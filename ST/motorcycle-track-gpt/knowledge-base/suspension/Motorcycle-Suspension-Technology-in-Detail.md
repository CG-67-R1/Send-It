One Thousand and One Problems —
A Million Solutions
othing is more heavily debated among motorbike enthusiasts than
suspension systems, tires, shocks and  the  right settings for them.
Whether touring, enduro riding, racing or  naked bike fan,  every
rider wants to  get the  best performance from his or  her  machine.
And this  doesn’t always mean speed or  lean angle. For  passionate
touring riders, comfort is the top  priority; enduro riders insist on
perfect off-road capability, and  motocross riders love fun  handling and
perfect tire  grip.
Thanks to  rapid technical development since the  beginning of the  80’s,
nowadays almost all  motorbikes can  be perfectly tuned to  meet their riders’
needs. However, only those who are  able to  perfectly fit together the widely
differing components will achieve this  goal.
That’s why this  book not  only addresses the  basic technologies of suspension
and  damping, rather it also illustrates all the other essential motorcycle
chassis components. This is the only way for serious riders to truly get to
know and understand the  interrelationships and functions of their machines.
In writing this  book, we  have reached deep down into  our  bag of tricks
based on  years of experience, and  we  will  share most of them with you.
Damper assemblies, forks, suspension systems and  tires will be dissected
and  described right down to the  last detail. Since theory by itself is boring,
we  have emphasized practicality by providing detailed DIY  tips and
instructions. We  hope the  mechanics and engineers among you riders will
forgive us  that  we  have dispensed with complicated formulas and  calcula-
tions. Instead, we  have focused on  explaining and  describing how to work
practically with modern suspension components and  their frequently sensiti-
ve  components. Our goal is to  introduce committed hobby mechanics,
motorbike mechanics and  all  interested riders to the  mechanical “secrets” of
function, perfect tuning and  efficient troubleshooting in complex motorcycle
suspension systems.
We  hope that you, the  reader, will  greatly benefit from this  book and  that the
knowledge and  experience we  have gained over thousands and  thousands of
test  kilometers will not  only help you, but will  also make the  motorcycle
experience much more enjoyable for you.

day. Massive aluminum profiles welded

parallel next to  each other, joined with
cross tubes and beautifully soldered —
this  is what the  ideal motorcycle frame loo-
ked  like  until the end of the  60’s. Craftsmen
in  British motorcycle workshops, in particu-
lar,  knew how to  create clean designs,
usually around English engines.

shocks between rear frame and swing arm
constituted a top suspension system.
The characteristics of those nickel-plated tube
designs were indeed superior to  the  Asian
mass-produced frames. The  latter were barely
able to  tame the  high-performance engines
well enough so  that a rider with only average
skills might fully enjoy the  engine’s output.
Still, the  Honda CB  750 produced a  cool 67
HP, and the  two-stroke monster from Kawa-
saki, with 750 cc  divided over its three cylin-
ders, even applied 75  horsepower to  its slim
18  inch rear wheel.
For  sport riders who could afford it, the clean
trellis frames from the fancy Italian shop of Bi-
mota were able to convert the  engine output
available into  fast  lap times. At the beginning
of the  70’s, this  fancy designer from the  Itali-
an  city of Rimini, who thrived on  experimen-
tation, also supplied sport touring machines
with artistic tube chassis. Dozens of frame de-
signers in Europe seized the moment to curve
and  weld cleverly thought-out tubular frames

around Japanese engines —  always with the
goal of holding the  front and rear wheels in
line  even at  high speeds.
change came about when the Japane-
se  began to  learn from the  successes
/ and failures of  their motorcycle de-
signs. The European market demanded ma-
chines that tracked and handled safely. Un-
like in  the  United States where speed limit
and  highway mentality determine the market,
European riders made much higher demands
on  their suspension systems. Smaller ma-
nufacturing tolerances, more rigid fra-
mes and better tuned suspension ele-
ments were just the  beginning of the
change. However, for  the  riders who
wanted to  go  fast, these changes
were not  enough.
Special accessories such as
steering dampers, fork sta-
bilizers and special swing
arms were just as  en  vogue
as  were the  legendary Met-
zeler sport tires from Munich.
Home-made — suspension
tuning came to  an  end as
more and more machines
with high quality and stable
suspension systems came
out  of Asia. That’s because
these machines, and with
them motorcycle design
itself, were increasingly
influenced by racing bike
technology.
Kawasaki came up  with the
first  central spring suspensi-
on  system, which they first
used successfully in motocross bikes and  later
transferred to  racing bikes. It was called the
“Uni Trak” and triggered a  wave of new de-
signs. Honda’s “Pro Link”, also tried and
trusted in  motocross bikes, began to  ensure
ride comfort in  the  motorcycle giant’s flag-
ship models. “Mono Cross” by Yamaha and
“Full Floater” by Suzuki were the  names of
other suspension systems whose designers

### were united by  one singular design goal:
Creating a  sensitive suspension system that
works using only one  single shock.
In fall  of 1984, Suzuki launched the  ultimate
Super Sport class bike —  the  GSX-R-750 —  at
With a groove 10  in front, and  a C5
block in the  rear, one’s steed would virtually
turn into  a different animal.
With its thin  frame and powerful engine, the Suzuki
GSX-R 750  R  garnered much attention as a daring
concept, but it also  had its problems.

the  IFMA. The 750 sport bike with
an  aluminum frame was an  abso-
lute sensation. Honda countered
by packing a  V4  750 engine into
an  aluminum chassis. This marked
the beginning of  anew motorcycle ©
generation.
With the exception of Yamaha’s GTS
1000 with its hub center steering, truly
innovative ideas were few and far  be-
tween in the  subsequent years. Of course,
frame dimensions evolved to  match engine
performance. 140 HP  and higher will force-
fully tear on  and torque the  material, and
wide 190-sized tires will create additional
loads and  torsional forces on  the  suspension
system. Consequently, designers packed in as
much as  they could: Components borrowed
from the  super bike sector now reinforce the
frames for sport tourers. Thick, upside-down
forks, mighty swing arms, monstrous alumi-
num frames made of extruded profiles -  they
used everything; only, it didn’t necessarily
look very good.
Il this  changed with Yamaha’s YZF R1
Avie chassis design, workmanship
and  sheer power represented a new di-
mension in  series production. It was a  mile-
stone that relegated the  popular lightweight
CBR 900 RR  to  second place.
The  scene really heated up  and  other manu-
facturers began to follow suit. Honda tested a
frame design in the VTR Twin and in the 2001
CBR 900 RR  which, more than previous mo-
dels, integrated the engine as a stressed mem-
ber. It transferred the  swing arm pivot to  the
engine housing without integrating it directly
into  the filigree aluminum chassis.
After the  not-so-successful TL  1000 Twin
series, Suzuki rolled up  its sleeves and broke
Kawasakis Uni  Track System, originally desi-
gned for motocross, found its way into road
bikes, too
the  300 km/h sound barrier. Here comes the
Hayabusa! And Kawasaki too  rolled again
with the  good old  times in  launching the
Z900 —  Frankenstein’s daughter. Then there
was the ZX-12R, and numerous others. Given
this lineup of sheer power, it is definitely a
good thing that the  consistent integration of
current racing technology is preventing mo-
torcycle riding from remaining an  unpredic-
table balancing act.
Generously dimensioned frame profiles di-
rectly linking steering head and swing arm
pivot point, bearings without clearance and
stiff wheel suspensions make rework on  cur-
rent motorcycle frames almost unnecessary.
What remains are  the  minor flaws and ge-
nerous tolerances of  mass-produced bikes
that stand in  the  way of perfect customized
suspension tuning. But never fear, the Wilbers
Team is here.

2.  Function and Design of
Modern Frames and

### Swing Arms
Motorcycle manufacturers have been inter-
preting the  need for a  light but  stiff main
frame and  responsive wheel suspensions in
very different ways.
hile engineers have spent years de-
veloping as  rigid a frame design as
possible, new roads have been
paved for the  beginning of the  new millenni-
um.  As before, high frame rigidity guarantees
razor-sharp steering precision in the front bet-
ween steering head and engine; in  the  rear,
however, computer-generated flexibility was
to  ensure less aggressive and hence, better
ride characteristics. Once again, it was in the
supersport bikes where this trend began to
take hold.
While Yamaha’s YZF-R1 met  these demands
through reduced material wall thicknesses,
Honda implemented a  system in  some of its
new models that transferred the required
stiffness or flexibility to the engine. The actual
main frame ended above the  rear swing arm

### bearing. :

### Just a trend, a fad? Only one  thing is for sure:
The top priority for the future is not maximum
frame stability, or  maximum engine perfor-
mance, and not  even maximum speed, but
rather, maximum rider control of  the mo-
torcycle. Above all, this  means a chassis that
clearly, transparently and  unmistakably com-
municates to the rider the machine’s physical
limits—-before it’s too  late. The preference in
frame design is rather secondary for this  pur-
pose. The essential factors are: Economy,
looks, a company’s philosophy.
Trellis frame
These designs made of tubular steel braced
by stiff  triangles were custom-made by Bi-
mota for sport bikes as  early as  at the  begin-
ning of the 70’s, and  made fashionable by the
successful Ducati 851 through 996 models.
The motorcycle of the  century, the  MV
Agusta F4,  also has a trellis frame with bol-
ted-on aluminum assemblies that couldn’t
look more beautiful and elegant. Only one
name is behind all  this: Massimo Tamburini,
founder of Bimota, creator of the  Ducati 916
and  the  MV Agusta F4.
The advantages: High rigidity and low
weight, minimal dimensions, good dissipa-
tion of engine heat thanks to  large open sur-
faces, good use  of space for housing electro-
nic  and secondary units.
The disadvantages: Costly production of the
many individual tube sections for accurate fit,
and  a  lot of welding work in areas often diffi-
cult to access.
Twin-spar frame
Manufactured mostly using aluminum pro-
files, two frame profiles (spars) run  from the
steering head to the swing arm pivot point. In
order to  keep production costs low, the stee-
ring head, the  swing arm pivot point and  the
engine mounts are  designed as  cast parts and
welded to the frame profiles. Profiles with ge-
nerous dimensions provide sufficient stabili-
ty,  usually with internal reinforcements. For
sufficient stability during braking, the  frame
spars must be joined by a cross brace behind
the steering head to prevent them from splay-
ing  under load. This cross brace can  be de-
signed as  a bolt-on to the engine or  as  a wel-
ded  tube. The Japanese pioneered this  frame
design, and they have been improving this
design for years, making it affordable for the
smaller displacement classes.

10
with its beautiful and lightweight YZF R1  model, Yamaha
represented a milestone for the new big bike generation.
Honda put its money on  new suspension technology and
supported the swing arm merely by the engine housing of its
CBR 900  RR model.

### Tin
Trellis frames made with triangular cross braces of short, stiff
steel tubing, using the engine as  a stressed member are  light-
weight, stiff, attractive and, in the case of Ducati, also very
successful in racing.

### The advantages:
Cost-effective production
using simple cast and profile
parts. Few and  easily accessi-
ble  weld joints. High stability
with generous dimensioning.
Appealing looks.

### The  disadvantages:
Poor engine heat dissipation
due to the large-surface closed
profiles, large dimensions, la-
teral profile parts susceptible
to  damage from falls, tension-
sensitive cast parts, requiring
engine and swing arm mounts
with adjustable end clearance
(threaded spindles or  clamps).
Duplex cradle frame
The classic motorbike design
made of  steel tubes running
from the steering head past the
engine to  the  swing arm bea-
ring. This keeps the  engine in
the  focal point and the  center
of the  machine, which is why
designers have eagerly helped
themselves to  this  frame con-
cept for the  neo-classics.
However, for  sport bikes, its
big disadvantage is that the top
rails restrict the downdraft car-
buretor —  mounted face up -  of
modern high performance
engines.

### The  advantages:
Classic looks, good engine
heat dissipation thanks to
completely open
engine, low  width.

### The  disadvantages:
High weight, relatively low
stability.

Monocoque design
A  design that had long sunk
into oblivion, only to  be  revi-
ved  with the  launch of Kawa-
saki’s flagship model, the  ZX
12R. In  this design, tank and
air  filter casing are  integrated
as  large volume components
into  the  frame made of alumi-
num sheets.

### The  advantages:
Narrow width, relatively low
weight, good rigidity.

### The  disadvantages:
Cylinder head and carbure-
tor/fuel-injection are  not  very
maintenance-friendly. Insuffi-
cient control of engine vibra-
tions (resonance behavior),
expensive to  produce.
Double-sided swing arm
The symmetrically arranged
arms of this  design have pro-
ved themselves as  probably
the best solution for rear  wheel
control. Consisting either of
simple tubular steel or  alumi-
num profiles, with stabilizing
members mounted on  top  for
sport bikes, the  double-sided
swing arm  has prevailed. Used
in  conjunction with largedi-
mension axles and_ sturdy
drop-outs, this design achie-
ves  enormously high torsional
and bending stiffnesses.
Diamond frames welded from profiled aluminium sheets and
cast parts are  not  only inherently stable, but also relatively easy
to manufacture. Here, too, the engine acts as  a stressed member
betrween steering head and swing arm  bearing.
Classic duplex-cradle frames made of steel tubes are  relatively
heavy and, due  to their top rails, not  well suited for high-perfor-
mance engines with downdraft carburetors.
Monocoque frame design can  already be found on  true Classics
Kawasaki rediscovered the concept for its ZX  12-R power bike
and modernized it by using light aluminium sheets and
thin-walled cast parts.
11

12
Single-sided swing arm
Honda introduced this  massive design to the
modern motorcycle world in  1988 in  its  RC
30  super bike replica. The design was then
adopted by Ducati for its 916  model, but it no
longer represents the state of the  art.
Relatively heavy, requiring very large wheel
bearing diameters which in turn caused high
frictional resistance, Honda quickly reverted
back to  the  tried-and-trusted double-sided
swing arm  for its racing bikes. In contrast, the
Italians preferred the asymmetrical design on
the  Ducati and  the  MV  Agusta F4  750.
Suspension systems
With few exceptions, central spring suspen-
sion systems have replaced the conventional
twin shock system on  the  swing arm end in
all  types of modern motorcycles. In  central-
suspension systems, the  single suspension
shock [mono-shock] located between the
swing arm axle and the  rear wheel is actua-
ted  by a  linkage mechanism, whose purpose
is to  reduce the  forces exerted on  the  shock
by a variable ratio.
If the  shock absorber were mounted directly
on  the  swing arm between the  tires and the
swing arm bearing, it would have to  resist
enormously high forces due to the  long swing
arm link (at a ratio of approx. 3:1). Only a very
hard spring (up  to  250 kg/cm) and very stiff
damping can handle these forces; however,
when it comes to  tuning and weight (due to
the massive spring), this can result in  other
problems.
With the  linkage mechanism, the  force will

### decrease to approx. 2:1.  With 120  millimeters
of suspension travel at  the  wheel, 60  milli-
meters of lift  can be  achieved on  the  shock,
thus allowing you  to install a correspondingly
soft  spring.

### Another advantage of the linkage mechanism:
It can  actuate the shock progressively by pur-
posely changing the  ratio with increasing
compression travel. This protects well against
bottoming out without affecting response
over small bumps. Enduro bikes and mo-
tocross machines, in  particular, utilize this
feature. In  contrast, for  road bikes, progres-
sive response of suspension systems has been
reduced considerably in the last few years. In-
stead, effective damper designs and  practical
adjustment features were introduced which
allow bikes to  be adapted to various loads.
Sensitive problem areas that sometimes lead
to  Unpredictable ride characteristics in  mo-
dern. motorcycles are primarily the pivot
points in the steering head, swing arm  and  lin-
kage in the rear  wheel suspension. In contrast
to the early 70’s during which mass-produced
suspension systems could still be  improved
using fork stabilizers, stiff box swing arms and
weld-in braces, nowadays the  main frames
and  swing arm designs remain mostly untou-
ched. Currently, true improvements are  being
made above all  in the  fine-tuning of suspen-
sion / damping and  tires.
Steering head bearing
The steering head bearings in  particular can
Cause serious suspension problems because
the  rotating mount of the  fork in  the  main
frame is subject to  very high bending forces
e.g., when braking, and because even minor
bearing play can prevent the  wheels from
tracking correctly.
Two types of bearings are  generally used in
the  steering head. Tapered roller bearings
with cylindrical rollers and conically honed
inner and  outer rings, and  magneto ball  bea-
rings which are  being used more and  more in
modern machines. Because of their shape, the
latter respond better to  out-of-round bearing

seats, have smaller diameters and conse-
quently, in aluminum frames, allow for grea-
ter  thickness of the  steering head wall with-
out  increasing outside diameter.
Self-aligning bearings, roller bearings with
barrel-shaped rollers are  usually used only in
supersport bikes in  which the  steering head
angle can  be adjusted using rotating or  inter-
changeable inserts.
Mounting areas can  be problematic.

PRACTICAL TIP
The bearing play in the  steering head should
be adjusted to be as  small as  possible without
noticeably increasing the  starting force, i.e.,
the frictional resistance at the  beginning of a
steering movement. Too  much play can  cause
head shaking, heavy engine vibrations in the
handlebar ends or weaving tendencies in fast
tight curves.
In contrast, bearing rings that are  adjusted too
tight will  affect steering precision in slow cur-
ves  because the  desired running line  will re-
quire constant corrections. Tracking stability
on  straight-aways or  in curves may also be im-
paired. In  addition, if there is too  much pre-
tension, the  rollers will grind into  the  machi-
ned surfaces of  the  bearing bushings after
only a short run-time —  making the bearing fit
for the scrap heap in no  time.

Steering head

Thanks to the  cross-sections adjusted to  the  flow
of force, stiff, massive aluminum profiles are
well suited for all loads and operational
purposes.
One problem with some machine models,
particularly ones made of aluminum frames,
is the  often out-of-round bearing seat on  the
steering head. Tapered roller bearings with
thin outer rings especially will  then be defor-
med to an  oval shape, after which the bearing
can no  longer support loads evenly, nor  can
it be adjusted any  more. The last resort is then
to  machine the  bearing seat extensively or  to
use  customized bearing bushings that  are  not
pressed in, but  rather slightly undersized and
glued into  the  seat.
Imprecisions, or  too much play, will also
cause constant slight clacking when riding
over bumps or  when braking. This is caused
by the  steering tube, whose diameter is too
thin, striking the  inner ring of the top bearing.
The solution is  to  insert the inner bearing
using bearing glue prior to  assembly and to
adjust the  play. Perfect and long-lasting tech-
nical solutions are  those that use  a complete-
ly  new adjustment nut that also simulta-
neously functions as  the  bearing seat. If this
adjustment nut  is locked, the  bearing will sit
absolutely tightly on  the steering shaft with no
play.
As‘an asymmetrical component with a large
cross-section, the single swing arm was  intro-
duced into  modern motorcycles by Honda in its
RC 30 model. Once launched, this design was
quickly copied by competitors.
When assembling new-
steering head bearings or
after cleaning, not  only the bearings, but also
the  sealing rings must be thoroughly lubrica-
ted. If these run  dry, the  relatively large
diameter of the  sealing lips  will create high
frictional resistance that has  the  same nega-
tive  effect as  a  bearing that is assembled too
tightly.
Swing arm pivot
While swing arm tracking was a  weakness
particularly in  Japanese suspensions caused
by the  use  of  brass or  even plastic bearing
shells, nowadays, only excessive tolerances
tend to  cause suspension problems.
Normally, needle bushings rotating on  har-
dened bearing rings are pressed into the
swing arm tube. They are  connected by a di-
stance bushing and  bolted to the frame using
a  half axle. Water and dust-resistant caps en-
sure smooth, trouble-free and long-lasting
operation.
HD  grooved ball  bearings that  simultaneous-
ly perform axial control are  also sometimes
used.

Especially when accelerating or  riding at high
speeds, when the  chain pulls the  swing arm
on  the drive side forward with great force, ex-
cessive radial play —  vertical play at a  90  de-
gree angle to  the  axle -  will become notice-
able. The bike will not  track well, respond
nervously to load changes and  may start wea-
ving. In these cases, too, bearings with abso-
lutely no  clearance are  the  best solution. If
there is wear or  a thorough suspension tuning
is performed, slightly oversized special exact-
fit  bearings can be  installed to  ensure solid
swing arm control.
For disassembly and _ as-
2a the  bearing seat should be heated to
approx. 60°  C for easy removal and installa-
tion of the  bearing without damaging or  ex-
panding the  bearing seat.
Linkage pivot
In order to  resist the  enormously high forces
exerted upon the  linkage for long periods, all
pivot points in the  suspension system should
be equipped with needle roller bearings. This
will also ensure low-friction and responsive
transmission of forces in the suspension.
Due to the lever ratio of approx. 2:1  —  the sus-
pension travel on  the  wheel is then twice as
large as  the  one on  the  shock —  potential ra-
dial play on  the  linkage is also increased by
a  factor of two. Usually, this  play is the  sum
of the three or  more pivot points, which with
some new bikes will  add up to two millime-
ters  of vertical play on  the  rear wheel. This
play is insignificant as  long as  the  shock ab-
sorber presses the  wheel onto the  road sur-
face so that all the pivot points are  under load.
Problems begin when the  wheel lifts up,
when the  pivot points are  unloaded and  the
unsprung masses, i.e., wheels, brakes, and
brake disks, are  completely undamped due to
the  bearing play. Even if the  wheel moves
only a  few millimeters up  and  down uncon-
trollably, this  can  still  trigger high frequency
chattering or  stuttering. For  example, during
hard braking when just the engine’s restoring
moment can  trigger brake stutter, play in the
linkage can  intensify this  undesirable
reaction.
Central suspension systems with clever linkages
replaced conventional “stereo” suspension
shocks. The option of using the suspension
shock with progressive suspension/damping
effects was  particularly well received by
motocross riders.

PRACTICAE TIP
Once such play exists in  the  highly loaded
pivot points, it can  spread very quickly. This
will then make a  complete overhaul of the
pivot points unavoidable.
Wheel bearings
Ball bearings, which are  grooved or  even
equipped with retaining rings, rank among
the  more inconspicuous motorcycle compo-
nents. If the  bearing is not  exposed to  water
(power washers) or overload (excessive chain
tension), the roller bearings will  normally run
for more than 50,000 kilometers without any
trouble.
PRACTICAL TIP
The following applies in this case, too:  When
assembling, always heat up the  bearing seat;
i.e., the hub, and press the bearing in and out
without jamming it.

### 3. Function of Hydraulic

### Shock Absorbers
Generally, all vehicle suspension systems also
require a  damper assembly. Damping is  re-
quired because during compression strokes,
the spring stores energy which moves the ve-
hicle beyond its  original position during re-
bound. This results in  up  and down move-
ments of the  sprung masses (frame, engine,
rider, tank and all  add-on parts) that take a
long time to  attenuate. In  difficult riding si-
tuations, such movements may even in-
crease, building up  in the vehicle to the point
where you might lose control.
Short jolts that  make the wheel compress the
springs and rebound quickly, can excite the
unsprung masses (wheel, tires, brake system,
and  parts of the wheel suspension) into  an  os-
cillation frequency. If this is  not  effectively
damped, it will cause the  wheel to  bounce
over the  road and  the tires to  lose traction. In
addition, while the tire  itself does generate a
certain inherent damping as  part of  its  sus-
pension features, due to the  inner friction be-
tween the rubber and the tire casing plies, this
will  not be enough to dampen the spring force
of the  tire  pressure. That is why all  sprung
tires require hydraulic damping in  order to
prevent resonant oscillation in the wheel sus-
pension.
The damper assembly’s main task is to  cap-
ture excess energy from the  suspension
movement. In  doing so,  it converts kinetic
energy into heat, which heats the  hydraulic
oil,  ise., the  shock absorbers and fork.
This kind of damping can  be accomplished in
different ways. In the  early days of motorcy-
cle engineering, friction dampers were instal-
led. Like in a clutch, friction disks which were
made of mostly organic fiber material rotated
on  steel disks. While this would brake the sus-
pension movement, its high starting force and
hard-to-control damping characteristics,
however, led  to this  technology being
replaced with hydraulic systems.
And it is this basic principle of hydraulic dam-
ping that has  proven itself to  be the  best so-
lution to this day. Nowadays, hardly anything
is left of those simple designs from the  early
pioneer days.
Telescopic fork damping systems
A distinction is made between open twin-tube
systems and sealed damper units, or  cartrid-
ge systems. In open dampers that  are  usually
only used in  low-cost mid-size machines
today, damping is  controlled by  a  piston

Path of the sprung masses
Path of the  unsprung masses
equipped with ports and a  sealing ring. This
piston is mounted to the  sliding pipe and
slides up  and down on  the inside of  the
stanchion.
During suspension strokes, the  oil  is pressed
through the ports, providing the necessary hy-
draulic resistance. A spring-loaded two-way
valve seals off some of the  ports on  reboun-
ding and thus ensures that  rebound damping,
which counters the  spring force and brakes
the  rebound speed, is stronger than compres-
sion damping, which supports the  suspen-
sion effect and prevents compression strokes
trom moving too  fast.
The disadvantages of this  simple system: Be-
cause compression and rebound strokes are
regulated by the  ports only, precise damping
control is  impossible with small suspension
strokes. They will result in  unsteady wheel

control on  bumpy and wavy roads. In  addi-
tion, these simple systems react very strongly
to  temperature fluctuations. In  colder wea-
ther, they cause excessive and sluggish dam-
ping; at  high temperatures, they are  too  soft
and uncontrolled, with a  lot  of  movement.
Changing to a higher viscosity fork oil during
the  summer will usually improve their dam-
ping characteristics. These simple systems are
not  adjustable. The only way to  make chan-
ges  is to  modify the  damper piston or  to  use
oil  with a different viscosity.
The logical step for  eliminating these disad-
vantages was the  introduction and spread of
the  cartridge system. This system houses a
cartridge in each fork leg, in which a damper
piston, the  so-called “moving piston” with
plate valves slides up  and  down. This piston
has  only the  tiniest of constantly open ports
(free bleeds) through which the  damper oil

masses do not  fully ride  through the

can flow during low-speed rebound move-
ments. This ensures that the fork  will  respond
very sensitively to  even the  smallest move-
ments. If the  rebound movement increases in
speed, after a deep dip in the  road for exam-
ple, the oil  is pressed through the piston ports
covered by shims.
When the fork dips, a spring-loaded two-way
valve will open at the top  of the  "moving pi-
ston,” letting the  oil  flow through the  piston
without much resistance. This will refill the
cylinder volume behind the  piston with oil.
In  most cartridge systems, the  hydraulic resi-
stance during compression (compression
damping) is controlled by an  additional plate
valve at the  lower end of the damper cartrid-
ge,  the  so-called “vertical piston." There, the
volume of the  piston rod  sliding into the  cy-
linder presses the oil  from the cylinder
through the  vertical piston, allowing precise
control of compression damping during com-
pression. Located in the  middle of the  piston
valve is a  port whose circular cross-section is
variably constricted by a  needle valve, repre-
senting the  compression adjustment mecha-
nism.
Its  adjustment screw is  located at  the  lower
end  of the sliding pipe. Its counterpart, the re-
bound adjustment mechanism, is usually lo-
cated on  the  top  fork cap. It also controls a
needle valve that uses a plunger rod  to adjust
the  free circular cross-section in the  moving
damper piston.
The design described above is identical in the
telescopic forks used on  almost all  mass-pro-
duced bikes. Despite huge advances in mass-
production, current cartridge systems still
have a  few kinks to  work out. For  example,
combining the  hydraulic oil  and the  air  cus-
hion causes the  oil  to  foam, creating an  in-
consistent damping force. Therefore, the  lo-
gical step is to  use  a  fork with a  divider that

4.  Function and Tuning
Options of Telescopic Fork

### Hydraulic Damping
The  following three measures influence
how high the  respective damping level and

### its characteristics will  be:

### 1. The  rebound damping adjustment screw:
This screw increases (low damping) or
decreases (high damping) the  circular gap  of
the  needle valve in the  “moving piston.” The
second needle valve with the  same function
is located on  the  “vertical piston” in the  bot-
tom of  the  damper cylinder; it  influences
compression damping. Both valves can  con-
trol  the  low speed range, i.e., damping ac-
tivity during slow suspension movements, by
means of a  variable opening of the  circular
gaps. During rapid suspension movements
and higher oil  throughput, this  cross section
will be too  small for the displaced oil quanti-
ty.  The oil  pressure will then press the  plate
valves out of  their seats, and oil  will flow
through the  now open ports on  the  damper
pistons.

### 2.  The shims on  the  piston and on  the  base
valve can  be replaced after disassembling the

fork and opening the  threaded connection.
By replacing the  shims, the  hydraulic
resistance (thicker shims =  higher damping
force, and vice versa) can be influenced. But
not  only the thickness of the  individual shims
determines the damping activity, but also the
way the  shims are  “stacked.” This combina-
tion  will  result in the  so-called damping
characteristics.

### Here is an  example:
If you want to  maintain sensitive response
characteristics and increase damping only in
the  high-speed range, i.e., for rapid, hard
suspension strokes, the  first shim above the
piston is retained. An  adapter is then placed
on  top  of it which will allow the  "soft” shim
to open quickly and without much resistance,
and  thus provide the  highest level of comfort
in the  low-speed range.
The damper shims above it, however, will be
increased in  diameter and thickness, which
will result in  increased flow resistance,
leading to  strong damping in the  high-speed
range. This is because a  substantially greater
volume of oil will then be pressed through the
ports and plate valves, which the  hard shims
are  better able to  resist.
This simple example illustrates that perfect
tuning requires many test  kilometers and a lot
of experimenting. Qualified suspension tech-
nicians can customize damping force and
characteristics by using a well-thought-out
arrangement of  stacked shims. However,
there are  only few specialists who are  cap-
able of performing this  task competently.
Therefore, only experienced suspension me-
chanics should be entrusted with this  kind of
work.
20

### 3. The viscosity of the fork oil is another way
of changing damping behavior. A low-visco-
sity oil (SAE W 5 or  7.5) will  reduce damping.
A high-viscosity oil  (SAE W  15  or  W  20)  will
increase damping. When a different fork oil
is used, rebound and compression damping
will obviously change accordingly. The oil
capacity will only influence the  progressive
increase in the spring suspension, but not the
damping. _
Each telescopic fork contains a hydraulic end
stop to  protect the  fork from hitting metal
components when bottoming out. Usually a
turned conical part, this  additional compres-
sion‘damping mechanism brakes so  strongly
on  the  last  15  to  20  mm of suspension travel
that it virtually prevents the  sliding pipe and
the  stanchion from bottoming out  so  that the
metals make contact. However, this  suspen-
sion range can  only be used within limits
because it blocks so  abruptly that no  spring
action will remain. If suspension and
damping are  well-tuned, this range will  not be
reached at  all  or  only for  a  brief moment
under extreme load. If the  fork rebounds all
the way to the  stop, a worm spring -  called a
top-end spring in  shop jargon —  will gently
slow this movement down preventing hard
metal-on-metal impacts.

### 5.  Basic Function of the

### Various Shock Types
Suspension shock absorbers and  telescopic
forks function similarly. The  damper piston
slides through an  oil  bath which, however,
in the case of the "de Carbon system,” is
pressurized by a gas  cushion. This gas
cushion serves to prevent the oil from fo-
aming
and
mixing
with
air,
thus
losing
vis-
cosity; i.e., damping force.

When it comes to  shocks, there are  three dif-

### ferent types of designs:

### 1. The twin tube damper, which is only being
installed in few motorcycles nowadays. Fun-
ctionally, it resembles the  simple telescopic
fork design. Here, the  actual shock absorber
is encased by a tube that functions as  an  ex-
pansion tank. It works without an  additional
gas cushion, but, like the  telescopic fork, it
can  only be mounted vertically (with the  cy-
linder at the  bottom). If it is installed upside
down, the  system will draw in air,  canceling
hydraulic dampening

### 2. The  gas-pressure damper with open,
so-called “emulsion damping” is used most-
ly in simple, inexpensive suspension systems.
In these dampers, the  nitrogen gas  cushion is
pressed through a valve or  filling plug with-
out  dividing piston into a  reservoir above the
hydraulic system. This type of  suspension
shock may only be installed with the damper
housing up  because otherwise the  gas  will
penetrate into  the oil chamber, rendering the
hydraulic damping ineffective. Even if pro-
perly mounted, the  gas  cushion with a  pres-
sure of approx. 15  bar  can mix with the  oil
during operation. This creates an  emulsion,
which, under extreme conditions, can lead to
a decreased damping effect.

### 3. The gas pressurized damper witha divided
system functions with much greater stability
and reliability. It can be  identified by its  ex-
pansion reservoir; only rarely does the  divi-
ding piston for  oil  and gas  sit directly inside
the  shock cylinder. The expansion tank is
mostly cast as  one piece or  bolted to  the
shock absorber. A  high-pressure-resistant
hose line  connected to the shock absorber is
another connection solution. Its advantage is
that the  remote reservoir can be  mounted
wherever there is room.
The advantages of divided systems are  that
the  oil  and the  nitrogen cushion are  separa-
ted  from one another by a  piston with a sea-
ling ring or  by a  rubber boot. This allows the
oil  to  guarantee constant, reliable damping
even under the  most brutally extreme me-
chanical loads, at  high temperatures and  ex-
tremely rapid suspension strokes witha rapid 7
succession of alternating movements.
Because the  volume of the  piston rod  sliding
into the  cylinder will press the  oil  out  of the
cylinder into the  expansion tank, it can be
very effectively controlled there. During this
process, a  needle will close or  open the  cir-
cular cross section of the  opening through
which the oil  is pushed out  of the  cylinder.

### 6. Mechanical Design
of a  Shock Absorber
A modern suspension shock (“mono-shock”)
for a central spring suspension consists of
approximately 100  components. This  chap-
ter describes the  most important compo-
nents and  their functions. In order to grasp
the complex interrelationships of a
motorcycle suspension system, particularly
damping and  suspension, it is necessary to
understand the functioning of the  individual
components introduced in this  chapter. This
will  make it much easier to do tune-ups and
to troubleshoot.

### 1. The cylinder: It is a tubular steel pipe
finely machined on  the  inside and  bolted
to the damper head and  the end  cap. With
inexpensive components, it may also be
welded or  caulked. Light cylinders made
of aluminum are  also used in a few  products.
However, their biggest disadvantage is that
they expand a  lot  when temperatures rise.
This can reduce seal tightness at  the  piston
ring, and  consequently, their damping
function.

### 2.  The  piston: It is usually manufactured of
steel, coated aluminum, or sintered metal and
equipped with a  piston ring for  sealing pur-
poses. The piston glides up  and  down inside
the  cylinder. The ports which the  oil  flows
through are  arranged or  machined in such a
way that  the valve shims only seal in one  di-
rection.

### 3. The piston rod:  It is bolted to the piston and
transmits the  spring movements of the  swing
arm, which is why it must be made of a
high-strength steel. To  reduce friction and  to
ensure a  long service life, it is coated with
hard chrome or,  on  high tech components, it
may even be  coated with low-friction chro-
mium nitrite.
Since the  rebound damping adjustment me-
chanism is housed inside the  piston, the  pi-
ston rod  must be  hollow. Welcome side ef-
fects of a  sound design: The larger the  dia-
meter, the greater the displacement of the oil
volume during compression, making for  bet-
ter  control of compression damping. The
disadvantages: Mechanical friction will in-
crease with the  sealing ring and pivot point
diameter sizes.
4a. The stop: It serves the same purpose as the
hydraulic stop in the telescopic fork though it
is located on  the shock absorber in the shape
of an  elastic synthetic ring between the  bot-
tom spring plate and the  end cap. Designed
as  a  tapered ring or  with slits, this auxiliary
spring is highly progressive at the end stop.
In  contrast to  the  hydraulic stop, under high
or extraordinary loads, this synthetic stop can
be counted, by up to about one  third, towards
the usable suspension travel. A small cable tie
wrapped around the  piston rod  has  proven a
reliable marker during test rides, showing

### 5. The valve shims: Bolted to the  piston, they
cover the  ports in  the  damper piston. The
shim with the  largest diameter rests directly
on  the  piston, the  rest  of the  shim package is
arranged on  top of it. This package consists of
numerous shims varying in  size and thick-
ness, and the  spacers. The damping charac-
teristics, which will differ according to  use,
will  result from how the shims and spacers are
arranged.
Important for  reliable damping is  the  seal
tightness of  the  first shim on  the  piston in
order to prevent the oil from flowing through
uncontrollably. The radial piston in the
Wilbers shock absorber provides an  almost
perfect solution to  this problem because its
sealing surface is not  machined flat. Instead,
it is shaped as  a  small 0.05 mm deep depres-
sion which will press the first  shim on  the
piston into its seat with light preload.
This will  ensure that the shim will  seal  the pi-
ston optimally, which will also result in  ab-
solutely controlled damping, even for  the
slightest of suspension movements.

ted  on  the  dam-
per head. This
component is
bolted to the
damper rod and
has  a  seal for  the
internal — plunger
rod which adjusts
the  needle valve on  the
piston.
6a. The damper base: The cast or mill-cut part
of the  shock is called the  "damper base." On
high quality shocks, this  is where the connec-
tion from the  damper cylinder to  the  expan-
sion reservoir and the  compression adjust-
ment mechanism are  attached. In most cases,
a  pressed-in ball and socket head serves to
mount this  component to the frame.

### 7. The compression reservoir: For holding the
oil displaced from the cylinder and  to ensure
as  consistent a damping force as  possible, an
expansion reservoir is mounted. It is located
either directly on  the  damper base or  it is
connected to  it  by  high-pressure-resistant
hoses. At  its  inlet, the  oil  flows through the
compression adjustment mechanism. A spe-
cial, practice-oriented feature on  the Wilbers
racing suspension shock absorber is that it
can  be separately adjusted for the  low  speed
and high-speed compression damping ran-
ges.

### 8.  The end cover: It contains the  piston rod
guide bushings and  sealing ring. You can
distinguish between a dry and wet bushing by
its  position. A wet bushing is  located inside
the  oil  bath, with the  radial shaft seal direct-
ly on  the cap  outlet. Its advantage is that it
Radial piston
permanently lubricates the  friction-bearing
bushing to  minimize wear and  starting force.
A dry  bushing is  located behind the  radial
shaft seal and has, besides many disadvanta-
ges, only one advantage: The distance from
the piston to the bushing, i.e., the overlap, can
be increased.

### 9.  The mounting lugs: The ones used the
most are high-strength, sealed ball-and-
socket joints with zero clearance. Sometimes
you will also find rubber mounts or  needle
roller bearings. It  is  important to  minimize
friction in order to avoid lateral forces on  the
piston rod  and  the  piston.
Too  much clearance can, in some riding con-
ditions, lead to problems with rear wheel con-
trol. Too much friction caused by tight mounts
will worsen the  response characteristics and
promote wear on  the  piston rod  and mount
due  to the  resulting lateral forces.

### 10.  Spring preload adjustment:
You can preload the  suspension spring (11)
using a screw thread with grooved nuts, a
latching mechanism or  hydraulic actuation.

7.  Damping Levels and

### Damping Speed
Rebound damping: Counteracts the  suspen-
sion force; i.e.,  it dampens the rebound speed
and is consequently a  relatively easily calcu-
lated variable because this  movement is es-
sentially defined by  two factors: First, the
spring force, and secondly, the  vehicle mass
that has  to  be  moved during rebound.
26
Rebound damping, which is effective almost
exclusively in  the  low-speed and in  the  ini-
tial  high-speed ranges, must be  selected in
such a  way that the  vehicle can return as
quickly as  possible to its original position after
a suspension movement, and without oscilla-
ting. If the damping setting is too stiff, the ma-
chine will rebound too  slowly and  will, over
several consecutive bumps, bounce far  into
the  positive suspension travel necessary for
shock absorption. The result is that successi-
ve  jolts can no  longer be  cushioned sensiti-
vely enough, and  comfort, ground clearance
and ride stability will become increasingly
worse.
If rebound damping is adjusted too  low, the
motorcycle will  tend to  oscillate over bumps
causing constant instability in the vehicle.
Compression damping: Compression dam-
ping supports the  springs; i.e., it decelerates
the  compression strokes. The compression
damping force amounts to only about 30% of
the  rebound damping force (see diagram on
the  next page). In  contrast to  the  suspension
spring, compression damping is  speed-pro-
portional. This means that the faster the
machine compresses, the greater the  hydrau-
lic resistance. The compression damping
mechanism also transfers a certain amount of
the road bumps to the suspension system. The
rider needs this  feedback as  contact with the
road surface in order to  be  able to  visualize
the  road surface and  the tire  grip limit.
In addition, tight compression damping
produces better tire grip when braking, acce-
lerating, or  riding curves. An  additional
advantage is that the  machine will not  sag  as
much when braking and in curves, and
ground clearance and brake stability will
improve. However, the other side of the coin
is that suspension comfort will  be limited, and
jolts will be transferred directly into the

chassis, increasing the tendency towards
headshaking on  bumpy surfaces.

### High- and  low-speed compression damping:
These terms refer to  the  speed at  which the
wheels move up and  down relative to the ve-
hicle body. They have absolutely nothing to
do  with riding speed. The low-speed range
covers compression speeds, measured at the
rear axle, up  to  approx. 0.6 meters per se-
cond (m/s). At that point, damping enters the
high-speed range, which can  be a  maximum
of 1.0  m/s on  road bikes. Only for motocross
bikes with extremely long suspension travel
does this  value increase to  up to  3.0  m/s.

justment mechanism (red adjustment button)
should also be turned back click for  click. If

bumps in  this  setting or  reacts too  spongily,
simply turn the  high-speed adjustment
mechanism back in the  “hard” direction.
¢  For  loaded riding or  with a  passenger, turn
both adjustment buttons click for click in the
“hard” direction. If this  setting is too  uncom-
fortable, just decrease the low speed damping
adjustment mechanism somewhat and
increase the  high-speed setting a  bit.  It will
prevent bottoming out  with high loads with-
out  detracting from the  sensitive response
characteristics.
¢  By  closing both the  high and low speed
damping adjustments by  equal amounts,
sport riders can  also adapt their road bikes for
use  at  the  racetrack. Comfort will decrease
while feedback, tire grip and stability im-
prove. On  racetracks with very bumpy, une-
ven  surfaces, the  low-speed range can  be ad-
justed to  a  softer setting in  order to  absorb
short hard jolts. At the same time, clicking the
high-speed damping mechanism a few more
times will prevent too much compression
when riding over deep bumps or when chan-
ging from one  extreme banked position to the
other in chicanes.
The difference between low and high-speed
damping should not  amount to  more than 5
clicks.
At  the  fork, where the  spring stroke corre-
sponds exactly to the suspension travel on  the
wheel axle, low-speed also ranges up  to  ap-
prox. 0.6  m/s.
uv aitis The effect of the  low-speed
range all set  in,  for  example, during slow
suspension strokes that trigger only minimal
suspension movements —  for example on  bad
paved roads, where they will become noti-
ceable as  vibrations in  the  handlebars. The
damper pistons do  not  go  into high-speed
range until the  entire suspension travel is
used, for  example due to  rapid suspension
strokes that occur when riding over big
bumps. For example, a racer will  use the high-
speed suspension range for only 20% of a lap
around the  racetrack.
But even in the case of rapid suspension stro-
kes on  the damper piston, damping force will
be noticeable in the  low-speed range becau-
se  suspension strokes always begin when ac-
celerating from zero, and stop on  reaching a
standstill. Thus, the low-speed range is always
involved. This means that the variably strong
damper rate in the  low-speed range will also
influence high-speed behavior.
TICAL TIP  ir  practice, these speed
ranges can  be figured out  according to  the

### following pattern:

### High-speed rebound damping:
Press the  rear  of the motorbike down into  the
suspension with all  your strength and at  the
deepest point, let it pop back up.  In doing so,
observe the  rebound speed until it comes to
a  standstill. You will notice that the  rebound
speed will  decrease toward the end.
The reason: In  relation to  the  rebound dam-
ping force, the  spring force is now consider-
ably weaker than at the  maximum compres-
sion inversion point.

### Low-speed rebound damping:
Now, press the  machine down very gently
about one  centimeter and  then let it rebound.
The rear will return to  its starting position vi-
sibly slower, even very sluggishly with some
shock absorbers.

8. Spring Design and

### Function
The spring, also known as  the  suspension
spring in technical jargon, is,  in  principle, a
simple, yet highly stressed component. Spring

### hardness consists of the following parameters:
e  Spring wire diameter
¢  Diameter of the winding
e  Length of the  spring when stretched out
e¢  Number of windings across the entire
unwound length

### Maximum
spring force

### The following generally applies:
¢  The thicker the  spring wire, the greater the
spring rate for  otherwise identical designs,
and  vice versa.
¢  The longer the spring, the smaller the spring
rate  for otherwise identical designs, and  vice
versa.
Contrary to popular belief, spring force is not
related to the quality of the spring steel. Spring
steel always has the same "hardness.” In spite
of this, there are  differences in the  quality of
spring steel. A block-resistant spring, for
example, can be  pressed right down to  the

winding stop without the free length being af-
fected or  without the  spring steel breaking.
Non block-resistant spring designs lose their
original free length when heavily deformed.
This “seating” of the  coil spring must be  ba-
lanced by correcting the  preload in  order to
re-establish the  desired ratio between posi-
tive and negative suspension travel. In  order
to  achieve high strength, the  surfaces of high
quality spring steels are  shot-peened to  com-
press the  material.
For  laypersons, a  coil spring’s characteristics
are, if at all, obvious only from the spring rate
stamped on  it. For  linear coil  springs, this  rate
results from its spring force per centimeter. An
example: In the case of a fork spring, 7.5  cor-
responds to  a  hardness of 7.5  kilograms per
spring travel centimeter. If this spring is pre-
loaded with 20  mm (7.5 x  2.0  cm), a  preload
of 15  kg per  fork leg will result.
The spring rate is calculated and  specified in
kilograms per  centimeter (kg/cm) or  in
Newtons per  millimeter (N/mm).
Two numbers are  usually printed on  the  sus-
pension shock coil springs. For example,
150/90 means a free spring length of 150  mil-
limeters at  a  spring rate of 90  kg per  centi-
meter.
Me the hardness of  a  coil
spring cannot be  changed by  increasing or
decreasing its  preload. The preload only de-
termines the machine’s sag, meaning the pro-
portion of negative to positive suspension tra-
vel. The only thing that  is achieved with a lar-
ger  preload (less negative, more positive sus-
pension travel) is  greater protection against
the  spring bottoming out  because the  spring
has  to  be  compressed by the  additional pre-
load setting once the  maximum damper stro-
ke  has been achieved. Important to  note is
that the  spring preload does influence ride

height, and consequently, will indirectly
change steering and  frame geometry.
PRACTICAL TIP Bm spring is clearly too  soft
or  hard, replacing the springs is the only way
to  really make an  improvement. However,
this  is only possible if the  hydraulic rebound
damping reserves can  be adjusted to the
increased spring force.
Progressive coil  springs are  very often
installed in telescopic forks. These are  springs
whose coils are  wound with varying pitches,
creating a two-stage progression.

### This is how it works:
The soft spring range consists of  a  tightly
wound and a more loosely wound spring coil.
When the spring is compressed by a load, the
tightly wound coils will block. This is called
the "block value”, which usually sets  in at ap-
prox. 70 to  85% of total suspension travel.
Starting at  this range, the  rest  of the  spring
coils will  spring into  action. These coils have
a greater spring rate  due  to the  shorter spring
To the left is a linear spring with equal pitch
between the coils. To the right is a progressive
spring whose spring coils have pitches varying
in size. At the beginning of the spring stroke,
the tightly wound coils will soon block, thus
shortening the available spring wire length,
which increases the spring rate  (hardness).
wire length available; i.e., they are  harder
than in the  start range. (See diagram). These
two  different spring rates —  called C1  and  C2
in technical jargon —  are  often identified by a
number code printed on  the spring. However,
this  only seldom represents actual values.
More expensive to  produce, but  equipped
with excellent suspension features are  conti-
nuous progressive springs, which generate a
soft, smooth progression curve thanks to their
progressively increasing coil pitch (see dia-
gram).
©  Progressive coil springs
ree be assembled with the tighter coils on
top  in  order to  minimize the  unsprung mas-
ses  which include the  springs with approx.
half of their weight. The installation direction
of a spring has  absolutely nothing to do with
its function.
Progressive fork springs are  installed with the
more tightly wound coils on  top in order to
reduce the unsprung masses.

PRACTICAL TIP
Mi  Jack up  the  motorcycle so  that the  front
wheel and fork legs are  free to  move. If you
don’t have a front stand, the  machine can be
suspended from the  workshop ceiling using
hooks firmly screwed in,  and strong tigh-
tening straps. Cover the tank with a towel in
order to  prevent potential scratches or  dents

### caused by tools or  components. Important:
Write down all  settings prior to  disassembly.
@®  Take off front wheel, fender and brake ca-
lipers. Do not  let the brake calipers dangle on
the  lines, rather attach them to the  lower fork
bridge using wire or  tightening straps.
@§  Unscrew the  fork caps one turn of the
thread using a socket or  ring wrench.
TIP: First, loosen the clamping screws on  the
fork bridge in order to  reduce the  tension on
the thread of the fork cap.
Mi  Before loosening all  other clamping scr-
ews, measure and note down how far the fork
legs protrude from the fork bridges, then com-
pletely pull the  legs downwards and  out.
mm  Take off the fork caps and  pour the fork oil
into  an  oil-resistant and leak-proof container.
While doing this, push the  sliding pipe and
the stanchion or  damper rod  back and forth
in order to  pump any remaining oil from the
damper system. Carefully store the used oil in
a  lockable container and dispose of  it pro-
perly at the  next opportunity.
For  cartridge forks, the  next step involves ta-
king the fork caps off the damper piston.
_IMPORTANT
Beforehand, find and note down the entire re-
bound damping adjustment range in turns or
clicks (important for assembly).
\
—@  Then, push down the  spring preload bu-
shing using a special tool (see photo) until the
locknut on  the  piston rod  is accessible. A se-
cond mechanic can  now loosen the  locknut
and  unscrew the fork cap from the piston rod.
IMPORTANT |
Do  not  use  screwdrivers or  tire  irons! Impro-
per  procedure or  tools can cause the  piston
rod  to  bend.
A simple trick for  correcting the  oil  level or
for replacing the springs (without oil) with the
fork installed: The spring compression tool
can be  tied down using a  tightening strap
wrapped around the  lower fork bridge. This
enables you to  easily loosen or  tighten the
locknut on  the  piston rod.
Remove spring, bushings and all  other parts
in sequence and lay them out  in such a way
that the assembly direction is correct; i.e., you
do not want to lay out the parts and  plates up-
side down, but  rather the  right side up.

This step also applies to open fork systems. If
you are  replacing just the  spring and oil,  in-
stall the  new parts now or  fill  with oil,  and
then reassemble the fork in the  reverse
sequence.
Replacing the  fork radial shaft seals or  mo-
difying the  damper system will require addi-
tional steps.
@@  For  this type of work, clamp the  sliding
pipes into the  plastic or  aluminum jaws of a
vise.
But  do  not  clamp the  sli-
Fine pipes by their cylindrical part, instead
clamp them by stable cast parts such as  the
brake caliper holder or  the drop-outs.
H@  Loosen the  screw connections inserted
from below. This is easiest done using an  im-
pact wrench because the thread is usually in-
stalled using a  thread locking compound. A
short, dry knock on  the  screw head using an
aluminum punch will also often help.
If the damper cylinder inside the fork also ro-
tates, it must be  held in  place using an  ap-
propriate tool. In  emergencies, you can  also
improvise and use  a  tube whose contour is
adapted to the  hex  or  a castellated pattern of
the  damper. You cannot use  it to  exert great
force, but this  step is mostly just about remo-
ving the  loosened screw completely from its
thread.
| If this is not  done correctly,
the damper cartridge may be damaged.
@®  Remove cartridge insert or damper piston.
Disassembling and modifying the  cartriage
inserts should be  left to  specialists.
In  most cases, the  seals are  caulked and re-
quire machining on  a  lathe and milling ma-
chine, or  a  new part may be required for as-
sembly.
HH  Remove the  locking rings and washers
above the sealing rings. To do this, use  a blow
dryer on  hot or a gas flame to heat up the area
around the sealing ring and  guide bushing to
about 60°  C.
M8  Then strongly yank the  stanchion to  re-
move it from the  sliding pipe. Lay out  all the
components in the correct order and direction
for  reassembly, thoroughly clean and rinse
out the base of the sliding pipe with a cleaner
in  order to  completely remove deposits and
dirty oil  residue from the damper system.
TUNING-TIP: To  reduce sliding friction, the
areas of the  hard chromium-plated stanchion
or  sliding pipe which come into  contact with
the  radial shaft seal and the  guide bushing
can  be polished.
To do this, clamp a  polishing disk into  a drill
press or  lathe and  manually polish them using
light rotating movements in  the  longitudinal
direction. This will break and smooth any
scoring on  the  radially machined chrome
layer.
Another trick for reducing friction in the fork
system is polishing the spring windings on  the
outside. The reason for  this is that the  sus-
pension springs are  compressed when sliding
and  are  bent slightly into  an  S-shape.
In the process, they will  touch the inside wall
of the sliding pipe and  scuff it with varying re-
sistance; this  can sometimes also be  clearly
heard. Polishing the outside will  reduce noise
and  friction.
To  polish the  springs to  a  smooth finish, use
300-grit sandpaper or  cloth and polish ma-
nually on  the  outside. Alternatively, you can
clamp the springs into a lathe, insert the other
end  in the centering cone and  let the lathe run
at  low speed while guiding the  sandpaper
along the  springs.

springs will provide a progressive increase in the

chanical friction is simply first class. Applied
to a previously very finely machined surface,
the stanchions will  prove incredibly resistant
to  Wear and  to  scoring, which will also help
preserve the  sealing lips  of the  radial shaft
seals.

are  burred from disassembly, they have to be
thoroughly deburred using a  shave hook. Be
careful when removing the sealing rings over
the  wide, recessed groove in  the  guide bu-
shings! The sealing lips may be damaged in
the  process. Before installing new sealing
rings, you can carefully smooth the  sharp-
edged grooves and cover the sensitive sealing
rings with a thin layer of adhesive tape to pre-
vent damage during assembly. Prior to  as-

shaft seals with fork oil, or  even better, lubri-
cate with silicon grease.

make absolutely sure that the  surfaces of the
stanchion and  the sliding pipe are  not  dama-
ged in  the  process. TIP: When assembling
conventional/RSU forks, push the sliding pipe
and the  stanchion completely together. This
makes the  surfaces (which glide over the  ra-
dial  shaft seals) disappear in the sliding pipe,
where they are  protected from damage. A

/  Most vehicle manufactu-
rers  epkcify the oil refill capacity in cubic cen-
timeters. However, since a certain amount of
residual oil  remains, these specifications will
not  ensure perfect tuning. The correct quan-
tity  is  not  the  refill capacity, but  instead al-
ways the filling height, i.e.,  the air Cushion.
@2@  An  additional option for  influencing sus-
pension and progression in  a telescopic fork
is the  air  cushion, which is created between
the  fork oil  and  the fork caps. This air cushi-
on  is compressed during compression, gene-
rating pressure that supports the fork springs.
The smaller you make this air  cushion, the
greater the  suspension effect and vice versa.
Since an  air cushion works progressively, the
air  cushion’s suspension effect will increase
substantially toward the  end of suspension
travel.
The  air  cushion depends on  the  stanchion
diameter, the suspension travel and the desi-
red progression. The table on  page 40 lists the
minimum and  maximum values for  conven-
tional forks (RSU) and upside down forks
(USD) for road bikes with a suspension travel
of max. 130  mm.
Measuring is always conducted with the fork
completely in, without spring or  preload bu-
shings. However, the  values can  be variably
adjusted between the  maximum and mini-
mum limits depending on  your needs. The air
cushions in both fork legs should be absolu-
tely identical in size.
idiots TO  Check the  oil  level, the
air ane ae Soaks: purged from the dam-
ping system, and the  piston rod  should be
completely slid  in.  Since the fork is mounted
at  an  angle, there will be  different results
when measuring the fill  level. If you  measure
the oil  level in the front area of the stanchion,
you will find the  air cushion is greater in the
front and smaller in the  rear. You can  derive
the exact measurement from the mean of both
values. The fill  levels should always be mea-
sured at  the  same measuring points on  the
right and  left stanchions.
The air  cushion determined by this method
will  rise  when the springs are  inserted becau-
se  their volumes will displace oil,  thus in-
creasing the actual oil level. When using short
springs with additional thin-wall bushings,
the  oil  level will increase a  bit  less  and  con-
sequently, the  spring force of the  air cushion
is a bit  lower than it would be when using lon-
ger  springs without preload bushings.
|  An  oil  level that is too  high
can  create problems. When the fork slides in,
the air cushion can  be completely used up be-
fore even reaching the  maximum spring tra-
vel.  It will  then be blocked by the oil volume

The  air  cushion was used as  early as  the  be-
ginning of the  80’s and  became highly
fashionable along with air-supported forks.
This type of fork was inflated with up  to  one
bar of compressed air through a valve on  the
fork cap to increase the actual spring rate. The
disadvantage of this  system was that the  sea-
ling lips of the  radial shaft seals were strongly
pressed against the  fork legs, requiring in-
creased starting force. In addition, it was prac-
tically impossible to  fill  the  small space be-
tween
the
oil
and
the
right
and
left
fork
caps
with exactly the  same pressure without ela-
borate tools. Manufacturers tried to solve this
problem by using connecting hoses, but they
soon realized that the  use  of a  harder sus-
pension spring resulted in substantially better
results than combining steel springs and
pneumatic suspension. Nowadays, this sy-
stem is rarely found anymore.
mH  After the damping cartridge has been
completely purged of  air,  the  fork oil  level
should be adjusted to the desired level. Using
a  fuel- and water-resistant pen, note fork oil
viscosity and oil  level (e.g. 7.5/130 mm) on
the  fork legs or  fork bridges. If too  much oil
has  been added, it can be extracted using a
small bulb with a  fuel hose attached to  its
end.
TIP: Wrap a  cable tie  around the  hose piece
and position it so  that the  length of the  pro-
truding hose end corresponds exactly to  the
height of the desired air cushion. Then place
the cable tie on  the edge of the stanchion and
start extracting —  and  you’re done.

### @  Another little tuning trick:
Before inserting the forks into the bridges, slip
two O-rings over the sliding pipe or  the
stanchion. The ring diameters should be
about 5 mm smaller. This will enable you to
“read” the  suspension travel actually used
during operation.
Also, measure and note down the  maximum
suspension travel with and without the  hy-
draulic end  stop. To do so,  compress the fork
without the  spring, but with the  complete oil
volume and  the  piston rod  installed. Approx.
15  to  20  millimeters before the  mechanical
end stop, you should feel strong resistance,
which is caused by the  hydraulic stop.
@@%  Position one O-ring where the  hydraulic
suspension travel ends; i.e., before the me-
chanical stop, and slide the  other one in the
direction of the dust cover. The difference be-

tween the  two O-rings will help you deter-
mine exactly the amount of suspension travel
reserves remaining during operation.
@%  In order to  be able to slide the spring and
the bushings over the piston rod  without a lot
of fiddling, simply push a tightly fitting hose
piece -  approx. 20 cm  long -  over the threads
in order to pull up the piston rod. What works
even better is to  completely close the  com-

### pression damping settings prior to  assembly:
The damper rod  will then sink back into the
cylinder only with a great deal of resistance.
@@  A  special tool is  used to  compress the
spring over the  preload bushing. In  order to
make this task easier, the second mechanic
should screw the  fork caps onto the  damper
rod  until an  obvious resistance becomes no-
ticeable and the  damper rods start rotating
too. However, before doing that, the  rebound
damping adjustment screw at  the  fork cap
must be  put  back on  to  “maximum.” Install
the  lock nut  and  check the rebound damping
adjustment range. Then finish tightening the
lock nut, and  carefully insert the fork caps at
a  right angle into the  first thread on  the
stanchion; then tighten them.
Mi  After assembling the  fork legs, check for
basic functionality. If both fork legs are  adju-
sted to  the  same setting, they should also
have the same damping characteristics.
Check this for the entire adjustment range. Al-
ways use  the  same force to  push down. Di-
rectly compare the  right and left  legs with re-
gard to damping resistance and response cha-
racteristics. Prior to  assembly, adjust spring
preload and damping on  both legs to  the
same settings.
lee APN UET When installing or  shifting
upside-down stanchions, use a_   torque
wrench to tighten the clamping screws of the
bottom fork bridge while strictly observing
manufacturers’ instructions. If they are  tighte-
ned excessively, the  stanchion will ovalize,
the  fork guide will stick, and response cha-
racteristics and  function will  deteriorate. Our
recommendation: For upside-down forks with
two or  more clamping screws, regardless of
their diameter, do  not  exceed a torque of 12
Nm.
Before inserting the  stanchions into the  fork
bridges, degrease them with a special cleaner
around the  clamping areas in order to achie-
ve the best possible grip between the surfaces
for  high torsional rigidity.
Mi  Evenly tighten all clamping bolts, re-tigh-
ten  fork caps, mount wheel and accessory
pieces, check spring function as  well as
smoothness and  freedom of movement of the
steering in both directions at a standstill.
ed ESL Have all  lines and cables
been correctly installed? Turn the handlebars
completely to  the  right and to  the  left  and
make sure that  cables and lines can  move
freely.
Follow the  instructions in Chapter 4 to adjust
the  basic settings and  then go for a test  ride.
Afterwards, recheck all  threaded connec-
tions. ;
TIP: In order to  prevent the fork legs from
deforming, the  axle clamps should not  be
tightened until the  fork has  been completely
bottomed out  several times with the  front
wheel brakes engaged. This will  align the fork
legs in parallel which will enable the  fork to
respond more sensitively.

### Oil  change intervals, viscosity and  quality:
When using high quality fork oils  in modern
motorcycles, changing the fork oil  every
15,000 to  20,000 kilometers or  every two
years at  the  latest will be  sufficient. When
using your bike for  racing, the  oil  should be
changed prior to  each season.
41

The selection of viscosity should be primari-
ly based on  the vehicle manufacturer’s speci-
fications.
When switching to  different fork springs or
overhauled damper systems, follow the OEM
recommendations for oil viscosity. When op-
timizing the  damping system by using a dif-
ferent (usually more viscous) oil, we  recom-
mend using only high quality oils.
Cheap products do  not  meet the  high requi-
rements for  constant damping effectiveness.
They can  lead to foaming in the  oil.  In addi-
tion, they can increase wear on  the  pivot
points and  radial shaft seals.
It’s  best to  use  only oils recommended and
used by  the manufacturers of  suspension
components. There you will also find visco-
sitiés in small gradations.
Mixing different oil  viscosities, for  example,
to  achieve a  viscosity of  15  by mixing oils
with viscosities of  10  and 20,  is  impossible
because additives and contents are  not added
in a  linear fashion. That is why you  should
always use  only a single viscosity.

@®  Insert bolts and  check whether the  shock
mount or  the  distance bushings have too

becoming deformed during tightening.
@®  If available, arrange the  remote reservoir
hose line according to  the  instructions and
make sure that they are  not kinked or rubbing.

anything dragging or  rubbing?
If not, tighten shock bolts and linkage while

the  shock can  still  be  rotated laterally in the
ball-and-socket joints, and  make sure that
nothing can  come into contact with the frame
or the swing arm  while pressing down onthe

Mi  Adjust the  basic settings, test  suspension
function at a standstill, then go for a test  ride.
Afterwards, recheck all  bolts and threaded

11.  Basic Adjustment and
Optimization of Damping
and Suspension in

### Practice
Poor ride  characteristics are  not  always
caused by the suspension or  damping sy-
stems. Mechanical defects, worn tires, or
even the wrong tire  pressure can  be the
causes of an  unstable bike. Therefore,
thoroughly check the  basic functions of
your machine using the  checklist at the end
of this  book. If you  do not  find  anything
wrong or  out  of the ordinary, you  can  now
turn your attention to the fine  art  of tuning.
Before going to  work with a  screwdriver or
sickle spanner, you should be  very clear
about your tuning goals.
Where is your suspension causing problems?
¢  Over bumps?
e  At top speed?
¢  With heavy loads?
Is it
¢  soft  as  butter and  mushy?
*  or  rock hard and  uncomfortable?

### Analyzing suspension problems:
First, map out  a test route. Then go for a test
ridé wearing protective clothing, riding at  a
speed that  enables you  to establish the bike’s
ride behavior at  critical points. Take your
time. If you  are  not sure, ride the critical stret-
ches two  or three times at the same speed, al-
ways using the  same running line (bumps or
potholes).
Observe whether the  imbalances are  coming
from the front or the  rear  of the  machine. Is it
long vibrations or short hard jolts that are  cau-
sing you problems?
\
Using the  information on  fork and  shock fun-
ctions and  the troubleshooting list at the  end
of this  book, you  can  then start localizing the
possible causes of the  problem.
Measuring and  recording negative suspensi-

an  accurate assessment.
The  rule of thumb for measuring negative sus-
pension travel in  road bikes with an  overall

back, measured on a static bike without (N1)

### On  the front wheel:
Ni  value =25to30mm
N2  value =35to40mm

### On  the  rear wheel:
N1  value =5to15 mm
N2  value =30to40 mm
For  motorcycles with shorter or  longer sus-
pension travel, the  following rule of thumb

### applies in % of the entire suspension travel:
Front. Ni =20 to  25  %
NZ =3O0i@ 35%
Rear N1 =5to15%
NZ =  251040 %
Measuring point

### i’ This is how to do  it:
M8  Lift  up  the machine to  completely re-
move any suspension function in  the  front
until the  wheel is no  longer touching the
ground. Measure the distance from the wheel
axle to  the  lower fork bridge and note this
down as  value A.
@®@  Put the motorcycle back on  the ground in
a vertical position, bottom it out several times
and then again measure the distance between
the  same measuring points noting it down as
value B, which should now be lower. Subtract
value B from value A.  You now have value
N1; i.e., negative suspension travel 1, mea-
sured without the rider. It should be within the
parameters specified.
8  Now, sit  on  your motorcycle in  normal
seating position, arms on  the handlebars, one
leg on  the  foot rest, and bottom out  the  mo-
torcycle a few  times balancing it so  that it is
almost in a  vertical position with barely any
load on  your supporting leg.  Now, have
someone measure the  distance between the
same measuring points. This measurement C
will be even lower than value B.

@®§  Now, subtract value C from the first value
A.  This will result in  N2; i.e., negative sus-
pension travel 2, with a rider. This value, too,
should be  within the parameters specified
earlier on  in this  chapter.
For the rear  wheel suspension, just follow the
same instructions. Your reference points are
now between the  rear axle and a fixed point
marked on  the  rear frame at  an  angle of ap-
prox. 15  degrees towards the  front. It should
be 15 degrees because this value corresponds
approximately to the  radius of the swing arm.
If the  values are  too  high; e.g., instead of N2
on  the fork being between 35  and  40,  it is 55
millimeters, you should increase the  preload
on  the  spring until you  obtain the  N2  values.
If it  is  less; e.g., only 25  mm negative sus-
pension travel with the  rider, you  should

reduce the  preload until you reach the  N2
values. The preload is adjusted on  the  tele-
scopic fork by means of threaded spindles or
other preload bushings (must be  manufac-
tured and installed).
On the shock absorber, this can  be done using
grooved nuts, hydraulic preload or  ratcheting
mechanisms. The "loaded” and "unloaded”
values should lie  within the  above-mentio-
ned  ranges. If both the  N1  and N2  values de-
viate heavily from the values specified, this  is
a  sign that the  spring rate is  basically inap-
propriate for  the  rider’s weight. A minor dif-
ference between N1  and N2  means that the
installed spring is  too  hard. If there is  too
much of  a  deviation between the  numbers,
the spring rate  is too  low; i.e., the spring is too
soft.

Adjust the spring preload on  the  fork via  the

Example 1: Negative suspension travel on  the
rear wheel (value N2) with rider is 35 mm; un-
loaded, the machine rebounds completely up
to the stop. Result: To reach the  N2  value, the
spring must be  preloaded too  much; i.e., its
spring rate  (hardness) is too  soft.
Example 2:  Negative suspension travel with

### rider (N2) is 35  mm; unloaded 20 mm. Result:
In  order to  achieve the  N2  value, the  spring
should have minimal preload; i.e.,  its  spring
rate  is too  hard.
The N2  value is always the  more important
one and must be  adjusted accordingly.
Springs that are  too  soft will result irt too  low
an  N1  value, which, in  extreme cases, can
lead to the machine hitting the end stop of the
shock when rebounding because no  N1  value
is left over due to  the  high preload required.
In such cases, the springs should be replaced
in order to definitely achieve an  N1  negative
suspension travel.

the negative suspension travel without a rider.
Write down the  differences in values.
ADJUSTMENT TIP: Definitely make sure you
have the  correct negative spring travel ad-
justments both front and  rear  before going on
a test  ride. The  reason: Negative spring travel
influences the  motorcycle's balance. If the
bike rear sags too  deep during the  test  rides,
this will  limit your ability to fine-tune the fork
to  its  ideal setting, and vice versa. Before
going for  a  test  ride, the  basic damping set-
ting should also be adjusted as  well as  possi-
ble  both in  front and back. This is because
even the  best tuning in the  front is useless if
the  rear completely over- or  underdamps so
that it bounces over road bumps.
TIP: With sport bikes or  machines that are  rid-
den with heavy loads and only achieve the
N2  negative suspension travel by means of a
high spring preload, we  recommend using
harder suspension springs. However, this mo-
dification will  only make sense if the rebound
damping force or  its adjustment range is suf-
ficiently high. Using harder springs has  the

### following advantages:
They will build up  a  higher end force
throughout the  entire suspension travel and
thus provide greater bottoming-out protection
for touring bikes carrying heavy loads.
The  N1  negative suspension travel can  be ad-
justed sufficiently high without the  machine
dipping too  far in curves.
In sport bikes, this can  result in more braking
stability and more grip when accelerating
over bumps. For  sport bikes, the  suspension
travel actually used will  decrease, the annoy-
ing  movements when shifting load or  lean
angle will be  reduced, and handling will
usually improve.

The reason: The hard spring does not build up
more spring force until it has reached the pre-
adjusted N2:negative suspension travel. In the
range it is in before, the  spring force is lower
and  therefore the  response is somewhat
better.
ASSEMBLY TIP: In some motorcycle models,
the central suspension shocks (mono-shocks)
are  mounted in. such inaccessible areas that
the shock has to be completely uninstalled for
adjusting the  preload. Before removing the
shock, write down the  current and the  desi-
red  negative suspension travel. The differen-
ce  between the  two values can tell  you by
how much the vehicle rear position has to be
changed, but  it will not  tell  you the  correct
spring preload value. In order to avoid unne-
cessary work steps, measure the  maximum
shock absorber stroke from the  damper hou-
sing to the rubber of the stop. Then add  to the
measured value half the  height of the  rubber
stop. In  practice, this  value is available as  ef-
fective suspension travel on  the  shock.
Divide this  value by the  rear  axle suspension
travel specified in the  motorcycle’s user
manual.
Example: Stroke on  the  shock plus half the
stop =  60  millimeters. Theoretical value on
the  rear  axle: 120  millimeters. This will  result

### in a ratio of 2:1.  The  reason for this  is the link-
age  system which reduces the  ratio between
the suspension travel on  the rear  axle and the
suspension travel on  the  shock from 2:1  to
3:1, depending on  the type of linkage.
For  changing the  spring preload, this means
that in order to  raise the  rear frame by

10  millimeters, the  spring must be preloaded
by an  additional 5 millimeters. This method
does not take into  consideration any  potenti-
al progressive action of the  linkage. Therefo-
re,  add about 10% more preload - in this  ex-
ample, this  would be  0.5  millimeters, resul-
ting in  a  total preload increase of 5.5  milli-
meters. This will spare you from
unnecessarily installing and uninstalling the
shock for  checking the  negative suspension
travel.
With the  shock absorber installed, the  pre-
load should only be  changed while the  rear
wheel is completely unloaded. Otherwise the
preload mechanism must not  only be actua-
ted  against the  spring preload force, but  also
against the  machine load.
If the  adjustment assembly is dirty or  corro-
ded, it often helps to spray MoS2 spray on  the
thread or  the  ratcheting mechanism.
Checking suspension balance
Matched suspension movements on  both
wheels are  essential for harmonious and  neu-
tral  ride behavior. The spring hardness should
be selected so  that the  suspension will com-
press by an  equal amount both in  front and
back on  bumpy roads, and particularly in
bumpy curves, at constant ground speed, with
slightly stronger compression in  the  rear —
caused by the  higher rear axle load —  being
normal.
If the suspension compresses too  much in the
front or  rear, the steering geometry will  chan-
ge.  This change of caster and steering head
angle will force an  unwanted change in the
handlebar movement and  the  steering forces
required. The machine will  become squirrel-
ly, tend to  waver and will be  harder to  keep
on  the  running line.
In order to check for synchronous compressi-
on,  you will have to  push down on  the  ma-
chine with all  your strength at  the  center
above the  tank. The suspension should then
equally compress both in front and  in the rear.
> wt If you  do not  apply enough
force, the bike will  compress more in the back
even if the suspension balance is correct. The
reason: Due to  its higher mechanical friction
(i.e., the  starting force required due to  the
large diameters of friction bearing and radial
shaft seal), the  fork will respond worse and
later than the  low-friction suspension system
on  the  rear wheel. There, almost all  pivot
points rotate in smooth-running roller bea-
rings with a  small diameter and low
friction. During this  test, the

damping levels must obviously also be adju-
sted correctly because their hydraulic resi-
stance has  a  considerable influence on  the
suspension characteristics.
If the  suspension compresses excessively in
the  front or  rear, the  cause of this should be
corrected. Either the spring must be replaced
or the compression damping increased. As al-
ready mentioned in Chapter 8, preloading the
spring to  rectify this  problem will not  change
anything because it will  only change the star-
ting position, but  not  spring hardness.
PU SENSU In  addition to  suspension
compression being synchronous, the rebound
movement should also occur as evenly and as
synchronously as  possible. If the machine gets
stuck considerably longer in  hydraulic resi-
stance in  the  front or  rear during a  rebound
stroke, this should be compensated for by cor-
recting the  rebound damping. As  a  rule, the
fork may rebound a bit  faster, but  never the
rear (see Basic Damping Adjustment).
What is annoying when riding through curves
is advantageous when braking ahead of and
turning into curves. Because when doing so,
the fork will  dip far down and  the rear  will re-
bound. Lighter handling due to lower steering
forces and  an  agile turning behavior is the re-
sult  of this  change in  geometry (short caster,
steep steering head angle, short wheel base
due to  the  swing arm moving downward),
which, in  turn, is  caused by dynamic axle
load change.
When the bike returns to  its normal initial po-
sition during the  subsequent constant ride
through the  curve, the  steering geometry va-
lues will  return to their original level. Only the
center of gravity will  be lower, due to the cen-
trifugal forces created when riding through
curves which also cause the  suspension
50
elements to dip lower.
Acceleration often produces a  negative
influence due  to dynamic axle load change
towards the  rear. The fork will rebound, the
motorcycle will be too  high in the  front, the
steering will become more indirect, and the
machine will tend to  understeer or  become
very light and  thus squirrelly in the front. The
advantage is  that the  rear wheel can now
exert more surface pressure in  the  accelera-
tion phase because of the dynamic axle load
change to the rear  wheel, which will then spin
less  when accelerating hard.
BASIC FORK ADJUSTMENT
Basic Rebound Damping adjustment
Use all  your strength to  press the  bike down
into its suspension. Observe how much resi-
stance the suspension/damping builds up and
how fast the  bike rebounds from its  lowest
position. Does the  machine bounce up  and
down or  does it rebound slowly and slug-
gishly like  molasses?
Before changing the  position of the  adjust-
ment screws in  the  damper assembly, you
should write down all original settings. To do —
so,  turn the  adjustment screws slowly, click- |
for-click or  in  half turns clockwise. Write

### down this value in  short form [for example:
“Fork: Rebound (top) 3 turns open, compres-
sion (bottom) 1 1/2 turns open”).
In  practically all  forks or  shock absorber de-
signs, the  settings are  counted starting from
the  maximum closed position. In  this maxi-
mum position, the  needle valves are  comple-
tely closed, while the  minimum adjustment
position can usually be  changed when as-
sembling the damper units.
Turn the rebound damping adjustment screws
to “completely open,” i-e.,  little damping, and
compress the  fork hard. Then adjust the  re-

52
bound to maximum, i.e., the hardest damping
level, and once again press the  bike down
into the  suspension. Can you feel  a  change?
The  adjustment has worked if the bike
rebounds clearly slower.
Basic rebound damping fork adjustment for
road riding: Turn the adjustment screws to the
completely closed position and press down
hard on  the  fork. Reduce the  damping force
by unscrewing the adjustment screws on  both
fork  legs far enough so that the front rebounds
a  few millimeters beyond the  starting positi-
on  and  only then comes to a standstill. In  no
way should the  fork continue to  bounce up
and down several times. For  lightweight ri-
ders, you can reduce the  rebound damping
setting a  bit  more if more comfort is desired.
Then the fork can rebound up to  15  millime-
ters  beyond its starting position.
For  use  as  a  sport bike, adjust the  fork dam-
ping as  described above. Then turn the  re-
bound damping adjustment screw to the clo-
sed position step-by-step until the  front no
longer bounces; i.e., when it  comes to  a
standstill immediately after rebounding to  its
starting position.
Be Perform only one  modifica-
tion at a time to  be able to  clearly recognize
the  results of each adjustment. Always chan-
ge the  settings equally on  both fork legs.
Basic compression damping adjustment on
the  fork: Now perform the  same steps for
checking the  function of  the  compression
damping in  order to  figure out  its  effective
range. Again: completely open the  rebound
damping adjustment mechanism, completely
close the  compression damping and then
press the  bike hard down into its suspension.
Then repeat the  whole thing with a  comple-
tely open compression damping adjustment
mechanism. The bike should then feel  spon-
gy  and  soft.
This test  can also actually show you the  ef-
fectiveness of the  compression damping sy-
stem. Wrap a  cable tie  around the  sliding
pipe/stanchion, pushing the tie  so  it sits  next
to  the  radial shaft seal. Then press the  bike
down hard. Measure how far the cable tie  is
now from the  radial shaft seal. Do  the  same
test with the same force when pressing down,
but this  time with a  completely closed com-
pression adjustment mechanism. The di-
stance between the cable tie/radial shaft seal
should now be smaller than with open com-
pression damping. The reason for this is that
the  stronger hydraulic resistance will slow
down the  compression force so  that the  mo-
torcycle no  longer dips as  far.
You should test  this  out  not  only across the
entire compression and  rebound damping ad-
justment range, but  also do  it in small steps.
This means press down, then adjust the  re-
bound or compression damping by two  clicks
or  a quarter turn, then press down again, and
so  on  until you have tested the  entire range.
Many adjustments are  not  linear; while they
may cause only minimal changes across a
broad range, starting at  a  certain position,
their damping force may increase dramati-
cally.
This can  happen within three or four clicks or
one  turn. Write down these positions in order
to  take this idiosyncrasy into consideration
during test  rides. Always test  only one dam-
ping level at  a  time. Never make two chan-
ges at a time. Otherwise you  may quickly lose
sight of the  interdependencies.
After checking the compression damping ad-
justment range, return the  adjustment screws
to the  position originally recorded and  go for
a test  ride.
Change the  damping levels in  the  direction
that  you  think is necessary or  as  described in
the
troubleshooting
table.

### If
you
are
not
sure

about the  changes in  ride behavior, go  back
to  the  original setting and compare ride be-
haviors again.
It is very difficult to  determine compression
damping while the  bike is static. You have to
have a  very good feel  for  it. That is why it is
better to  determine it during a test  ride.
Select as  your starting point the  setting
recommended in the  user manual or  a  mid-
dle position. Then, during the test  ride, adjust
it to a softer setting for more comfort or a har-
der setting for sporty handling. The motorcy-
cle  must always ensure good tracking in all
riding situations.
Go  for  a  test ride and pay attention to  the
changes. Better? Worse?
Turn a few  more clicks or  quarter turns in the
desired direction. If there is no  improvement,
return to  the  recorded starting value and try
other improvement options according to  the
table at the end  of this  book.
Motorcycles tuned hard for  sporty riding or
general excess damping can  lead to  head-
shaking on  bad roads or  at high speeds.
BASIC REAR WHEEL SUSPENSION
ADJUSTMENT

### Basic rebound damping adjustment:
Prerequisite for  this  step is a  spring preload
correctly adjusted to  the  recommended
values.
Press the bike down into its suspension at the
rider seat cushion. The bike should rebound
with a visible delay and return to  its full
starting position after less  than a second.
TIP: Count to  “twenty-one” starting from the
point at which you release the  bike after
pressing it down hard. The rear should have
completely rebounded in the time it takes you
to  say  “twenty-one”. If the  rear bounces ab-
ruptly and  uncontrolled out of its compressed
position against the end  stop or even tends to
bounce up  and  down, the  rebound damping
has to be increased. On  the other hand, if the
suspension gets visibly and  tangibly stuck in
the  damping phase, if it rebounds sluggishly
and slowly and requires more than one se-
cond to  come to a standstill, then the re-
bound damping setting has to  be reduced.
In order to  see  the  effectiveness of the  chan-
ges  made, follow the  same instructions used
with the  telescopic fork. Test the  entire re-
bound and compression damping adjustment
range and  each click for effectiveness. Make
sure to write down all original settings be-
forehand.
Too  much rebound damping should always
be avoided. Excessive rebound damping will
cause imbalance in the  suspension when ri-
ding over bumps, reduce suspension and  ride
comfort on  bad roads, and make the  machi-
ne  unwieldy and balky due  to  its excessively
sagging rear.
To little rebound damping will  allow the ma-
chine to  bounce up  and down over bumpy
surfaces, make the  handlebars unsteady, and
lead to  overall unstable ride behavior and
even an  uncontrolled build-up of suspension
movements in the  machine.

### Basic compression damping adjustment:
It is also very difficult for  laypersons to  feel
compression damping in  the  rear while the
bike is static. When it comes to compression
resistance, only experienced specialists can
feel  whether it is caused by spring force, hy-
draulic compression, or  the  progression cau-
sed  by the  linkage.
53

54
Compression damping reacts strongly to com-
pression speed. If the  bike is pressed down
fast  and with a  lot  of force, hydraulic resi-
stance will  build up.  If compression is perfor-
med slowly by a  heavy load, this  resistance
will remain very low. In  this case, too, stick
with the  basic settings recommended by the
manufacturer. Only change these if you  want
to  make improvements in a  certain direction
or  if you want to  proceed according to  the
table at the end  of the  book.
The  following generally applies: More com-
pression damping for sporty riders, direct sus-
pension or when riding with heavy loads. Less
compression damping for  more comfort and
sensitive response characteristics or  for light-
weight riders.
When riding, a  high compression damping
setting in the low-speed range will  have a po-
sitive effect on  curve stability —  particularly
when exiting curves; i.e., when you are  ac-
celerating. The machine will not  dip  down
too far; it will  handle and track well. The com-
pression damping hydraulic signal will also
provide clearer feedback to  the  rider. When
riding with heavy loads in particular, effective
compression damping in  the high-speed
range will prevent the  bike from bottoming
out  when going over bumps. Too  much com-
pression damping on  the  shock, particularly
in the low-speed range, will  reduce ride com-
fort  and can lead to  squirrelly steering and
even headshaking (kickback).
IMPORTANT
In  almost all  shock absorber designs, the  re-
bound adjustment mechanism will also influ-
ence the  compression damping system to  a
certain extent. The reason: The port located
in the damper piston will  allow the oil to flow
in both spring directions. If the rebound dam-
ping is adjusted "very soft;” i.e., a  larger cir-
cular cross-section is opened, the damper pi-
ston will  also counter the compression stroke
with somewhat less  resistance.
This interdependence should be  taken into
consideration when making adjustments.
TIP: In order to do the work according to the
error/correction table at the  end  of the  book
as  effectively and inexpensively as  possible,
you should always begin with the  simplest
optimization steps. For  example, if the  mo-
torcycle bottoms out  in the  rear when riding
over bumps, you should first check to  make
sure the  preload is correct, i.e.  the  negative
suspension travel. Only then should you in-
crease the  compression damping. If neither
adjustment leads to  the  desired result, the
spring or  the suspension shock (mono-shock)
will  have to  be replaced.
Rebound adjustment: If the knurled nut  on  the
bottom end of the shock absorber is turned
clockwise, the needle inside the hollow damper
rod will push upward and narrow the annular
gap, thus producing a higher damping force.

dom in the rebound range.

12.  Suspension Geometry
and Balance
The fact that a motorcycle rides at all in-
stead of falling over, is seen as  a miracle by
many. But  the fact that a motorcycle can  be
directed with razor-sharp accuracy, and
will  track precisely even at 300  km/hour,
must consequently border on  magic.
It generally applies that  all two-wheeled ve-
hicles become more stable the faster they go.
The  reason for this  is that the rotating masses
(tires, wheels, disk brakes) as  well as  the  ro-
tating masses in  the  engine build up  stabili-
zing centrifugal forces that can  only be com-
pelled to come out of their rotation plane; i.e.,
their respective position, by applying a force
to  the  handlebars. The higher the  rotating
masses, the  more stable a  motorcycle will
ride  on  the  straight-away. The  disadvantage
is that planned directional changes, i.e., stee-
ring into curves or  changing lean angles ra-
pidly, can  only be accomplished by applying
a very high steering force.
RAL
56
In addition to  these rotating mass forces, the
geometric values also provide more or  less di-
stinct ride stability. For  example, the  wheel
base, which results from the distance between
the  front and rear axle and which, in  some
ways, is also a caster, i.e., the caster of the rear
wheel to  the  rotation axis (steering head) of
the  front wheel. Current values are  around
1380 to  1420 mm for supersport motorcycles
and over 1700  mm  for choppers and cruisers.
A short wheel base will make the  motorcycle
handle and turn well. The reason for  this is
that a motorcycle with a short wheel base re-
quires less  of a  steering movement for a  cer-
tainycurve radius and  thus less  steering force
than_a bike of the  same design with a  long
wheel base (see drawing on  the  next page).
However, a  motorcycle with a  short wheel
base can tend to  experience suspension im-
balances at  maximum speed. In  addition, a
short wheel base responds more sensitively to
the effects of bumpy roads. Also, when acce-

same curve radius.
lerating, motorcycles with a short wheel base
tend to do more “wheelies” —  especially if the
center of  gravity shifts upwards and back-
wards due  to  heavy loads or  a passenger. Ae-
rodynamic lift and  the  related change of axle
load to  the  rear wheel are  more distinct for
motorcycles with a  short wheel baSe. In  the
case of sport bikes with well-handling stee-
ring geometry and stiff suspension/damper tu-
ning, a  “light” front wheel can lead to  the
dreaded headshaking syndrome because the
downforce will ease up,  causing the  front
wheel to  “dance” nervously over the asphalt.
As mentioned above, the wheel base influen-
ces  how the  axle load is distributed. It is re-
corded with a full  tank at a standstill without
a rider. Depending on  the design and the mo-
torcycle’s purpose, this value is a  50  to  50
ratio, meaning absolutely even distribution of
«—— Short wheel base 4

Center of curve
vehicle weight over the front and  rear  wheels
for sport bikes. For choppers and  cruisers, the
ratio is 40 to  60, with much higher weight in
the  rear.
The  actual value of the axle load distribution
is  naturally dependent on  the  seating posi-
tion of the  rider, which is extremely upright
for choppers and  shifts the value towards the
rear axle, while for sport bikes, their low-
mounted handlebars place the rider in a more
neutral position.
A further point which has  to  be  taken into
consideration when designing and determi-
ning goals is the position of the center of gra-
vity. It results from the arrangement of the  in-
dividual (especially the  heavier) components
such as  engine, tank, radiator, battery, etc.
57

58
Designers try  to  arrange these units as  close
as  possible to the center of gravity as  early as
the design phase. This mass concentration im-
proves the  handling of the  machine; though
it can  also be detrimental to  stability in some
riding situations. .
The  common belief that  the  center of gravi-
ty should be positioned as  low  as  possible is
fundamentally wrong. If it were too  low, mo-
torcycles with wide tires would have to be rid-
den in  curves in  steeply banked positions in
order to balance the centrifugal forces. A cen-
ter  of gravity that is too  high would cause the
bike to  have unstable curve behavior and  an
extreme change in axle load when accelera-
ting and braking.
Therefore, the  best compromise can only be
worked out  during time-consuming test  rides
and  computer simulations, as  long as  the en-
gineering team makes the  effort at  all  to  ba-
lance mass-produced machines as  well as
possible. And practice is  proof enough that
extensive practical testing is not  always
followed through on.
It is noteworthy that in racing, i.e., extreme ri-
ding situations, even changes of just a  few
millimeters in  the  location of  the  center of
gravity and the suspension geometry can  lead
to  obvious changes in ride behavior.

To  simplify such tuning work with regard to
balance, the  position of the  engine in GP  ra-
cing bikes, whose relatively heavy weight re-
presents the  lion’s share of the  vehicle mass,
is  shifted by  means of  variable mounting
points in order to  guarantee an  optimal cen-
ter  of gravity location for  all  rider types and
all track conditions.
Commercially available motorcycles, on  the
other hand, offer fewer, but  nevertheless effi-
cient means for specific tuning. With the  ex-
ception of a very few very sporty and very ex-
pensive motorcycle models, the  basic key
suspension parameters such as  steering head
angle, wheel base or  caster cannot be chan-
ged in mass-produced machines and  are
therefore fixed parameters.
However, due to  variable fork and shock
lengths, more and more machines now have
sufficient room for separately tuning the frame
geometry.
But not everyone wants to race  around a track
in record time. Most motorcyclists go touring
on  country roads or  freeways.
For such varying requirements —  from cruising
around town to high-speed riding —  there can
only be compromise. And that is specified by
the  manufacturer. Of course, manufacturers'
specifications obviously make the  motorcy-
cle’s main operational purpose and riding
safety top  priorities.
Handling and excellent behavior in  curves
are  the  main considerations for  sport bikes.
However, some limitations are  necessary in
order to achieve safe  and  stable ride features
at high speeds.
After all,  safety is  the  top  priority for  mo-
torcycles that anyone can  purchase.
59

In conjunction with wider tires and a cor-
respondingly strong displacement of the center
of gravity out  of the  track and longitudinal axle
(B), a deeper center of gravity (2) requires a
greater lean angle (C) than with a bike with a
higher center of gravity (1) in order to achieve
the same curve speed. In practice, this means
that the motorcycle has  to be banked lower
than a machine with a high center of gravity.
The lower the center of gravity, the smaller the
lean angle will need to be.  The higher the cen-
ter of gravity, the greater the lean angle for the
same curve speed.

### Steering
geometry
ranks
among
one
of
the
most
important
features
in
motorcycle
chas-
sis
design.

### Two
essential
parameters
are
stee-
ring
head
angle
and
caster.
The  steering head angle refers to the angle of
the steering head welded onto the front of the
frame. This component holds the  two fork
bridges that are  connected by a shaft -  the
steering tube. The angle of the  steering tube
is  between 35  degrees (with extreme chop-
pers) and  not quite 20 degrees (for road racing
motorcycles). These values refer to the  angle
of the steering head, measured in the vertical
plame. (See drawing). They can also be mea-
sured from the horizontal level, which will re-
sult in  different values, but  the same func-

### tions. For  example:
35  degrees vertical =  55  degrees horizontal
20 degrees vertical =  70  degrees horizontal
The steeper the  fork angle is, the  better the
handling, but  the  more squirrelly the  hand-
lebars on  uneven surfaces or  bumps. The rea-
son  for this  is that with a  steep steering head
angle, the  rider’s steering movement induces
an  almost vertical rotational movement of the
wheel and  thereby a very direct change in di-
rection. In  contrast, given the  same steering
movement by the  handlebar as  for  the  steep
steering head angle, flatly angled forks move
ona more horizontal rotational plane, the re-
sulting turning movement of  the  wheel is
weaker and so  are  the  steering impulses. On
the  other hand, the  steering stability in  bikes
with a  flat  steering head angle is not  as  hea-
vily impacted by bumps and potholes as  in
bikes with a direct steep angle.
The steering head angle has  its most essen-
tial  influence on  the  second parameter, the
caster. It denotes the distance (in millimeters)
at which the tire  contact patch “runs behind”
the  rotation axis of  the  steering head. The
steering is dragged by the tire’s rolling re-

With the  caster (1),  the  tire
contact patch swings out  of the
longitudinal line  (track), thus re-
quiring a certain steering force to
displace the  wheel from the cen-
ter line. The advantage is that  the
leverage for the stabilizing resto-
ring force is very effective. The
steering will remain calmer and
will be less sensitive to disruptive
influences from the road.

sistance in the longitudinal direction and thus
stabilized. The steering straightens out  auto-
matically, which is called the  “restoring ef-
fect” of the  steering geometry.
Like the  steering head angle, this  unit speci-
fied in  millimeters influences handling and
ride stability. The following rule of thumb also
applies in this case: The longer the caster, the
better the machine will track on  straight-
aways. The  shorter the  caster, the  more agile
and directly the machine will  respond to stee-
ring impulses, but the more susceptible it will
also be  to  unwanted influences such as
bumps or  road grooves. The average values
are  around 80 millimeters for sport bikes and
130 mm for choppers and  cruisers.
The drawing shows that  the  bigger the  caster

__dteering axl axle
yy
is,  the  further a  front wheel steering move-
ment of a certain angle will shift the  wheel's
contact patch out of the longitudinal axis. The
resulting leverage which restores the  front
wheel to the riding direction is larger than for
a shorter caster. However, the front wheel will
also require more force to  steer into  the  cur-
ves. In  doing so,  the  steering impulse must
twist the wheel out  of the  longitudinal direc-
tion in order to  introduce the  necessary ban-
ked  position.
However, the stabilizing effect of the steering
geometry is only available if the  front wheel
is loaded. If the wheel loses contact with the
ground, as  in the  case of a  wheelie, or  if it is
not  pressed down enough, for example, due
to  aerodynamic lift at  high speeds, the  hand-
61

62
lebars can become squirrelly and unstable.
Therefore, mechanics try  to  minimize lift  in
racing and  sport bikes by optimizing the front
cladding aerodynamically (front face, etc.) A
high static axle load on  the  front wheel will
also promote steering stability in all positions.
Therefore, shifting heavier components, such
as  the  starter battery, to  the  front part of the
motorcycle can  achieve better riding stabili-
ty.
The same thing can  result if the machine's ba-
lance is "tilted" towards the  front and  the  in-
creased pressure of the  rider's weight on  the
handlebars raises the  stabilizing restoring
forces.
Caster can  also be  responsible for  annoying
and, to  some extent, dangerous torsional os-
cillations in  the  handlebars. If, for  example,
in certain situations, like rapidly changing the
lean angle, the  restoring moment causes the
wheel to  rotate back over the  vertical posi-
tion, the  steering system masses (wheel, fork
legs, fork bridges, handlebars, fairings fitted to
the handlebar, instruments, etc.) may begin to
oscillate in a  resonant vibration and destabi-
lize  steering.
In practice, this  usually occurs in the form of
headshaking —  going over bumps or  bridge
grooves —  or  shimmy — with unround or  badly
balanced tires.
A hydraulic steering damper is the  only cor-
rect-solution for preventing such torsional os-
cillations or  at  least to  minimize them.
At high speeds, the  wind pressure lifts  the motorcycle
and  the rider out  of the suspension in the front via  the
fairing contact surface. Steering head angle (1) will be-
come flatter, and wheel base (2) and caster will increase.
At the same time, the front axle load (FAL) will decrease
in the  front while the rear axle load (RAL) will increase.

Caster is a  result of the following parameters:

### 1.  Steering head angle.

### 2.  Of the drop-out from the center line of the
sliding pipe is added).

### 3.  Effective tire  radius.

### Do  not  let this confuse you:
A large offset between the  steering tube and
the  stanchion will result in a short caster and
vice  versa.
That is why for choppers with stretched fork
bridges, this  will result neither in  a  flat  stee-
ring head angle —  even if the fork legs are  po-
sitioned at a flat angle, the steering head’s ro-
tational axis stays the  same —  nor  in a really
long caster, but  rather in  a somewhat dange-
rously short one.
Extreme changes in the steering geometry when bra-
king: If the motorcycle dips down to the maximum,
Caster and  steering head together produce
the  steering geometry of a motorcycle; they
are  measured when it is in  a  static, comple-
tely extended state. A change in both values
will  occur when fork  or  shock absorber com-
press during operation.
Extreme deviations in the  basic values occur
primarily when the  bike brakes sharply. Du-
ring braking, the suspension will  compress in
the  front along almost the  entire suspension
travel in  the  telescopic fork, while the  rear
will  completely rebound due to the dynamic
wheel load distribution. In  sport bikes, the
rear  wheel will  even lift off the ground.
The change in  the  effective steering wheel
angle will  also shorten the caster.
the forks will become steeper (steering head angle (2)
becomes steeper), and wheel base (1) will shorten. At
the same time, the caster is substantially reduced.
63

64
Bumps or  sharp lane edges can also drasti-
cally change the actual caster for a  brief mo-
ment when, due to the bump, the tire contact
patch shifts forward in  the  direction of the
theoretical intersecting point with the  stee-
ring axle.
At  this  moment, the  stabilizing effect of the
caster is  lost, steering can become unstable
and possibly trigger more or  less violent
headshaking. Such situations occur on  brid-
ge grooves and  sharp lane edges, but even
potholes and big bumps can put  the  stabili-
zing effect of the caster out  of commission for
a  brief moment.
A third component, the wheel base, is also in-
fluenced by suspension travel. As soon as  the
telescopic fork dips, the  wheel base, too, is
shortened. Due to  the  telescopic fork’s incli-
nation angle, the  front wheel will not  only
spring upwards, but  at  the  same time also
backwards, reducing the  distance to the  rear
axle.
The maximum wheel base is attained when
a) the telescopic fork is completely extended
and b) the  rear wheel swing arm operates
parallel to  a  horizontal line.
In  contrast to  changes in  steering geometry,
the rider will  barely notice the impact of a mi-
nimally shortened wheel base when riding.
Proof of this is the fact that very few riders feel
a  change in  the  wheel base caused by tigh-
tening the  drive chain, even if it is an  adjust-
ment of 15  or  more millimeters.
The track offset, which would not exist in
ideal situations, exerts considerable influen-
ce  on  ride behavior.
However, design restrictions and mostly se-
ries variations in  mass production are res-
ponsible for the fact that hardly any  mass-pro-
duced motorcycles are  delivered without an
alignment offset. Depending on  the suspensi-
on  design, tires, operational purpose, steering
and frame geometry, the tolerances can  range
up to 10  millimeters. For  optimal suspension
function, however, the maximum deviation
of front and rear wheel tracks should be  no
more than 2 millimeters. Excessive track off-
set  can negatively impact handling, steering
stability (headshaking), tracking, and  steering
precision. —
The simplest method for correcting track off-
set  is shimming the  rear wheel in the  swing
arm. This requires producing new distance
bushings for aligning the wheel with the front
wheel. Note that if its alignment to the output
gear is correct, the position of the chain wheel
may not  be changed.
The wheel must be  correctly distanced be-
tween the  chain wheel mount and  the  brake
disk side, or  the  sprocket must be brought to
its original position by machining material off
or  by shimming it. This type of work should
only be  performed by experienced mecha-
nics in well-equipped garages or  workshops.

### 13. Chain Reaction
The  position of the swing arm pivot point,
thrust and  chain drive dimensions are  three
factors resulting in another phenomenon
that impacts suspension and  suspension
behavior.
It is  a well-known fact  that when a  motorcy-
cle accelerates, the front wheel will rise. Me-
chanics call this process dynamic axle load
change; motorcyclists simply call it a "whee-
lie.”

### It
will
not
only
make
the
front
wheel
float
up  in the air, but the rear  frame will  also want
to dip hard.

In a rebound state, the swing arm is swung out
at an  angle of approx. 8 degree (D).  The force
line  of the drive (C) runs considerably lower
than the swing arm  pivot point which is sub-
stantially higher (B) than the rear axle. This dif-
ference produces a swing arm rebound moment
during acceleration, which, in turn, counteracts
the dynamic axle load change. The leverage ef-
fect of the chain pull (A) is relatively minor in
this position due  to the small distance from the
swing arm  pivot point to the upper chain run
and is overlapped by the long lever from the
driving force line  (C) to the swing arm  pivot
point.
When compressed, the swing arm  pivot point
(B)  will lower, the swing arm’s angle (D) de-
creases to about 2 degree. The chain force will
pull the rear wheel into  the suspension due  to
the now increased distance (A) between upper
chain run  and swing arm  pivot point and the
lower leverage effect of the force line of the
drive (C).  Because the swing arm's rebound
moment is very small, the dynamic axle load
change can  cause the motorcycle to bottom
out right down to the stop.
65

The reason for this is that 100% of the  load is
now on  the rear wheel.
Another force counteracts —  stronger or  wea-
ker  depending on  the  riding situation —  the
dipping in the  rear: The driving force in  mo-
torcycles with chain or  toothed belt drives.
The swing arm rises due to  the  thrust at  the
contact point of the  rear  wheel, which acts in

### the  direction of the  ride. Described in detail:
The driven rear wheel has  a tendency to  pass
the motorcycle from below because of the in-
cline position (angle of  inclination) of  the
swing arm  and the inertia of the machine. The
result is that the swing arm  will  rebound light-
ly and thus act  as  a  support for  the  suspen-
sion spring in the  shock.
This does not  look substantially different in
conventional universal drives without torque
shock. The best examples are  the older BMW
boxers that severely heaved up  out  of  their
suspension when accelerating. To  eliminate
On purebred racing
bikes such as  the  Ya-
maha YZF R7,  the
position of the swing
arm  pivot point in
the frame can  be
changed by using
different inserts. This
allows the swing
arm’s angle of incli-
nation to increase or
decrease without
changing the ride
height in the  rear
and thus, the geome-
try and balance.
the  troublesome movements caused by the
long suspension travel, current universal
drive machines use  so-called torque shocks
for  minimizing or  entirely neutralizing the
drive’s rebound force.
However, the  rebound effect in  chain-drive
machines will only occur if the  swing arm
pivot point is  higher than the  rear axle. For
only then will  the swing arm, which braces it-
self  in  the  swing arm pivot point against the
vehicle masses, raise the rear. The angle of in-
clination is a  result of the difference between
the heights of the swing arm  and the rear  axle,
and  the swing arm length. If wheel and  swing
arm axle are roughly aligned, i.e., during
strong compression, there will neither be a re-
bound moment at  the  swing arm nor  an  im-
pact on  the  suspension.
If the machine dips even lower, which will re-
sult  in the  swing arm pivot point being lower
than the  rear axle, the  effect of  the  driving

force will reverse. The machine will then be
drawn even more into the  suspension and
may bottom out  all the  way to the  stop.
This effect is very unwelcome, which is why
manufacturers attempt to  counteract it  as
much as  possible when designing the  swing
arm pivot point, position and  diameter of the
chain wheels, and the  swing arm's angle of
inclination. Particularly motorcycles that are
ridden with heavier loads and  are  already sag-
ging in their starting position, are  often com-
pressed right down to  the  stop when accele-
rating, due  to the dynamic axle load change.
For this  reason, too, it is important that nega-
tive suspension travel and with it, the  swing
arm inclination angle must be correctly adju-
sted with heavy loads. Depending on  the type
of motorcycle, the swing arm’s angle of incli-
nation in the  extended state is approx. 5 de-
grees (road bikes, choppers) to 10 degrees (for
sport bikes) to  15  degrees (motocross/endu-
ro).
In order to  neutralize the  chain pull between
the pinion and  the chain wheel, which coun-
teracts the spring force and  compels the swing
arm to  compress, you would have to  guide
the  chain through the  swing arm pivot point,
which is impossible in conventional suspen-
sion designs.
In  order to  minimize the  undesirable com-
pression reaction, the distance from the chain
to  the  swing arm pivot point must be  mini-
mized. This will ensure that even with mo-
torcycles that are  already heavily sagging, the
driving forces keep the  rear high enough to

68
counteract dynamic axle load change.
The  disadvantage of such a chain drive: Due
to  their small diameters, small pinions/chain
wheels wear out the chain and  the few enga-
ging teeth quickly. Chain drive play must be
kept very large because the bottom chain run
sags a  lot  under engine thrust and often has
to  be absorbed by an  additional guide roller.
The slide bars mounted on  the swing arm  also
wear out  quickly due to the chain contacting
them in the  rebound state.
Thanks to  an  ingenious drive-train geometry
dreamed up  by mechanics, sport and racing
bikes, in particular, can be adjusted to  hand-
le  well and have good mechanical grip. In
order to tune the  rebound force during acce-
leration for  each route and rider, the  swing
arm  bearing has variable adjustment positions
in the frame in almost all  racing bikes.
However, this also has its  limits. If the re-
bound moment is too  high, the rear  will  shoot
out  all the way to the stop, the wheel will lose
downforce going over bumps, and slide out
from under. When accelerating out of curves,
the goal must be to  hold the  rear approxima-
tely within the  N2  negative suspension travel
range measured and  adjusted in a static state.
This requires that the  centrifugal forces not
cause the machine to bottom out too far in the
maximum banked position, causing it to enter
the  driving force’s neutral or  even negative
range of influence. For this  reason alone, the
suspension travel actually used was substan-
tially reduced in racing.
When it comes to optimizing suspension and
damping in  supersport machines, those who
take the function and the effects of the driving
force into consideration will find a  solution
much more quickly and systematically.

### 14.  Adjusting and

### Optimizing Geometry
and Center of Gravity

### Let’s get one  thing straight right off the bat:
There are  no  universally valid dimensions
and  settings for achieving optimal balance
and  geometry. Only systematic test  rides
can  show how the  motorcycle will  react
and  where the  best compromise can  be
found.
What was originally Conceived of for  racing
bikes can  also be applied to road bikes as well
as  touring bikes. Prerequisites for this  are,  of
course, adjustment options on  suspension
shocks and  forks.
_ IMPORTANT _
Since these modifications can  change ride be-
havior, they may only be applied to the extent
that they do  not  impair safety. This also in-
cludes checking the absolute smoothness and
freedom of  movement of  the  steering and
wheels with the suspension at  maximum
compression.
To  do  this, after modifying the  fork, remove
the  springs or  remove the  fork caps from the
stanchions, press the  fork completely down
and make sure that the  wheel, mud guard,
brake calipers and lines have a  minimum di-
stance of 10  mm  over the entire steering mo-
vement range from adjacent components
attached to the frame.
Conventional forks (RSU) may only be inser-
ted  so  that the  dust cap of the  sliding pipe
does not  hit  against the  bottom fork bridge
with maximum compressed suspension.
For USD forks, make sure that if the ride
height is changed, the  stanchion diameter in
the  clamping area is the  same across the  en-
tire clamp width. Outside the clamp area, the

stanchions are  often machined to a very flat,
barely visible conical angle. Therefore, mark
the  area within the  bridges and measure it
with a sliding caliper. The clamping diameter
in  the handlebar area can also vary and
should be measured.
In practice, the value for sensible changes in
the  front, usually shortening the  fork length,
ranges between 5 to  a maximum of  15 mm.
If the fork is  “lengthened,” i.e.,  pushed
downwards, make absolutely sure that the
brake lines are  not  stretched in the complete-
ly extended state of the suspension (during re-
bound). Otherwise, tearing and total brake
failure may result.
Changing the shock absorber length will  also
automatically change the chain tension. If the
rear is lifted, the  chain sag  will increase due
to the swing arm’s stronger angle of inclinati-
on.  Do  not  re-tension because the  chain sag
will  decrease considerably when the suspen-
sion compresses down to  the  alignment line
of the  rear  wheel, swing arm pivot point, and
the  pinion pivot point.
A  chain adjusted too  tightly will strain and
eventually damage the  pivot points of gear

### shaft and rear wheel. The best test  method:
Have two people sit on  the motorcycle or  use
a  tightening strap to  press the  motorcycle
down far  enough so  that the  three above-
mentioned points are  aligned. In  this state,
you should be able to  move the  chain up  or
down with slight pressure by about a  centi-
meter. The measuring point is  exactly bet-
ween the  pinion and  the  rear  wheel axle.
Changes to the vehicle level should be made
in small steps of no  more than 3 millimeters.
Those who proceed in  centimeter steps will
have a  hard time finding the best adjustment.
An  example of how much steering geometry
can  change: If a motorcycle with a 1400 mm
wheel base is lifted by about 24  millimeters
in the  rear, the steering head angle will  be an
entire degree steeper. The caster will  be shor-
tened by about 6 millimeters.
A change in  ride height has  a  greater influ-
ence on  the steering head angle and  caster in
motorcycles with a  short wheel base than in
machines with a  longer wheel base.
ADJUSTMENT TIP: The change in ride height
is measured in the rear  from the middle of the
axle to the rear  frame ina   line with an  approx.
15  degree incline toward the  front. When
measuring the  fork, measure the  distance
from the bottom fork bridge to the wheel axle
or to a suitable measuring point on  the sliding
pipe.
If you  make a change and cannot feel  any  no-
ticeable benefits, perform the next step to  im-
prove the  adjustment. If you reach the  maxi-
mum possible adjustment limit without im-
proving ride behavior, you  should always re-
turn to the original settings.
Lowering or  lifting the machine via the spring
preload should only be  used as  a  temporary
measure by a small range of  a maximum of 3
millimeters (too  little ground clearance or too
high a seat) because doing this will also chan-
ge the  basic suspension settings.
The rear  frame has  numerous options for

### lifting its  level:

### 1.  Lengthening the suspension shock (mono-
shock) using the  threaded spindles attached
to  the  frame or  fine threads on  the  shock
mount.
69

In order to check the freedom and smoothness of movement of a completely compressed fork, the
fork caps (left photo) must be removed. With a completely compressed fork (see arrows in right
photo), the distance to all components attached to the frame, such as  the cylinder head cover
(arrows), should be at least 10 mm.
at a  time per  test. Lengthening the  shock ab-
sorber too  much can, in some linkage
systems, especially ones with short lever
lengths, produce undesirable changes in the
suspension and damping progression curve.

### 2.  Changing the  linkage, usually by  using

### shorter or  longer trailing arms. But be careful:
Improperly changing the  linkage can negati-
vely impact the suspension because even mi-
nute changes in kinetics can  change the  pro-
gression curve in such a way that the suspen-
sion system is stressed digressively or too  pro-
gressively.

### 3.  Machines with off-center drop-outs (some
models from Kawasaki, Triumph, etc.) can be
changed by positioning the  axle in the  upper
or  lower part over a  range determined by the
chain tension.
The table below provides information on
which geometric values will  change. The cri-
teria listed under “Plus” will change in a  po-
sitive direction; the  reactions recorded under
"Minus" can result as  negative impact if the
limit is exceeded.
70
Using this  puzzle of adjustment options, any
rider can  adapt his or  her motorcycle to  meet
any  individual needs. Your goal should be to
tune your motorcycle in  such a  way that it
rides safely and neutrally. Note: Not all  ma-
chines will respond equally to the  same
modifications.

### |. Lifting the  rear:
Doing this  will reduce caster, steering head
angle (steeper), and due to  the increased
swing arm angle of  inclination, the  wheel
base (the latter, by a bit). This increased angle
of inclination will also result in  a  change in
reaction to the driving forces, and  thereby the
suspension behavior (see Chapter 13). The
center of gravity will be higher.
Plus: Easier turning, better handling, less  sag-
ging in the rear  suspension when accelerating
and more ground clearance. Heavier load on
the  front wheel, therefore less lift  at  high
speeds and, possibly, better ride stability in
fast  curves despite a  “shorter” steering
geometry.
Minus: Less grip when accelerating,
squirrelly tracking, wobbly curve behavior,

Lifting the rear:
Lengthening the shock absorber will raise
the  vehicle rear  and center of gravity.

### Lowering the rear:
Shortening the shock absorber will lower the
rear  and the center of gravity.

and unstable braking behavior (rear wheel
will lift off earlier). Uncomfortable seating
position on  roads because of increased load
on  the  arms.

### Il. Lowering the  rear:
The steering head angle will become flatter
and the  caster longer, the  wheel base some-
what longer, the  swing arm angle of inclina-
tion smaller, and  the  center of gravity lower.
Plus: Lower seating position, more stable
tracking, better braking stability.
Minus: Less ground clearance, worse hand-
ling and  turning, tendency to  understeer,
higher lift  at  higher speeds due to  the  lower
front axle load.

### III.  Raising the front:
This can  only be done if the fork legs stick out
of the  bridges. Results: Caster and steering

head angle will increase, the wheel base will
lengthen negligibly. The center of gravity will
be raised.
Plus: More ground clearance, better tracking,
more brake stability.
Minus: Handles worse, tends to  understeer,
higher seating position, less front axle load.

### IV.  Lowering the front:
To do so, the fork legs are  pushed through the
bridges. This will shorten caster, wheel base
and seating height; the  steering head angle
will  become steeper. The center of gravity will
sink, ground clearance will be less.
Plus: Better handling and turning, heavier
load on  front.
Minus: Less ride and brake stability, reduced
ground clearance, wobbly curve behavior,
greater load on  the  arms, less  grip when ac-
celerating.

### V. Tilting around the vehicle center:
To  do  this, the  motorcycle is rotated around
the  center point between the  front and rear
axles by lifting it in the rear  and  lowering it in
the front (or vice versa) at the same time. The
center of gravity will remain almost unchan-
ged; depending on  the  tilting direction, geo-
metry and ride characteristics will  Change as
described in points | through III.
Plus: The center of gravity position, seating
height and ground clearance will hardly
change at all.
VI.  Changing the  height of the  center

### of gravity:
To do this, the fork and  shock are  lengthened
or  shortened equally. Changing the center of
gravity will affect handling, ride stability,
ground clearance and curve stability. Gene-
ral  instructions will not  make sense here be-
cause each change has  its  own advantages
and disadvantages that have to  be  weighed
according to  operational purpose and road.
From a  purely theoretical point of view, a
lower center of gravity will  improve handling
in alternating curves, as  well as  brake stabili-
ty.
A  high center of gravity will result in  more
ground clearance, higher curve speeds and
improved grip when accelerating because of
the  smaller lean angle and thus larger tire
contact patch.
Wide tires force a greater lean angle than thin-

### ner  tires at the  same curve speed. Compare:
The three tires and  the varying B to A angles.
The reason: With wider tires, the tire  contact
patch is shifted out  of the track, i.e., the
longitudinal line of the  motorcycle. In  the
right-hand curves, the  line will  wander to the
right which will make the  center of gravity
shift left, i.e., to the  outside of the  curve.
This shift requires the  higher lean angle in
order to  counteract the  centrifugal forces
righting the  motorcycle. The  additionally ne-
cessary lean angle depends on  the  height of
the center of gravity.
Wide tires produce a greater lean angle at the
same curve speed than narrow tires.

### 15.  Tire Technology

### Details
Black, wide, good: Modern tires are  a
popular and  often sweeping means of re-
medying suspension problems.
ires  are  the first suspension element be-
| sees motorcycle and  road performing
all  kinds of tasks. First of all, they have
to transmit circumferential forces (the forces
that occur when braking and accelerating) sa-
fely to  the  road. Secondly, brief jolts, cross
grooves and bumps are  supposed to  be  cu-
shioned by the  tires before they are  introdu-
ced  to the chassis via the suspension compo-
nents. In  doing so,  they must also overcome
enormous lean angles stably and while pro-
viding perfect feedback. In short: Highest de-
mands which can  only be fulfilled using the
most modern technology and the  best mate-
rials.
Consequently, radial technology launched by
Michelin at  the  end of the  80's has  finally
found its  way into the  lower middle class.
With this  design, almost all  demands can  be
met  under one umbrella: Stability, grip, com-
fort, and  handling. Naturally, since then they
have been modified and  refined by all manu-
facturers according to their own technologies
and  philosophy.
Tire manufacturers Metzeler and Pirelli, for
example, have equipped their tires with a
zero-degree steel belt and  are  using this tech-
nology on  the front wheel, too, in order to fur-
ther optimize inherent damping capability
and ride stability.
In  1999, Michelin itself finally came out  with
a combination of racing and  road tire, called
the  radial delta structure. Tires now exhibi-
ted  even better handling, were more stable
and had more grip —  even on  wet roads: Sili-
cic acid, called silica in technical jargon, has
replaced carbon black, the  function carrier
and filler, guaranteeing noticeably better trac-
tion on  wet  roads with less wear.
Driven by active competition, all  major ma-
nufacturers are  developing new and better
road rubber. It has  been a  race that motorcy-
clists have most benefited from. Still, the
question of which tire performs best on  which
motorcycle is far from answered.
Of course, such an  answer is also  subjective
to  a  certain extent and can really only be
found by you riding your own motorcycle,
from your own experience or  from what you
glean from comprehensive and detailed tire
tests published by trade magazines.
For advice, you  can  also refer to brochures is-
sued by tire manufacturers which describe the
operational purposes and the  essential fea-
tures of the various tire  types.
After all,  all-around tires are  a  thing of the
past. Nowadays, all companies are  manufac-
turing special touring, sports, or  supersport
tires.
fhen changing tire brands or  tire
/ types, you  may experience drama-
Z /   tic changes in  ride behavior. In par-
ticular, tires designed for  racing can throw
many road bike suspensions for a  loop. And
| mean that in the truest sense of the word. The
reason for this  is that racing tires are  primari-
ly designed for  maximum grip and optimal
handling. Ride stability or  comfort are  at the
very bottom of the performance specification
list.  The extremely stable and  stiff tire casing,
i.e., the  sub-structure made up  of  synthetic
cords or  plies, can cause extreme oscillations
at high speeds. Changing the frame geometry
or  adjusting the  suspension/damper tuning
can  often solve these problems or  at least mi-
nimize them.

# n addition to the rubber compound and the
casing design, one of the  essential design
=  features is the curvature of the tread. It de-
termines whether the  motorcycle will handle
well -  easily but a little squirrelly or more slug-
gishly and  balky, but with good tracking sta-
bility.
Tires with angular cross-sections and  excel-
lent handling characteristics have the  disad-
vantage of faster wear on  straight-aways due
to  their small contact patch, and of greater
susceptibility to  bumpy surfaces and  patched
spots.
Tires with a  flatter design manufactured
mainly for  touring bikes are  considerably
more stable, and  they provide more inherent
damping capability due to  their contact
patch. Their disadvantage is that the  further
the tire contact patch is from the  longitudinal
axis, the  more the  machine’s center of gravi-
ty will  shift to the outside of the curve. In order
to  balance this shift, the  machine must be
banked more. This will make the  machine
harder to handle in alternating curves and  re-
quire more steering force, and the  bike will
tend to  understeer in curves.
On  front wheel tires, a major deviation from
the  longitudinal axis will increase the  bike’s
righting moment when braking during ban-
king. When this  happens, the tire wants to ro-
tate around the  steering head bearing to  the
inside of the  curve using the  offset leverage
between tire  contact patch and  steering axle.
This rotational movement to the  inside of the
curve will  also right the machine from its ban-

The simplest design: Under the  tread, diagonal
tires have numerous cross plies that run  from
one  tire bead to the next. This  tire design is
mostly used on  inexpensive, relatively slow ma-
chines.

from the  rider. In this  case, the  geometric va-

~~   pressure by about 0.2  bar  in the front and
0.3  bar  in the  back. This will lower tire
temperature and  consequently, wear.
Never ride without valve caps. Otherwi-
se,  a  loss  of pressure could occur at  high
speeds because the  valve can  be pushed out
of its  seat against its  spring resistance by the
centrifugal force.
Before buying tires, do  some research in
trade magazines about the  quality of tires
authorized by and entered in the vehicle
registration document. Select a tire  that will

best meet your personal needs and
requirements.

of a  ride. Accelerate carefully in  curves be-

rature for building up  a good grip
Technical terms in tire  technology
Shimmy effect: These are  torsional vibrations
around the steering axis at a frequency of ap-
proximately four beats per  second. Depen-
ding on  tire design and diameter, shimmy can
occur in the  speed range of 60  to  100 km/h.
The oscillations are  noticeable in  the  hand-
lebars and, riding one-handed or  even no-
handed, they can become so  strong that the
handlebars oscillate from one stop to  the
other.
Possible causes for shimmying may be the tire
casing (out-of-round tread, heavy overlapping
at the butt-joint of the casing plies resulting in
varying levels of stiffness when rolling), poor
balancing, or  insufficient profile design. The
dreaded effect can increase with decreasing
tread depth.

### Street racing tires with racing technology:
The usual wraparound zero-degree belt
(4) runs over the radial casing (5). As
an  additional tread stabilizer, two
more bias-belt layers (2 and 3) are
placed crosswise above the casing.
The rubber compound (1) con-
tains a large percentage of silica
for the best possible grip on
wet surfaces.
Kickback: Kickback is also a  torsional oscil-
lation around the  steering axis; it has, how-
ever, completely different causes than shim-
mying. Headshaking, also called kickback,
occurs when the front of the bike is very light
(accelerating, riding at  high speeds) and  jolts
from the  road are  transferred to  the  steering
system. Incorrect balancing, suspension/dam-
ping tuning that  is too  hard, or  poor spring re-
sponse characteristics can also cause kick-
back.
As  a  direct damping element between the
road and the  machine, the tire  has the task of
absorbing jolts as  effectively as  possible. For
this purpose, tire casing, bead apex and  tread
curvature are  tuned to provide inherent dam-
ping capability.
This problem plagues light and high-HP su-
persport bikes, in particular, and, in the  end,
only a  hydraulic steering damper can com-
pletely solve it.
Chunking: A term that is being used more and
more since the  launch of  300 km/h bikes.
Chunking happens when rubber tread pieces
detach from the  synthetic fiber belts in  the
tires. This can  occur when rubber and tire ca-
sing severely heat up  due to  the  brutal cir-
79

cumferential forces of these 300  km/h rockets.
In  most cases, the  forming of bubbles under
the  tread will  precede chunking. These bub-
bles can then break under further stress, de-
stroying the tire.
An  airtight layer in  the  tires called the  inner
lining will  prevent tire blowouts when such a
breakdown occurs. Damage caused by chun-
king can, however, also develop on  roller test
beds where the engine output is transferred to
the  heavy steel rollers by the  rear  wheel.
Chattering is a  high-frequency stutter of the
front wheel in curves, usually caused by su-
perimposed wheel suspension oscillation fre-
quencies not  absorbed by the  stiff tire  body.
This is  mainly the  case with tires designed
specifically for sport riding. The most effective
remedy is stiff low-speed damping in fork and
shock (mono-shock).
Tire slip describes variable wheel spinning. A
slip of up  to  10  percent can occur when ri-
ding at full  throttle on  the freeway.
This means that the tire circumference will
cover 110 meters for a distance of  100 meters
ridden, thus increasing tire  wear.
Casing: Consisting of  high-strength, rubber-
ized synthetic fibers such as  nylon, rayon or
aramide (carbon fibers), it forms the  founda-
tion of the tire.
Diagonal tires are  a  simple tire  design; they
have numerous cords running diagonally
from tire  bead to tire  bead.
Diagonal radial tires are  based on a tire body
designed with crossed plies. An  additional
80
belt  made up  of numerous layers of crossed
plies is placed on  the casing in the tread area
only.
With modern radial tires on  the  rear wheel,
often only one  casing running at a 90-degree
angle to the  riding direction is used.
Two casing layers arranged on  top  of  each
other usually provide sufficient stability for
the front wheel. They are  not  really arranged
radially, rather slightly diagonally, i.e.,  cross-
wise. é
In road tires, the belt placed on  the rear  wheel
casing is usually rolled onto the  casing as  a
zero-degree belt, which is then called
“  endless belt.” In  contrast, the  tread on  the
front wheel is stabilized by two or  more
criss-crossed layers.
This second design type is  also called bias
belt because the individual plies are ma-
chine-cut according to  their bias. The bias
greatly affects the stiffness and inherent dam-
ping capability of the tire.
A 45-degree bias, as  it is often used in racing
tires, will frequently decrease tracking stabi-
lity at high speeds.
That’s why most designs for  everyday use
have a  bias of about 25  to  35  degrees in the
ride direction, i.e.,  they are  usually arranged
in  a  longitudinal direction, thus improving
ride  stability and  the  inherent damping capa-
bility of the tire.

16. Pedal to  the Metal
Had enough of crowded country roads and
radar traps? Then your decision to get off
the  road and  onto the  racetrack is right on
the  money. More and  more, those commit-
ted to the fast lane are  now riding where
they belong. However, only those who pro-
perly tune their motorcycles for  riding hard
will  also have lasting fun  out  there. To  help
you  out, here are  a few  practical tips for tu-
ning your bike for recreational and  ama-
teur racing.
_PRACTCAL TIP_
Tips and  tricks for the  reight racetrack
set-up
Most suspension shocks (mono-shocks) and
forks on  mass-produced machines have
basic settings that are  only limitedly suitable
for the  racetrack. Normally designed for
road riding, they often lack stiff, precise
compression damping and  sufficient spring
hardness (spring rate too  low). But  if you ra-
dically exploit the  adjustment range, you
can  still  burn up  some serious rubber with
amazing lap times.
Basically, you  have to  ride with much more
compression damping in both front and back
than on  roads. Do  not  even shy away from a
completely closed adjustment mechanism if
that provides you with more stability, more
grip and ground clearance.
The disadvantage of this is that the  motor-
cycle will  become more squirrelly on  bumpy
surfaces. High performance big bikes in par-
ticular are  notorious for headshaking or "kick-
back" when used in  connection with super-
sport racing tires or  even slicks.
That’s why a  low-friction, adjustable steering
damper belongs on  any supersport motor-
cycle which is being tuned for the  racetrack
or  even sporty road riding.
The damping force of a steering damper must
be  adjusted based on  type of use  and road.
For  slow routes with narrow curves or  for  ri-
ding in the rain, too  much damping force will
interfere with steering precision; the machine
will wobble and have to  be  constantly cor-
rected. This calls for  reducing the  damping
force. The steering damper should be  adju-
sted so  that kickback will merely occur as  a
light twitch in the  handlebars. More is unne-
cessary and, as  described above, would im-
pair accuracy when riding at high speeds, and
handling during quick lean angle changes.
| IMPO
Never adjust the  steering damper while ri-
ding! With some models, the  damping force
can  be increased to the point where it almost
blocks the  steering, which can  lead to wipe-
outs. While making adjustments with the bike
on  the stand, check the damping force by mo-
ving the handlebars back and forth very
quickly.
When installing clamps on  the  fork, make
sure that the clamping bolts are  correctly tigh-
tened. If the  clamps slip while you are  riding
or after a strong steering movement caused by
kickback, the  steering may also lock up.  The
damper must be free to  move across the  en-
tire  steering movement and may not  touch
the  frame, fork or  other components in  any
position.
TIP: If extreme headshaking occurs that is al-
most uncontrollable, a brief but strong tap on
the  foot brake will help. This makes the  ma-
chine dip abruptly in the front, which will  sta-
bilize the  steering because of the  increased
front axle load. Obviously, this will only work
on  straight roads, and  then only if no  one is
“tailgating” you.
An  additional tip: When riding tricky roads,
shift as  much of your body weight as  possible
81

over the  tank to  the  front, and apply as  little
steering force as  possible. Each pull on  the
handlebars may unintentionally — trigger
headshaking. Also, too  loose a steering head
bearing adjusted with some play can  increa-
se  kickback tendencies. A lightly preloaded
bearing will help reduce the  kickback pro-
blem, but  it cannot prevent it altogether.
Only minor changes are  made to the rebound
damping for use  at the  racetrack. Usually, an
increase in  damping is only necessary if the
damper oil  heats up  and becomes less  effec-
tive as  a result. A lot of rebound damping will
make the motorcycle appear more stable
when "pressing” it at  standstill; however, it
will  also limit the bike's banking freedom be-
cause the machine is held too  low  in the sus-
pension and  is not able to rebound quickly or
far enough after a  bump.
In contrast, on  roads with hard, fast  changes
in  lean angle, increased rebound damping
can  contribute to  greater stability on  the  chi-
canes. This applies especially if the compres-
sion damping is adjusted too  soft and does not
build up the  necessary resistance for preven-
ting the  machine from bottoming out  all  the
way to  the  stop. An  accordingly sudden re-
bound from the hard spring range can  be pre-
vented by higher rebound damping.
A further advantage of greater rebound dam-
ping is that, in dicey situations such as  acce-
lerating hard out  of curves, the dreaded
"highsider," which is  when the  rider is  un-
controllably tossed up,  is minimized. When
this happens, the  machine will at  first re-
bound when the rear  wheel slips, but as  soon
as  the wheel grips again, the  suspension will
be completely compressed so  that the spring
is compressed almost right down to the  stop.
The result is that the  rear of the  motorcycle
will shoot upwards like  a  rocket. The higher
the  rebound damping force is set  at this  mo-
ment, the  slower and less  dangerously rider
A cable tie wrapped around the piston rod will
allow you  to see  how far down the motorcycle
compresses and how much room remains
before the stop.
and  machine will be jolted upwards.
The spring preload, on  the other hand, should
be adjusted above the values for  road riding.
That means that negative suspension travel
can  be shortened from approximately 15  mil-
limeters to  about 10  millimeters (without
rider) for the  track. Particularly with relative-
ly soft mass-produced shock absorbers, this
correction makes sense for improving ground
clearance and handling. Never preload the
spring so  strongly that the  rear without the
rider (N1) will rebound all the  way up  to  the
stop. Otherwise, the  rear wheel could sud-
denly lose traction with such a spring setting
when accelerating hard over bumps.
Harder springs for the forks are  advisable in
any case. Even if the  bike weight has  been
decreased (removal of  headlights, light fai-
ring), compared to  the  factory trim, braking
will  be much more brutal than in road riding,
usually forcing the fork to  block. The  result is
that the  bike will tend to bounce, and no  lon-
ger  sufficiently transmit the  braking forces.
83

More oil  in the  fork may make it possible to
achieve the  desired spring progression. De-
pending on  design, the  air  cushion can be
changed to  “hard” in  10  millimeter incre-
ments (see  air cushion table).
Arguably the  best solution is to  use  a shock
absorber (mono-shock) tuned specifically for
racing, and modifying the telescopic fork for
a stable damping set-up.
The quasi-series 600 supersport class shows
just how successful such modifications can
be.  Compared to  the  series set-up, a  perfect-
ly tuned suspension system will  allow the ma-
chine to shave more than a second from each
race minute.
The fact  that  tires have also dramatically im-
proved when it comes to  traction and beha-
vior at  the  stability limit is an  enormous ad-
vantage. Also, stiff suspension will provide
the  rider with better control and transparent
feedback. Consequently, you will not  only
ride  faster, but also more safely.
A widespread problem when using purebred
racing tires is the annoying chattering, a high-
frequency front wheel stutter in  curves.
Usually, only very stiff low-speed damping in
the  fork and suspension shock can remedy
this. Chattering is mostly a superimposition of
oscillation frequencies in  the  wheel suspen-
sion that  are  not  absorbed by the  stiff  casing
of racing tires.
In  order to  nip  high-frequency stutter in  the
bud, the hydraulic damping resistance should
respond to  even the  smallest of  suspension
movements.
Even though these oscillations affect the front
wheel, this annoying problem can also be
triggered by the rear  wheel and transmitted to
the front by the  chassis. Even loose assembly
parts such as  fairings, unstable rear  frames or
mufflers can  trigger frequencies that  may
result in  chattering. Precise balancing and
faultless truing of tires can  also eliminate this
problem.
On the  other hand, oscillations around the
steering axis when using racing tires can  often
be  influenced by correcting the  geometry.
Suspension/damper tuning that is too hard
can also be  responsible since it allows the
bumps and stimuli to  be  transferred to  the
chassis unfiltered.
Steering geometry is a further means for opti-
mization. During extensive test  rides, targeted
modifications can be  made to  the  bike to
adapt it to  surface type and riding style.
TIP: Frequently, the soft rubber compounds in
supersport tires just fall  to  pieces when used
on  the  racetrack. In the  shoulder area of the
tire, a  thumb-wide strip tends to  form on
which the rubber is heavily torn. The most fre-
quent cause: the  centrifugal force makes the
motorcycle dip right down to  the  stop when
riding fast  curves. This hardens the  suspen-
sion so  that the tire  rubber will become over-
loaded and break apart.
That is why the suspension and  damping set-
tings in  racing should be  adjusted in  such a
way that the stop will  not  be touched. To do
this, a  cable tie  is attached to the  piston rod;
if the  spring is too  soft, the  cable tie  will vir-
tually be  pressed into the  plastic bumper. In
the  ideal scenario, after a  few fast laps, ap-
prox. one to two millimeters of air should be
left between cable tie and  stop. You can  also
easily check this  by applying a  bit of bearing
grease to the damper rod.
After the  test  ride, a small grease ring should
still  be visible in front of the stop. If the grea-
se  has  disappeared or  is sticking to  the  end
cap of the  shock absorber, this indicates that

the  suspension travel was completely exhau-
sted. If the  negative suspension travel is cor-
rectly adjusted, the  motorcycle must be  pre-
vented from sagging so far by mounting a har-
der spring or  adding more compression dam-
ping.
A further cause of damaged tires and heavy
bouncing when exiting curves is too  soft a
compression damping setting in mass-produ-
ced  suspension shocks (mono-shocks). In this
case, then, adjust the  setting to  make it “har-
der.”
Too  much rebound damping will  also force
the  rear  wheel suspension to  block. Then the
machine will be  unable to  rebound fast
enough after a bump, and  bounce even more
heavily into  the  hard suspension range when
going over the  next one, thus destroying the
tire  rubber.
An  ugly side effect is that the  motorcycle will
start to  handle badly and understeer because
of the  low rear end (flat steering head angle,
long caster).
Insensitive compression damping that  is ad-
justed too  hard can  mechanically overload
the  tires and ruin them. This will also be-
come noticeable in the bike's uncomfortable
and “stuttering” suspension behavior.
The  rear end will then virtually bump over the
asphalt and lose traction when rapidly tur-
ning on  the  brake (unloaded rear wheel).
Note: Stiff is  stable, but  a  rock-hard setting
causes instability.

### 17.  Practical Tips for

### Road Use
Getting ready for the  big tour? Taking a
friend along with you  to the ends of the
world? Here are  a few  important tips on
the  right adjustments, loading and  tires for
that road bike vacation and  unmitigated
fun  in the sun.
Adjust the spring preload for your load. Par-
ticularly in  the  rear, an  additional load will
place considerably more weight on  the  sus-
pension system. The N2  negative suspension
travel should not  exceed the 60% mark at full
load. Therefore, increase the  spring preload
to  the  maximum value and, if possible, take
further measures to  stabilize the  bike by ad-
justing the compression damping in  the
"hard" direction.
If the  motorcycle sags too  low into the  rear
suspension, handling and ground clearance
will also suffer. If the  problem cannot be eli-
minated with the  standard adjustment me-
chanism, there is only one remedy: a  harder
spring in the shock absorber (mono-shock).
If your motorcycle is equipped with level ad-
justment in the rear, use  its options and  make
the  motorcycle handle better by raising the
suspension. Because when the  rear sags so
low, caster and  steering head angle will also
contribute to worse handling. Moving the fork
up through the bridges to achieve the original
geometry will not  make much sense because
it will  considerably reduce ground clearance.
Before taking a trip with a  passenger or  with
a  lot of luggage, increase the tire  pressure in
the rear  by 0.3  bar and  in the front by 0.2  bar.
This will increase tire  stability, decrease flex
and  slow down wear. Remember to lower the
tire  pressure again when riding alone becau-
se  otherwise traction and inherent damping
capability will  get worse.

If possible, stow heavy luggage in the  lower
part of the tank bag (tools, replacement parts,

### etc):
Before hitting the  road, you might want to go
for  a  test  ride with your passenger and load.
It  will help you get  used to  the  increased
weight, usually worse ride characteristics,
and reduced ground clearance.

### 18.  Swinging Low in the

### Saddle
Options for lowering motorcycles.
Got short legs? No  problem. More and more
people are  getting bitten by the  motorcycle
bug, and  not  everyone wants to  make friends
with the  low-slung choppers. The vertically
challenged who decide in  favor of  a  sport
bike, naked bike or  even an  enduro despite a
smaller body also have options for  lowering
their seating height to  a  better height for ma-
neuvering. Reducing the  seat cushion height
by up to three centimeters is one  of them. The
disadvantage is that the  seat will not  be  as
comfortable, and  jars and  jolts will not  be ab-
sorbed as  well.
The simplest method for adjusting height con-
sists of  reducing the  spring preload on  the
fork and the  shock absorber (mono-shock) to
about 50% of negative suspension travel. This
is a  solution that a  lightweight rider of up  to
60  kg will be  able to  live  with comfortably
without the  suspension bottoming out. The
disadvantages are  that ground clearance in
curves and over obstacles will be  limited. If
the bike is loaded down with luggage for a va-
cation, the  preload must be increased accor-
dingly.
Installing shorter shocks and  fully inserting
the  fork legs. The  advantage is that  the  mo-
torcycle will  not bottom out so quickly, but re-
main comfortable. The disadvantage is that
ground clearance will be  reduced. In  this
case, the  tips on  safety described in  Chapter
14  should be observed.
Installing a  modified linkage on  the  central
shock absorber (mono-shock). Advantages
and  disadvantages are  the  same as  for  using
shorter shocks.

This will  make you  comfortable —  tuning op-

### tions for  lightweight riders:
A valid complaint: Why are  motorcycle ma-
nufacturers not  offering any  custom suspen-
sion kits? In an  era  dictated by customization,
motorcycles are  still  delivered with one-size-
fits-all basic tuning settings and that's that.
But what to do if lightweight riders almost fall
out  of the  saddle when riding over bumpy
surfaces? .
If fork and  shock absorber are  equipped with
adjustment mechanisms, anyone can  tune his
or  her damping.

### 1.  Reduce compression damping.

### 2.  Reduce rebound damping. You  should do
this  in  small steps and  then test  each adjust-
ment.

### 3.  Adjust negative suspension travel, i.e.,
spring preload, to the  rider’s weight.

### 4.  If necessary, reduce fork oil  viscosity, oil
level, and length of the  preload bushings.

### 5.  You may need to  install a  softer spring in
the rear  suspension shock (mono-shock). You
can  calculate the right spring weight using the
rider's weight and the  motorcycle specifica-
tions provided in the  OEM documentation.

Problems in the front wheel suspension

### Problems

### Possible Causes
Fork does not  respond well, noti-
ceably high starting force when
pressing from the zero position.
Uncomfortable on  bad  roads,
jolts are  transferred to steering
and  chassis; headshaking tends to
occur when accelerating or  dri-
ving at high speeds on  bumpy
surfaces. Poor front wheel
tracking on  bumpy surfaces,
wheel tends to hop.
¢  Compression damping too  high
particularly in low speed range.
¢  Fork tubes assembled in twisted
position.
¢  Too  much mechanical friction in
mounting points of sliding pipe.

### Solutions
¢  Decrease compression setting. If
necessary, use  lower viscosity fork
oil.
¢  Loosen clamps on  the  axle, bot-
tom  out fork and tighten clamp.
*  Disassemble fork, polish surfa-
ces,  install low-friction radial
shaft seals.
Front end uncomfortable on  bad
road surfaces, transfers jolts di-
rectly to chassis, front wheel
tends to hop and  cause headsha-
king. Even when braking, mo-
torcycle dips very little, awkward
to turn, tends to understeer,
overall hard to  handle.
¢  Fork springs too  hard. This
makes the  bike too  high in the
front (harder to  handle).
¢  Compression damping too  high
in both high- and  low-speed
range.
¢  Fork oil level too high, makes
suspension effect too
progressive.
¢  Measure and  adjust negative
suspension travel with and  with-
out  rider. If necessary, install sof-
ter fork springs.
¢  Decrease compression setting. If
necessary, use  lower-viscosity fork
oil.
¢  Reduce fork oil  level.
Motorcycle dips fast and  far
when braking, bottoms out  hard
on  bumps, wheel then tends to
hop. Front end moves dramatical-
ly up and  down during load
change. Rider does not  have
much of a feel  for the front
wheel. Very top-heavy when ri-
ding downhill.
Front end  has slow rebound res-
ponse, feels uncomfortable on
bumpy surfaces, poor steering
precision in alternating curves
and  over bumps. Tends to tramp
in front when braking hard.
¢  Compression damping too  soft.
¢  Fork springs too  soft.
¢  Fork oil level too low; causes
bike to  be too  low  in front.
¢  Rebound damping too  high.
Over bumpy surfaces, bike is too
low  in front, so  it doesn’t res-
pond sensitively to uneven surfa-
ces.
Front end rebound response is
too  fast, rebounds repeatedly,
unsteady when changing lean
angle and  over bumps, constant
movement in fork.
¢  Rebound damping too  low.
There may not  be enough hy-
draulic oil in the system because
of oil  loss.
¢  Increase rebound setting. If ne-
cessary, use  higher-viscosity fork
oil.
¢  Install harder fork springs.
¢  Check fork oil level; if neces-
sary, increase it.
¢  Decrease rebound setting. If
necessary, use  lower-viscosity fork
oil.
e  Increase rebound setting. If ne-
cessary, use  higher-viscosity fork
oil.  Check oil level.

Trouble-Shooting
Rear wheel suspension problems

### Problems

### Possible Causes

### Solutions
Rear wheel suspension does not
respond well, noticeably high
starting force when pressing
from the zero position. Uncom-
fortable on  bad  roads; jolts are
transferred to bike’s rear  and
entire chassis. This may cause
headshaking when accelerating
or  at high speeds on  bumpy
roads. Poor wheel control, rear
wheel tends to hop.
Rear wheel tends to chatter un-
controllably on  bumpy surfaces.
When braking and  shifting
down, rear wheel begins to
tramp slightly.
¢  Mechanical friction in suspensi-
on  system too  high.
¢  Too  much friction between
damper rod  and  bearing/sealing
ring.
¢  Compression damping too  high
in low speed range.
¢  Too  much play in suspension sy-
stem, noticeable when swing arm
is moving with an  unloaded rear
wheel. Maximum play measured
on  rear  axle: 2 millimeters.
¢  Too  little damping force in the
low speed range of rebound and
compression stroke. The damping
piston may also be leaking.
Bike rear  uncomfortable on  bad
road surfaces, unstable when
braking, absorbs bumps poorly,
wheel tends to hop. Motorcycle
has  little suspension compression
even over big bumps. Turns with
ease, but wobbly and  nervous.
¢  Spring preload much too  high
or support spring too  hard.
¢  Compression damping too  high
in both high- and  low-speed
range.
¢  Progression curves in linkage sy-
stem too  steep. May occur if
shock length is changed or  if dif-
ferent linkage is used.
¢  Ball-and-socket joints on  the
shock absorber or  linkage moun-
ting points stiff. (Clean, lubricate,
or  replace).
¢  Replace damper rod together
with mount and  seal.
¢  Decrease compression setting
or,  if necessary, disassemble shock
and  have damping assembly
system modified.
¢  While moving the swing arm,
check all mounting points for
possible vertical play and  replace,
if applicable. Parts from retrofit
specialists (Emil Schwarz, precisi-
on  bearings) are  usually better
than mass-produced parts.
e  Increase compression and  re-
bound damping
¢  Check and  adjust negative sus-
pension travel with and  without
rider.
*  Install softer spring.
¢  Reduce compression setting. If
necessary, have shock absorber
-  modified.
e  Check linkage system. Measure
progression curve.
Bike rear  compresses heavily over
bumps, bottoms out  all the way
to the stop with heavy load or  in
wavy curves. Rear wheel tends to
hop uncontrollably on  bumpy
surfaces. Bike rear does not  pro-
vide much of a  "feel" for the  rear
wheel, suspension movements
build up when accelerating in the
banked position, and  bike tends
to understeer. Has  relatively poor
handling and too  much move-
ment in alternating curves in the
road.
°  Spring preload much too  low  or
spring too  hard.
¢  Compression damping too  low
particularly in the  high-speed
range. In curves, centrifugal for-
ces  can  cause the shock absorber
to dip all the way down to the
stop (use cable tie as  check) using
the tire  as  suspension, conse-
quence: Heavy tire  bouncing. Is
often wrongly blamed on  re-
bound damping that is too  low.
¢  Check and  adjust negative sus-
pension travel with and  without
rider. If necessary, install harder
springs.
¢  Increase compression setting, if
necessary have shock absorber
modified for more damping.

Trouble-Shooting
Rear wheel suspension problems

### Problems

### Possible Causes Solutions
Slow rebound response in rear,
bounces right down to the  hard
spring range over washboard sur-
faces, then becomes uncomforta-
ble; wheel tends to hop on
bumpy road surfaces. Bike does
not  handle well and tends to un-
dersteer. Suspension movements
build up in wide curves with
bumpy surfaces, bike begins to
weave even on  straight-aways.
Bike rear rebound response is too
fast. Permanent imbalances in
curves and  over bumps, imbalan-
ced  when braking, places too
much load on  the fork. Poor stee-
ring precision, in bumpy curves,
when changing lean angle and
downhill.
¢  Decrease rebound setting. If
the setting range is too  small,
have shock. absorber modified.
A harder spring or  more com-
pression damping may also relie-
ve  the  problems.
¢  Rebound damping too  high.
Keeps the rear  too  deep in the
suspension, thereby changing the
geometry to make it more awk-
ward. If ridden over numerous
successive bumps, may be com-
pressed all the way to the stop,
which limits the  necessary impact
absorption. This wears down the
tire casing which can  then lose
stability.
*  Incredse rebound setting. If ne-
cessary, have shock absorber
modified.
¢  Rebound damping too  soft. The
energy stored during compressi-
on  is not  absorbed sufficiently.
Motorcycle rebounds beyond the
zero position, and  the sprung
masses reverberate.
When pushing, suspension is very
unresponsive and  sluggish. Very
uncomfortable on  bumpy surfa-
ces,  poor tracking. Suspension
movements tend to build up in
curves and  over bumps.
e  Decrease rebound and com-
pression setting.
¢  Compression and  rebound dam-
ping too  high. Necessary suspen-
sion movements are  blocked by
the  hydraulic system.

Trouble-Shooting
Additional problems in ride  behavior

### Problems
The  motorcycle’s steering is slug-
gish. Requires a great deal of
steering effort even when ma-
neuvering, steering feels mushy
and  indirect. Insufficient steering
precision in curves.

### Possible Causes
¢  Pressure in front tire too  low.
This creates too  large a contact
patch; the tread and  sidewalls
are  instable.
When accelerating, the banked
motorcycle tends to bounce. It re-
quires a lot of effort to steer the
bike along the desired line.
Motorcycle rights itself strongly
when braking. When this  hap-
pens, it takes a lot of strength to
counter steer along desired line.
Motorcycle wobbles along its lon-
gitudinal axis when riding slowly.
Constant corrections necessary to
keep the  motorcycle on  course.
Poor steering precision in curves.
Tends to weave at high speeds.
¢  Pressure in rear tire too  low;
tire flexes heavily under load; the
contact patch forms two raised
ridges on  the outsides of the tire
tread which rights the  bike and
forces it towards the outside of
the curve.
¢  Tire  pressure too  low.
¢  Tires with inappropriate con-
tours mounted, usually too  flat.

### Solutions
*  Increase tire  pressure according
to the  information provided by
the tire  manufacturer.
¢  Increase tire  pressure according
to the  information provided by
the tire  manufacturer.
*  Increase tire  pressure.
¢  Install tire type with lower
“righting moment."
¢  Steering damper has too  high a
damping force.
¢  Steering head bearing adjusted
too tightly.
¢  Steering head bearing bushings
damaged. Both will  prevent to-
tally smooth steering and  require
constant steering corrections.
¢  Adjust steering damper to be
softer or  replace with retrofit
component that has  less damping
force.
¢  Adjust steering head bearing
with less preload.
e  Replace defective bearing
bushings.
When accelerating or  on  bumpy | ¢  Steering head bearing has too
surfaces, headshaking tends to
occur. Rattling noises in the stee-
ring head area on  bad  roads and
when braking.
Increased engine vibrations in
the  handlebars.
much play. The  bearing’s frictio-
nal  resistance is reduced, which
will  have the same effect as  a
steering damper.
7
¢  Adjust steering head bearing
correctly so there is no  play.
Some motorcycle models require
the  bearing to be preloaded. Du-
ring this  process, the starting
force is determined and  set  using
a spring scale.

Werner ,,Mini” Koch
As  a  little boy in  1963, Werner “Mini” Koch
scored a  real  trophy by picking up the  broken
windshield from the  bike ridden by Yamaha team
rider Phil Read in the  legendary Schatten Curve
at the  Solitude racetrack. Ten  years later he retur-
ned home from his first motorcycle race comple-
tely surprised with his own trophy in hand, with
many more victories and winner’s wreaths to
come. So far, so  good; yet the  skilled motorcycle
mechanic wanted more. He wanted to  know
how things work. As a mechanic and  tuner for
two German champions, he gained a great deal
of experience, was well on  his way to  a career in
Grand Prix racing himself, missing the  German
championship title in the  super fast  SoS  one-cy-
linder division by only one point.
However, he chose to  dedicate his career prima-
rily to  being a test  rider and  editor for "Motorrad"
magazine. There is probably not  a  single mo-
torcycle that Mini has  not  tested and evaluated.
On  the  side, he designs and builds prototypes in
his  private workshop. These bikes provide even
the  large manufacturers with innovative inspira-
tion. His  very private interest, though, lies  in the
much praised "handling” of  a motorcycle. Where
is the  best setting, the  best compromise? When
do you feel comfortable on  the  bike? When do
you trust it?
These are  essential questions, because only
when they have been answered is riding a  mo-
torcycle truly fun. When and in which direction
does a screw have to  be turned so  that the  sus-
pension system functions? Thousands and  thou-
sands of test  kilometers away from MOTOR-
RAD’s actual test  center and infinite tests in his
own workshop have gained him valued skills
and experiences throughout the  courserof his ca-
reer. And because Mini is hitting 50  soon, it
would be a  shame if he did  not  share these expe-
riences directly and in great detail with all other
committed mo-
torcycle enthu-
siasts and experts,
even at the  risk
that someone
might say: Duh!
We've known
that for a  long
time. That may
be so,  but then
why hasn’t anyo-
ne  written it
~~  down?

### Die Autoren
Bernardus ,,Benny”

### Wilbers
Once upon a time there
was a young, up-and-co-
ming Dutch motorbike
racer. He  came in second
in the  Dutch nationals
and left to join the world
of Grand Prix racing.
There, he achieved rea-
sonable success. Howe-
ver,  once he recognized
that he didn’t have what
it takes to  be world champion, he retired from
the  sport. In the  end, he took a different road and
actually made it to the top.
In Germany, former racer Benny Wilbers is THE
champion when it comes to  suspension-system
technology. Twenty years ago  when he promoted
the  fork springs and  shock absorbers that he hel-
ped develop, he met  with skepticism and misun-
derstanding. But  all that changed —  on  the  Nord-
schleife of the famous Nurburgring of all  places —
when he  installed “his” suspension system in se-
veral motorbikes at no  charge so  that racers
could test  it. The majority of them were reluctant
to  give it back. And because his products convin-
ced  not  only those in the  racing world but were
also proven in tests sponsored by trade publica-
tions and  journals, his success became unstopp-
able.
Thus began the  dual career of Benny Wilbers. As
a  "suspension system" genius, he performed and
tested tune-ups for  hundreds of types of motor-
bikes, developed the  products he sold, and  at
some point stopped counting the world cham-
pion titles that were racked up  with “his” suspen-
sion systems and innovative solutions. As  a
business man, he was constantly expanding his
suspension system product line. In  1998 he took
the  plunge and became a  manufacturer. After a
minor detour, his  suspension components now fi-
nally carry his  name. “Wilbers Racing Suspen-
sion” stands for suspension innovation made in
Germany. But  the  new name also stands for suc-
cess. His  suspension components played a  sub-
stantial role in Jorg Teuchert’s Super Sport world
champion title in the year 2000, according to
Yamaha Germany team captain Udo Mark.
The skepticism that he met  with twenty years ago
has  long since reversed course and  arrived at the
other extreme. Whether racer or  recreational
rider, suspension systems are  a  major theme for
motorcyclists. This has  been a  rapid develop-
ment. And, at  least in Germany, Benny Wilbers
has  been leading the  pack for more than the  past
twenty years.
