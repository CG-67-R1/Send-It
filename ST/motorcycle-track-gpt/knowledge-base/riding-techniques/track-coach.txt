position think of the body in two halves
the top half can be moved around without
upsetting the bike stability but the
bottom half does affect it so must be
moved only when necessary and at the
correct moment if you watch the best
motor GP Riders closely their lower body
movements are so smooth and perfectly
timed that you hardly notice them and
they do not upset the bike
stability also take note of how far
forward they sit changing your lower
body position is best done when the bike
is close to straight up and down and
when your head is on the bike center
line that is the moment when it's safest
to move your backside in preparation for
the next turn think about the next steps
as the bike returns to the vertical from
Full lean your head moves from out to
the side looking over your hand to back
to the center looking through the middle
of the screen the moment the bike is
upright and your head is on the center
line it is time to move your backside
from off one side to off the other side
in one smooth movement without dragging
yourself across the seat as this will
upset stability at higher speeds then
you can commit your head and your upper
body to the turn as the bike leans over
you should be standing on the balls of
your feet when doing this as this is
much more efficient than being flat
footed also the flat footed position
restricts ground clearance where and
when you move and position the top half
of your body is less important it's a
personal style thing that you can vary
to get the most from your bike setup
don't move your lower body if the next
Corner goes in the same direction as the
one you've just exited come coming out
of the corner and onto the straight
section don't move your backside leave
it off to the side ready for the next
turn

2

moving your backside too late in
preparation for the corner I'm talking
about when a rider has almost finished
breaking and is about to or already has
committed to the corner and then at the
last moment they move their backside
they're moving around on the bike right
when they should be concentrating on
more important things like the front
tire grip the turn and getting the rear
back in line get it done much earlier
when there's less to do moving your
backside back to the center for the
straight too early when I see a rider
doing this it makes me cringe because of
the unnecessary risk coming out of a
corner and onto a straight get tucked in
early out of the wind head behind the
screen knees and elbows tucked away but
always leave moving your backside until
you're well out of the corner and the
bike is closer to Upright this way there
is less chance of losing rear grip plus
your mind is free to focus on riding at
a risky moment

Riders sitting to far back the
importance of sitting forward the guys
that are sitting too far back problem is
it's very physical to hold yourself back
there when you're on the brakes because
all of your body weight's basically on
your arms so it's much more Rel I can
literally break really hard like this
that way because all your lower body
supported by the tank you can't move
once you're committed to the turn and
mid turn you have to be sitting forward
turning okay not have to but it it makes
a big difference turn of the bike you
know but to be sitting more in the
center of the bike than back here
secondly if you lose the rear on the
throttle and you're sitting back here
you go with it you've got no control
like anyone that rides a dirt bike will
know that you got to be right forward
with the front and the rear is back
there doing its own thing doesn't matter
you're back here you go with it you've
got less control the other thing is on a
powerful bike exiting the turn hard on
the throttle if you're not right forward
here the thing wheelies so every little
bit that you're back you have to use
less throttle further forward you are
the more throttle you can use for it'll
lift

foot position in general Riders should
position their feet so the ball of the
foot is on the pck you not only have
more ground clearance and are more agile
while changing position you also have
less chance of knocking the gear lever
selecting the wrong gear at the wrong
time can cause a crash while cornering
the ball of the foot on the inside of
the corner and therefore near the ash
felt should always be on the foot Pig
unless you need to change gear or use
the rear brake momentarily outside foot
the outside foot position does not
matter unless you are going to need to
change direction quickly in the middle
of a chicane for example in that case it
should be ball of the foot on the peg in
preparation for change of Direction
otherwise choose where you want it gear
change difficulties often arise once
Riders begin to sit forward and off to
one side for the majority of the lap it
is not necessary to have your weight on
the foot Peg when you change gear you
can sit off to either side and dangle
your leg at this point to give yourself
freedom to tap dance through the gears
more easily this is not only easier but
more accurate and faster there is no
negative to doing this you need to move
the foot back to ballon Peg position
after the gear changes anyway convince
yourself by sitting on a chair with your
feet flat on the floor applying a little
weight to your feet now try changing
gear your foot movement is restricted
slightly now dangle your legs with all
your weight on your back side and try
changing gear it is easier to move the
timing is more accurate and consequently
gear changes a faster

braking top half of your body during
maximum breaking I hold the top half of
my body up with relatively straight arms
until I commit to the corner apart from
holding my upper body weight back for a
slight center of gravity Improvement it
is far less physically demanding to hold
your body in a push-up position with
straight arms then bent arms once I
really start turning in I move my upper
body off to the inside and relax my arms
as I come off the brakes bottom half of
body to hold the bottom half of your
body back during maximum braking is
physically more difficult than simply
letting it slide forward against the
tank and off to one side in preparation
for the corner the problem with holding
your lower body back from the tank
during braking is not only physical it
is not safe to move your lower body
forward once you commit to the corner


6

you can win the most amount of time
safely on the straights Corners are for
getting from one straight to the next
the speed you can go around a corner is
limited by grip your speed on the
straight is not the key to going faster
is to make the Straits as long as
possible and the corners as short as
possible wherever you can possibly use
Full Throttle or full Breaking effort
find the those areas and squeeze
everything out of them you can and I
don't just mean the obvious Straits but
the little ones between the corners on a
series of turns look for the places
between the corners where you can open
the throttle and find the lines that
allow you to make these small straights
longer don't make the mistake of turning
a short straight between two corners
into an S as with everything there's a
balance but the general rule is that
longer Straits means more time on full
gas and ultimately a faster lap time if
you push hard and use a lot of corner
Speed without being strict about your
lines you will stay leaned over for
longer so you will not be able to open
the throttle fully until well out of the
corner it's not who gets on the gas
first it's who gets on full gas first

7

 
when I'm learning a track whether I'm
looking at a track diagram or out there
writing identify the longest straight
first the exit points of the corners on
to the longer straights are the most
important everything else is of lesser
importance and slightly variable but the
point where you exit your corner in
order to make the longer straight as
long as possible
is normally fixed you may need to
sacrifice a shorter straight to position
yourself best for a good exit onto a
longest road

Simon says hold it on holding a big
capacity bike at Full Throttle can be
intimidating but if you can't do it on
the streets where the least amount of
risk is where can you do it by Full
Throttle I mean all the way until it's
physically on the stop not partially
open or nearly open but wholly
completely and totally 100% open I
recommend you don't do it half-heartedly
so once the bike is upright I grit my
teeth grab the throttle by the Scruff of
the neck and hold it open until the
engine RPM has climbed towards the
limiter where it makes Peak power in
each gear trying to blow the it up this
is where you are winning time yell abuse
out loud at the bike if this works for
you use whatever makes the fear go away
because this is the safest place to win
time after a few laps of this holding it
on the fear goes away and you can relax
while the throttle is wide open and in
relative calm line up the next Corner
entry while looking for your braking
marker I never use the clutch on
upshifts this doesn't damage your
gearbox if your timing is correct once
you start using Full Throttle together
with high engine RPM you'll start
passing Riders on the straights the
Riders who think they're on Full
Throttle it is much easier and safer to
pass on the straights than the corners

throttle opening is directly
proportional to lean angle there's a lot
happening when you're riding on track if
you forget everything else do not forget
this rule it will keep you safe and show
you where to push in order to go faster
I still rely on it today the greater the
lean angle the smaller the throttle
opening the more upright the bike the
more you open that throttle very simple
I know but it works it amazes me how
many reasonable track Riders do not
understand this and put themselves in
unnecessary danger for slower lap times
looking at the Riders trying to get
their knees down I see them half
throttle on the straights looking for
the corner and then they lean the bike
over and open the throttle up crazy the
rear tire can cope with Full Throttle
when the bike is relatively upright and
on the fat part of the tire on full lean
you're using such a small contact patch
it's designed to hold you and the bike
up through the middle of the corner with
closed throttle neutral throttle or
slightly building speed to adjust track
position but not hard acceleration look
carefully at the diagram the area from
part lean left to part lean right is
approximately where you can use Full
Throttle in relative safety all although
it is impossible to say exactly what
degree of lean angle is safe on your
bike it depends on the power of the bike
surface grip and how good the rear tire
is to name just a few variables it is
your job as a rider to solve this
equation

10

breaking markers the first thing I do is
find my breaking markers at the end of
the long straights
make them at safe and early points to
start with if you want so that you know
you'll stop easily but on the straight
fiction the throttle needs to be open
fully until you reach these market
breakheart immediately and see where you
slow to the required speed the aim is to
reach the point where you start turning
at the desired speed if you slow down to
earn you know you can move your braking
marker a little closer to the corner on
the next lap it is very important to
concentrate solely on stopping the bike
in the shortest possible time
from the braking marker to the turning
point if you look away from the turning
point too early you're probably going a
look and turn in too early some writers
use breaking markers everywhere around
the track personally for the shortest
rate I find I can judge the distance
without physical market but it's
important that you do what works for you

11

full brakes break hard the only thing
that limits your braking when you're at
safe lean angles and track conditions
are good is your back wheel coming off
the ground break hard immediately every
time so it becomes comfortable by
holding the throttle open fully you will
arrive at the end of the straight at a
simless speed every time by breaking
hard every time you will slow to your
desired speed at around the same place
every lap this leads to consistency
which in turn creates confidence if you
break softly at first then harder as you
get closer to the corner it can lead to
panic if you break hard then let off the
brakes earlier you have more control
just like with a throttle when the bike
is upright you must use the brakes to
the maximum braking halfheartedly will
only lose you time breaking toward the
corner just as with the throttle there's
an area between part lean left and part
lean right where it is possible to use
maximum braking with no danger and again
you can keep the bike in this Zone
longer by leaning your upper body off
the side of the bike this enables you to
start committing to the corner and keep
the bike more upright for a moment
longer I call this stealing a few meters
if you steal these few meters on the
corner entries and also the corner exits
you'll have made the straights longer
and will ultimately win a good amount of
time over the whole lap toward the end
of the maximum braking period
approaching almost every corner I break
at a slide angle lean and line toward
the corner this not only gets you closer
to the corner from the outside of the
track so the distance to the Apex once
you release the brake is shorter it also
puts your bike on the right trajectory
thus making the turn easier it also
makes it possible to release the brake
at a higher speed if the corner requires
it basically this method of braking
towards the corner is setting yourself
up for Corner entry when you start to
lean the bike on full brakes you will
get to a certain point when you may feel
the bike start to resist or refuse to
lean your bike and front tire are
telling you something do not ignore this
warning and stay on full brakes Beyond
this lean angle full braking at small
lean angles is not to be confused with
Trail breaking Trail braking is breaking
more gently but at greater lean angle
and is far more risky occasionally I've
come across Corners where I'm leaning
and still accelerating as I get to the
point where I must start breaking in
this situation it is vital that you roll
off the throttle a fraction before
applying the brakes in order to transfer
weight to the front tire otherwise
there's a good chance of locking the
front wheel because there's no weight on
it

12
Braking -Straight Arms
on the initial heartbreaking hold the
top half of your body back with
relatively straight arms because this
uses less energy as I mentioned earlier
let the bottom half of your body slide
forward against the tank and off to the
side appropriate for the corner you're
approaching using the fuel tank to
support the bottom half of your body
saves a lot of energy all this is scary
and difficult to make yourself to at
first but our minds are just quickly and
it's good to get into the habit of
braking hard every time like most things
we do repeatedly in a short time it will
become second nature to brake like a
demon and be relatively relaxed at the
same time

13
Braking - Backing In
if the real wheel starts coming around
during hard braking sliding out to the
side chattering bouncing all you need to
do is put a slight pressure on the
clutch lever enough to make the clutch
slip ever so slightly which results in
the rear coming back into line and the
chatter stopping this is what slipper
clutches do automatically for this and
down changing I enter every corner with
one finger on the clutch it does not
matter if all this happens when you are
braking as long as you get it back into
line and under control
before you release the brakes and commit
to the corner this rear wheels dipping
out and backing in is the easiest type
of slide to do and control if you brake
hard enough at a slight lean angle and
change down through the gears the rear
will automatically step out the danger
really only comes from not getting the
rear back into line before you release
the front or both brakes on a bike with
lower grip like those used in other
motorcycle racing disciplines enduro
supermoto etc it is possible to
transition from backing in on the brakes
to quickly coming off the brakes and
onto the throttle while the rear is
still stepped out in order to continue
the slide on a sports bike with a good
rear tire this is incredibly dangerous
I never do it you might get away with it
a few times but eventually it'll bite
you big style

14
Braking - Changing Down Gears
changing down as soon as you hit the
brakes you should be going down through
the gearbox to the gear that is correct
for that corner it is not important to
know what gear you're in as long as it
is the correct gear for the corner you
know this by the engine rpm personally
for each corner I go into I note how
many gears I go down to get the right
gear not what gear I'm in so for example
down one or down three but you soon know
if you are wrong because either the bike
is not slowing enough in the engine rpm
is low or it's backing in and revving
its bollocks off while the bike is
relatively upright during hard braking
it is not a problem to change to the
correct gear as long as this is done
before you release the brakes and commit
to the corner I use one finger on the
clutch and blip the throttle to smoothly
match the down changes ever had a false
neutral the bike doesn't want to stop
and wants to go straight on pushing the
front tire ahead of it the same is true
in Reverse if you go down the gears and
keep the engine braking at its maximum
so high engine rpm the bike stops better
turns better and accelerates off the
corner better these are all extra little
ways you can make time over someone who
can't be bothered with extra gear
changes by using this technique you can
enter the corner much faster than you
ever thought possible this is not an
easy thing to do it's something that you
build up to once you have it mastered it
is an incredibly useful skill for almost
every corner of every track I never use
the rear brake on a four-stroke I use
engine braking but this is a personal
choice when I rode 502 strokes and GPS I
had to learn to use the rear brake again
because they have no engine braking
in order not to have to move my foot on
right corners and for ground clearance I
chose to remove the foot operated brake
and fit a thumb operated rear brake
which meant my hands were working the
throttle clutch front and rear brakes
all at the same time neither the rear
brake or the engine braking is very
efficient at stopping the bike in a
straight line they really come into
effect once you lean over and there's
some weight back on the rear tire I
choose engine brake of a rear brake on a
four-stroke because you have to think
about and control the rear brake you
don't have to control engine braking the
motor does it for you if you choose the
right gears

16
Braking - Weight Shifting with Leg
the rear wheels tendency to come around
during maximum braking at part lean
backing in is one of the reasons you see
top riders weight shifting by holding
the leg out as soon as you turn the bike
toward the corner under heavy braking
the front of the bike moves slightly in
the direction of the corner but the
inertia of everything else behind it
wants to continue straight ahead this
results in the weight of the bike and
the rider behind the front tire contact
patch no longer being evenly distributed
at this same moment the rear wheel has
almost no downward force on it and the
engine braking or rear brake is
resisting the ash felts attempt to turn
it so the rear wheel wants to slide out
this is called backing in taking your
inside foot off the peg and moving your
whole leg towards the inside of the
corner redistributes the weight of you
and the bike behind the front tire
contact patch more evenly again so this
helps prevent the rear wheel from
backing in I've also noticed that taking
my foot off the foot rest and moving it
close to the edge felt surface and also
rear wood allows me to brake slightly
harder before the rear wheel lifts off
the surface this enables me to stop the
bike a meter or two earlier and not run
wide but can also help avoid a collision
with a bike in front I call this my
panic brake

16
Braking - Suspension
suspension to make hard braking safe and
to get the most out of your bike and
yourself you'll need well set up front
suspension if your Forks have Springs
that are too soft or too soft damping
settings or both they will dive through
their stroke to quickly transferring all
of the weight of the bike and the rider
to the front tire contact match if this
is the case your bike will not only be
hard to stop there is a good chance the
front tire will lose grip once you start
turning into the corner because of this
load well setup suspension will slow
this weight transfer and allow you to
focus on your riding obviously good
brakes are a must

17
Corner Entry - Transitional Forces
when you decide the time is right simultaneously release the front brake
and fully commit your upper body and bike to the corner the nature of the
corner will dictate whether you need to make this transition gently and slowly or more decisively and quickly your
braking effort must be directly related to the lean angle of your bike you can
stay on full brakes until a certain lean angle just like with a throttle your aim
is to keep the load on the front tire consistent all the way through the transition from upright to fully
balancing the forces on the tires from braking to cornering the more you lean
with the brakes applied the bigger the risk of the front letting go there is absolutely no point taking risks by
pushing in this area until you are executing all other areas of riding well let me explain this another way imagine
you are compressing the front fork by a certain amount when you're at maximum braking in a straight line once you
start turning in your aim is to keep the forks compressed by the same amount to do this reduce brake pressure as you
lean over and the lateral forces due to cornering increase once I reach the
point where I do not want to push my luck any further I smoothly and simultaneously release the front brake
completely commit to my maximum lean with the bike and my upper body while
relaxing those stiff arms that supported me under heavy braking all of this is to give the front tire the best chance of
maximum turn without losing grip

18
Corner Entry - Closed Throttle Turning
turning on a closed throttle I closed
the throttle on the entry of almost
every corner of every track to go fast
you must take advantage of not only the
rear grip you have but also the front if
you have the right tires and they're
warm you can trust them until you're
riding in a very high level it's mainly
throttle opening and applying the brakes
that make the tires let go not closing
the throttle I use maximum engine
braking full lean angle close throttle
and no brakes
simultaneously you'll never feel the
bike turn better than at this moment it
is a fantastic technique that I trust
but it only works to its optimum if
you've changed down through the gears
beforehand under heavy braking so you
have the maximum amount of engine
braking and have released the brakes
while you still have enough speed to
reach mid turn just a warning you will
need a clear track in front of you to
practice this in case you come across a
late turn and rider who stays on the
brakes until he's almost stopped this
might sound scary and most riders prefer
to keep dragging that front brake for
too long
scrubbing off too much speed as if every
corner as a hippin consider the
following closed throttle turning as
much safer than trail braking because
with no front brake applied there is
much less chance of the front tire
letting go if it does that happens at a
slower rate and you have much more
chance of it coming back because the
wheels turning freely this technique is
more effective and flowing corners
rather than hairpin turns where you need
to scrub off more speed by staying on
the front brake a little longer as a
general guide if you have to open the
throttle to get to the apex you've gone
and to slow or you've stayed on the
brakes too long if you've stayed on the
brakes too long when you let them go and
are on full lean you'll not be carrying
enough speed to into the corner with a
closed throttle as soon as you open the
throttle you take away the optimum turn
of your bike and you put more stress on
your rear tire please don't try to make
up for it by accelerating and destroying
your turn
Dixit as well you can vary your line by
using small amounts of throttle to
adjust where you are on track but do not
accelerate keep strictly to the correct
line and get the exit right fix the
entry on the next lap by getting off the
brakes fractionally earlier so you carry
a little more speed chip away at it like
this bit by bit until when you release
the brakes you no longer need to open
the throttle to get to the corner this
is not easy and it will take some time
you will be impressed with the way your
bike turns the grip of your front tire
and how fast you can enter the turn
using this tool another tip once you let
go of the brakes you should go to your
maximum lean as quickly as possible so
the bike can turn and the tightest arc
possible if you lean the bike slowly it
is like turning the steering wheel of
your car slowly it's turning circle
won't be as small as it could be if you
don't use all of the lean angle
available while you're off the brakes
and have the throttle closed you will
not turn as tightly as you could

19
Corner Entry - Corner Entry Line
corner entry lines it is important to
prepare for the entry of the corner
while you are still on the throttle
approaching the corner sometimes you'll
have to compromise the exit and
acceleration out of one corner or on a
straight to get into the correct
position for the next corner if you
don't it's often not only the entry of
the corner that suffers but mid turn and
exit as well if you come back too late
in preparation for the next corner your
bike will be aiming in one direction
when the corner goes in the other
direction this asks too much of the
front tire it puts you in a risky
situation

20
Corner Entry - Double Apex Corners
enter hotter than normal to push you wide but still on a closed throttle
letting the bike slow down mid corner to come back to the second apex for a better line

21
Corner Entry - General Guide
corner entry general guide writer a by
breaking in a straight line for too long
writer a will have a much later turning
point
this makes the initial turn and sharper
putting stress on the tires for no gain
it also results in having to slow down
too much to get to the corner so writer
a will not be able to use turning on a
closed throttle and will have to get
back on the throttle to get to the
corner and opening the throttle takes
away the optimum turning circle of the
bike so writer a does not utilize the
available side grip of the front tire
while braking at a slight angle or
turning on a closed throttle rider a
will easily be overtaken by writer
beyond entry rider a makes the corner
much longer than it needs to be by
spending longer on full lean remember
the straights longer corners shorter
rule writer be starting from the outside
of the track writer be breaks in a
straight line then when the time is
right breaks at a slight angle and lean
toward the corner writer be can break
just as hard using this line as writer a
can in a straight line
even though total maximum braking
distance is the same for both writers
writer B can break slightly later
because he has moved his break release
point and turning point closer to the
corner also writer B doesn't have to
slow as much can release the brake at a
higher speed and still make the apex
turning with a closed throttle because
the bike is on a better angle for the
corner the distance from the brake
release point to the center of the
corner is far shorter so takes less time
finally the corner is shorter and there
is less time on full lane so less risk
remember the straights longer corner
shorter rule

22
Corner Entry - Optimum Turn-in Point
optimum turnin point the aim is to keep
a constant level of pressure close to
the limit on the tires all the way into
and through the turn you do not want a
higher stress level at one particular
point
imagine a fast 90 degree turn that
requires you to close the throttle but
not to brake if you turn in too early
you make the corner tighter in the
middle therefore loading up the front
tire more than necessary at that point
if you turn in too late
you stress the tires on the initial
turnin the optimum turnin point is
between those two extremes putting the
same load on the tires all the way into
and through the turn if there isn't a
high stress point there is no one
particular area the tyro let go the
transition from upright on full throttle
to full lean and closed throttle has to
be smooth and progressive the corner
will dictate if this transition must
happen quickly or slowly the throttle
position the lean angle and the turn all
work together to keep the pressure on
the tires even remember the throttle
position is directly connected to the
lean angle of the bike

23
Mid Corner - Full Lean
once your bike is fully on its side
maximum lean relax your arms and your
grip on the bars this not only saves you
energy and avoids arm pump it also feeds
less input into the bike
this means the bike is more stable and
lets the tire and chassis geometry do
their work the less input you put into
the bars the smaller chance of the front
tire letting go if your bike needs input
into the bars at this point to steer or
to stay leaned over then something is
not quite right this could be caused by
setup or tires street orientated tires
can cause this as they have a flatter
profile for more stability

24
Mid Corner - Throttle
the next very important skill has proved
difficult to teach some people just do
it others don't seem to understand once
you've decided the time is right to
crack open the throttle you need to do
so softly and so slightly that the bike
stops decelerating but stays strictly on
the line you have chosen at the correct
speed fast but not running off line if
you open the throttle too much too early
the bike will run wide and off the line
you need destroying your turn and your
exit also it is dangerous especially now
the RPM is very high because you're
utilizing maximum engine braking on
entry and there is limited rear grip
when you're traveling as fast as
possible at full length you may feel the
rear moving around at this point it is
important not to try and go faster here
but to keep a neutral throttle so not
accelerating hard or decelerating and
wait for the bike to turn the skill
isn't knowing when to crack the throttle
open not too much not too early and not
too late
I only crack the throttle when I know
I'm going to make it back to the paint
on the inside of the corner and I've
slowed enough once you have it cracked
wait keep the bike on that neutral
throttle still turning at its maximum
hugging the tight inside line a moment
longer until you can stand the bike up
off the edge of that rear tire get on
the throttle harder winning time
accelerating off the corner if you crack
it open too hard or too early
you'll stay leaned over for longer and
never get accelerating hard until it's
too late
and you risk high sighting like I always
say it's not who's first on the gas it's
who's first on full gas


25
Mid Corner - Knee Down
knee down one of the questions I'm asked
Wrigley is knee down how much how hard
when and when not to getting your knee
down it's not important for your lap
time it's just a personal thing I use it
like a gauge and a safety-net
gauge if your knee is on the ground you
know how far you're leaned over I don't
use it heavily I use it softly just
touching everywhere I don't need to
change my knee sliders very often some
riders have smoke coming off theirs and
change them regularly it is once again a
personal choice safety met the only time
having my knee on the ground really does
help is if I lose the front then I Drive
my knee into the ground as hard as
possible trying to hold the bike up long
enough for the front tire to gain grip
and pop back up if you're on the front
brake when the front goes there's not
much chance of saving it if you're not
there's a good chance it'll come back
holding your bike up on your knee is not
something you plan it's a reaction
reflex just like when you slip and try
to stay upright I've never hurt myself
pushing my knee into the track when the
front goes but you do have to watch for
high curbs people have mentioned that
they need to sit back from the tank in
order to put their knee out further and
not pivot around the tank I don't rate
knee down as important it will come when
you go fast concentrate on going fast
which requires sitting forward look at
the styles of doing Schwantz Bayliss and
myself for example it is clear to see
that we all sit forward and pivot around
the tank I'm not saying that this is the
only way just that there's nothing wrong
with it people that hang off the bike
and push their knee out as far as
possible to touch the ground and just
stopping the bike from leaning over
further the bike will never be able to
turn to its optimum if held up like this
in the mid term the only other reason
I've heard for getting your knee down is
to stick it in the dirt on the inside of
the corner spraying the rider behind
with stones one of my heroes and friend
Mick Doohan told me about this and then
did it to me a few years later in the
Dutch 500 Grand Prix
I was hiding behind this green laughing
outlet personally I would not recommend
doing this as unique catching the dirt
and rip you off the bike but all's fair
in love and racing

Corner Exit - Body Over The Paint
the point where you need to be in
control have finished turning and on the
way up off the edge of the rear tire
late in the corner and lining up the
exit is right next to the paint on the
inside of the corner you need to do this
in order to achieve optimum exit and
make the straights as long as possible
your body should be over the paint many
riders think because their knee is close
to the paint on the inside of the corner
that they are in the right position it
is where your tires are that is
important they have to be close to the
paint on the inside which means your
body is well over the paint when a bike
turns well in the mid turn it's a
pleasure to ride and it makes the exit
easier and safer if you can't get your
bike to turn well you'll still be at
your maximum lean angle waiting for the
bike to turn when you reach your exit
point accelerating it too big a lean
angle is dangerous also waiting for the
bike to turn after the optimum exit
point costs you time your bike setup
geometry ride height preload Springs is
important here also tires and the tire
profiles can make a big difference to
how efficiently your bike turns and can
make the riders work easier and safer
when it comes to exiting the turn on the
most important exits the ones onto the
long straights most of the turning is
done before I get to the late apex so I
can start to pick up the bike and drive
as I clip the paint on the inside at the
start of the exit this way you sacrifice
a little speed and time before the late
apex to allow you to drive from the apex
all the way out of the turn and down
that long straight straight longer
corners shorter

Upper Body Position on Track: Move INSIDE, not DOWN
- How low should we be getting our head
and upper body on the bike during cornering?
And how beneficial is it to get lower and lower?
In this video, I want to touch on this particular part
of a lot of rider's body position goals,
my hope being that it will help make things
a little more clear on why we do it
as well as save you some unnecessary discomfort
or frustration as you try to improve your current position.
(racing motorcycle engine roaring)
(soothing music)
Upper Body Position
"I still need to get a little bit lower on the bike."
This is something I hear quite a lot
typically from riders who are already displaying
a perfectly good body position in a fundamental sense.
By that I mean they're not only able to get into
a good neutral position visually, but they're able
to hit the other requirements of a good position too,
things that sit outside of how you look in photos.
Exactly why riders still want to achieve lower
and lower upper body positions remains to be seen,
but I strongly suspect it stems from the extreme standards
we see from the guys at the top of our sport.
These are the fastest guys, so they set the standard.
However, in my experience, a lot of discomfort can come
from trying to achieve this standard,
a standard that is often misunderstood based on information
they may have heard elsewhere.
Moving inside is the key.
If you've spent any time learning about why we hang off,
you no doubt would have heard something to the effect of
move lower to lower the center of gravity
and reduce lean angle.
And this is something I'm sure many of you
will be sitting there nodding along with.
However, some confusion can creep in
because people misunderstand what exactly
getting low really means.
In terms of reducing lean angle,
the goal of a good hang off position is to move inside
the centerline of the bike, not to lay down on top of it.
It's moving your mass inside the centerline
and therefore moving the combined bike and rider's
center of gravity to the inside too
that has the biggest impact on the lean angle
of your motorcycle.
And this' the exact reason why in extreme cases,
we see riders doing things like this.
Here we have Valentino Rossi making every effort
to reduce the motorcycle's lean angle
during this important acceleration phase
by getting as much of his mass inside the centerline
as he can.
And because he's one of the taller guys out there,
it makes it look so extreme.
Riding in this position comes with drawbacks
in terms of bike control, and in high speed corners,
increased aerodynamic drag, but the necessity
to stand the bike up to this degree
outweighs those drawbacks in this instance.
Now, I'm not showing you this picture to give you something
to emulate, merely to demonstrate how reducing lean angle
with the body is actually achieved,
by moving inside the centerline of the bike,
not by laying down on top of it.
With all of that said, I'm sure some of you
will still be sitting there saying,
but look how low Vale is.
And that's the exact confusion I'm talking about.
He is low to the ground, yes,
but that's a natural consequence of moving farther
inside a bike that sets high lean angle.
Naturally, you're going to move closer to the ground
when doing that.
What riders often try to do though is move their head
and upper body lower in relation to the motorcycle
or said another way they try to get their head closer
to the handlebar thinking that it's going
to further help their efforts to reduce lean angle.
And this is actually a rider I worked with in the past.
But while his head position isn't excessively low on paper
at the time, he was forcing it as low as possible,
which created discomfort and hindered his control
for no real gain.
And the reason there's no real gain is because moving
the center of gravity closer to the contact patches
by getting low on top of the bike actually means
you need to lean the bike more for a given speed, not less,
as Vittore Cossalter explains
in his book "Motorcycle Dynamics."
He says, "...with equal cross sections of the tires,
"to describe the same turn with the same forward velocity,
"a motorcycle with a low center of gravity
"needs to be tilted more than a motorcycle
"with a higher center of gravity."
This basically means that for a given speed
and turning radius, a rider sitting upright
won't lean as far as a rider laying down on top of the tank,
if we assume the same seating position.
Now the difference is minimal,
especially if you're on the lighter side
but there is a difference.
Why do some riders get low
So why do some of the best guys get really low then?
You don't have to look too far to find pictures
of riders getting low in relation to the bike
and getting their head close to the inside bar.
The most obvious cases coming from the Young guns in MotoGP,
Marc Marquez being a prime case, with people like
Maverick Vinales showing similar styles too.
The first thing to note is that while he is low on the bike,
aside from his outside arm and leg,
almost the entirety of his body is inside
the centerline of the bike, which as we've covered
is a key to reducing lean angle.
It's the style Maverick adopts to hold his mass
on the inside of the bike.
He's basically hanging onto the side of it,
and that's an important distinction to make.
His head and upper body is low as a consequence
of him working to get his body to the inside
while still retaining a good connection with a bike
and a good level of control.
Is getting low good
So does that mean getting low is good after all?
Well, for some of the motorcycling elite,
it's clearly a style that can work,
I'm sure we can all agree on that.
However, your everyday track rider,
the balance of each style, that's hunkering
right down on the bike versus sitting a little taller,
it starts to fall a little bit too much
in the negative's column.
Of course, we don't want to ride
with completely straight arms and bringing our head lower
is an important part of improving body position
and bike control.
But riding to the extremes of someone like Maverick Vinales
is flat out harder.
It's harder to maintain good lower body stability,
it's more tiring, it'll likely have a negative impact
on your ability to control the machine
and your grip will likely be tighter too.
That's a whole lot of negatives for something
that offers zero appreciable benefits to the average rider.
You simply don't need to put your chin on the bar.
Sitting more upright is fine
and it will be easier to achieve the most.
Conclusion
Focus on the fundamentals.
If it's your style to hunker down on the bike
and ride compact like Maverick, and you can make it work,
I'm not telling you you're wrong by any means.
This video is really for riders who are trying to emulate
that style to the detriment of the fundamental principles
of a good body position thinking that they're doing
the right thing.
And this has become a particular focus point for me
because with the riders I work with,
I see a lot of people wasting time and creating problems
for themselves in an effort to look like the best out there.
The basic lesson here is that if trying to force
your head lower creates problems for you,
I would advise you to stay in a more neutral position
for greater comfort and control.
You can likely experience greater results by sticking
with your more conservative position
and focusing on other things instead.

and upper body on track?

Corner Exit - Pushing The Bike Up
when you've lined up the exit and start
to stand the bike up as the bike lifts
up off full lean you start applying the
throttle
remember throttle opening is directly
related to the lean angle of the bike
this is the moment you can steal a few
meters by extending your arms and
pushing the bike up and away from your
body the bike is in a more upright
position earlier which means you can
instantly apply more throttle this is
only possible if you wait a fraction
longer as I explained earlier if you
don't get the bike turned enough in the
mid turn you won't be able to steal a
few liters on the exit if you stand the
bike up the forward has turned enough
it'll just run wide or maybe even off
the track deciding how much throttle to
use as you lift the bike up involves
treading a very fine line because you've
gone down gears to use engine braking
and turning with a closed rattle the
engine will be at relatively high rpm in
the mid turn producing high power the
peak power of your engine is on tap
ready to go in an instant it is
therefore imperative to keep it on a
smooth constant or neutral throttle
until you can pick the bike up from full
lean and off the edge of the rear tire
then you can really hold it on that
moment when you have the throttle
against the stop in a low gear with the
bike accelerating hard out of the turn
your backside still off the side of the
seat at parte lean but upright enough to
be in the safe area of the rear tire is
when you are winning time you want as
much of this in a lap as possible if you
find yourself waiting for the engine to
pick up rpm and accelerate harder you
are losing time whenever you are ready
to pick the bike up and accelerate the
bike must jump forward
as hard as possible winning as much time
as possible the engine will help you do
this but only if it is in the last few
thousand rpm of its range

29
Corner Exit - Finding The Right Exit Gear
finding the right exit gear if you're
into higher gear the bike won't respond
to the throttle instantaneously so there
will be a delay in at making peak
horsepower and accelerating hard if it
isn't to lower gear you won't get far
enough out of the corner and we'll still
be leaned over when you hit the rev
limiter the perfect gear is the one that
allows you to accelerate hard far enough
out of the turn without any delay until
the bike is at a safer lean angle before
you need to hook the next gear

30
Corner Exit - Split Personality
I call it like two doing personalities
jekyll-and-hyde when I'm upright
I'm mr. aggressive just blows it up give
it everything squeeze every last ounce
of acceleration right forward in the
last couple of thousand rpm then as soon
as it starts leaning over like for
example turn one to two you're upright
and I go back to him mr. gentleman this
wrote literate rush through they don't
do anything to upset the tires and let
it do its job you know get the tires and
the turn of the bike do its job until
you transform as it comes up back into
mr. aggressive squeeze everything out of
it I I think of it as like when it's
upright something really aggressive you
know Rage Against the Machine and then
when it's on its side it's like birds
tweeting let's silent you know there's
no engine noise it's just a little bit
of wind noise and

Vudu Tricks - Wet Weather Tyres
full wet tires they're unbelievable for
those of you haven't written on them
once you try them you'll never want to
write on normal treated tires again
they're so so much better I'm guessing
five ten times better than normal once
the other thing is there's so much more
feel like with because they're rubber so
much softer the grip so much better when
they do let go they give you a better
feel rather than the hard feel of a
standard Road tire that just you think
it's alright and much earlier but also
much faster they let go and you're on
your ear before you know these things
keep you safe and so much fun

32
Vudu Tricks - Chicanes
chickens in slow and medium speed
chicanes I break at an angle on the
approach to help find a straight line
through the chicane from paint to paint
like every corner I make sure I release
the brake before I get too much lean
angle and then have enough speed to
travel through the chicane without
having to accelerate before the exit
once off the brakes I really go to work
getting my body over the paint on the
inside of the first part of the chicane
and then back over the other side of the
bike for the second part I try to do
this in a fast flowing single movement
all this is much safer without brakes
and throttle that are likely to make the
tires let go

33
Vudu Tricks - Change of Direction
there are three main elements to getting
your bike to change direction pressure
on the bars counter-steering
I think there is too much importance put
on countersteering to change direction
for example when I pushed my children
off on their bicycles for the very first
time at about four years old they change
direction by countersteering without me
having to tell them about it we all do
it naturally I hope so for your sake and
the only thing that needs to be thought
about is timing and the force required
as I explained in corner entry it is
important to keep the transitional
forces smooth and not to create a stress
point for your tires this is where
people who put too much emphasis on
counter steering can come unstuck by
using it too aggressively and at the
wrong moment when you decide the time is
right you simultaneously pull on the
outside bar and push on the inside bar
if your braking at the time of change of
direction you can apply much more force
to the bars because the tire has more
weight on it allowing you to get the
change of direction done faster also
during braking you'll already have
pressure on both bars so you will just
need to apply more to the inside bar and
give the outside bar a pull only if
necessary this is why your triceps get a
good workout riding on circuit once I've
done this and initiated the change of
direction I commit my upper body to the
corner and look where I want to go
pressure on the foot pegs if I am
breaking I personally don't find it
necessary to apply weight to the foot
pegs to get the change direction done as
the front tire has enough grip to cope
with the change of direction and the
majority of my bodyweight wants to go
forward at that
knocked down I'm being supported by the
tank and the handlebars and I don't have
much weight to spare to push on the pigs
on the other hand if you're accelerating
during change of direction it's a whole
different beast one of my riding heroes
Mick Doohan is a classic example of this
grip the bars hold yourself forward
facing the screen chest on the tank
backside hovering over the seat with all
your weight on the foot pegs your front
tire will have very little weight on it
so you can use very little force on the
bars before it will turn and skim the
ground this is very bad for stability so
you need to use the foot pegs to the
full to make up for the lack of force
you can put through the bars and the
hard acceleration if your weight is off
the seat the center of gravity of you
and your bike moves down and forward
enabling you to open the throttle more
before the front tire lifts when not
breaking and applying pressure to the
bars to get the bike to change direction
I am also pushing on the inside foot Pig
the only way to apply pressure to a
single foot peg is to commit your body
to that side it is not a conscious
forceful move it is a fluid action that
coincides with pulling your weight
forward moving your body position to
that side and applying pressure to the
bars all in a balanced way this is all
about getting the timing right to
maintain the stability of the bike body
position and weight distribution I use
this for every corner it is basically
looking through the corner to where you
want to go and moving your head and body
off the side of the bike in that
direction by extending your arms try
this if you're sitting in a chair right
now pretend to hold the bikes bars in
your hands they should be close to your
body because you're holding yourself
forward and accelerating with the
throttle open now lean forward and off
to the left putting weight on your left
foot at the same time as turning the
bars to the right
this is basically what I mean
