## ONERACE_S00 — Overview & key themes
**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** One Raceway – Wakefield Park (NSW) (Formerly Wakefield Park Raceway) in NSW, this 2.2 km track (recently rebranded “One Raceway”) is a tight, technical circuit renowned for being a club-level rider training ground. With 10 turns packed into its length, Wakefield (One) Park emphasizes cornering skill over outright speed. Key features include the...
**Stable reference points:** The track has no significant elevation except a small rise and dip at the “Fish Hook” section, but its layout punishes poor lines because most corners lead directly into the next.; Use the curb on the inside lightly if needed.; For bikes: pick your brake marker (there’s typically a 100m board; a superbike might brake ~110m, a lightweight at 70m).
**Hazards / surface:** The track has no significant elevation except a small rise and dip at the “Fish Hook” section, but its layout punishes poor lines because most corners lead directly into the next.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** For bikes: pick your brake marker (there’s typically a 100m board; a superbike might brake ~110m, a lightweight at 70m). 600s and 1000s: get the bike slowed and square up the exit.
- **600/midsize:** 600s and 1000s: get the bike slowed and square up the exit. The approach: you are accelerating uphill, likely in 3rd or 4th gear on a 600cc by the time you crest.
- **300/small:** Smaller bikes (sub-400cc) can often go through T1 flat out, as their top speed isn’t as high – they should take advantage of that and carry max speed. For bikes: pick your brake marker (there’s typically a 100m board; a superbike might brake ~110m, a lightweight at 70m).
**Common mistakes:** A common saying is “keep it high (left) exiting 4 to get a good line into 5” – meaning keep your trajectory towards the left side. This means it’s easy to overshoot the apex or run wide if you haven’t shed enough speed early.
**Overtake / passing:** This is a prime overtaking spot (outbraking someone into T2 or cutting back underneath at exit), so be prepared for different lines in traffic. T4 itself isn’t a passing zone usually; it’s all about the setup.
**Confidence:** Medium (overview extracted from uploaded guide; validate on-track markers).

## ONERACE_S01 — Turn 1 (Left Kink)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** corner , more of a bend, but it sets up for Turn 2. The crucial fact here: you can usually take Turn 1 faster than you think, but it will limit your Turn 2 if overdone. The track edge on exit of T1 comes quickly; aim to be about mid-track or just left of center after the kink to line up for braking into Turn 2.
**Stable reference points:** Use the curb on the inside lightly if needed.
**Hazards / surface:** Big bikes will approach ~200 km/ h and may need a slight lift or brush of brake just to get weight forward, then turn in left and hug the inside. Use the curb on the inside lightly if needed.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **300/small:** Smaller bikes (sub-400cc) can often go through T1 flat out, as their top speed isn’t as high – they should take advantage of that and carry max speed.

## ONERACE_S02 — Turn 2 (Right Hairpin)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** Wakefield – it leads onto an uphill straight and any time lost here hurts all the way up the hill. Heavy braking is done in a straight line – the track has good runoff here, but you want to get braking done early and straight to avoid unsettling the car/bike (this advice was for cars but applies to bikes too)....
**Stable reference points:** For bikes: pick your brake marker (there’s typically a 100m board; a superbike might brake ~110m, a lightweight at 70m).
**Hazards / surface:** For bikes: pick your brake marker (there’s typically a 100m board; a superbike might brake ~110m, a lightweight at 70m).

## ONERACE_S03 — Turn 3 (Left Bend over Crest)
**Shape:** Corner / complex
**Priority / what matters:** over the crest of the hill. Many riders don’t even consider it a “turn” as much as a necessary line adjustment. It’s important to not drift too far right after Turn 3, because Turn 4 is a left and you’ll need to be on the left side of the track for it.
**Hazards / surface:** over the crest of the hill. The approach: you are accelerating uphill, likely in 3rd or 4th gear on a 600cc by the time you crest.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **600/midsize:** The approach: you are accelerating uphill, likely in 3rd or 4th gear on a 600cc by the time you crest.
- **300/small:** Small bikes can probably stay full throttle through Turn 3, just slight lean.

## ONERACE_S04 — Turn 4 (Left-hander)
**Shape:** Straight / link
**Priority / what matters:** some natural camber because it’s on a hillside. You drop a little into it. It’s important for setting up Turn 5 ahead.
**Hazards / surface:** You drop a little into it. Ideally, you approach T4 from mid-track (since you wisely stayed a bit left over the crest of T3) and carry good speed through T4.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes might approach in 4th but downshift to 3rd, feathering throttle.
- **600/midsize:** 600cc bikes can often take this in 3rd gear with a maintenance throttle – the camber will help grip.
**Common mistakes:** A common saying is “keep it high (left) exiting 4 to get a good line into 5” – meaning keep your trajectory towards the left side.
**Overtake / passing:** T4 itself isn’t a passing zone usually; it’s all about the setup.

## ONERACE_S05 — Turn 5 (Right-hander)
**Shape:** Straight / link
**Priority / what matters:** There is a short straight (more like a link) between 4 and 5, but if you exited 4 correctly, you won’t be 21 22 23 23 24 25 26 25 26 6 fully to the right edge – you’ll be about mid-track, which is ideal to dive into Turn 5. This corner is critical for the run down into the Fish Hook (Turns 6-7). Many lap times are...
**Hazards / surface:** It’s slightly downhill entry, but then the track falls more steeply after the apex, so anticipate the weight shift. 600s and 1000s: better to err on a slightly slow-in, fast-out approach.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** 600s and 1000s: better to err on a slightly slow-in, fast-out approach. The bike will lighten a bit at T5 exit as the hill drops – be ready; a superbike might wag the bars or spin slightly here.
- **600/midsize:** 600s and 1000s: better to err on a slightly slow-in, fast-out approach.

## ONERACE_S06 — Turns 6 & 7 (“The Fish Hook”)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** immediate right that looks like a hook or hairpin/chicane combination. Essentially, Turn 6 is a fast right kink and Turn 7 a tight left hairpin at the bottom of the hill. Approaching from Turn 5’s exit, you go down a short hill into a shallow right curve (T6).
**Stable reference points:** Use the pavement change or a cone as a marker , and drop anchor hard.; Once in the bowl, hug the curb.
**Hazards / surface:** Use the pavement change or a cone as a marker , and drop anchor hard.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: upright the bike as much as you can, even if it means braking a touch earlier , to get maximum decel. Superbike riders: stand it up and pin it – you’ll be full throttle through the next sweeps if you do it right.
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size bikes: trail brake down into the bowl, but keep a bit of throttle to maintain stability as you’re leaning left (the banking will help “catch” you).
**Overtake / passing:** Smaller bikes can dive into the Fish Hook really deep and use that banking to catch them – you might even pass bigger bikes here by braking later .

## ONERACE_S07 — Turn 8 (Left kink)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** kink in this downhill run. For bikes, it’s usually just a slight lean at full gas. Turn 8 sets you up for Turn 9.
**Hazards / surface:** For bikes, it’s usually just a slight lean at full gas. The track has a few undulations here.

## ONERACE_S08 — Turn 9 (Fast Right Sweeper)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** This is a very fast right-hand bend that in many cases is just a slight roll-off and lean. There’s a gentle rise on entry to T9 which can unsettle the bike. Try not to over-slow – keeping speed is crucial.
**Stable reference points:** The corner has a bit of exit curb inside – but beware using too much inside curb on T9, it can upset the chassis if you hit it at lean.; Let the bike run out to the left exit curb as you accelerate out.
**Hazards / surface:** This is a very fast right-hand bend that in many cases is just a slight roll-off and lean. Superbikes: you might approach T9 in 5th gear 27 27 27 28 11 29 7 topping 200 km/h; a slight roll or tap of brake to get weight forward is needed .
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: you might approach T9 in 5th gear 27 27 27 28 11 29 7 topping 200 km/h; a slight roll or tap of brake to get weight forward is needed .
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size bikes (600) often just do a quick downshift or tiny lift, then throw it in – it’s a rush because you’re still probably above 150 km/h through T9.
- **300/small:** Small bikes likely can keep it pinned through T9 if the rider has the courage, maybe a minor throttle feather .
**Overtake / passing:** T9 is critical for setting up an overtake into Turn 10 – in car racing, this sets up passing on the straight, but on bikes it’s more about maintaining momentum.

## ONERACE_S09 — Turn 10 (Final Hairpin, “The Sweeper”)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** that leads onto the main straight. It’s about 135° and heavily banked on the inside. The exit of Turn 10 is crucial not only for finishing the lap but it dictates your speed across the start/finish and into Turn 1 of the next lap.
**Stable reference points:** Line: aim to apex about a meter late of the geometric center – basically don’t hug the curb from the start, come in late and tight.; The exit of Turn 10 is crucial not only for finishing the lap but it dictates your speed across the start/finish and into Turn 1 of the next lap.; Common mistake: rushing the apex and missing it, resulting in running wide onto the exit curb or grass.
**Hazards / surface:** Approach is slightly downhill: about 70% of your braking is on level ground, but the last part the track falls away as you tip in. Superbikes: you’ll come into T10 hot (probably 5th gear on that short straight) – drop to 2nd gear , maybe even 1st.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: you’ll come into T10 hot (probably 5th gear on that short straight) – drop to 2nd gear , maybe even 1st. Superbikes will often wheelie or spin slightly cresting onto the straight – it’s okay if you’re pointed right.
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size and small bikes can handle a bit more entry speed due to lower mass – but even on a 300, rushing T10 will kill your drive and possibly send you off-line. A 600cc should be set for versatility: medium stiffness, perhaps raise rear ride height a tad to help quick transitions, and make use of that front-end feel in hairpins.
- **300/small:** Mid-size and small bikes can handle a bit more entry speed due to lower mass – but even on a 300, rushing T10 will kill your drive and possibly send you off-line. Setup for classes: A lightweight bike (e.g.
**Common mistakes:** This means it’s easy to overshoot the apex or run wide if you haven’t shed enough speed early. Common mistake: rushing the apex and missing it, resulting in running wide onto the exit curb or grass.
