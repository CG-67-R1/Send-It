## BEND_INT_S00 — Overview & key themes
**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** The Bend Motorsport Park (International Circuit, 4.95 km) – Motorcycle Track Guide Official track map of The Bend Motorsport Park – International Circuit (4.95 km, 18 turns). The layout features a 1 km uphill main straight and a mix of fast sweeping sections and tight technical bends. A well set-up bike that balances front-end confidence (for...
**Stable reference points:** The circuit is wide and forgiving of lines in places, but that very openness means scarce visual reference points – you often feel like you’re “running blind” and must create your own markers on the vast pavement .; Corner-by-Corner Breakdown and Lines Turn 1 – “Big Stop” Hairpin (Right): After the long uphill start/finish straight (which crests then levels off near the braking zone), Turn 1 is a first-gear right-hand hairpin that requires shedding massive speed – from ~280–290 km/h down to about 85 km/h.; There are marker boards (300 m, 200 m, 100 m) on rider’s left – a good reference is to begin braking around the 200 m board on a superbike (earlier ~250 m when learning, or on smaller bikes).
**Hazards / surface:** Wind can also be a variable at this open rural circuit, and dust or sand can reduce grip off the racing line on windy days (keep this in mind when offline or overtaking).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** The result is a long lap (around 1m54s for superbikes) that is “long and technical…but a bucket load of fun”. You’ll hit top speed (approaching ~290 km/h on a 1000cc superbike) on the 1 km straight , then slam into heavy braking for Turn 1.
- **600/midsize:** Gear: Superbikes drop to 2nd gear (some even 1st if geared tall) for Turn 1; a 600cc or 400cc will also use 2nd if possible, to avoid excessive wheelspin or bogging on exit. Gear: 600s and 1000s will be in 3rd gear through this left-right (maybe short-shifting to 3rd for smoother transition); a 400 might hold 4th through T2 and downshift to 3rd for T3.
- **300/small:** There are marker boards (300 m, 200 m, 100 m) on rider’s left – a good reference is to begin braking around the 200 m board on a superbike (earlier ~250 m when learning, or on smaller bikes). Gear: Superbikes drop to 2nd gear (some even 1st if geared tall) for Turn 1; a 600cc or 400cc will also use 2nd if possible, to avoid excessive wheelspin or bogging on exit.
**Common mistakes:** Overall, the track “is simply amazing” and a joy once you learn it, but it demands respect – any mistake in the technical sequences will compound and cost you all the way through the lap. Common mistakes: Out-braking yourself into T1 (there’s generous runoff, but time lost) and early apexing – which leaves you running wide and slow on exit.
**Overtake / passing:** It’s one of the best overtaking spots on the track due to the huge braking zone. But it’s also a passing opportunity: a rider who brakes extra-deep can dive inside at T6’s entry.
**Confidence:** Medium (overview extracted from uploaded guide; validate on-track markers).

## BEND_INT_S01 — Turn 1
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** off near the braking zone), Turn 1 is a first-gear right-hand hairpin that requires shedding massive speed – from ~280–290 km/h down to about 85 km/h.

**Stable reference points:** There are marker boards (300 m, 200 m, 100 m) on rider’s left – a good reference is to begin braking around the 200 m board on a superbike (earlier ~250 m when learning, or on smaller bikes).; The corner entry is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 5 10 11 7 12 1 very wide with no walls, so it can be deceiving – many riders report depth perception issues here .; Focus on your braking markers and look for the apex cone/curb rather than the endless asphalt.
**Hazards / surface:** Gear: Superbikes drop to 2nd gear (some even 1st if geared tall) for Turn 1; a 600cc or 400cc will also use 2nd if possible, to avoid excessive wheelspin or bogging on exit.

## BEND_INT_S02 — Turns 2–3
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** and it’s deceptively tricky. There’s a rise and dip through here – “a lot of undulation… which TV won’t show” – and the bike transitions from full lean right to left. The exit of Turn 3 is crucial; get on the gas early and drive out cleanly, using all the track width.
**Stable reference points:** There is a bit of curb on the outside – you can run onto it on exit if needed, as the runoff is forgiving here.
**Hazards / surface:** There’s a rise and dip through here – “a lot of undulation… which TV won’t show” – and the bike transitions from full lean right to left. Only a slight brake or roll-off may be needed as you flick left.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Gear: 600s and 1000s will be in 3rd gear through this left-right (maybe short-shifting to 3rd for smoother transition); a 400 might hold 4th through T2 and downshift to 3rd for T3.
- **600/midsize:** Gear: 600s and 1000s will be in 3rd gear through this left-right (maybe short-shifting to 3rd for smoother transition); a 400 might hold 4th through T2 and downshift to 3rd for T3.
- **300/small:** Gear: 600s and 1000s will be in 3rd gear through this left-right (maybe short-shifting to 3rd for smoother transition); a 400 might hold 4th through T2 and downshift to 3rd for T3.
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Rushing Turn 2 and compromising Turn 3.

## BEND_INT_S03 — Turns 4–5
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** sweeping section. Turn 4 is a slight right-hand kink taken almost flat-out, and Turn 5 is a fast left-hand sweeper . The track slightly crests and drops away through these turns, and the camber falls off towards the outside, which “draws you out” wide at the exit.
**Stable reference points:** For Turn 4 (right kink), pick a turn-in reference – perhaps a distant tree, flag post, or brake marker board on the right (even though you won’t brake much, a board or painted curb can cue your tip-in).; The apex is blind, but as you tip in, look for the inside curb appearing and apex mid- curb.; You can use the exit curb, but too much speed will still risk running off.
**Hazards / surface:** Turn 4 is a slight right-hand kink taken almost flat-out, and Turn 5 is a fast left-hand sweeper . The track slightly crests and drops away through these turns, and the camber falls off towards the outside, which “draws you out” wide at the exit.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** This “run to Turn 5 is quite quick” – on a superbike you’ll reach 5th gear and about 230 km/ h through Turn 4. Turn 5 requires a quick brush of the brakes to shed a bit of speed (superbikes drop to ~195 km/h).
- **600/midsize:** Gear: 1000cc in 5th gear through 4, down to 4th for 5; 600cc around 5th->4th; 400cc maybe 5th pinned through both if you can keep momentum.
- **300/small:** Gear: 1000cc in 5th gear through 4, down to 4th for 5; 600cc around 5th->4th; 400cc maybe 5th pinned through both if you can keep momentum.
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Turning in too early (you’ll run off as the track falls away) and not trusting the bike’s grip through the blind entry.

## BEND_INT_S04 — Turn 6
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** the fast T5, you’ll be accelerating on a short straight (briefly up to maybe 200+ km/h on literbikes) and then braking hard for Turn 6, a tight left-hand hairpin that goes on forever. It’s described as “a weird corner – a long left-hander that comes back on itself”. The off-camber means if you hug the inside too...
**Stable reference points:** Braking: There is a brake marker board (100 m) – a superbike might start braking just after the 150 m mark, a 600 around 150 m, and a 400 closer to 100 m, since their entry speeds are lower.; Tip: There’s a flag marshal post** on the outside of Turn 6 – as you approach, it can serve as a visual cue to judge where the corner wraps back.; Only when you see the end of the guardrail or flag station on exit can you really hammer the throttle.
**Hazards / surface:** Think of it as a bowl or carousel, except it’s off-camber . The off-camber means if you hug the inside too early, you might lose the line, so don’t be afraid to let the bike run a little wide mid-turn, then pull it back tight for exit.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** the fast T5, you’ll be accelerating on a short straight (briefly up to maybe 200+ km/h on literbikes) and then braking hard for Turn 6, a tight left-hand hairpin that goes on forever. Braking: There is a brake marker board (100 m) – a superbike might start braking just after the 150 m mark, a 600 around 150 m, and a 400 closer to 100 m, since their entry speeds are lower.
- **600/midsize:** Braking: There is a brake marker board (100 m) – a superbike might start braking just after the 150 m mark, a 600 around 150 m, and a 400 closer to 100 m, since their entry speeds are lower. You’ll be in 2nd gear (perhaps even 1st on a 600/400).
- **300/small:** Braking: There is a brake marker board (100 m) – a superbike might start braking just after the 150 m mark, a 600 around 150 m, and a 400 closer to 100 m, since their entry speeds are lower. You’ll be in 2nd gear (perhaps even 1st on a 600/400).
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Charging in too fast and running wide (especially given the off-camber – you’ll end up way outside and slow out, or worse, onto the runoff).
**Overtake / passing:** But it’s also a passing opportunity: a rider who brakes extra-deep can dive inside at T6’s entry.

## BEND_INT_S05 — Turns 7–8–9–10
**Shape:** Double-apex
**Priority / what matters:** speed esses sequence: a left-right-left-right combination (Turns 7–10) taken in rapid succession. This is widely considered “the hardest section of the track” because the corners flow one into the next, and crucially, the entry is completely blind.
**Hazards / surface:** Turn 7 is a fast kink (right) over a crest – as you crest, begin to turn in left for Turn 8 without seeing the apex of 8 yet. Turns 7/8 are taken almost as one big chicane; roll the throttle only slightly to settle the bike.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Approach Turn 7 uphill and stay on throttle – on a superbike you’ll be in 4th gear , flicking right then left.

## BEND_INT_S06 — Turn 9 (Right)
**Shape:** Corner / complex
**Priority / what matters:** brakes. Squeeze the brake as you transition from left to right, shedding speed (down to ~145 km/h on a superbike).
**Bike-class notes:**

## BEND_INT_S07 — Turn 10 (Right)
**Shape:** Esses / S
**Priority / what matters:** essentially the exit of the esses. It tightens more, so you may need to downshift (perhaps to 3rd gear). Hug the right-side apex curb and really focus on drive, because there’s a short straight after Turn 10.
**Stable reference points:** Hug the right-side apex curb and really focus on drive, because there’s a short straight after Turn 10.; This sector will really separate riders; it’s where lap times can swing significantly.
**Hazards / surface:** Look as far ahead as you can (even though it’s blind, look through the blind crest to where you expect the track to go).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Gear: 1000cc in 4th gear through 7-8, downshift to 3rd by Turn 10; 600cc similar; 400cc may hold 5th then 4th.
- **600/midsize:** Gear: 1000cc in 4th gear through 7-8, downshift to 3rd by Turn 10; 600cc similar; 400cc may hold 5th then 4th.
- **300/small:** Gear: 1000cc in 4th gear through 7-8, downshift to 3rd by Turn 10; 600cc similar; 400cc may hold 5th then 4th.
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Turning in wrong for Turn 8 and subsequently getting out of sync (when one part is off, the rest cascade in a “painful” way).

## BEND_INT_S08 — Turn 11
**Shape:** Esses / S
**Priority / what matters:** (between T10 and T11). Turn 11 is a fast right-hander that comes just after a crest. The corner opens up on exit.
**Stable reference points:** However , there’s a catch: a very high inside kerb.; As the iRacing guide notes, you want to “stay to the left until you see the kerb, then flick it in and lean on the camber”.; In other words, don’t turn in too early – that tall apex kerb will unsettle you (or behead your toe/peg!).
**Hazards / surface:** Turn 11 is a fast right-hander that comes just after a crest. Instead, delay apex slightly: trail-brake in uphill, wait until that kerb is visible, then tip in decisively.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes approach in 4th gear , then flick right into T11 at about 160–165 km/h. Gear: 1000s in 4th gear , 600 maybe 4th, 400 could be 5th pinned and barely roll off.
- **600/midsize:** Gear: 1000s in 4th gear , 600 maybe 4th, 400 could be 5th pinned and barely roll off.
- **300/small:** Gear: 1000s in 4th gear , 600 maybe 4th, 400 could be 5th pinned and barely roll off.
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Turning in too early and hitting that kerb (which can bounce the bike off-line), or conversely, apexing too late and missing the camber window – you’ll run wide onto the outside curb which, with less banking, can be sketchy.

## BEND_INT_S09 — Turn 12
**Shape:** Straight / link
**Priority / what matters:** left-hand corner that leads onto the back straight. This is a heavy braking zone but slightly downhill or flat, and as Winterbottom notes, “the exit here has no run off” – so any mistake at exit can be costly. Exit: Prioritize a clean exit – as you stand the bike up, feed in throttle and use the full track width at...
**Stable reference points:** Hug the inside at the apex, but watch the curb; beyond it is dirt with very little paved runoff.; Exit: Prioritize a clean exit – as you stand the bike up, feed in throttle and use the full track width at exit (there is no extra asphalt outside the curb, so you must flirt right to the edge of that curb).
**Hazards / surface:** This is a heavy braking zone but slightly downhill or flat, and as Winterbottom notes, “the exit here has no run off” – so any mistake at exit can be costly. Bikes will drop to around 100–110 km/h mid-corner (2nd gear for most classes).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** You won’t have a ton of time, so it’s a quick downshift or two (superbikes from 4th to 2nd) and a firm brake bite. Gear: 2nd gear for 1000s/600s; a 400 might even use 3rd if gearing is short (to avoid an extra shift) but likely 2nd as well for torque.
- **600/midsize:** Gear: 2nd gear for 1000s/600s; a 400 might even use 3rd if gearing is short (to avoid an extra shift) but likely 2nd as well for torque.
- **300/small:** Gear: 2nd gear for 1000s/600s; a 400 might even use 3rd if gearing is short (to avoid an extra shift) but likely 2nd as well for torque.
**Common mistakes:** This is a heavy braking zone but slightly downhill or flat, and as Winterbottom notes, “the exit here has no run off” – so any mistake at exit can be costly. Common mistakes: Not fully preparing the bike after Turn 11 – many riders are late to stabilise from the right flick and thus brake and turn for T12 in a hurry, leading to overshooting.
**Overtake / passing:** Passing: Turn 12 itself isn’t a major passing spot (since passing would mean lunging inside as someone comes off T11 lean – risky). But a better drive out of T12 can set you up to draft and pass on the back straight that follows.

## BEND_INT_S10 — Turn 13
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** end of the back straight. It’s unique because it goes uphill and features a camber change mid-corner . Entry is on-camber (so you can carry good speed in), but then the camber falls off on exit, almost like the corner “flattens out” or even off-cambers as it crests.
**Hazards / surface:** Entry is on-camber (so you can carry good speed in), but then the camber falls off on exit, almost like the corner “flattens out” or even off-cambers as it crests. Approach in 4th gear , then brake moderately – you’re dropping to about 130–135 km/h in the apex.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Gear: 1000s in 3rd gear typically (maybe high 3rd); 600 in 3rd; 400 could hold 4th if momentum allows or 3rd if needing grunt.
- **600/midsize:** Gear: 1000s in 3rd gear typically (maybe high 3rd); 600 in 3rd; 400 could hold 4th if momentum allows or 3rd if needing grunt.
- **300/small:** Gear: 1000s in 3rd gear typically (maybe high 3rd); 600 in 3rd; 400 could hold 4th if momentum allows or 3rd if needing grunt.
**Common mistakes:** Line: Because of the camber shift, a common tactic is to apex early-mid while the camber is helping, then be ready as the bike wants to drift out when the banking disappears. Speaking of which: any mistake through Turn 13 (e.g.
**Overtake / passing:** missed apex, too slow or too wide) “will offer an opportunity to pass at the next corner”.

## BEND_INT_S11 — Turn 14
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** Turn 13. It’s one of the slowest corners (around 80 km/h again) and definitely an overtaking spot if you have a run. You’re still leaned right exiting 13, so you have to upright and brake quickly.
**Stable reference points:** So your braking marker should be conservative – perhaps a shade earlier than you think, especially on worn tires.; If you’re trying to pass someone, you need to be significantly alongside at turn-in or you’ll both tangle; as Winty noted, “if you’re going to make a move there you have to be a LOT quicker”.; There might be a cone or barrier marking the apex – clip it as you finish braking.
**Hazards / surface:** The track here is flat, maybe even slightly downhill into 14, with no helpful camber . But caution – coming off the slowest point, it’s easy to over-apply throttle and spin up or wheelie.
**Common mistakes:** A late apex is mandatory – otherwise you’ll either run off inside or overshoot outside. Common mistakes: Going in too hot (you’ll either overshoot wide – there is moderate runoff, but you’ll lose heaps of time – or you might tuck the front trying to hold a tight line).
**Overtake / passing:** If you’re trying to pass someone, you need to be significantly alongside at turn-in or you’ll both tangle; as Winty noted, “if you’re going to make a move there you have to be a LOT quicker”.

## BEND_INT_S12 — Turns 15–16
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** Turns 15 and 16, a pair of medium-speed bends that form an S-shape. These look like minor kinks on paper , but in reality they are real corners – “you cannot treat it as a kink… looks easier on track walk than when you’re at speed”. As soon as you exit 15, set up for Turn 16 (left).
**Stable reference points:** Line: use all the track between 15 and 16; drift out after 15 to the right-hand edge, then toss it left for 16, hitting the inside curb of 16 at the midpoint.; No real braking is needed for 16 if you got your speed right in 15 – you can carry significant speed and even accelerate through 16.
**Hazards / surface:** Many riders find a nice rhythm through 15-16 when done correctly: you flick right, apex, then left with maybe slight throttle lift and right back on gas through 16.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Gear: 1000cc likely 3rd gear through both; 600 maybe 3rd; 400 possibly 4th through 16.
- **600/midsize:** Gear: 1000cc likely 3rd gear through both; 600 maybe 3rd; 400 possibly 4th through 16.
- **300/small:** Gear: 1000cc likely 3rd gear through both; 600 maybe 3rd; 400 possibly 4th through 16.
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Misjudging Turn 15 – it tightens, so if you go in like a gentle kink, you’ll end up wide which ruins 16.

## BEND_INT_S13 — Turn 17
**Shape:** Straight / link
**Priority / what matters:** comes after a short burst out of 16. You’ll be accelerating out of Turn 16 (on a superbike perhaps up to 4th gear briefly, then back to 3rd or 2nd for 17). Line: Aim for a late apex again – the straight to the finish isn’t super long, but exit speed still matters for possibly defending into 18 or carrying momentum.
**Stable reference points:** Entry: There’s likely a 100 m board on the left; start braking hard as you approach it.
**Hazards / surface:** The corner is about as tight as Turn 14 (maybe slightly more open, but not by much).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** You’ll be accelerating out of Turn 16 (on a superbike perhaps up to 4th gear briefly, then back to 3rd or 2nd for 17).
- **300/small:** Exit: There’s only one more turn, so you can afford to give the throttle pretty hard on exit – any wheelspin here can be managed since tires don’t need to last beyond next 300 m.
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Getting greedy and overshooting (especially while attempting a pass).
**Overtake / passing:** This is a prime overtaking spot – a heavy braking into a slow corner after some high-speed bends. Many last-lap passes happen here.

## BEND_INT_S14 — Turn 18
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** that feeds onto the 1 km pit straight. Unlike many circuits with a super-slow final turn, Turn 18 at The Bend is a bit faster and flowing – about 120–125 km/h mid-corner for Superbikes. So it’s mostly an immediate left turn-in after exiting 17.
**Stable reference points:** Use all the exit curb if needed – just don’t run into the grass.; The pit wall will come up on your right as you drive out.
**Hazards / surface:** Also watch for highside risk – cold tires early in a session or worn tires later can spin up as you crank on throttle exiting onto the straight’s slight incline.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Unlike many circuits with a super-slow final turn, Turn 18 at The Bend is a bit faster and flowing – about 120–125 km/h mid-corner for Superbikes. Electronics (TC) will help on a 1000cc, but on a 600 or 400 it’s up to your wrist.
- **600/midsize:** Electronics (TC) will help on a 1000cc, but on a 600 or 400 it’s up to your wrist. Gear: 2nd or 3rd depending on bike torque – most 1000s will use 2nd for a punchy exit; a 600 might hold 2nd; a 400 could perhaps use 3rd if geared short to avoid an extra shift mid-straight.
- **300/small:** Electronics (TC) will help on a 1000cc, but on a 600 or 400 it’s up to your wrist. Gear: 2nd or 3rd depending on bike torque – most 1000s will use 2nd for a punchy exit; a 600 might hold 2nd; a 400 could perhaps use 3rd if geared short to avoid an extra shift mid-straight.
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Rushing in and missing the drive. Also watch for highside risk – cold tires early in a session or worn tires later can spin up as you crank on throttle exiting onto the straight’s slight incline.
**Overtake / passing:** It’s critical because it dictates your speed down the enormous straight (and thus your lap time and ability to pass/ defend into T1). Often, fights into Turn 18 can decide a race: “if someone passes at Turn 18 there could be an over and under on the run out”.
**Confidence:** Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).
