# Track Riding Knowledge Base — Mallala (Starter)

This file is intended for retrieval (RAG) in a custom GPT. It avoids fixed speeds/braking distances and uses **SegmentID** instead of relying on turn numbering.

## Numbering note

- Mallala turn numbering varies by map/provider. The **Mallala venue map** labels fewer turns than typical rider maps, while **Champions Ride Days** publishes a 9-turn map for track days.

- The draft guide you provided includes a section titled **“Turns 2–3 (Esses sequence)”**, but that appears to be a numbering/template mismatch relative to the Champions map and your rider description.

## MALLALA_S01 — Start/Finish → Turn 1 kink → setup into Turn 2

**Track:** Mallala Motorsport Park  
**Layout:** Full circuit  
**Direction (descriptor):** As per Champions map (arrow up main straight)


**Map numbering (Champions):** T1 (kink/approach) into T2  
**Official map numbering:** Varies (official map labels fewer turns)  
**Draft PDF numbering:** Draft: Turn 1 (right-hander) + Draft: Turns 2–3 (esses)


**Shape / type:** Kink / lead-in complex


### What matters
- Get the bike settled early; prioritize the line that gives you a clean, calm entry to the next left complex.

### Reference points (stable)

- Start/finish line; pit wall end; marshal post (add exact ID); edge of kerb start/end (add).

### Hazards / surface notes

- Draft mentions an apex bump at 'Turn 1' and that bumpy areas exist (validate on-bike).

### Bike-class notes

- **Superbike (1000):** Treat as stability-first. Brake/settle early if needed; avoid loading the front over bumps while turning.

- **Mid-size (600-ish):** Most braking upright; keep a little momentum to avoid dead-throttle; focus on line to next left.

- **Small (300-ish):** Momentum-first: minimize roll-off; prioritize a smooth arc that preserves speed.

### Common mistakes

- Over-commit to the kink and end up out of position for the next left; late/abrupt input over bumps.

### Overtake notes

- Generally not a safe dive area unless fully alongside early; better to focus on exit to set up the next braking zone.


**Confidence:** Medium (shape from Champions map; some hazards from draft need validation).  
**Source notes:** Champions Ride Days map for numbering; draft PDF text contains inconsistent numbering and an 'esses 2–3' description.

## MALLALA_S02 — Turn 2 (tight left on inner loop)

**Track:** Mallala Motorsport Park  
**Layout:** Full circuit  
**Direction (descriptor):** As per Champions map (arrow up main straight)


**Map numbering (Champions):** T2  
**Official map numbering:** Varies  
**Draft PDF numbering:** Possibly part of Draft 'Turns 2–3' or Draft 'Turn 4' depending on numbering


**Shape / type:** Tight left / hairpin-ish


### What matters
- Exit matters more than entry: aim for a late-ish apex that opens your drive toward the next section.

### Reference points (stable)

- Inside kerb beginning; outside exit kerb end; marshal post (add).

### Hazards / surface notes

- Potential bump/transition on entry/inside (validate).

### Bike-class notes

- **Superbike (1000):** Square it off if needed for a stable drive. Be deliberate with pickup/drive to avoid spin.

- **Mid-size (600-ish):** Blend corner speed + exit: carry speed in, but don't pinch the exit.

- **Small (300-ish):** Keep it rolling; avoid over-slowing—tiny mistakes here echo down the next run.

### Common mistakes

- Turning in early and pinching the exit; rushing throttle before the bike is pointed.

### Overtake notes

- Viable if there's a clear braking zone and the inside stays predictable; otherwise set up a cutback.


**Confidence:** Medium  
**Source notes:** Champions map geometry; class guidance is principle-based.

## MALLALA_S03 — Turn 3 (far-left end of top loop)

**Track:** Mallala Motorsport Park  
**Layout:** Full circuit  
**Direction (descriptor):** As per Champions map (arrow up main straight)


**Map numbering (Champions):** T3  
**Official map numbering:** Varies  
**Draft PDF numbering:** Draft: Turn 5 (Northern Hairpin) could correspond to a hairpin elsewhere—needs remap


**Shape / type:** Hairpin / 180-ish (map suggests tight end)


### What matters
- Get the bike turned efficiently and prioritize a strong, straight drive onto the long top section.

### Reference points (stable)

- End of kerb/paint; outside barrier alignment (add); marshal post (add).

### Hazards / surface notes

- If surface is narrow/bumpy, keep inputs smooth (validate).

### Bike-class notes

- **Superbike (1000):** Point-and-shoot. Control wheelspin on exit; pick up early.

- **Mid-size (600-ish):** Late apex helps exit; keep engine in meat of torque band.

- **Small (300-ish):** Maximize corner speed and exit—this feeds a long run where bigger bikes stretch legs.

### Common mistakes

- Over-slowing (300s); over-squaring and losing flow (600s); spinning/standing up too early (SBK).

### Overtake notes

- Classic brake-and-turn passing zone if run-off and sightlines are good.


**Confidence:** Low–Medium (needs rider validation of corner severity).  
**Source notes:** Champions map indicates a tight end-of-loop corner.

## MALLALA_S04 — Turn 4 (long top section / sweeper)

**Track:** Mallala Motorsport Park  
**Layout:** Full circuit  
**Direction (descriptor):** As per Champions map (arrow up main straight)


**Map numbering (Champions):** T4  
**Official map numbering:** Varies  
**Draft PDF numbering:** Draft: Turn 4 (Back Straight Sweeper)


**Shape / type:** Fast sweeper / long radius


### What matters
- Carry speed while keeping a line that preserves track width for the next right-side complex.

### Reference points (stable)

- Entry kerb start; mid-corner seam/patch (add); exit kerb start (add).

### Hazards / surface notes

- Crosswind/bumps can make it feel vague—stay loose and prioritize repeatability.

### Bike-class notes

- **Superbike (1000):** Throttle discipline: enough to keep settled; don't force the front on entry.

- **Mid-size (600-ish):** Use a late apex if it opens the next section; keep momentum.

- **Small (300-ish):** Often near-pinned if the line is clean—focus on smoothness and minimizing lean-angle corrections.

### Common mistakes

- Running wide and compromising next corner; abrupt throttle changes mid-lean.

### Overtake notes

- Usually not ideal unless there’s a big speed delta; safer to set up the next braking zone.


**Confidence:** Medium (aligns with draft concept of a long sweeper).  
**Source notes:** Draft PDF describes a long left sweeper; Champions map shows a long top segment.

## MALLALA_S05 — Turn 5 (top-right bend)

**Track:** Mallala Motorsport Park  
**Layout:** Full circuit  
**Direction (descriptor):** As per Champions map (arrow up main straight)


**Map numbering (Champions):** T5  
**Official map numbering:** Varies  
**Draft PDF numbering:** Draft: approaching the right-side run


**Shape / type:** Medium-speed bend / direction change


### What matters
- Prioritize exit line that gets you straight and stable onto the right-side run.

### Reference points (stable)

- Outside edge/paint; inside kerb (add).

### Hazards / surface notes

- May be dusty/off-line (common at sandy venues—validate at Mallala).

### Bike-class notes

- **Superbike (1000):** Stay composed; avoid aggressive turn-in that forces TC cuts on exit.

- **Mid-size (600-ish):** Smooth roll-on; keep the bike pointed early to gain speed on the run.

- **Small (300-ish):** Momentum; minimize lean-to-lean transitions.

### Common mistakes

- Turning too early and running out of exit; trying to pass mid-corner.

### Overtake notes

- Better on exit with drive rather than on entry.


**Confidence:** Low–Medium  
**Source notes:** Geometry inferred from Champions map; needs local rider notes.

## MALLALA_S06 — Turn 6 (right-side run / slight bend)

**Track:** Mallala Motorsport Park  
**Layout:** Full circuit  
**Direction (descriptor):** As per Champions map (arrow up main straight)


**Map numbering (Champions):** T6  
**Official map numbering:** Varies  
**Draft PDF numbering:** Draft: Turn 6 (kink/curve) possibly


**Shape / type:** Fast kink / setup


### What matters
- Be in the correct place early for the big braking zone into the bottom hairpin.

### Reference points (stable)

- Track edge line; braking board (if present); marshal post (add).

### Hazards / surface notes

- If camber changes or bumps exist, keep the bike neutral and avoid sudden inputs.

### Bike-class notes

- **Superbike (1000):** Short-shift if wheelspin; keep it stable for braking.

- **Mid-size (600-ish):** Use it to set the braking line; don't drift out unnecessarily.

- **Small (300-ish):** Mostly line/positioning; stay smooth to preserve speed.

### Common mistakes

- Late movement across track before the braking zone; adding unnecessary lean.

### Overtake notes

- No—focus on setup for next corner.


**Confidence:** Low–Medium  
**Source notes:** Segment scaffolding only; fill with rider reference points.

## MALLALA_S07 — Turn 7 (bottom-right hairpin)

**Track:** Mallala Motorsport Park  
**Layout:** Full circuit  
**Direction (descriptor):** As per Champions map (arrow up main straight)


**Map numbering (Champions):** T7  
**Official map numbering:** Varies  
**Draft PDF numbering:** Draft: Turn 7 (Southern Hairpin)


**Shape / type:** Tight hairpin / major braking


### What matters
- Consistency + exit. Get braking done earlier than you want, then turn once and drive out cleanly.

### Reference points (stable)

- Braking boards (if present); end of right-side wall/line; inside kerb start (add).

### Hazards / surface notes

- Downhill/weight transfer risk if approach falls away; risk of rear lightness (validate).

### Bike-class notes

- **Superbike (1000):** Brake stability is key; sacrifice entry speed to protect exit traction.

- **Mid-size (600-ish):** Controlled trail-brake if surface allows; aim late apex to open drive.

- **Small (300-ish):** Carry as much corner speed as you can without running wide; keep it flowing.

### Common mistakes

- Over-braking late; turning while still too loaded; missing the late apex and killing drive.

### Overtake notes

- Prime passing zone (classic hairpin) if the braking zone is predictable.


**Confidence:** Medium (hairpin + draft alignment).  
**Source notes:** Draft explicitly calls this Southern Hairpin; Champions map shows a major bottom hairpin.

## MALLALA_S08 — Turn 8 (bottom-mid kink / connector)

**Track:** Mallala Motorsport Park  
**Layout:** Full circuit  
**Direction (descriptor):** As per Champions map (arrow up main straight)


**Map numbering (Champions):** T8  
**Official map numbering:** Varies  
**Draft PDF numbering:** Draft: part of Turns 8–9 (esses onto main straight)


**Shape / type:** Kink / transition


### What matters
- Use it to position the bike for the last corner and maximize your drive onto the main straight.

### Reference points (stable)

- Kink apex kerb; seam/patch (add).

### Hazards / surface notes

- Undulation/compression mentioned in draft for final section (validate).

### Bike-class notes

- **Superbike (1000):** Keep body light; avoid harsh bar inputs if the bike moves around.

- **Mid-size (600-ish):** Smooth, quick transition; avoid extra steering corrections.

- **Small (300-ish):** Treat as momentum link—stay on a steady throttle where possible.

### Common mistakes

- Over-slowing and turning it into a 'corner' rather than a setup link.

### Overtake notes

- Not ideal; usually single line.


**Confidence:** Low–Medium  
**Source notes:** Draft describes a fast section into the straight; Champions map shows a wiggle before T9.

## MALLALA_S09 — Turn 9 (final corner onto main straight)

**Track:** Mallala Motorsport Park  
**Layout:** Full circuit  
**Direction (descriptor):** As per Champions map (arrow up main straight)


**Map numbering (Champions):** T9  
**Official map numbering:** Varies  
**Draft PDF numbering:** Draft: Turn 9 (tighter right-hander out of left kink)


**Shape / type:** Final turn / drive corner


### What matters
- Exit is everything: line it up so you can pick the bike up early and drive without drama.

### Reference points (stable)

- Inside kerb; track-out kerb start; pit entry/exit line (if present).

### Hazards / surface notes

- Draft mentions a compression/dip on exit of final corner (validate).

### Bike-class notes

- **Superbike (1000):** Be patient until you can pick it up; manage wheelspin/wheelie; use full exit.

- **Mid-size (600-ish):** Balance: carry speed but still prioritize drive; smooth roll-on.

- **Small (300-ish):** High corner speed + early throttle; avoid running wide because you can’t ‘power out’ to fix it.

### Common mistakes

- Early apex and running out of road; rushing throttle while still leaned on a bumpy exit.

### Overtake notes

- Usually ‘no’—too risky to pass on the outside on exit. Better to set up a draft on the straight.


**Confidence:** Medium  
**Source notes:** Draft describes a critical final turn; Champions map indicates last corner before main straight.

## Seed rider note (attribution)

- **User-provided:** “Turn 1 is a right kink with dip then a double apex left followed by a straight to the southern hairpin… there are no esses 2–3.”
