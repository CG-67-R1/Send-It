## MALLALA_S00 — Overview & key themes
**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** Mallala Motorsport Park (SA) Mallala is a 2.6 km, 9-10 turn circuit in South Australia known for its flat layout and heavy braking zones . The track surface is generally bumpy in places, notably a bump at the apex of Turn 1 and a compression dip exiting the final corner.
**Stable reference points:** Big bikes approach at high speed (~200+ km/h) and must brake hard (around the 200m marker for a 1000cc) to about 3rd gear for this medium-speed right.; Braking markers: there are boards (150m/100m) – a 600cc might brake around the 100m, a 1000cc around 120m mark to be safe.; Braking: markers at 100m/50m – a 600cc can go to ~75m, a literbike should brake by 100m because the approach is still quite fast.
**Hazards / surface:** The track surface is generally bumpy in places, notably a bump at the apex of Turn 1 and a compression dip exiting the final corner.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Good brake cooling and pad life are essential on superbikes here. Big bikes approach at high speed (~200+ km/h) and must brake hard (around the 200m marker for a 1000cc) to about 3rd gear for this medium-speed right.
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size 600cc bikes should do most braking upright then ease off as you tip in, aiming to carry momentum. Braking markers: there are boards (150m/100m) – a 600cc might brake around the 100m, a 1000cc around 120m mark to be safe.
- **300/small:** Small bikes (300cc) can often take Turn 1 with just a slight roll-off, maintaining high corner speed. Small bikes can often take this flat-out, maximizing drive onto the straight.
**Overtake / passing:** The track is also relatively narrow (about 8-10 m wide) which demands precise lines and can make passing challenging. After a long fast run, this is a prime overtaking spot requiring hard braking from top speed.
**Confidence:** Medium (overview from uploaded guide; corner sequence corrected based on rider note).
**Source notes:** Source: Motorcycle Track Guides_ Mallala, Mac Park, One (Wakefield), Morgan Park, Wanneroo (1).pdf. Note: rider correction—Mallala T1 described as right kink with dip → double-apex left; no 2–3 esses.

## MALLALA_S01 — Start/Finish → Turn 1 kink → setup into Turn 2
**Shape:** Kink / lead-in complex
**Priority / what matters:** Get the bike settled early; prioritize the line that gives you a clean, calm entry to the next left complex.
**Stable reference points:** Start/finish line; pit wall end; marshal post (add exact ID); edge of kerb start/end (add).
**Hazards / surface:** Draft mentions an apex bump at 'Turn 1' and that bumpy areas exist (validate on-bike).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Treat as stability-first. Brake/settle early if needed; avoid loading the front over bumps while turning.
- **600/midsize:** Most braking upright; keep a little momentum to avoid dead-throttle; focus on line to next left.
- **300/small:** Momentum-first: minimize roll-off; prioritize a smooth arc that preserves speed.
**Common mistakes:** Over-commit to the kink and end up out of position for the next left; late/abrupt input over bumps.
**Overtake / passing:** Generally not a safe dive area unless fully alongside early; better to focus on exit to set up the next braking zone.
**Confidence:** Medium (shape from Champions map; some hazards from draft need validation).
**Source notes:** Champions Ride Days map for numbering; draft PDF text contains inconsistent numbering and an 'esses 2–3' description.

## MALLALA_S02 — Turn 2 (tight left on inner loop)
**Shape:** Tight left / hairpin-ish
**Priority / what matters:** Exit matters more than entry: aim for a late-ish apex that opens your drive toward the next section.
**Stable reference points:** Inside kerb beginning; outside exit kerb end; marshal post (add).
**Hazards / surface:** Potential bump/transition on entry/inside (validate).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Square it off if needed for a stable drive. Be deliberate with pickup/drive to avoid spin.
- **600/midsize:** Blend corner speed + exit: carry speed in, but don't pinch the exit.
- **300/small:** Keep it rolling; avoid over-slowing—tiny mistakes here echo down the next run.
**Common mistakes:** Turning in early and pinching the exit; rushing throttle before the bike is pointed.
**Overtake / passing:** Viable if there's a clear braking zone and the inside stays predictable; otherwise set up a cutback.
**Confidence:** Medium
**Source notes:** Champions map geometry; class guidance is principle-based.

## MALLALA_S03 — Turn 3 (far-left end of top loop)
**Shape:** Hairpin / 180-ish (map suggests tight end)
**Priority / what matters:** Get the bike turned efficiently and prioritize a strong, straight drive onto the long top section.
**Stable reference points:** End of kerb/paint; outside barrier alignment (add); marshal post (add).
**Hazards / surface:** If surface is narrow/bumpy, keep inputs smooth (validate).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Point-and-shoot. Control wheelspin on exit; pick up early.
- **600/midsize:** Late apex helps exit; keep engine in meat of torque band.
- **300/small:** Maximize corner speed and exit—this feeds a long run where bigger bikes stretch legs.
**Common mistakes:** Over-slowing (300s); over-squaring and losing flow (600s); spinning/standing up too early (SBK).
**Overtake / passing:** Classic brake-and-turn passing zone if run-off and sightlines are good.
**Confidence:** Low–Medium (needs rider validation of corner severity).
**Source notes:** Champions map indicates a tight end-of-loop corner.

## MALLALA_S04 — Turn 4 (long top section / sweeper)
**Shape:** Fast sweeper / long radius
**Priority / what matters:** Carry speed while keeping a line that preserves track width for the next right-side complex.
**Stable reference points:** Entry kerb start; mid-corner seam/patch (add); exit kerb start (add).
**Hazards / surface:** Crosswind/bumps can make it feel vague—stay loose and prioritize repeatability.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Throttle discipline: enough to keep settled; don't force the front on entry.
- **600/midsize:** Use a late apex if it opens the next section; keep momentum.
- **300/small:** Often near-pinned if the line is clean—focus on smoothness and minimizing lean-angle corrections.
**Common mistakes:** Running wide and compromising next corner; abrupt throttle changes mid-lean.
**Overtake / passing:** Usually not ideal unless there’s a big speed delta; safer to set up the next braking zone.
**Confidence:** Medium (aligns with draft concept of a long sweeper).
**Source notes:** Draft PDF describes a long left sweeper; Champions map shows a long top segment.

## MALLALA_S05 — Turn 5 (top-right bend)
**Shape:** Medium-speed bend / direction change
**Priority / what matters:** Prioritize exit line that gets you straight and stable onto the right-side run.
**Stable reference points:** Outside edge/paint; inside kerb (add).
**Hazards / surface:** May be dusty/off-line (common at sandy venues—validate at Mallala).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Stay composed; avoid aggressive turn-in that forces TC cuts on exit.
- **600/midsize:** Smooth roll-on; keep the bike pointed early to gain speed on the run.
- **300/small:** Momentum; minimize lean-to-lean transitions.
**Common mistakes:** Turning too early and running out of exit; trying to pass mid-corner.
**Overtake / passing:** Better on exit with drive rather than on entry.
**Confidence:** Low–Medium
**Source notes:** Geometry inferred from Champions map; needs local rider notes.

## MALLALA_S06 — Turn 6 (right-side run / slight bend)
**Shape:** Fast kink / setup
**Priority / what matters:** Be in the correct place early for the big braking zone into the bottom hairpin.
**Stable reference points:** Track edge line; braking board (if present); marshal post (add).
**Hazards / surface:** If camber changes or bumps exist, keep the bike neutral and avoid sudden inputs.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Short-shift if wheelspin; keep it stable for braking.
- **600/midsize:** Use it to set the braking line; don't drift out unnecessarily.
- **300/small:** Mostly line/positioning; stay smooth to preserve speed.
**Common mistakes:** Late movement across track before the braking zone; adding unnecessary lean.
**Overtake / passing:** No—focus on setup for next corner.
**Confidence:** Low–Medium
**Source notes:** Segment scaffolding only; fill with rider reference points.

## MALLALA_S07 — Turn 7 (bottom-right hairpin)
**Shape:** Tight hairpin / major braking
**Priority / what matters:** Consistency + exit. Get braking done earlier than you want, then turn once and drive out cleanly.
**Stable reference points:** Braking boards (if present); end of right-side wall/line; inside kerb start (add).
**Hazards / surface:** Downhill/weight transfer risk if approach falls away; risk of rear lightness (validate).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Brake stability is key; sacrifice entry speed to protect exit traction.
- **600/midsize:** Controlled trail-brake if surface allows; aim late apex to open drive.
- **300/small:** Carry as much corner speed as you can without running wide; keep it flowing.
**Common mistakes:** Over-braking late; turning while still too loaded; missing the late apex and killing drive.
**Overtake / passing:** Prime passing zone (classic hairpin) if the braking zone is predictable.
**Confidence:** Medium (hairpin + draft alignment).
**Source notes:** Draft explicitly calls this Southern Hairpin; Champions map shows a major bottom hairpin.

## MALLALA_S08 — Turn 8 (bottom-mid kink / connector)
**Shape:** Kink / transition
**Priority / what matters:** Use it to position the bike for the last corner and maximize your drive onto the main straight.
**Stable reference points:** Kink apex kerb; seam/patch (add).
**Hazards / surface:** Undulation/compression mentioned in draft for final section (validate).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Keep body light; avoid harsh bar inputs if the bike moves around.
- **600/midsize:** Smooth, quick transition; avoid extra steering corrections.
- **300/small:** Treat as momentum link—stay on a steady throttle where possible.
**Common mistakes:** Over-slowing and turning it into a 'corner' rather than a setup link.
**Overtake / passing:** Not ideal; usually single line.
**Confidence:** Low–Medium
**Source notes:** Draft describes a fast section into the straight; Champions map shows a wiggle before T9.

## MALLALA_S09 — Turn 9 (final corner onto main straight)
**Shape:** Final turn / drive corner
**Priority / what matters:** Exit is everything: line it up so you can pick the bike up early and drive without drama.
**Stable reference points:** Inside kerb; track-out kerb start; pit entry/exit line (if present).
**Hazards / surface:** Draft mentions a compression/dip on exit of final corner (validate).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Be patient until you can pick it up; manage wheelspin/wheelie; use full exit.
- **600/midsize:** Balance: carry speed but still prioritize drive; smooth roll-on.
- **300/small:** High corner speed + early throttle; avoid running wide because you can’t ‘power out’ to fix it.
**Common mistakes:** Early apex and running out of road; rushing throttle while still leaned on a bumpy exit.
**Overtake / passing:** Usually ‘no’—too risky to pass on the outside on exit. Better to set up a draft on the straight.
**Confidence:** Medium
**Source notes:** Draft describes a critical final turn; Champions map indicates last corner before main straight.
