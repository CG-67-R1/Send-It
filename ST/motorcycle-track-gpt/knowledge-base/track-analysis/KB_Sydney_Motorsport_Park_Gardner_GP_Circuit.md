**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** Sydney Motorsport Park (NSW) Track Guide Sydney Motorsport Park (Gardner GP Circuit) layout. Track Map & Layout: Sydney Motorsport Park’s 4.5 km Gardner GP circuit features 11 turns, combining fast sweepers with a few tight bends.

**Stable reference points:** Elevation changes are mild – a gentle rise over the tunnel between Turns 3–4 and a crest exiting Turn 11 onto the straight.; On a 1000cc superbike you’ll reach 4th or 5th gear before braking after the pit wall ends (roughly ~150m marker for superbikes, ~100m for 600s ).; Apex late at the inside curb once past the bump, then drift out.
**Hazards / surface:** The surface is smooth but bumpy in spots (notably entering Turn 1 over old dragstrip bumps ). Elevation changes are mild – a gentle rise over the tunnel between Turns 3–4 and a crest exiting Turn 11 onto the straight.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** On a 1000cc superbike you’ll reach 4th or 5th gear before braking after the pit wall ends (roughly ~150m marker for superbikes, ~100m for 600s ). Expect wheelspin on superbikes until fully upright.
- **600/midsize:** On a 1000cc superbike you’ll reach 4th or 5th gear before braking after the pit wall ends (roughly ~150m marker for superbikes, ~100m for 600s ). First gear on 600s, second gear on 1000s (to avoid excessive torque) is typical.
- **300/small:** Common Mistake: Braking too early or hard – it’s surprising how deep you can go at ~300 km/h. Riding Tips by Class: - 300–400cc (Small Bikes): Lower power means you can often take Turn 1 nearly flat out – minimal braking, just a roll-off.
**Common mistakes:** Common Mistake: Braking too early or hard – it’s surprising how deep you can go at ~300 km/h. Sacrifice entry speed slightly – many crash 1 2 1 3 2 4 5 6 7 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 from charging in too hot.
**Overtake / passing:** A good Turn 1 is crucial for a fast lap and sets up passing into Turn 2. A strong drive out of T2 can set up a pass into Turn 3.

## SMP_S01 — Turn 1
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** 4th or 5th gear before braking after the pit wall ends (roughly ~150m marker for superbikes, ~100m for 600s ). Only a light brake is needed; carry high entry speed. Instead, settle the bike and trust the wide exit.
**Stable reference points:** 4th or 5th gear before braking after the pit wall ends (roughly ~150m marker for superbikes, ~100m for 600s ).; Apex late at the inside curb once past the bump, then drift out.; Reference: the pedestrian bridge – you flash under it aiming at the ocean skyline.
**Hazards / surface:** Only a light brake is needed; carry high entry speed. The bike may feel light over a mid-corner bump , so stay loose.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** 4th or 5th gear before braking after the pit wall ends (roughly ~150m marker for superbikes, ~100m for 600s ).
- **600/midsize:** 4th or 5th gear before braking after the pit wall ends (roughly ~150m marker for superbikes, ~100m for 600s ).

## SMP_S02 — Turn 2 (Southern Hairpin)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** hard in a straight line (down to 2nd gear) and release brakes early to roll speed through this long turn . Aim to clip an early apex, let the bike drift out at mid-corner , then tighten to a late second apex on exit . Short-shift on exit if needed to keep the rear hooked up.
**Overtake / passing:** A strong drive out of T2 can set up a pass into Turn 3.
**Confidence:** Low–Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).

## SMP_S03 — Turn 3: A medium-speed right leading over the tunnel.  First right-hander of the lap
**Shape:** Straight / link
**Priority / what matters:** right side of your tire is warmed by now. Enter T3 from the far left. Apex late to straighten the exit toward Turn 4.
**Stable reference points:** On big bikes wheelies are an issue over the tunnel rise, so modulate throttle.
**Hazards / surface:** It’s slightly uphill and blind; as you crest, the front may go light. On big bikes wheelies are an issue over the tunnel rise, so modulate throttle.
**Overtake / passing:** Good exit drive here can enable an inside pass into T4.

## SMP_S04 — Turn 4: A right-hand sweeper (Corporate Hill entry). Early apex over an inside bump
**Shape:** Sweeper
**Priority / what matters:** falls away slightly, so expect momentary loss of grip. Keep tight all through T4 to position for the immediate left Turn 5.

## SMP_S05 — Turn 5: A fast left flick uphill. As you flick left, throttle on even before the apex
**Shape:** Corner / complex
**Priority / what matters:** provides grip. Use all the track; you should drift out onto the exit curb if done right.

## SMP_S06 — Turn 6 (BMW / MotoRide corner)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** Downshift to 2nd gear . The entry is straightened out now, but a late apex is critical. As you exit T6, the track starts a crucial acceleration zone – a strong drive here sets up overtaking into Turn 9.

## SMP_S07 — Turn 7 (Corporate Hill): A long, blind right over a rise. Sacrifice entry speed slightly
**Shape:** Corner / complex
**Priority / what matters:** 1 2 1 3 2 4 5 6 7 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 from charging in too hot. Tip in late over the crest so the bike settles, then get back on throttle immediately. The corner falls downhill at exit.
**Stable reference points:** Visual marker: the corporate suites (or former hill) on the inside can be a guide but focus on the pavement.
**Hazards / surface:** Tip in late over the crest so the bike settles, then get back on throttle immediately.

## SMP_S08 — Turn 8: Really just the slight right kink on the short chute to Turn 9
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** work through this kink as long as you brake hard in a straight line for Turn 9.
**Confidence:** Low–Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).

## SMP_S09 — Turn 9 (Hairpin): A sharp right hairpin at bottom of hill. Very fast approach
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** turning (only light braking needed once turning). Many passes happen by out-braking someone here. Early throttle on exit for drive toward Turn 10.
**Stable reference points:** Once turned, hug the curb.
**Hazards / surface:** turning (only light braking needed once turning).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** First gear on 600s, second gear on 1000s (to avoid excessive torque) is typical.
- **600/midsize:** First gear on 600s, second gear on 1000s (to avoid excessive torque) is typical.
**Common mistakes:** Tip: Don’t grab a big brake input right at turn-in – one rider learned the hard way with a crash here.

## SMP_S10 — Turn 10
**Shape:** Corner / complex
**Priority / what matters:** right – it’s easy to unsettle. Clip the inside without hitting the high inner curb (on production bikes, hard parts can touch). Drive out wide to the exit curb, then quickly bring the bike back left for T11.
**Stable reference points:** Clip the inside without hitting the high inner curb (on production bikes, hard parts can touch).; Drive out wide to the exit curb, then quickly bring the bike back left for T11.

## SMP_S11 — Turn 11 (Final corner)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** the track aside from T1 because exit speed here determines your entire front straight speed. Turn in late from far right, aiming to “V” the corner: get it stopped, pointed, then hard throttle on. It’s slightly off-camber , and there’s a small crest on exit, so the front may lift as you accelerate hard down the hill .
**Stable reference points:** Use all exit curb.
