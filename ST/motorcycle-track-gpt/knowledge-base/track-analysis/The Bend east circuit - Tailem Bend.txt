The Bend east circuit - Tailem Bend, SA.


CORNER CLUSTER PLAN (Actual Map Reference)
✅ Sector 1 – Heavy Start + Flow (T1–T6)

T1: Heavy braking. Long trail. Apex late. Exit to mid-left.

T2: Short burst, brake hard. Apex early, then float to T3.

T3: Flick left. Blind. Aim for curb mid-turn. Don’t overslow.

T4–T5: Classic esses. Look through T5 as you enter T4.

T6: Slight kink. Stay calm. Commit throttle early for long drive to T7.

🧠 Mental shortcut: “Brake → Flow → Drift”
→ Treat T1–T3 as “point and punch”, then flow through 4–6

✅ Sector 2 – Rhythm + Reset (T7–T13)

T7: Big stop. Downhill. Brake hard but don’t trail deep.

T8–T9: Apex early both. Look early. Bike needs to float.

T10–T11: Right-left. Elevation. Apex late into 11.

T12–T13: Easy to lose rhythm. Don’t rush T12 — it sets T13.

🧠 Mental shortcut: “Reset → Rhythm → Recover”
→ Focus on posture here. Body movement sets up the rhythm.

✅ Sector 3 – Blind Bends + Finish Drive (T14–T22)

T14–T15–T16: Triple flick. Start wide. Late apex every one.

T17–T18: Right-left. T17 is critical — early throttle here sets up T18.

T19–T20: Deceptive. Brake late for T20.

T21–T22: Last right hairpin. Big exit drive. Don’t apex early.

🧠 Mental shortcut: “Patience → Pivot → Power”
→ Take your time into 17, then commit throttle on exit to start-finish
