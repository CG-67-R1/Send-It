**Stable reference points:** Wanneroo Raceway (WA) – Barbagallo Wanneroo Raceway (formerly Barbagallo) in Western Australia is a 2.41 km clockwise circuit known for its natural sand-hill terrain, featuring significant elevation changes including the famous “Basin” (Kolb Corner) and a high-speed hilltop sequence.; Superbikes might brake at around the 150m board, drop one gear and tip in around 160+ km/h.; Line: aim inside early (there’s a curb/apex on right) and let the bike drift out mid-corner .
**Hazards / surface:** Wanneroo Raceway (WA) – Barbagallo Wanneroo Raceway (formerly Barbagallo) in Western Australia is a 2.41 km clockwise circuit known for its natural sand-hill terrain, featuring significant elevation changes including the famous “Basin” (Kolb Corner) and a high-speed hilltop sequence. It’s a busy, demanding track with a bit of everything: a fast Turn 1, a steep drop into a bowl hairpin (Turn 6), and a final sweeping turn onto the straight .
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes might brake at around the 150m board, drop one gear and tip in around 160+ km/h. A superbike might even wheelie slightly cresting here; short-shift or lean forward to keep it down.
- **600/midsize:** T3 itself has some camber and is not too tight – you could take it in say 3rd gear on a 600. Mid bikes (600): focus on mid-corner front grip – this corner demands trust in the front tire.
- **300/small:** Small bikes may not brake at all. Small bikes: you can be more aggressive – later braking (less mass to manage), and you might even be able to trail brake deep because the banking will catch you.
**Common mistakes:** Sand runoff areas mean any off-line excursions can be perilous (the sand traps here are deep and unforgiving). If you run wide, you’ll hit the curbing or sandy runoff; many crashes happen from running off here.
**Overtake / passing:** If riding the motorcycle short circuit, T3 might be bypassed, but on full course you have this right- left combo.

## WANNEROO_S01 — Turn 1 (“Cat Corner”)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** It’s a sweeping turn that you enter at high speed after the ~800m straight. There is a dip as you turn in, and the outside of the turn has been known to accumulate dust (from drift events or wind blowing sand). The corner has a bit of camber on entry that goes neutral on exit.
**Stable reference points:** Superbikes might brake at around the 150m board, drop one gear and tip in around 160+ km/h.; Line: aim inside early (there’s a curb/apex on right) and let the bike drift out mid-corner .; If you run wide, you’ll hit the curbing or sandy runoff; many crashes happen from running off here.

## WANNEROO_S02 — Turn 2
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** layouts; in the motorcycle layout it might be counted if a chicane was added, but traditionally Turn 2 is a sweeping left that transitions from the T1 exit towards the back section. It’s taken flat out usually. No braking for T2 per se; focus on positioning for Turn 3.
**Hazards / surface:** The main challenge in this area is setting up for the next corner and dealing with the crest – the bike may get light after T1 into T2. A superbike might even wheelie slightly cresting here; short-shift or lean forward to keep it down.

## WANNEROO_S03 — Turn 3
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** with Turn 4. Essentially, after the gentle left kink (T2), you flick right for T3, which leads into a quick left T4.
**Hazards / surface:** Braking: a slight dab for T3 as needed.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **600/midsize:** T3 itself has some camber and is not too tight – you could take it in say 3rd gear on a 600.
- **300/small:** Small bikes may not brake at all.

## WANNEROO_S04 — Turn 4
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** slightly toward the “Basin” hairpin. Turn 4 is usually taken with just a lean flick; any braking you do for T3 covers T4 as well. So get the bike to the right at T3 exit, then cut T4 left, and drift out right again after it.
**Hazards / surface:** slightly toward the “Basin” hairpin.

## WANNEROO_S05 — Turn 5
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** straight segment. I’ll interpret Turn 5 as the braking zone approach to the Basin.
**Stable reference points:** Use the right side of track, there might be brake markers (100m, 50m).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** The straight isn’t very long, so on a superbike you only have a second or so before you must clamp down from maybe ~180+ km/h.
**Confidence:** Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).

## WANNEROO_S06 — Turn 6 (“Kolb Corner” a.k.a. “The Basin”)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** of a hill, heavily banked like a bowl. Locals call it “The Basin” because you drop into it and climb out. Mid bikes (600): focus on mid-corner front grip – this corner demands trust in the front tire.
**Hazards / surface:** Locals call it “The Basin” because you drop into it and climb out. For bikes: approach is downhill, so braking is tricky – your rear lightens (it will slide or wag if you’re hard on brakes).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: brake a bit earlier than you think, because going downhill reduces braking effectiveness. Superbikes: as you pick up throttle, the bike will want to squat deep in the rear because of the banking and climb (the rear “rolls over” as Frosty said).
- **600/midsize:** Mid bikes (600): focus on mid-corner front grip – this corner demands trust in the front tire.
- **300/small:** Small bikes: you can be more aggressive – later braking (less mass to manage), and you might even be able to trail brake deep because the banking will catch you.

## WANNEROO_S07 — Turn 7
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** gentle left curve which is Turn 7. It’s taken flat out; the main thing is that near the crest after T7, you have to set up for the final turn.
**Stable reference points:** Superbike/1000cc: likely a significant crest – many riders will short-shift or roll a fraction to keep wheel down, then back on throttle.
**Hazards / surface:** It’s taken flat out; the main thing is that near the crest after T7, you have to set up for the final turn. Also, as you crest Turn 7, bikes often go light or wheelie (this might actually be the infamous “jump” section that caused safety concerns years ago for bikes).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbike/1000cc: likely a significant crest – many riders will short-shift or roll a fraction to keep wheel down, then back on throttle.
- **300/small:** Small bikes: full throttle, minimal drama.

## WANNEROO_S08 — Turn 8 (Final Corner)
**Shape:** Sweeper
**Priority / what matters:** that leads onto the pit straight. It’s a bit banked on entry and has a dip (known historically as “The Bowl” as well by some, but let’s avoid confusion – we already have a bowl). Plus, this corner tightens a bit late and the exit drops away (which can cause wheelspin or wheelies).
**Stable reference points:** Braking: There’s usually a brake marker ~100m.; Line: aim a little early apex then hold tight – you don’t want to run wide mid-corner or you’ll hit exit curb oddly.; Use all the exit – there’s concrete run-off which is often used; just be mindful of any dust there.
**Hazards / surface:** It’s a bit banked on entry and has a dip (known historically as “The Bowl” as well by some, but let’s avoid confusion – we already have a bowl). The corner is tricky: you come in from a crest, needing to brake and turn left while going downhill.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** 600/1000: get the bike turned and squared up for exit because the main straight is short-ish but you still need a drive. Set up for good mid-corner stability (a little softer front maybe because they don’t have as extreme weight shift as 1000s).
- **600/midsize:** The corner radius is such that it’s about medium speed (say 3rd gear on a 600). 600/1000: get the bike turned and squared up for exit because the main straight is short-ish but you still need a drive.
- **300/small:** 57 15 Classes:Lightweights – exploit the nimbleness in Basin and quick flick T3-T4. srsltid=AfmBOooCOxDLEa2MGlmuXMdcaQryMSJKw2REICgtjTeNcYscVgGZ1n0F BigPond 400 - The Official Site of Mark Winterbottom https://markwinterbottom.com/events/races/2008/5/bigpond-400 Wanneroo Raceway - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanneroo_Raceway 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 10 8 9 11 12 13 14 15 37 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 72 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 33 34 35 36 68 69 70 71 20 32 38 58 59 61 60 63 64 65 66 67 62 17
**Common mistakes:** Any mistake here (missing apex, etc.) costs your drive and hence lap time. Brakes: heavy duty pads – Turn 6 is known for making cars/bikes overshoot if brakes fade.
