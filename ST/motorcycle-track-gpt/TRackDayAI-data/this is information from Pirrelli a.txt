Certainly, the images you've uploaded appear to be from Pirelli's technical documentation for their Diablo Superbike motorcycle tires. I will interpret the images and convert the information presented into text for you.

Image 1: Diablo Superbike - Front Tire Compound Characteristics

SC1: Offers high performance with a strong contact feeling.
SC2: Optimized for stability and consistency.
SC3: Balances performance with endurance.
The diagram shows overlapping areas between SC1 and SC2, SC2 and SC3, suggesting that there are compounds with characteristics that provide a mix of the primary benefits of adjacent compounds.

Image 2: Diablo Superbike - Rear Tire Compound Characteristics

SC0: Special compound for high performance on smooth tarmac.
SCX: Extreme performance compound for smooth tarmac.
SC1: Versatile compound for varied track conditions.
SC2: Durable compound designed for severe tarmac and higher temperatures.
SC3: Compound focused on endurance and cooler temperatures.
The diagram includes a gradient from 'Cold' to 'Hot', indicating the operating temperature ranges of the compounds, with SC2 and SC3 being suitable for hotter conditions, while SCX and SC0 are indicated for cooler conditions on smooth tarmac.

Image 3: Recommended Tire Pressures

Provides recommended rim sizes for front and rear tires, ranging from 100/80 - 10 inches to 200/65 R 17 inches.
Specifies cold pressure recommendations without tire warmers and hot pressure recommendations after using tire warmers, in both psi and bar measurements.
Also indicates that for some tire sizes, using warmers for 50 minutes at 80 degrees Celsius (176 degrees Fahrenheit) is optional.
For example, a 120/70 R 17 front tire has a recommended rim size of 3.50 inches, with cold pressure recommendations of 1.6/1.8 bar (23/26 psi) and hot pressure recommendations of 1.7/1.9 bar (25/28 psi).

can you list all the information specifically in text? the only relevant tyres sizes needed are 125/70  R 17 and 190/60 R 17. the data is to be put into text for a GPT AI to read
are you able to provide me with technical data on the 2022 Yamaha R6?

The 2022 Yamaha YZF-R6, available in the GYTR and Race versions, comes with a strong racing heritage and is designed for track use. Here are the combined technical data from the sources consulted:

Engine: It's powered by a liquid-cooled, DOHC, forward-inclined parallel 4-cylinder engine with a displacement of 599cc. The engine's bore and stroke measure 67.0 x 42.5 mm, and it has a high compression ratio of 13.1:1. This setup allows the engine to produce a maximum power of 87.1 kW (118.4 PS) at 14,500 rpm and a maximum torque of 61.7 Nm at 10,500 rpm.

Chassis: The motorcycle has a diamond-type frame, a caster angle of 24º, and a trail of 97 mm, providing sharp handling characteristics. For suspension, it has telescopic forks with a 43 mm diameter at the front and a swingarm (link suspension) at the rear, each offering 120 mm of travel.

Brakes and Tires: Braking is managed by hydraulic dual discs of 320 mm at the front and a single 220 mm disc at the rear. The front tire size is 120/70 ZR17M/C (58W), and the rear tire size is 180/55 ZR17M/C (73W), both tubeless.

Dimensions and Capacities: The overall length of the bike is 2,040 mm, the width is 695 mm, and the height is 1,150 mm. The seat height is set at 850 mm, with a wheelbase of 1,375 mm and a minimum ground clearance of 130 mm. The wet weight (including all fluids and a full fuel tank) is 190 kg. It has a fuel tank capacity of 17 liters and an oil tank capacity of 3.4 liters.

Electronics and Extras: The GYTR version is equipped with a suite of racing-oriented parts, including a GYTR ECU for adjustable fuel injection and ignition timing, a PC interface cable, and a GYTR ABS Emulator. It also features a racing fuel cap, stainless steel brake line set, race rear sets, a reverse shifting kit, and more.

Aesthetics: The bodywork of the GYTR model is supplied in white primer, ready for custom race livery. It also includes a race seat and is prepped with a complete race cowling kit.

Please note that these models are race-spec and are not street-legal as they are tailored for track use and racing competitions. The detailed specifications and the variety of specialized GYTR parts highlight the R6's focus on performance and customization for professional racing environments​
