- In this video, we're gonna be taking a look at tyres.
Specifically, we're gonna take a look at
the different types of tyre wear
that you can find across different track day
and racing paddocks to give you a better idea
on what they mean and what you can do to fix them.

So my intention here is to help you learn more
about performance riding tyre wear,
so that you're better equipped
to deal with any nasty where should you encounter it.
However, the nature of this subject is quite complex,
and oftentimes, the cause and fix
of certain way isn't always clear cut.
With that said, please take this as a more
simplified Beginner's Guide to tyre wear,
not the definitive manual.
And lastly, before we jump into the first type,
I wanted to quickly give credit to
Dave Moss of Dave Moss Tuning.
Everything that's gone into this video
and the article that is based on has come from the mountains
of advice that Dave has given over the years.
Dave is the man when it comes to tyre wear,
suspension tuning and bike setup.
So if you want to learn more about this subject,
then check him out through the various channels
which I've linked in the description down below.
Okay, with all of that said,
I'm now gonna jump behind the screen to kick this off.
Cold Tear
So the first couple we're gonna look at are probably
the most common you see around track day paddocks,
and they're typically caused by incorrect tyre pressures.
The first is cold tear,
Cold tear is caused by the tyre being over inflated.
When the tyre is over inflated,
the contact patch on the ground is too small,
so it cannot generate heat that is widespread enough
to bring the carcass of the tyre
up to operating temperature.
Instead, what happens is the surface of the tyre
super heats very quickly while the carcass stays
below operating temperature
meaning the surface of the tyre is ripped straight off.
As for the symptoms,
the tears associated with cold tear
are quite deep into the carcass
and a somewhat fingernail shaped.
If you can get your fingernail out under them
and almost peel a sizable chunk of the rubber back,
then this is a surefire sign of cold tear.
The next common type is hot tear.
Hot tear is caused by the tyre being under inflated,
and under inflated tyre
causes the contact patch to be too large on the ground,
which in turn means the tyre overheats.
When the whole of the tyre overheats,
the surface gets hot and is melted off very quickly
and is pitched away due to the centrifugal force
created when the tyre spins.
At first glance, it's quite similar to cold tear,
but because the whole tyre is overheating,
instead of just the surface,
the rubber comes off with less effort
as opposed to being ripped off a cold carcass
like you see with cold tear,
which means hot tearing isn't as deep,
and those are the symptoms you can expect to find.
As I said, it doesn't take much for the surface rubber
to come off of an under inflated tyre
because the whole tyre is overheating.
So the tears on a tyre experiencing hot tear
are fairly shallow and more spread out
and you shouldn't be able to get your fingernail
deep under them like you can with cold tear.
You may also notice looking at the tyre that the tears
come down into the center of it
in an arc shape because of that centrifugal force.
Suspension
Okay, now we're gonna move on
to suspension related tyre wear.
When we start talking about suspension
and how incorrect settings can affect tyre wear,
it's difficult to explain what symptoms mean what,
because not every form of wear is unique
to one particular component of the suspension.
However, what I want to give you here,
is an outline of some points that should help you
better determine if your tyre problems
could possibly be suspension related.
If your suspension settings,
meaning rebound, compression, sag or spring rate
are incorrectly set to the point
where they're asking the tyre
to act as part of the suspension,
you are immediately going to see unusual wear or tearing
because the tyre simply
wasn't designed to be used in that way.
To the untrained eye, tyre wear brought on
from incorrect suspension could quite easily be palmed off
as a pressure related problem.
But there are some differences and some questions
you can ask yourself to get you started
on the right path to fixing it.
First is, do you know if you have the correct spring?
If your spring is either too hard
or too soft for your weight,
the carcass of the tyre will be put under a lot of strain
because it's being asked to act
as a significant part of the suspension.
This means the tyre ends up quickly
shredding itself to pieces because of the incorrect loads.
Is the affected area uniform in width?
Have a look at the thickness of the tear,
if you notice the width of the tear is not uniform
and changes considerably as you follow it around the tyre,
then this is a good indicator
that something is wrong with the suspension,
usually rebounds being out of adjustment.
Does the tear go all the way around?
If it does, that may be poor tyre pressure or geometry.
However, if it doesn't,
and you follow the tear around the tyre
to notice that it's not continuous,
meaning there's an affected area,
then a sizable area where it's clean,
then some more damage, then it goes clean again,
this is another indicator that a suspension setting is out,
most probably rebound or compression
or even a combination of them both
Are the edges of the tread raised?
If you have a raised area on either the leading
or back edge of the tread,
this is a strong sign that rebound damping on the forks
or Shock is set either too fast or too slow.
Usually, if it's on the leading edge, rebound is too slow,
and if it's on the back edge, it's too fast.
by answering these questions,
you should be able to determine
whether or not you have a suspension related issue.
Geometry Tear
Next, we're gonna move on to Geometry tears.
Specifically, these tears can come from
poor weight distribution as a result of your setup.
First, not enough weight on the front.
This type of wear is not quite as common
as things like hot and cold tear,
as it comes from incorrect geometry set up
which usually affects the front tyre.
What you see in the picture
is a result of there not being enough weight on the tyre,
so it cannot get to operating temperature.
This means it cannot get proper grip or traction,
and as a result, the front tyre pushes
and drags across the ground
when the rider gets on the throttle,
rather than rolling over it as it should.
The surface then gets super heated and subsequently torn up.
With not enough weight on the front,
what you'll see is a much smaller band of tearing
that looks very similar to hot tear on a rear tyre.
Only the band will be about five to 10 millimeters thick,
usually about halfway between
the center of the tyre and the edge.
Also, it will typically be uniform
all the way around the tyre.
And the second of the geometry tears we're gonna look at,
is a result of too much weight on the front.
What happens in this instance is that
when you start to steer the bike and lean it into a corner,
because of the excessive weight on the front,
it will actually plow across the ground rather than rolling
and it's only when you finished leaning the bike
and you get back to the throttle that you take weight
away from the front and the tyre is relieved.
As well as having too much weight on the front,
this type of tear can often be caused by the front end
being too soft in conjunction with too much weight.
As for symptoms with too much weight on the front,
it will be the edge third of the tyre
that is showing signs of incorrect wear.
So the affected area is quite large.
If your tyre is showing bad wear patterns on the edge third,
where the start of the wear,
that's the bit closest to the middle of the tyre
follows the circumference of the tyre uniformly,
you can be pretty sure you're suffering from geometry tear
and have too much weight on the front.
Tire Discoloration
Okay, so this next thing we're gonna talk about
isn't so much about wear,
but more so a common question you see about tyres,
and that is tyre discoloration,
specifically when the tyres turn blue.
This is a question you often see come up from a rider
that's recently used the tyres
and they've let the tyres cool,
and many would suggest that the tyres are finished,
but this isn't completely true.
So what makes it blue?
Tyres actually contain oils that help keep them soft,
and the Bluey greeny tint that you see on the tires
is just the oil was coming to the surface.
So why are they on the surface?
After the tyres have been used
to the point where they gain significant heat.
When they cooled down again,
the oils in the tyre will often come to the surface.
When you go back out and ride the bike again,
these surface oils are scrubbed off
and it's only when you come back in
and let the tyres cool down again,
that you'll see more oils coming to the surface.
Each time you take the tyre through this heat cycle,
you are losing the oils that keep the tyre soft.
That's why the more heat cycles a tyre has been through,
the less effective the rubber is going to be for you.
Okay, the last thing I wanted to cover here
is what we want to see from our tyres,
and it looks something like this,
if you have a pattern like this,
which looks like a beach where the tide has gone out,
your tyres are wearing nicely.
Now, this doesn't mean to say that they'll give you
absolute optimum performance.
For instance, races will often sacrifice tyre life
for better performance,
but it does mean that you're likely to see
great longevity from your tyre.
Okay, that covers our look
at many of these surface level issues
that you may find with your tyres.
Once again like I said up top,
this is a fairly simplified guide to tyre wear and tearing
is there are normally a multitude of factors
that can come into play,
things like pressures, suspension makeup,
how the riders ride the bike
and even the nature of the track that you're riding.
So my only intention here
is to give you some baseline knowledge
so that you can head in the right direction
to getting your tyre problems fixed.
