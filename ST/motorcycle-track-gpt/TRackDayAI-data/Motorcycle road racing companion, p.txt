Thanks for sharing your session data. Based on your settings, here are a few suggestions and considerations:

Sprocket Ratio: Your 45/15 setup gives a ratio of 3. This generally affects your top speed and acceleration. Adjusting this can improve acceleration off the corners or top speed on the straights, depending on your circuit.

Front Suspension:

Spring Rates & Air Gap: Your spring rates are different left (90) to right (95), which is not uncommon to address circuit-specific demands or rider preference. Ensure it delivers the balance you seek. Your air gap at 220 mm might influence the fork's bottoming resistance; adjust as needed based on track layout and riding style.
Preload, Compression, and Rebound: Given your preload is at 7, and both compression and rebound settings are at 15, it suggests a middle-ground setup. Depending on feedback, you might want to adjust preload to fine-tune sag and then compression/rebound to manage handling during corner entry, through the turn, and on exit.
Rear Suspension:

Spring Rate and Shock Length: A 90 spring rate and 292 mm shock length indicate your rear setup's baseline. Consider whether the bike's ride height and geometry align with your needs, as these can influence corner entry and exit stability.
Preload, Compression, and Rebound: Your settings lean towards a firmer setup that could improve responsiveness but might sacrifice some grip or comfort depending on track conditions. Adjust based on feedback from the rear tire and chassis behavior during acceleration phases.
Tire Pressures: Your tire pressures are typical for the compounds mentioned — SC1 front at 36 psi and SC0 rear at 22 psi. Tire pressures are critical for optimal grip, wear, and handling. Monitor tire condition post-session to decide if adjustments are needed.

Considering track conditions, temperatures, and your personal riding feedback, these settings provide a starting point. Adjustments should be made based on the specific demands of the track you're racing on, the ambient and track temperatures, and your personal preference for bike handling. It's essential to make one change at a time and document the outcomes to understand the effect clearly.

Do you have any specific concerns or areas you're looking to improve in your setup?

I've reviewed the files and based on the provided information, here's a summary and analysis focusing on areas where you might want to consider adjustments for optimal performance:

General Suspension Setup
Sprockets: Your 45/15 ratio suggests a focus on acceleration. Depending on the track's requirements, you may want to adjust this ratio to either improve top speed or further boost acceleration.
Front Suspension:
Springs Rate (LH 90, RH 95) & Air Gap (220): This setup, alongside the preload of 7, suggests a stiffer front end to support aggressive braking and corner entry. You might consider equalizing spring rates if you experience uneven wear or instability.
Compression & Rebound (15 each): A balanced setup, but if the bike feels too harsh over bumps or too slow to recover from dips, consider softening compression and/or rebound respectively. Use the guide from "Motorcycle Suspension: - A Troubleshooting Guide" for more detailed adjustment instructions .
Rear Suspension:
Spring Rate (90) & Shock Length (292): Indicates a setup aimed at stability and control at the expense of some plushness. Adjust the shock length for geometry changes if needed for corner entry/exit behavior.
Preload (11), Compression (12), Rebound (10): This setup points toward a relatively firm suspension aimed to enhance rear stability. Adjust based on traction feedback, reducing rebound if the rear feels harsh or bouncy.
Tyre Pressures
null.

Data Interpretation from Sessions
The data from "Coop136.txt" indicates various segments and lap times, showing detailed speed, acceleration, and possibly suspension performance through telemetry data .

To interpret and apply this to your suspension setup:

Analyze sections where speed drops or increases significantly—does this correlate with handling issues that could be addressed with suspension adjustments?
Use lap segment times to identify areas for improvement. Are some corners slower due to lack of confidence in front or rear stability? Adjust suspension settings to target these areas.
Review the provided guide's troubleshooting section to diagnose specific handling issues based on your telemetry data.
Specific Adjustments
Based on your feedback, if the bike is understeering (running wide), consider softening the front compression or increasing the rear rebound slightly.
For oversteering or rear instability, reduce the rear suspension's compression or rebound.
Safety remains paramount; any adjustments should be tested in controlled conditions. Adjust one setting at a time and test to isolate the effects of each change.

we have just remove 10mm of oil height from the front forks to help with steering. We are looking for any insights you can offer for the rider about his riding

Road Race Setup KB
12 Jul 2024, 12:55
Reducing the oil height in your front forks by 10mm is an adjustment aimed at impacting the front suspension's air spring effect, particularly at the end of the fork's travel. Lowering the oil height generally makes the forks softer towards the end of the compression stroke. Here's how this change could affect the bike's handling and performance, along with some insights for the rider:

Effects on Handling:
Improved Compliance: The front end may absorb bumps and irregularities better, especially under hard braking or when riding over curbs. This could lead to improved tire contact with the track and potentially more grip.
Easier Turning: A softer fork towards the end of its travel can make the bike easier to turn by allowing more front-end dive under braking, which reduces the rake angle and makes the steering quicker.
Potential Bottoming Out: With less oil, the risk of bottoming out increases, particularly if the rider is aggressive on brakes or hits deep compressions at high speed. The rider should be attentive to any harsh impacts or the feeling of the front end 'bottoming out.'
Riding Insights:
Take Advantage of Improved Turning: Encourage the rider to experiment with braking points and turning inputs. The bike might settle into corners more predictively, enabling more aggressive corner entries.
Monitor Front End Feedback: The rider should pay close attention to how the front end feels, especially under heavy braking and through bumpy sections. Improved compliance means better feedback, which could allow finer control over the front tire’s grip limit.
Adjust Riding Style if Necessary: If the front end feels noticeably softer and more compliant, adapting the riding style to exploit this added grip and stability could yield faster lap times. This might mean braking later, carrying more speed into corners, or altering lines to take advantage of the improved handling.
Watch for Signs of Bottoming Out: If the rider experiences the front end bottoming out, they should report it immediately. While a certain amount of front end dive is desirable for better cornering, too much can lead to loss of control or damage to the forks.
Supplementary Adjustments:
Preload and Compression: If bottoming out becomes an issue, consider increasing the preload or compression damping slightly to compensate. However, do so carefully to preserve the newly gained compliance and steering characteristics.
Rebound Damping: Since the forks might compress more easily, ensure the rebound damping is set appropriately to prevent the forks from rebounding too quickly, which could upset the bike's stability.
This adjustment can significantly improve how the bike handles, particularly in terms of steering response and front-end feel, which are crucial for rider confidence and lap times. As with any change, it's vital to proceed with testing incrementally and adjust based on rider feedback and observed performance on the track.

Let's observe how these changes influence the rider's experience and whether further adjustments are required based on the rider's feedback.

From the documents reviewed and the complaints your rider has about the bike's behavior, particularly the twitchiness tipping into corners and running wide out of corners under power, here are the tailored insights and adjustments you should consider:

Twitchiness Tipping into Corners:

This can be caused by too much front end stiffness or an overly aggressive steering geometry. Consider softening the front suspension slightly, either by reducing preload or compression damping, to allow more compliance. The fork oil adjustment you made, by removing 10mm of oil, should in theory help with this by making the forks softer, potentially addressing part of this issue .
Ensure the front and rear suspension settings are balanced. An imbalance can cause unexpected handling characteristics. Given the adjustments, verify that the rear suspension is not too soft or too stiff compared to the front, which may exacerbate turning issues .
Running Wide Out of Corners Under Power:

This problem often links back to insufficient rear grip or excessive squat, causing the front end to lighten and lose directional control. Fine-tuning the rear suspension by adjusting the squat characteristics can help. This includes increasing the rear shock's preload or compression damping to control squat under acceleration. The specific adjustments to rear rebound and compression damping will help manage how the bike behaves under power .
Consider looking at the geometry; lowering the rear or raising the front slightly can sharpen steering responses and help mitigate running wide. The changes to oil height in your forks will alter the front end's behavior but pay close attention to the bike's overall geometry as you make these adjustments .
A comprehensive approach considering both setup adjustments and the rider's adaptability to these changes is essential. It's notable that track familiarity, rider input consistency, and confidence in the bike's reactions are equally crucial. As the rider becomes more accustomed to the bike's feedback and handling with the setup adjustments, encourage focus on consistent entry speed, lean angles, and throttle application to mitigate twitchiness and running wide.

Given that the rider identified specific issues, this feedback should direct your initial focus. However, it's critical to proceed with one change at a time and assess its impact before implementing another to ensure you're moving towards the desired handling characteristics, not away from them.

We are about to start day 2 and our first session will be qualifying, new tires will be on the bike

Road Race Setup KB
13 Jul 2024, 06:53
With the start of Day 2 and qualifying on the horizon, here are some recommendations for making the most out of your new tires and setup adjustments:

Pre-Qualifying Checklist:
Tire Preparation: Ensure your new tires are correctly mounted, balanced, and set to the recommended pressure for your conditions. Given Pirelli SC1 front and SC0 rear, consider starting with pressures around 36 psi for the front and 22 psi for the rear, then adjust based on ambient and track temperature. New tires will offer peak grip, but make sure to give them a proper warm-up.
Suspension Recheck: After adjusting your fork oil height and considering any other feedback-based changes, recheck all your suspension settings (preload, compression, rebound) to ensure they align with your targeted handling characteristics.
Bike Geometry: Double-check the bike's geometry, especially if you've made any adjustments to the fork height or rear shock settings. The bike's stance can significantly affect handling and stability.
Rider Preparation: Remind the rider to focus on the feel of the bike during the out-laps, particularly how the new tires and any setup changes are affecting grip, steering, and stability. Quick feedback during or after qualifying can be crucial for any last-minute tweaks before races.
Strategy for Qualifying:
Warm-Up Strategy: Use the initial laps to gradually bring the tires up to operating temperature. Avoid pushing too hard too soon to prevent premature wear or loss of grip.
Session Pacing: Plan your qualifying strategy around track density and timing. Find clear space on the track to set uninterrupted laps. With tire performance in mind, your best lap times might come in the middle of the session once the tires are at optimum temperature.
Adapt to Setup Changes: Encourage the rider to adapt their riding style according to the feel and feedback from the bike with the new suspension settings. This might involve adjusting braking points, corner entry speed, and throttle application exiting turns.
Feedback and Adjustment: Immediate feedback from the rider post-qualifying is invaluable. This feedback will guide any further tuning or tire pressure adjustments needed before the races.
Remember, the qualifying session is not just about setting the fastest time but also about optimizing the bike and rider combination for the best race performance. Keep communication open, and ensure the rider feels confident with the bike's setup.

Best of luck with your qualifying! If there's any other advice or support you need, feel free to ask.

The rider had trouble washing off a crash from the end of yesterday. The bike has had quite a bit of repair including some minor electrical. The rider complained of the bike cutting out in many sections under full throttle. The rider also complained of the bike wanting to tuck the front and then chatter wide. We found the front wheel was dragging the brake. When the front wheel was lifting under acceleration, the wheel speed would drop quickly causing the traction control to activate and cut throttle. The rider has also complained that the ride is rough. The front fork was reaching full stroke in 1 location so a turn of preload has been added and 2 turns of compression.

The issues you've described point to both mechanical and setup concerns that need immediate attention. Addressing the rider's feedback and the bike's behavior post-repair is crucial for both safety and performance. Here's a breakdown of the problems and suggested actions:

Electronic / Throttle Cut Issue
The bike cutting out under full throttle, especially if linked to front wheel lift and subsequent traction control (TC) intervention, suggests a calibration or sensor issue. Given the recent crash and repairs:

Check Sensor Alignment: Ensure wheel speed sensors and any related wiring are intact, properly connected, and correctly aligned. Misalignment or damage can cause faulty readings leading to inappropriate TC activations.
TC Settings: Review traction control settings to ensure they're appropriate for the conditions. Excessively sensitive TC, especially with altered wheel speeds due to lifting, can trigger premature cutouts. Adjust TC settings to better match current track conditions and bike behavior.
Diagnostic Check: Perform a comprehensive diagnostic to check for any fault codes or irregularities in the engine management system that could indicate unresolved electrical issues from the crash repair.
Mechanical / Brake Drag Issue
The front wheel dragging is a significant safety concern and can directly affect bike handling:

Brake Inspection: Thoroughly inspect the front brake system (calipers, pads, discs, and lines) for any signs of damage or misalignment. Ensure there's no hydraulic pressure buildup that could lead to brake drag.
Wheel and Hub Inspection: Check the front wheel bearings and hub for damage or misalignment, which could also contribute to dragging. Ensure the wheel spins freely when lifted off the ground.
Suspension and Handling Issues
With the rider experiencing front-end tuck, chatter, and a rough ride, alongside the bike reaching full fork compression:

Preload and Compression Adjustment: While you've added preload and compression to address full stroke issues, ensure this doesn't overly stiffen the front end, exacerbating chatter and rough ride complaints. It's important to find a balance that supports the bike under braking without making the front suspension too unyielding.

Fork Oil and Seal Check: Post-crash, check the condition of the fork oil, seals, and overall fork integrity. Leaking oil or damaged seals can dramatically affect performance and handling.

Chassis Geometry: Re-examine the bike's overall geometry. The added preload and compression will alter the front end height and weight distribution, potentially affecting handling dynamics. Consider if a balance needs to be struck between improving braking stability and maintaining cornering performance.

Tire Pressure & Suspension Feedback: Given the track temperature and the described handling issues, reassess tire pressures in conjunction with suspension changes. Lower track temperatures can affect tire performance, potentially leading to the described front-end behaviors. Lower pressure might help but monitor closely for undue wear or instability.

Communication with the rider is paramount. Review the changes made, explain the rationale, and ask for detailed feedback after each adjustment. The rider's confidence and ability to provide clear, actionable feedback will be critical in diagnosing and addressing the issues effectively.

Given the severity of the issues mentioned, prioritizing safety and ensuring a thorough check and adjustment process before pushing for performance are essential.

The rider wasnt happy with the direction of the bike changes. We had conversations about the stiffening the rear to stop running wide out of a corner on throttle. The Coach believes the bike setup is correct. The cornering problem is the rider. not leaning the bike enough into the corner and then leaning to maximum to correct the trajectory. By this time the corner is wrong. We are at a different track that is tricky on a 600. The instruction to the rider is to lean the bike more sooner and stay at lean longer. warm up session is next and then 2 races today.

Given the feedback from the coach and the issues faced during setup changes, focusing on rider technique, particularly in terms of corner entry and lean management, seems to be the next constructive step. Here are some suggestions to support the rider through the warm-up session and races, ensuring both bike and rider are optimized for the current track:

Rider Technique Focus:
Lean Early and Maintain: Encourage the rider to lean the bike earlier into the corner. This will help achieve the required trajectory without the need to correct midway through the corner, which can upset the bike's balance and lead to running wide.
Smooth Inputs: Emphasize the importance of smooth throttle, brake, and steering inputs. Abrupt changes can unsettle the bike, especially at lean. Smoothness aids in maintaining traction and control.
Visual Cues: Remind the rider to use visual cues effectively. Looking through the corner and focusing on the exit can naturally improve body positioning and lean angle, aiding in smoother corner navigation.
Trust the Bike: Rebuilding rider confidence might be necessary, especially after a negative experience. Assuring the rider that the bike setup is optimized and encouraging trust in the bike's capability to handle lean and throttle application is crucial.
Bike Setup Reevaluation:
While the bike's setup, as per the coach, is considered correct, ensuring it's indeed optimized for the current track and rider's style is crucial. Here are areas to double-check or adjust based on the warm-up session feedback:

Rear Suspension Setup: With previous discussions on stiffening the rear to address issues with running wide, closely monitor the bike's behavior after instructing the rider on leaning more into the corners. The adjustments might still be beneficial, but the effectiveness will now also depend significantly on the rider's ability to adapt their technique.
Tyre Pressures and Temperamentals: Given the different track and potentially different weather conditions, reassess tire pressures to ensure they're suited for the track temperature and the rider's style. Adjustments here can significantly affect grip and handling.
Warm-Up Observations: Use the warm-up session to closely observe the bike's behavior and the rider's adaptation to the instruction. Any additional feedback can guide last-minute tweaks before the races.
Communication and Support:
Feedback Mechanism: Establish a clear and positive feedback mechanism for the rider to communicate their feelings about the bike's behavior post-warm-up. Use this to make any necessary adjustments before the races.
Positive Reinforcement: Support the rider mentally and emotionally, reinforcing the belief in their skills and the bike's capabilities. Confidence plays a significant role in how well a rider can adapt and perform.
Encouraging the rider to focus on their learning and applying the instructions regarding lean angles and trajectory management will be key. The goal is to ensure the rider feels supported and confident in making the necessary adjustments to their riding style, complementing the bike's setup.

Best of luck with the warm-up session and the races today. Keep the lines of communication open, focus on positive reinforcement, and be prepared to make incremental adjustments based on real-time feedback.
