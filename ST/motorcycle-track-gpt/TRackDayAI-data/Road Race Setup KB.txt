Great, you're looking to tune Bike 57, the Yamaha R6, at the Sydney Motorsport Park today using its base setting as a starting point. Here's how we can proceed to optimize the bike's performance:

Gather Data: Before making adjustments, it's crucial to gather data on how the bike is performing with its current base settings. This could include lap times, rider feedback, tire temperatures, suspension travel, and telemetry data if available.

Identify Goals: Determine what improvements are desired from the tuning session. This could range from better handling and cornering, increased acceleration and top speed, or more stable braking. The goals will guide the adjustments you make.

Adjustment Areas: Based on the goals and initial data gathered, identify which areas of the bike you'll want to focus on. Possible areas include suspension settings (spring preload, compression, and rebound damping), tire pressures, gear ratios, and electronic settings such as traction control and engine mapping.

Plan the Session: Organize the session into runs, allowing for changes and sufficient track time to assess their effects. Ensure you document each change made and its impact on the bike's performance.

Implement Changes Gradually: Make adjustments in small increments, one variable at a time. This approach helps isolate the effects of each change and understand how different adjustments interact with each other.

Continuous Feedback Loop: After each run, gather data and feedback, analyze it, and decide on the next set of adjustments. It's a continuous process of tweak, test, and review.

Document Everything: Keep a detailed log of all the settings tested, the conditions (like weather and track temperature), rider impressions, and the performance indicators. This will be invaluable for future reference and as a foundation for further improvements.

If you have specific data from today's runs, or if there are particular aspects of the bike's performance you're looking to improve, please share, and I can provide more targeted advice or calculations to assist with the tuning process.

Given the specifics of the track conditions and your bike, here's how you should approach tire choice and pressures for your Yamaha R6 at Sydney Motorsport Park:

Tire Choice
Given the grippy surface, ambient temperature of 20 degrees Celsius, and track temperature of 28 degrees Celsius, you're operating in a fairly moderate temperature range. Considering this:

Front Tire: For the front tire, the SC1 compound would be suitable as it offers high performance with a strong contact feeling. The SC1 is versatile and should provide good grip and feedback in the moderate temperatures you're experiencing.

Rear Tire: For the rear tire, the SC1 compound appears to be the most versatile option for varied track conditions. It strikes a balance between performance, grip, and durability, making it a good choice for the conditions mentioned.

Tire Pressure
Front Tire Pressure: Since you're likely looking for a balance between grip and stability, setting your front tire (125/70 R 17) to the higher end of the recommended hot pressure after warmers at 36 psi would be ideal. Without warmers, aim for 32 psi cold pressure.

Rear Tire Pressure: For the rear tire (190/60 R 17), given the warmer track conditions but still relatively moderate, you could opt for the higher end of the hot pressure after warmers recommendation at 28 psi. Without warmers, aim for 26 psi cold pressure.

Additional Considerations
If possible, use tire warmers for 50 minutes at 80°C before your runs to ensure your tires reach their optimal operating temperature and pressure right from the start.
Monitor tire behavior closely during initial runs. If you notice any issues with grip or tire wear, consider adjusting pressures slightly within the given ranges. However, make small changes to avoid negatively impacting the bike's handling.
These recommendations aim to balance grip, tire wear, and performance under the described conditions. Once you've had a chance to test these settings, evaluate the bike's behavior and feel free to fine-tune from there.

With your Yamaha R6 equipped with Ohlins FKR for the front and TTX at the rear, you're already set up with top-notch suspension components known for their adjustability and performance. To optimize these for your track day at Sydney Motorsport Park under the given conditions (grippy surface, ambient temperature of 20 degrees Celsius, track temperature of 28 degrees Celsius), let's consider some setting recommendations based on common issues you might encounter and their solutions provided in the suspension document:

Front Suspension (Ohlins FKR)

Lack of Rebound: If the front end of the bike feels mushy and loses traction easily, especially when riding aggressively, this indicates insufficient rebound damping. The bike might understeer, or the front might feel unstable. Increase the rebound damping gradually until you achieve optimal control and traction, without the front end chattering or bouncing.

Too Much Rebound: A harsh ride at the front, feeling as if the fork locks up on rough pavements, suggests too much rebound damping. This can lead to instability under hard acceleration. Gradually decrease rebound damping until the front end provides a compliant ride without being overly harsh.

Lack of Compression: Excessive front-end dive under braking, a mushy feeling, or bottoming out implies insufficient compression damping. Increase compression damping together with adjusting the front fork oil level for a firmer, more controlled ride.

Too Much Compression: If the ride feels overly harsh, with the front end riding too high in corners, reduce compression damping. Adjust to ensure the bike doesn't bottom out but also doesn't ride too high, maintaining optimal steering geometry and control.

Rear Suspension (Ohlins TTX)

Lack of Rebound: A plush ride at cruising speed that turns wallowy and unstable at a faster pace could be due to insufficient rebound damping at the rear. Increase the rebound damping to eliminate wallowing/weaving and ensure the rear end doesn't kick back too quickly, upsetting the chassis.

Too Much Rebound: If the rear end feels stiff and uncompliant, possibly causing the bike to run wide in corners due to the rear "packing down," reduce rebound damping. This will prevent the rear from becoming overly harsh and improve traction over bumps.

Lack of Compression: Too much squat under acceleration and difficulty steering out of corners signal insufficient compression damping at the rear. Increase compression damping to balance squat, ensuring the bike maintains good control and traction.

Too Much Compression: An overly harsh ride at the rear, especially when encountering bumps at speed, suggests too much compression damping. Decrease this until the harshness decreases, optimizing traction and prevent the rear from kicking up.

Given these general guidelines, it's important to approach adjustments gradually and methodically, focusing on one setting at a time to isolate its effects. Start with a baseline setting and adjust based on feedback from the bike's performance on the track. Document all changes meticulously to understand the influence of each adjustment and to establish a setup that's tailored to your riding style and the current track conditions.

the rider has completed a session and the tyres have a feathered rear edge on the rear tyre. through some of the tighter corners the rider suggests the bike doesnt feel very stable, maybe a bit spingy. do you have any suggestions?

The symptoms you've described—feathered rear edges on the tire and instability through tight corners—suggest two main areas of focus: tire conditions and rear suspension settings. Let's tackle each issue and provide potential adjustments to improve stability and handling for your Yamaha R6 equipped with Ohlins suspension.

1. Tire Conditions and Pressure
Feathered edges on a rear tire could result from several factors, including improper suspension setup (particularly rebound damping), incorrect tire pressure, or aggressive riding style. Since you've already selected your tires based on the conditions, make sure the tire pressures are still optimal given the feedback from the session. It might be worthwhile to slightly adjust the tire pressures if they're not within the recommended range for the track and ambient conditions.

2. Rear Suspension Tuning
The feel of instability and a bike feeling "springy" through corners can often be linked to improper suspension settings—most notably, the rebound damping on the rear shock (Ohlins TTX). Here's how you can adjust:

Increase Rear Rebound Damping: If the rear end of the bike feels springy, it might be rebounding too quickly. This rapid extension can cause a loss of traction and instability, especially through tighter corners. Try increasing the rebound damping on the Ohlins TTX rear shock to slow down the rate at which the shock extends. This should help maintain more consistent rear tire contact with the track surface, improving stability.

Adjust Rear Compression Damping: Additionally, it might be beneficial to adjust the rear shock's compression damping. If the bike is squatting too much under acceleration out of corners or not maintaining a stable line through the corner, consider increasing the compression damping. This will make the rear end firmer during the compression phase, potentially contributing to a more stable ride through corners.

Suspension Geometry and Balance: Make sure that any adjustments to the rear suspension are balanced with the front suspension settings to maintain the bike’s overall balance and geometry. An imbalance can contribute to handling quirks.

Implementing Adjustments
Start with small incremental adjustments to the rear rebound damping, and if needed, adjust the rear compression damping.
After each adjustment, have the rider complete a session and provide feedback on the changes. It’s critical to adjust one setting at a time to isolate its effect.
Pay careful attention to tire wear and pressures post-session as they provide valuable clues about the bike's interaction with the track surface.
Final Note
Given the intricate nature of motorcycle suspension tuning, it's often a process of trial and feedback with iterative adjustments. Maintaining open communication with the rider about how the bike feels after each adjustment is crucial to dial in the perfect setup for their riding style and the track conditions.
