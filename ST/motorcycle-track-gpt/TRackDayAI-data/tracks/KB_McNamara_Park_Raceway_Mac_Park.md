## MACPARK_S00 — Overview & key themes
**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** MacNamara Park “Mac Park” (SA) McNamara Park (“Mac Park”) is a 2.4 km motorcycle-only circuit near Mount Gambier , SA, featuring 12 corners and notable elevation changes. It’s a dedicated bike track with a recently fully resurfaced 10m-wide tarmac, so grip is generally very good. Riders will encounter blind rises, off-camber turns, and frequent...
**Stable reference points:** Pick a reference, like a tree or flagpole beyond the crest, to aim your turn-in.; The good news: Turn 8 has good banking (the track designers knew bikes would be flying here).; Reference: there’s a braking marker near a marshal hut – on a 600cc start braking at that marker; on a superbike, brake a bit earlier until you gauge it.
**Hazards / surface:** The layout is undulating and technical, mixing slow hairpins with fast sweepers over crests. Riders will encounter blind rises, off-camber turns, and frequent direction changes, so a nimble setup and good suspension compliance are key here.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes must square off this hairpin: get the bike stopped, quick steering input to snap it around, and then drive out. Superbikes should be cautious of wheelspin on landing from T2’s crest – feed in throttle once the suspension settles, then flick right.
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size 600s should brake hard and deep (watch for slightly uneven pavement transitions at the turn-in – the new surface is smooth but there’s often dust off-line from the nearby camping area). 600s: be mindful that the exit drops downhill, so any mid- corner speed too high will push you wide when the camber disappears.
- **300/small:** Small bikes can be very aggressive here – you might not even need first gear as their corner speed is higher; focus on a late apex to carry speed out. Lightweight bikes can take T2 nearly full throttle, as their lower power won’t launch them over the crest too violently.
**Confidence:** Medium (overview extracted from uploaded guide; validate on-track markers).

## MACPARK_S01 — Turn 1 (Hairpin aka “The Hairpin”)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** hand hairpin (nearly 180°). It’s very slow – likely 2nd gear on most bikes, maybe 1st on a big bike. Small bikes can be very aggressive here – you might not even need first gear as their corner speed is higher; focus on a late apex to carry speed out.
**Hazards / surface:** Heavy braking is needed but the braking zone is slightly uphill, which helps slow the bike (use the incline to your advantage). Mid-size 600s should brake hard and deep (watch for slightly uneven pavement transitions at the turn-in – the new surface is smooth but there’s often dust off-line from the nearby camping area).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes must square off this hairpin: get the bike stopped, quick steering input to snap it around, and then drive out.

## MACPARK_S02 — Turns 2–3
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** hairpin, accelerate and spot the crest ahead – T2 goes over a blind rise. All bikes should keep a tight line through T2 (hug the inside left) because as you crest, the bike may unload. There’s not much braking here, it’s more about line: exit T3 on the left side of the track, which positions you for Turn 4.

## MACPARK_S03 — Turn 4 (Left-hander)
**Shape:** Corner / complex
**Priority / what matters:** falls away at exit. It’s a classic “tip in and tighten” corner . 600s: be mindful that the exit drops downhill, so any mid- corner speed too high will push you wide when the camber disappears.
**Hazards / surface:** Small bikes: trail brake slightly and cut a smooth arc – you have the advantage of less weight, so carry speed. 600s: be mindful that the exit drops downhill, so any mid- corner speed too high will push you wide when the camber disappears.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** 1000s: Approach in maybe 3rd gear , drop to 2nd, and don’t be greedy with speed.
- **600/midsize:** 600s: be mindful that the exit drops downhill, so any mid- corner speed too high will push you wide when the camber disappears.
- **300/small:** Small bikes: trail brake slightly and cut a smooth arc – you have the advantage of less weight, so carry speed.

## MACPARK_S04 — Turn 5 (Right-hand sweeper)
**Shape:** Esses / S
**Priority / what matters:** faster and has positive camber, allowing higher entry speed. Many riders consider Turn 5 part of a “esses” with Turn 4 – effectively a direction change to the right. On a small bike, this is likely full throttle or a slight lift – take it as a big sweeper , using all the track on exit.
**Hazards / surface:** On a small bike, this is likely full throttle or a slight lift – take it as a big sweeper , using all the track on exit. Any wheelies from the crest should be managed by short-shifting if needed.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: This is a spot where your power can really shine – get the bike turned and upright as soon as possible in the exit and hammer the throttle.
- **600/midsize:** On a 600, roll on strong from mid-corner – 16 17 18 18 3 the camber will support you, but be ready to pick the bike up as the camber flattens at exit.
- **300/small:** On a small bike, this is likely full throttle or a slight lift – take it as a big sweeper , using all the track on exit.

## MACPARK_S05 — Turns 6–7 (Chicane and Sweeper)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** 7. Turn 7 is one of the fast sweeping turns on the track – a long, high-speed left that crests a hill. This turn is blind – you don’t see the exit until you’re at the apex on the crest.
**Stable reference points:** Pick a reference, like a tree or flagpole beyond the crest, to aim your turn-in.
**Hazards / surface:** Turn 7 is one of the fast sweeping turns on the track – a long, high-speed left that crests a hill. This turn is blind – you don’t see the exit until you’re at the apex on the crest.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Mid-size and superbike riders need real commitment here. 1000cc bikes: likely 4th or even 5th gear pinned, then a brief roll-off or slight tap of rear brake at the apex of 7 if the bike feels light.
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size and superbike riders need real commitment here. 600cc bikes can often take this in 4th gear , feathering only slightly at the apex if needed.
- **300/small:** Small bikes can usually stay fully pinned through 6 and into 7.

## MACPARK_S06 — Turn 8 (Fast Right)
**Shape:** Sweeper
**Priority / what matters:** form an S-shaped sequence at high speed. As you come off the left sweeper , the track immediately transitions right.
**Stable reference points:** The good news: Turn 8 has good banking (the track designers knew bikes would be flying here).
**Hazards / surface:** There’s a slight downhill here and Turn 8 is fast – likely one gear lower than 7. Superbikes should apex Turn 8 a bit late – there’s a slight dip at the inside that can unsettle if you hit it too early.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes should apex Turn 8 a bit late – there’s a slight dip at the inside that can unsettle if you hit it too early.
- **300/small:** Small bikes: flick right and stay on throttle – your bike will handle it, just shift weight quickly and use a late apex.

## MACPARK_S07 — Turn 9 (Hairpin
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** some spectator areas (hence often called Clubhouse). You approach T9 after a short straight from T8, carrying a lot of speed, so this is a serious braking zone. The corner itself is a bit off-camber , especially on exit, so expect the bike to want to drift out.
**Stable reference points:** Reference: there’s a braking marker near a marshal hut – on a 600cc start braking at that marker; on a superbike, brake a bit earlier until you gauge it.; Superbikes should prioritize a smooth drive out, as any wheelspin will be punished on the short chute to Turn 10.
**Hazards / surface:** The track goes slightly uphill into T9, which helps braking stability. The corner itself is a bit off-camber , especially on exit, so expect the bike to want to drift out.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Reference: there’s a braking marker near a marshal hut – on a 600cc start braking at that marker; on a superbike, brake a bit earlier until you gauge it. 600s and 1000s: get down to 2nd gear , maybe 1st for a very tight line.
- **600/midsize:** Reference: there’s a braking marker near a marshal hut – on a 600cc start braking at that marker; on a superbike, brake a bit earlier until you gauge it. 600s and 1000s: get down to 2nd gear , maybe 1st for a very tight line.
- **300/small:** Small bikes can cheat a bit and trail brake late, as their corner entry speed is less.

## MACPARK_S08 — Turns 10–11 (Esses)
**Shape:** Chicane
**Priority / what matters:** chute out of T9 – not much time to breathe. Turn 10 is blind entry (it goes over a small crest). Aim for a late turn-in once you crest; that sets you up for immediate Turn 11 right.
**Stable reference points:** chute out of T9 – not much time to breathe.; The surface here is smooth, and the curbs are low if you need to use them.; Most riders will clip a bit of inside curb on both 10 and 11.
**Hazards / surface:** Turn 10 is blind entry (it goes over a small crest). Aim for a late turn-in once you crest; that sets you up for immediate Turn 11 right.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes should be careful not to punch the throttle too early out of 11, as the bike will still be leaned and can spin up.
- **300/small:** Small bikes can often flick left-right with no braking, just a throttle maintenance.

## MACPARK_S09 — Turn 12 (Final corner)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** the main straight. Turn 12 is critical for lap time. Line: Try to late-apex Turn 12 so that you can stand the bike up on the exit.
**Stable reference points:** 600s: roll in with medium throttle, find the apex (there’s usually a cone or tire mark as a reference), then once you see the straight, pour on the gas.; Use all the exit width – there’s extra pavement on the exit curb, which is forgiving.; Liter bikes could consider standard gearing; they have plenty of power for the short chutes, and too short gearing will just cause wheelies.
**Hazards / surface:** It’s a long constant-radius left with some slight positive camber. Entry is slightly downhill, then it levels out through the turn.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: you must be patient initially.
- **600/midsize:** 600s: roll in with medium throttle, find the apex (there’s usually a cone or tire mark as a reference), then once you see the straight, pour on the gas. A 600cc might gear one tooth shorter on the rear sprocket than at a fast track, to punch out of the hairpins.
- **300/small:** Short gearing can help a 300cc get drive up the hills.
