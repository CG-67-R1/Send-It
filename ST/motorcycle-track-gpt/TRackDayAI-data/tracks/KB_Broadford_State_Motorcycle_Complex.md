## BROADFORD_S00 — Overview & key themes
**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** Broadford State Motorcycle Complex (VIC) Track Guide Broadford Road Circuit track map (2.16 km, 12 turns), with slight elevation and multiple off-camber corners. Track Map & Overview: Broadford’s road circuit is a tight 2.16 km track in rural Victoria featuring 12 turns in a mostly clockwise layout (11 right, 1 left – actually the track has...
**Stable reference points:** The final Turn 12 drops off- camber downhill onto the main chute.; Grip is decent in dry but drops significantly if offline (racing line quite narrow).; Broadford is famous for minimal margin of error: natural terrain limits run-off, and some walls/embankments are not far – avoid crashing, it’s easy to get collected if you fall in the racing line .
**Hazards / surface:** Broadford State Motorcycle Complex (VIC) Track Guide Broadford Road Circuit track map (2.16 km, 12 turns), with slight elevation and multiple off-camber corners. Elevation: The track flows over gentle hills – a climb up to Turn 1, dipping down the back straight, and a slight downhill run into Turn 10/11.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** - 1000cc Superbike: Broadford is challenging for liter bikes – they often can’t unleash full power except a brief squirt on back straight and front straight. Key for 1000s: electronics and throttle control.
- **600/midsize:** - 600cc Supersport: Medium bikes do well here – they have enough power to challenge straights but nimble for tight corners. Key will be managing power in off-cambers – a 600 can spin up out of T2, T5, T12 if you’re ham-fisted.
- **300/small:** Riding Tips by Class: - 300–400cc: Broadford is a playground for small bikes – you can utilize agility and corner speed to the max. Turn 1 might be nearly full throttle on a 300 once you know the line, due to lower speed and less risk of tire overload.
**Common mistakes:** Broadford is famous for minimal margin of error: natural terrain limits run-off, and some walls/embankments are not far – avoid crashing, it’s easy to get collected if you fall in the racing line . Common: Many highsides occur here from opening throttle at the wrong point (mid-corner when off-camber).
**Overtake / passing:** Off the start, this is a great place to overtake by hugging the inside all through – you can pass multiple people by staying tight from T1 entry all the way through T2 (others will drift out, you slip inside). If passing, note others might be unsettled cresting the hill.

## BROADFORD_S01 — Turn 1 & 2 (Big Left “Honda Corner” double-apex)
**Shape:** Double-apex
**Priority / what matters:** uphill into a fast sweeping left (T1) that immediately continues into a tighter left (T2). Many riders treat it as one extended corner . Off-camber: The exit of T1 and through T2 is very off-camber – it “tucks” the front if you coast.
**Hazards / surface:** Entry: Approach from far right, slight uphill helps braking. Off-camber: The exit of T1 and through T2 is very off-camber – it “tucks” the front if you coast.
**Common mistakes:** Common: Many highsides occur here from opening throttle at the wrong point (mid-corner when off-camber).
**Overtake / passing:** Off the start, this is a great place to overtake by hugging the inside all through – you can pass multiple people by staying tight from T1 entry all the way through T2 (others will drift out, you slip inside).

## BROADFORD_S02 — Turn 3 & 4 (Back “Kink” and Straight)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** straight. After T2, you crest a small hill then go downhill flat out. Essentially, as you exit T2 stand the bike up and aim from the far left of track straight to the right side by Turn 5 entry, effectively ignoring the labeled T3/4.
**Hazards / surface:** After T2, you crest a small hill then go downhill flat out. Turn 3 is a slight right kink, Turn 4 slight left kink – but the fast line is straightlining them.
**Overtake / passing:** If passing, note others might be unsettled cresting the hill. It’s a good place to slipstream and possibly outbrake into Turn 5.

## BROADFORD_S03 — Turn 5 (UpHill Hairpin
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** short climb (“the ramp”). The braking is uphill, which is handy – you can brake late, using the hill as a stopper . Off-camber on exit – traction is there but limited.
**Stable reference points:** Use all the exit (there’s no curb, just track edge then grass – falling off here means a drop to dirt which is trouble).
**Hazards / surface:** But careful: as you crest into the turn, the rear may lift or skip. Off-camber on exit – traction is there but limited.
**Common mistakes:** Many overshoot by not realizing how slow it is at top.
**Overtake / passing:** Passing: Great spot – you can sneak inside at apex because speed is low. It's vital to drive hard off T5 – there’s a crucial downhill run to Turn 6 where passing is possible if you exited better .

## BROADFORD_S04 — Turn 6 (The Kink): A fast right kink at bottom of the hill after T5. Honestly, it’s barely a turn
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** courage test leading into the braking for Turn 7. You come downhill from T5 and T6 is just a bend you must not run off. Hug the right side on exit of T5, then let the bike drift left as you accelerate through T6, already setting up for next braking.
**Stable reference points:** There’s a drop-off dirt beyond the curb – don’t touch it or you likely won’t recover.
**Hazards / surface:** There’s a drop-off dirt beyond the curb – don’t touch it or you likely won’t recover. Usually flat-out or a slight roll depending on bike.
**Common mistakes:** It’s common to see riders have the rear step out if they go wide on exit (10cm drop).

## BROADFORD_S05 — Turn 7/8/9 (Flip-Flop “Esses” known as the Motorcross Flip Flop)
**Shape:** Chicane
**Priority / what matters:** after the short chute out of T6. Approach is downhill then flat as you brake.
**Stable reference points:** after the short chute out of T6.

## BROADFORD_S06 — Turn 7 (right): flick right, moderate speed. Immediately flick left for Turn 8
**Shape:** Esses / S
**Priority / what matters:** Steering speed is key: snap the bike side to side fast. If you lazily hang off or move slow, you waste time. It’s off-camber exit again for T8 to T9.
**Stable reference points:** Use curbs?; There are slight curbs but these can unsettle if you hit them – best not to unless you absolutely have to (they have some camber helping hooking bike).
**Hazards / surface:** It’s off-camber exit again for T8 to T9. Because T8/9 is off-camber , it’s easy to spin up out of T9 – be ready.
**Common mistakes:** Mistakes in 7-9: going in too hot, which forces you to miss left apex and then you’re late to throttle at T9 – losing drive uphill.
**Overtake / passing:** If battling, a skilled rider might brake early and square T8 to block pass someone diving inside at 9. But passes here often slow both parties.

## BROADFORD_S07 — Turn 10 & 11 (Favorite “Twin Apex” Rights)
**Shape:** Double-apex
**Priority / what matters:** positively cambered. Many riders love these – lots of grip and you can carry big corner speed. Ideally, use all the track on entry and exit – a wide approach, not braking too hard but just enough to tuck the front in, then as soon as you lean, maintenance throttle then accelerate.
**Stable reference points:** Use up the exit – running out near curbing sets you up for Turn 12.
**Hazards / surface:** After accelerating uphill out of T9, you approach T10 – no heavy braking, just a roll-off and perhaps drop one gear . Turn 10: a sweeping right, goes uphill slightly and is banked – trust the grip and carry roll speed .
**Common mistakes:** Because T10-11 has so much grip, a common mistake is under-using it – accelerate harder!
**Confidence:** Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).

## BROADFORD_S08 — Turn 12 (Final left onto straight): A tricky downhill off-camber left
**Shape:** Straight / link
**Priority / what matters:** chute. It’s quite tight and falls away – heart in mouth moment especially on worn tires. The exit is critical for start/finish speed.
**Stable reference points:** chute.; The exit is critical for start/finish speed.; There’s a wall outside track at exit – do not drift wide; if you think you will, straighten and go off rather than hitting the wall.
**Hazards / surface:** Approach: Slight crest as you turn – front gets light then you drop down. There’s a big elevation drop on exit – the bike might slide or the front push.
**Common mistakes:** Many final-lap passes happen by outbraking into 12 (not common, but possible if someone leaves door open) or by squaring off under someone in 12 and drag racing to the line. Mistakes: grabbing a handful of front on entry – weight off front going downhill leads to easy tuck.
**Overtake / passing:** Many final-lap passes happen by outbraking into 12 (not common, but possible if someone leaves door open) or by squaring off under someone in 12 and drag racing to the line. So ideally, finish overtakes earlier .
