**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit (VIC) Track Guide Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit map (2022 layout, Miller Corner at Turn 4). Track Map & Overview: Phillip Island is a fast, flowing 4.45 km seaside circuit running anticlockwise (seven left, five right turns). Elevation & Camber: Significant elevation differences: the run from Turn 2...
**Stable reference points:** Elevation & Camber: Significant elevation differences: the run from Turn 2 (Southern Loop) down to Turn 4 (Honda, now Miller) drops downhill, then climbs up through Turn 5 (Siberia) and Turn 6/7 towards Lukey Heights.; Wind can be a factor here: the circuit’s exposed to Bass Strait, and strong winds can affect braking and bike stability (a tailwind down the main straight can push your brake marker deeper; a crosswind can nudge you off line in Turn 3).; Braking: drop two gears (from 6th to 4th on a 1000cc) and brake around the 150m marker (big bikes) or ~100m for 600cc.
**Hazards / surface:** Elevation & Camber: Significant elevation differences: the run from Turn 2 (Southern Loop) down to Turn 4 (Honda, now Miller) drops downhill, then climbs up through Turn 5 (Siberia) and Turn 6/7 towards Lukey Heights. Lukey Heights (Turn 8) itself is a crest – blind and steeply uphill on entry, then a quick drop to the Turn 9 hairpin (MG).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Approach in top gear (~300 km/h on a superbike). Braking: drop two gears (from 6th to 4th on a 1000cc) and brake around the 150m marker (big bikes) or ~100m for 600cc.
- **600/midsize:** Braking: drop two gears (from 6th to 4th on a 1000cc) and brake around the 150m marker (big bikes) or ~100m for 600cc. On a 600, it’s often full throttle, touching the rev limiter in 4th by corner exit; on a 1000, a slight roll or downshift might be needed depending on gearing and tire grip.
- **300/small:** Approach in top gear (~300 km/h on a superbike). Riding Tips by Class: - 300–400cc: The little bikes can keep corner speed extremely high at Phillip Island.
**Common mistakes:** Mistakes: Many sit up 28 18 7 29 30 2 31 32 4 or roll off too much – it’s incredible how deep you can go while still making the turn. Common error: pulling over too far right between the two apexes – it’s not necessary and wastes time.
**Overtake / passing:** Overtaking: A good exit from T2 often allows passing into Turn 3. Getting through T3 fast is exhilarating and sets up passes into Turn 4 by carrying momentum.

## PHILLIP_S01 — Turn  1  (Doohan  Corner)
**Shape:** Sweeper
**Priority / what matters:** Approach in top gear (~300 km/h on a superbike). Braking: drop two gears (from 6th to 4th on a 1000cc) and brake around the 150m marker (big bikes) or ~100m for 600cc. After that, focus on hitting a late apex (inside curb) because the turn opens on exit.
**Stable reference points:** Braking: drop two gears (from 6th to 4th on a 1000cc) and brake around the 150m marker (big bikes) or ~100m for 600cc.; There is a bump/jump just after start/finish that unsettles the bike as you approach.; After that, focus on hitting a late apex (inside curb) because the turn opens on exit.

## PHILLIP_S02 — Turn 2 (Southern Loop)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** high speed – scrub speed gently or a quick downshift. Enter mid-track, aim straight at the first apex and clip it, then let the bike drift out in the middle of the Loop. As the radius tightens for second apex, bring it back in and apex late on exit.
**Hazards / surface:** The mid-corner is slightly off-camber and can feel like the bike wants to fall in or run wide alternately – stay relaxed. Traction is important here – keep RPMs up to avoid bogging (gearing such that you don’t drop below 2nd gear).
**Common mistakes:** Common error: pulling over too far right between the two apexes – it’s not necessary and wastes time.
**Overtake / passing:** Overtaking: A good exit from T2 often allows passing into Turn 3.

## PHILLIP_S03 — Turn  3  (Stoner  Corner)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** Southern Loop and accelerating downhill. Flick right with minimal or no brake – just a throttle roll-off. Exit on the left edge of track, setting up for Turn 4 braking.
**Hazards / surface:** The track drops away at the apex and is bumpy; the front may get light and drift as you turn at high speed (~200+ km/h).
**Overtake / passing:** Getting through T3 fast is exhilarating and sets up passes into Turn 4 by carrying momentum.

## PHILLIP_S04 — Turn 4 (Miller Corner, formerly Honda Corner)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** high speed downhill. This is one of the best overtaking spots on the lap . Typically downshift to 2nd (or 1st for some bikes, though many prefer 2nd to avoid excessive wheelspin on exit).
**Stable reference points:** Brake marker depends on wind: with a headwind you can brake ~20m later than with a tailwind.; Visual: Brake in a straight line aiming at the large tire wall ahead, then turn late so you almost clip the inside curb twice (entry and exit).
**Overtake / passing:** This is one of the best overtaking spots on the lap . Passing: Outbrake up the inside – it’s wide, and late-brakers shine here.

## PHILLIP_S05 — Turn 5 (Siberia)
**Shape:** Straight / link
**Priority / what matters:** of grip here. Accelerate out of Turn 4 and flick left; leave it in 2nd gear (gearing usually perfect to pull through without a shift). A tight exit (stay left on exit curbing) is vital to set up the fast Hayshed section.
**Stable reference points:** A tight exit (stay left on exit curbing) is vital to set up the fast Hayshed section.; The outside of Siberia exit has bumps near the curbing – but also note it can be bumpy near the outside curb when the front is light (some wheelspin or wobble may occur).
**Hazards / surface:** Brake lightly on entry – carry speed. Turn in from mid-track or slightly wide, aim for a late apex (right as corner ends) to launch onto the straight that follows.

## PHILLIP_S06 — Turn 6 (Hayshed)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** right under the “Hayshed” (an old shed landmark). On a 600, it’s often full throttle, touching the rev limiter in 4th by corner exit; on a 1000, a slight roll or downshift might be needed depending on gearing and tire grip. Use all the track on exit.
**Stable reference points:** There’s a bump right at the inside curb – many riders just let the bike wheelie over it and keep accelerating.

## PHILLIP_S07 — Turn 7 (Lukey Heights entry)
**Shape:** Corner / complex
**Priority / what matters:** Heights, sometimes not counted separately (often Turn 7/8 collectively). You’re still leaned left from Hayshed? Lean over hard from inside white line to outside by exit.
**Hazards / surface:** It’s an uphill left that never really settles 2 5 33 34 35 35 36 37 38 39 40 39 30 41 41 42 43 28 44 45 46 5 the bike until you crest.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Many approach it pinned on a 600 (wide open in 4th, hitting limiter) and maybe a small roll on a superbike.
- **600/midsize:** Many approach it pinned on a 600 (wide open in 4th, hitting limiter) and maybe a small roll on a superbike.

## PHILLIP_S08 — Turn 8 (Lukey Heights proper): The cresting blind right at the top. One of the trickiest corners
**Shape:** Corner / complex
**Priority / what matters:** charge uphill, then tip right over the blind crest. Downshift one gear (4th→3rd usually) just before tipping in – engine braking plus uphill helps slow you. A strong run through Lukey sets up a pass into MG, or prevents one.
**Stable reference points:** You apex atop the hill, then as you crest you’re already on the right edge curbing.
**Hazards / surface:** charge uphill, then tip right over the blind crest. A small bump on the inside entry can unsettle; right after it, get back on throttle to settle the chassis and pull you over the rise.
**Overtake / passing:** A strong run through Lukey sets up a pass into MG, or prevents one.

## PHILLIP_S09 — Turn 9 (MG Hairpin): A tight downhill right hairpin. Braking as you come off Lukey is tricky
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** from crest to steep downhill, so load on the front is high (easy to bottom forks) and it’s easy to misjudge. Many bikes use either 1st or 2nd gear here. Gear choice: Some prefer 2nd to avoid a 1st-2nd upshift mid-corner exit and to soften the hit on corner exit.
**Hazards / surface:** from crest to steep downhill, so load on the front is high (easy to bottom forks) and it’s easy to misjudge. There’s a notable bump out wide at entry – best to avoid the far outside line and instead brake more down the middle of the track.
**Common mistakes:** Passes here are common: outbrake up the inside (but beware the inside can be dirty).

## PHILLIP_S10 — Turn  10: A  shallow  left  kink  immediately  after  MG.  Not  really  a  corner  you  aim for
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** acceleration zone where you’re still leaned. Coming out of MG, pick the bike up and accelerate hard. Use all the track at exit; there’s concrete run-off that can save you if slightly wide.
**Stable reference points:** Use all the track at exit; there’s concrete run-off that can save you if slightly wide.
**Hazards / surface:** Use all the track at exit; there’s concrete run-off that can save you if slightly wide. The front gets light downhill here (a lot of weight on the front from braking, then suddenly as you accelerate down a dip – easy to lift the front).

## PHILLIP_S11 — Turn 11
**Shape:** Straight / link
**Priority / what matters:** corner worldwide. Approach is a brief straight – snick up to 5th gear on a 1000cc just before tipping in . When you do reach that inside curb, immediately dial in throttle hard – the exit leads onto a rise onto the front straight.
**Stable reference points:** When you do reach that inside curb, immediately dial in throttle hard – the exit leads onto a rise onto the front straight.; As you drive out, the bike is still heeled over but you’re already full throttle and tucked in by the time you hit the exit curbing.; If you nail it, you’ll hit the outside edge by start/finish in top gear , front skimming over bumps, and carry an extra 5-10 km/h down the straight.
**Hazards / surface:** Turn in from far right, brave and early, and drop the bike onto your left knee. The front will go light (even weave) over the crest as you go past pit entry – it’s normal.
