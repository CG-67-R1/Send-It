## QR_S00 — Overview & key themes
**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** Queensland Raceway (QLD) Track Guide Queensland Raceway “National Circuit” layout (6 corners, nicknamed “the Paperclip”). Track Map & Layout: Queensland Raceway is a 3.12 km clockwise circuit with a simple “paperclip” layout – essentially two straights with four right-angle corners and two kinks. The circuit’s simplicity is deceptive: each...
**Stable reference points:** The design is flat – no significant elevation changes – and all turns except 3/4 are flat 90° bends.; It opens onto the short chute to Turn 2.; There’s an early inside curb but ignore it – aim to apex past the midpoint.
**Hazards / surface:** It has 6 corners: Turn 1 (fast right sweeper), Turn 2 (left hairpin), Turn 3/4 (a right-left switchback forming the “flip-flop” or “dipper”), Turn 5 (right hairpin at end of back straight), and Turn 6 (final right kink onto main straight). Surface & Grip: The asphalt is wide (12 m) and was historically bumpy, but recent updates have improved it.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Entry is around fifth gear on a 600cc, perhaps fourth on a 1000cc (depending on gearing). On a 300, it’s probably flat; on a 600/1000, maybe a slight maintenance throttle then full gas once pointed.
- **600/midsize:** Entry is around fifth gear on a 600cc, perhaps fourth on a 1000cc (depending on gearing). On a 300, it’s probably flat; on a 600/1000, maybe a slight maintenance throttle then full gas once pointed.
- **300/small:** On a 300, it’s probably flat; on a 600/1000, maybe a slight maintenance throttle then full gas once pointed. Riding Tips by Class: - 300–400cc: These lightweight bikes can exploit QR’s simple layout by carrying maximum corner speed.
**Common mistakes:** Common issues: Rolling off too much (carry more speed and trust the bike). Bonus: On starts, T1 is a common passing opportunity since many bikes don’t need to brake off the grid – a brave rider can hold it pinned around the outside.
**Overtake / passing:** Bonus: On starts, T1 is a common passing opportunity since many bikes don’t need to brake off the grid – a brave rider can hold it pinned around the outside. Passing: prime spot by outbraking someone on the inside.
**Confidence:** Medium (overview extracted from uploaded guide; validate on-track markers).

## QR_S01 — Turn 1 (Kitty’s Corner)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** like a fast kink. On many bikes, you barely brake – maybe a slight roll-off or light brake tap.
**Stable reference points:** It opens onto the short chute to Turn 2.
**Hazards / surface:** On many bikes, you barely brake – maybe a slight roll-off or light brake tap. Reference: The track rises ever so slightly on entry; use the start of that rise plus a change in track surface color as a turn-in cue.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Entry is around fifth gear on a 600cc, perhaps fourth on a 1000cc (depending on gearing).
- **600/midsize:** Entry is around fifth gear on a 600cc, perhaps fourth on a 1000cc (depending on gearing).
**Common mistakes:** Common issues: Rolling off too much (carry more speed and trust the bike). Bonus: On starts, T1 is a common passing opportunity since many bikes don’t need to brake off the grid – a brave rider can hold it pinned around the outside.
**Overtake / passing:** Bonus: On starts, T1 is a common passing opportunity since many bikes don’t need to brake off the grid – a brave rider can hold it pinned around the outside.

## QR_S02 — Turn 2 (Turn 3 on some car maps, aka “The Kink” leading to “The Switchback”)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** hand hairpin. After T1, you must brake hard for T2. It’s a classic heavy braking zone – straight line braking is key, as the track is slightly uphill into T2 which helps slow you.
**Stable reference points:** There’s an early inside curb but ignore it – aim to apex past the midpoint.; Best to “hug the 55 59 23 60 10 paint” all around the inside on exit – staying tight can block others and also shorten distance.; There is ample concrete run-off if you overcook it, but rejoin carefully to avoid a penalty or collision.
**Hazards / surface:** It’s a classic heavy braking zone – straight line braking is key, as the track is slightly uphill into T2 which helps slow you. Accelerate hard out; there is minor off-camber on exit (outside edge drops away slightly), so going wide means less grip.
**Common mistakes:** Riders often make a common mistake here of turning in too soon, hitting inside then drifting too wide on exit.
**Overtake / passing:** Passing: prime spot by outbraking someone on the inside. Off the start, you can guarantee to pass a few if you hug tight all through T2’s inside.

## QR_S03 — Turn 3/4 (The Switchback or “esses”)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** left in quick succession. Turn 3 is a shallow right kink, Turn 4 a tighter left. As you exit T2, drift to track right.
**Stable reference points:** Clip the inside left curb at Turn 4 apex.; Watch for the dirt just beyond curbs – running slightly off can be hazardous due to drop-off edges about 10cm to the dirt.
**Hazards / surface:** Approach: After exiting T2, short-shift and tuck in, keeping slight right lean (T3 is just a bend). Watch for the dirt just beyond curbs – running slightly off can be hazardous due to drop-off edges about 10cm to the dirt.
**Common mistakes:** If someone runs wide out of T2, you can shoot straight through T3/4 and pass them before Turn 5.
**Overtake / passing:** If someone runs wide out of T2, you can shoot straight through T3/4 and pass them before Turn 5.

## QR_S04 — Turn 5 (Spitfire or “Thunderbolt” Hairpin)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** hairpin. This is similar to Turn 2 in shape but opposite direction. Apex: mid-corner , not too early – if you hug inside too early, you’ll run wide off exit.
**Stable reference points:** Use markers (boards or fence posts) for consistency.; Beware the exit curb drop: the outside of Turn 5 exit has a 10cm drop to dirt – don’t run off or you likely won’t rejoin without incident.
**Hazards / surface:** Trail-braking into Turn 5 is risky due to minimal camber and a slightly bumpy braking zone. Off-camber exit means it’s easy to spin up the rear – you might see some riders backing it in or sliding out here when pushing.
**Common mistakes:** Wheelies: as you drive out of Turn 5 uphill onto the short link, the front might lift (common on big bikes) – short-shift or feather to keep it down for Turn 6.
**Overtake / passing:** Passing: prime spot due to the long straight preceding – outbrake on the inside. There are multiple viable lines (you can enter shallow and block pass, or do a wide entry and cutback exit).
**Confidence:** Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).

## QR_S05 — Turn 6 (Final Corner onto Main Straight)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** corner – more of a bend you accelerate through. Line: after Turn 5, you’re on left side; keep left to set up maximum radius through 6. Crucial: get the bike upright as early as possible out of 6 for drive.
**Stable reference points:** There is a concrete apron on exit – you can use it.; Visual: Turn 6 itself has few markers; you usually sight the pit entry on right or the lighting pole beyond the straight as you exit.; Since it’s so fast, do minimal steering – let the bike run out to the exit curbing.
**Hazards / surface:** On a 300, it’s probably flat; on a 600/1000, maybe a slight maintenance throttle then full gas once pointed. This turn is slightly banked which helps grip.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** On a 300, it’s probably flat; on a 600/1000, maybe a slight maintenance throttle then full gas once pointed.
- **600/midsize:** On a 300, it’s probably flat; on a 600/1000, maybe a slight maintenance throttle then full gas once pointed.
- **300/small:** On a 300, it’s probably flat; on a 600/1000, maybe a slight maintenance throttle then full gas once pointed.
**Common mistakes:** Mistakes: the most common is not getting back on throttle early 61 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 11 enough – every mph lost here multiplies down the long straight.
**Overtake / passing:** Because of the long straight, drafting is huge – you can gain a bike length or more by staying tucked behind someone exiting 6, then pop out to overtake into Turn 1.
**Confidence:** Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).
