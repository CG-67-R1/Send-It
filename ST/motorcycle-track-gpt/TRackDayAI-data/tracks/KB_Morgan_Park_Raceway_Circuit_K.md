## MORGAN_S00 — Overview & key themes
**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** Morgan Park Raceway (QLD) – 2.97 km Circuit K Morgan Park (Warwick, QLD) is a 2.9 km circuit with 12 turns used in ASBK. It’s characterized by significant elevation changes and undulation, giving it a very technical character.
**Stable reference points:** It’s characterized by significant elevation changes and undulation, giving it a very technical character.; Turn 3 (Blind Left-hander by the Wall) – A notorious blind crest left.; As you power up from T2, you approach a left turn (T3) with a concrete wall tight on the inside that blocks your view through the corner .
**Hazards / surface:** It’s characterized by significant elevation changes and undulation, giving it a very technical character. Riders face a bit of everything: a blind crest turn (Turn 3), a mix of tight hairpins (T4 and T7 chicanes) and fast sweepers (the Turns 8-9 kink combo), plus a banked high-speed corner (Turn 10) and a final tricky chicane (Turns 11-12) onto the main straight.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Approach: You come off the front straight quite fast (over 200 km/h on a superbike). Mid-size and superbikes: enter T1 on the right, gradually braking or rolling off through the right-hand part, keeping some brake all the way to the midpoint of T2.
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size and superbikes: enter T1 on the right, gradually braking or rolling off through the right-hand part, keeping some brake all the way to the midpoint of T2. 600s: practice a bit of late braking in Friday practice here; you can make up time or positions with confident braking and a tight inside line.
- **300/small:** Small bikes can almost go full throttle through T1 and just a slight chop for T2, as their cornering speed is high relative to power . Small bikes: you can nearly go flat through here, just a slight lift for stability.
**Common mistakes:** The track undulates over the Southern Downs hillside, which means you need to be aggressive yet precise – many corners flow into one another and any mistake carries on through subsequent turns. There’s plenty of run-off and it’s a common pass attempt area, as Mike Jones notes “a really good opportunity for overtaking”.
**Overtake / passing:** Turn 4 (Heavy Braking Right-Hairpin) – After the intensity of Turn 3, you get a prime overtaking spot: Turn 4 is a tight right-hand hairpin at the end of an uphill-to-flat straight. There’s plenty of run-off and it’s a common pass attempt area, as Mike Jones notes “a really good opportunity for overtaking”.

## MORGAN_S01 — Turns  1  &  2  (Right-Left  Sweepers)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** immediately followed by a left (T2) up a hill. In reality, riders treat T1/T2 as one large “S” shaped sweeper . The key is to combine them into one arc.
**Hazards / surface:** Turn 1 is a kink to the right – roll off slightly or maintenance throttle through it, and prepare to tip left for Turn 2. Small bikes can almost go full throttle through T1 and just a slight chop for T2, as their cornering speed is high relative to power .
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Approach: You come off the front straight quite fast (over 200 km/h on a superbike). Mid-size and superbikes: enter T1 on the right, gradually braking or rolling off through the right-hand part, keeping some brake all the way to the midpoint of T2.

## MORGAN_S02 — Turn 3 (Blind Left-hander by the Wall)
**Shape:** Corner / complex
**Priority / what matters:** approach a left turn (T3) with a concrete wall tight on the inside that blocks your view through the corner . This is “probably the most exciting corner on the whole circuit” – because you must commit to the left-hand line without seeing the exit.
**Stable reference points:** approach a left turn (T3) with a concrete wall tight on the inside that blocks your view through the corner .; The wall is right at apex, so riders aim to get as close to it as possible (some joke “kiss the wall” – figuratively!).; Aim your bike toward the wall as you crest.
**Hazards / surface:** Aim your bike toward the wall as you crest. Small bikes: you can nearly go flat through here, just a slight lift for stability.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** On a superbike, many riders will not fully open throttle until they’ve cleared T3 because the bike’s front is light and you’re leaned – it’s a finesse corner .
- **300/small:** Small bikes: you can nearly go flat through here, just a slight lift for stability.

## MORGAN_S03 — Turn 4 (Heavy Braking Right-Hairpin)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** Turn 4 is a tight right-hand hairpin at the end of an uphill-to-flat straight. It’s a classic “slow corner = heavy braking” situation. Superbikes: you’ll approach faster , so focus on stability – braking upright then trailing slightly as you turn.
**Hazards / surface:** Small bikes can dive very deep and still make the corner due to lighter weight. Superbikes: you’ll approach faster , so focus on stability – braking upright then trailing slightly as you turn.

## MORGAN_S04 — Turn 5 (Long Sweeping Left)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** somewhat long and sets up Turn 6 immediately after . Mike Jones describes it as a “long sweeping left hander” where you “drive the bike really hard into 5”. There’s also an element of compromise: if you exit T4 tight, you can attack Turn 5 better .
**Hazards / surface:** Small bikes: you might not even need to brake before Turn 6 because your corner speed can be high; you might roll off slightly at the end of T5 to load the front.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** 600s and 1000s: commit to throttle through T5, then just as you reach max lean and see Turn 6 ahead, apply the brakes.
- **600/midsize:** 600s and 1000s: commit to throttle through T5, then just as you reach max lean and see Turn 6 ahead, apply the brakes.
- **300/small:** Small bikes: you might not even need to brake before Turn 6 because your corner speed can be high; you might roll off slightly at the end of T5 to load the front.
**Common mistakes:** The transition must be smooth to avoid a lowside.

## MORGAN_S05 — Turn 6 (Right-Hand Flick)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** kink in the middle of the S-bend (forming a chicane with T5). It’s a bit of a “change-of-direction” chicane: left T5 into right T6. The apex of T6 is important because it sets the timing for changing direction into 7.
**Stable reference points:** Small bikes: can perhaps do a small lift and throw it right, using inside curb.
**Hazards / surface:** There’s a dip or slight off-camber at T6 entry, making it tricky – Mike Jones noted you start braking while the bike is at max lean left, then pick it up and change direction to the right. You want to pick the bike up slightly while braking to get grip on the front as you turn right.

- **300/small:** Small bikes: can perhaps do a small lift and throw it right, using inside curb.

## MORGAN_S06 — Turn 7 (Left-hand tight corner)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** (almost hairpin-ish) immediately after the quick Turn 6 right. Jones calls 4-5-6 “the complex” and says he prefers to “slow up a little, get a really good line as you change direction from right to left” (6 to 7) and focus on drive out of 7. That tells us: don’t rush the entry to 7; rather , set the bike direction...
**Stable reference points:** There aren’t strong reference markers; it’s about feel, and many find Turn 7 deceptively tight and tough to be consistent .
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes/600s: likely 2nd gear , maybe short shift to 3rd as you pick up the bike.
- **600/midsize:** Superbikes/600s: likely 2nd gear , maybe short shift to 3rd as you pick up the bike.
- **300/small:** Small bikes: you might carry more corner speed and less worry about exit power , but still keep it tidy and maximize drive – you need all the speed onto the straight.

## MORGAN_S07 — Turns 8 & 9 (Fast Esses
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** Turn 7 hard, you go down a hill into a flat-out left kink (T8) immediately followed by a flat-out right kink (T9). Motorcyclists often treat 8 and 9 as a single high-speed snake. The combined exit of 9 you should drift back left, setting up for Turn 10.
**Stable reference points:** The bike may wallow or slide – just stay loose and let it.; These kinks have gentle curbing that you can touch if necessary.
**Hazards / surface:** Mike Jones describes this as “through the fast turns 8 and 9…very high speed, over 200km/h, bike dancing, try to let it move by standing on the pegs slightly”. Turn 9 has a crest on entry and is taken nearly flat as well, just a slight decel while flipping from left to right.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Indeed, Turn 8 is a left that you take at full throttle in 5th gear on a 1000cc .
- **600/midsize:** On a 600, likely flat out through 8, slight lift or upshift, then flat through 9.
- **300/small:** On a small bike, you’re probably pinned throughout and just sweeping the esses with minor body English corrections.

## MORGAN_S08 — Turn 10 (Fast Banked Right)
**Shape:** Chicane
**Priority / what matters:** the high-speed section. You’ve just blasted through 8/9 and now approach T10 still carrying big speed. So focus on exit drive: “Fire yourself out of there as hard and fast as you can, towards the last chicane”.
**Hazards / surface:** Perhaps drop 1-2 gears (600 in 4th, big bike 4th or maybe down to 3rd).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** On a 600/1000, trail braking into the banking is effective. Mid-corner , it’s maybe a medium-fast turn (say 120-140 km/h on superbike).
- **600/midsize:** Perhaps drop 1-2 gears (600 in 4th, big bike 4th or maybe down to 3rd). On a 600/1000, trail braking into the banking is effective.
- **300/small:** On a small bike, you might barely brake – just roll and pitch it in.
**Overtake / passing:** It’s also a good overtaking spot because the banking allows inside passes without washing out . You can go in deep on the inside line (hence the passing opportunity).

## MORGAN_S09 — Turns 11 & 12 (Final Chicane onto Main Straight)
**Shape:** Chicane
**Priority / what matters:** the short straight out of T10, you must brake hard and flick right for Turn 11 then immediately left for Turn 12 (which exits onto the main straight). Turn 11 is a sharp right, basically the entry to the chicane. You could enter really quickly and make up time on entry, but then you have to slow a lot to change...
**Stable reference points:** The chicane curbs are usable; many riders take a bit of curb on both 11 and 12 to straighten it out.
**Hazards / surface:** Turn 12 left is slightly uphill onto the straight, and there’s a crest on the exit that can unsettle the bike if you’re not upright. So the goal is to have the bike upright over that crest while at full throttle.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: be cautious of too much throttle while still leaned in T12 – the crest can cause a momentary loss of grip. 1000s – consider anti-wheelie strategies (electronic or setup) because of many rises; perhaps lower front end a tad (or raise rear) to shift weight forward to help front stay in contact over crests, but careful not to induce headshake in the fast stuff – a steering damper is your friend here.
- **600/midsize:** 600s – a middle-ground setup, maybe slightly front-biased for all the direction changes (these bikes thrive at Morgan Park).
- **300/small:** Small bikes: can maybe carry a bit more entry speed as they flick easier , but they too benefit from a good exit drive. Class-specific:Lightweights – focus on maintaining momentum; you can likely run slightly softer springs to maximize grip and you won’t overpower the track, just keep corner speed high.
