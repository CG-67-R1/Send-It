INTRODUCTION
I raced at World Championship level for many years before working
with
World Championship riders as an Ohlins suspension technician
and more recently as a rider Coach and Mento~
My original book and DVD 'Motovudu: Dark Art of Performance'
contains
all the rules and techniques I  learnt throughout my career
as a professional motorcycle racer that enabled me to ride fast on
circuit
while taking as few risks as possible.
Motovudu 2 utilises these same rules, but pushes them to the very
limits. This book is not about safety as much as riding to the highest
levels, and this is not possible to achieve without risk. Like anything
pushed
to the very limit, there is a  fine line between pain and
glory. For this reason I must warn that some of what I describe in
Motovudu 2 will only be suitable for aspiring or professional Racers.
Also included are some of my thoughts on the mental and physical
approaches to our sport.
I sincerely hope that Motovudu 2 helps you reach your goals.

CHAPTER 1:
IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD
One of the great things about riding sportbikes on circuit is. . it's all in your head!
Until you get to racing levels, it's not about how old you are, how fit you are, or even
what gender you are. I'll give you one of my favourite examples: I was at Cartagena
circuit,
Spain and was introduced to the three people I was giving instruction to that day.
An early thirty year old, tall, polite guy in good physical condition, next a kickboxer in his
late twenties. shaved head, tattoo's and not an ounce of fat on him. The third client, nice
guy, mid sixties I guess, a paunch and a handshake that spoke of office work. All said they
had not ridden on circuit before, but had ridden on the street. You can guess what my
preconceptions were.
I will try not to make that mistake again, as I said, it's all in your head.
The older guy soaked up what I told him and was prepared to trust what I showed him
without hesitation, getting off of the brakes and following me into the turns. The younger,
fitter clients weren't prepared to do this. They would not relax and trust their bike
and tyres. I can't remember the lap times exactly, but by the end of the day the older
client
was lapping about I 0 seconds a lap faster than the others, and doing it smoothly,
accurately,
and safely.
I  believe a part of our sport is about calculated risk. No matter what your maximum
speed
is, when you get there it feels like if you go any faster. or lean any further, you will
crash. Everyone gets to that place, and to go faster you have to decide, or be told, where
exactly you can push to win more time. Once you decide where that time is, you need
to be able to make yourself take a small step at a time into the unknown and see what
happens. For
example; as you get closer to a corner with the thmttle fully open, your self
preservation kicks in and tells you to close the throttle and brake, but you know from
previous
laps that the point where your self preservation alarm in your head kicks in is too
early and you stop easily for the turn. So you make yourself go slightly past this marker
on
full throttle. Once you do it once, you do it every lap with your internal alarm ringing.
Working methodically, eventually my internal alarm is sounding during the entry of every
corner, but the
logical side of my brain tells me I have calculated it well and I know it's not
dangerous. This
is what makes riding fast on circuit such an adrenalin 'rush'. I notice that
it is almost like I have to be prepared to crash to make that next step and hopefully find
out that I was nowhere near crashing. From then on, that will be my new limit. The trick
is knowing the places you are already near the limit and where your slow sections are.

A  rider I worked with lot with in 20 12, reached his personal limit
at
an incredibly slow speed, I even joked with him that my Mum
would
pass him around the outside. After a lot of practice and
instruction over 12 months, he literally went from 'slow in the
slow group',
to 'fast in the fast group'. To me he proved that the
'calculated risk' thing,
even if you can't do it at f1rst, can be learned.
I've also worked with riders of the other extreme who push hard
to go fast, but in many of the wrong places, taking big risks to
achieve their lap times. I stop them immediately to explain that
unless we go all the way back to basics and start again, there's going
to be a crash. It may take half a day for them to understand the
different way
of riding, but because they are not afraid to have a
go, they figure it out. Even if they don't beat their personal best by
the end of that first day, their new style of riding is not as limited,
and they achieve these times easier and safer.
The important thing is to first identify where you believe you can
make time, and secondly make yourself do it. I have worked with
riders that
are leaning their bikes over to about 50 to 60% of what
is possible with the conditions, bike and tyres they have, but they
are afraid to lean more. They try to go faster into the corner but
the bike won't turn at
50 to 60% of the possible lean and they feel
they won't make the turn, so rather than trust their bike/tyres and
take a step into the unknown they 'bail out' by standing the bike up and running off track and into the gravel. The thing you need to decide is, are you prepared to
fall off to go faster? If the answer is no, then just enjoy the speed you are going. If the answer is yes, then go ahead and commit to the extra lean angle you know the
bike
and tyres can achieve. Nine times out often when you do, it feels good and you realise you were nowhere near falling in the first place, and that is your new
limit.
Yes you may fall, but if you don't try you will never know.
Good riders don't want
to fall any more than anyone else, but in addition to natural ability and motivation, they are prepared to take calculated risks to f1nd the limits.

### That
is one of the key ingredients to going faster.

Another important part of learning to go fast is being able to memorise everything about a circuit. Some do it quicker than others, which is not a problem as long
as you can do it. It is very important that you can memorise brake markers, turn in points, speed sensations and gear positions consistently. I show many riders
how to ride a circuit faster and safer, explaining why it works and why it will work on other circuits, but if they can't replicate what they are doing each lap, or at
least remember exactly where they are and what they are trying to achieve at dozens of points around the track, it will never feel or look safe. This is something
that's
not easily taught, people seem to either to have this ability or they don't.
''
TAKE NOTE AND THINK HARD ABOUT REPLICATING BRAKE MARKERS,
TURN IN POINTS, SPEED SENSATIONS AND GEAR POSITIONS. ''
I have instructed many female riders, who seem to have less of an ego about getting instruction than many guys and are keen to listen and learn. Recently at Valencia
Spain, I instructed a woman that was on her second or third circuit  event. Within a few laps of her fo llowing my lines, we were carving through literally half of the
riders
in the group because she was prepared to trust me and she was not lost on circuit, she knew exactly where she was and could replicate what we did lap after
lap. This really is the difference between doing it with risk. or safely. I believe that if you can memorise a circuit and understand exactly where you are on it and are
prepared
to step into the unknown, your age, fitness, and/or gender w ill not stop you from being a fast rider. Like anything, it's just a matter of committing to it, and
getting enough
quality practice.

GOING RACING, HANDLING THE PRESSURE
Everyone feels the pressure of racing, it's how you decide to deal with the pressure that makes the difference.
It is important to f 1nd what works for you. For me it was having my own routine. I'd go to the garage well in advance to talk w1th my mechanics to make sure
everything was ready for my race, but also to make sure there was no misunderstandings or surprises that would be too late to do something about when I turned
up ready to race. Then I'd find a quiet place with plenty of time to prepare my gear and helmet (finding your gear is not ready when you are late for the grid is a
good way
to raise your stress levels). I would have something small to eat and some more to drink, then take a nap or at least a quiet relax.  I found this gives my
brain a rest
and makes me think clearer. Non stop meeting and talking with people was a good way to make my brain feel tired and less 'sharp'.
I'd have my alarm set. just so I could relax and stop looking at my watch, and when
the
alarm went off I would know I had more than enough time to go to the toilet,
get my gear on and get to the garage. I would not get to the garage too early, I was
there to do a job, and was focused on that. so if I was reasonably close to the time I
had to put my helmet on it suited me well.

### All
good racers put pressure on themselves to do well, the added pressure from
outside
elements can raise the pressure we feel. At one stage I remember it all
adding up to a point where I knew it was too much. As I looked across from the
starting grid
I t hought about the I S  plus team staff, the 2 articulated trucks, the
sponsors, the manufacturer
of my bike, who all wanted results that I was paid well
to get. I cared what press, fans, friends and family would say about my result in that
race. The thing that helped me handle all this, right at the moment when I felt that it
was all getting a bit much for me, was the following ....
I said to myself with commitment ... "This is what I do best, that's why I am here.
am going to give my very best in this race, I 00%, never giving a I Oth of a second to
another rider without a fight. all the way to the flag.  If someone doesn't like what I
achieve, f**k them, there is nothing I can do about it. so there is no point worrying
about
it".
I literally felt
the outside pressure lift, I had a laugh to myself. had a look around, gave
the bike a rev and waited to be under starters orders.
Also, when the pressure is getting too much, it's good to remember that we are
doing this because we love riding bikes and more often than not. we ride at our best
when we
are having fun.

UPS AND DOWNS
THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU
Who to have around you in the garage is an important thing to consider. The team
will
not always be right about everything, but the last thing you need is someone vocal
with you who will raise the tension.  Someone quiet and supportive, no matter how
you are riding is the right person to have around, you must make your own decisions
in the garage and learn from them.
The emotions
and instincts a parent has for their child often makes it difficult to be
the supportive
and quiet person I have described above. I don't know many parents
who are good to have around the garage, and the couple that are good are so laid
back and/or know so little about the sport that they leave their child to it.
My Father helped me a lot in the early years of my racing. I prepared my own bikes, as
early as 12 years old (not very well), but he paid for them and drove me all over the
North Island of New Zealand to Motocross races that I wanted to compete in and
he also helped me to get started on the Asphalt at I 5 years old. Because he knew
nothing about my chosen sport he stepped away once
I got to a level that I did not
need his help. I think I was lucky that it happened like this. It helped me learn to take
responsibility
and make my own decisions, which is all part of forming the complete
package as a racer and a person.
I have known more than one very talented rider that some of the top teams refused
to consider because they come with a "pain in the ass" parent. Sad but true.
Racing is a rollercoaster of extreme ups and downs. I learnt by the end of my career to not get carried away with the ups and not dwell on the downs. It's very hard
emotionally and mentally if you don't learn to do this.
There are
always going to be people that think you are wonderful and others that think you are crap. They are entitled to their opinion, but the easiest way to handle
it
as a racer is to try not to listen to any of it. You know how you are doing.

GIVING100%
Early in my internalional career, I was in 4th position
during a
t·ace and steadily catching third. I could have
passed the rider in 3rd right then, but that would mean
pushing very hard afterward and trying to make a break
so they could not attack me on the last lap. I thought
that
because there are a few laps left I could afford to
take the easier route, and follow for a  few laps and
then pass on the last lap to secure the last step on the
podium. The
last lap came and I went for it, but to my
surpri
se the rider ahead of me put together an inspired
last lap, giving me no opportunity to pass. I finished the
race off the podium, and furious  with myself. so much
so I could hardly trust myself to speak. I made the firm
decision
to never ever make that mistake again.
Don't take the easy route, take every single opportunity
as it presents itself. I love the feeling inside when I know
I have given everything in a race. There is no need to
make excuses to myself or anyone else. If a rider caught
me or pulled away, it is because they earned it, not
because I gave it to them.
I recommend this to all racers. It allows you to be proud
of yourself. It makes you stronger, happier and more
self confident
and other riders will see it and start to
respect the fact you never give up during a race.
'' DON'T TAKE THE EASY ROUTE,
TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY AS IT PRESENTS ITSELF
''

CHAPTER 2: ADVANCED BRAKING
Do you remember the rules of braking from Motovudu: Dark Art of Performance?
I work with a lot of riders on circuit and I am often impressed with the skill that many of the new generation have with the throttle. Usually
it comes from their time riding dirt bikes on the dirt, Ice or asphalt. I regularly witness them squeeze everything out of the rear tyre, on
the edge of grip and past it, which is what fast riders need to be able to do. However, more often than not they don't use the potential
of their front tyre. Of course, this does not apply to all young riders. I have come across some that push the front to the limit, but they
usually enter the turn so fast that they are still on the brakes long after the point where it is faster and safer to have both wheels back in
line, off of the brakes, at maximum lean carrying speed and turning, before getting ready for the exit.

It is not only important to brake as late as you can, it's important to brake hard, in order to get the bike slowed enough before the optimum brake release and
maximum lean point. If you can't, you must move your brake marker slightly earlier in order to avoid having to stay on the brakes too deep into the corner effectively
scrubbing of too much speed while pushing the front straight past the optimum brake release/maximum lean and turn in point.
PART LEAN
PART LEAN
APPROXIMATE EXAMPLE OF LEAN ANGLE AND BRAKING
In general though, the majority of riders I see on circuit at track
days or at lower levels of racing are weak on corner entry. They
brake
and enter the turn at about 80% of maximum, thinking that
they
are at I 00%. I can relate to this, because this was one of the
areas of my riding that took time to master and did not come very
easily. Like all of the final pieces of the 'riding fast puzzle', it didn't
just
fall into place one day, I had to really push myself to achieve 1t,
a little at a time. With the motivational help of a Mentor. an older
Japanese man, and former motocross racer (no, his name was not
Mr Miagi), I kept pushing to improve, entering so fast that at first
I  felt like I was on the edge, playing with fire, which I was, but
after some time
like everything done repetitively, it started to feel
normal and I could do it lap after lap and into every corner. This
is what riding a bike at a high level is all about. Pushing everything
you
have available to the absolute limit. Not just some sections of
the lap. but all the way around the lap.
'' IT IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT TO BRAKE AS LATE AS YOU CAN,
IT'S IMPORTANT TO BRAKE HARD ''

ANGLE OF ENTRY
Your job as a fast rider; among other things, is to prepare for the entry of each
corner by positioning your bike on the correct angle of entry for the next turn
whilst still on the throttle approaching the turn. If you do this you will be able to
enter even faster; as the front tyre has less work to do because you have already
done part of the job of corner entry before you have even braked.
One of my simple Motovudu rules of riding that applies to every corner; of every
circuit
is: 'Line up the entry while still on the GAS'.
Many riders brake in the middle of the track (a metre or two from the edge of
the track), then swerve toward the outside of the track just before they turn
into the corner. This
is fine if you are not going fast, but when you are, it means
you are asking more than necessary of the tyres by setting the bike up on the
WRONG angle of entry for the corner; so the front tyre must not only stop the
bike, it must
change its direction too. The front tyre has a limited amount of grip
available, so in effect you are using some of this grip to change the bikes direction
and therefore have less left over for braking. At a certain level/lap time the front
tyre
will not be able to cope any more and w ill push/understeer or at bigger lean
angles completely let go.
''
LINE UP THE ENTRY
WHILESTILLONTHEGAS ''
DO NOT SWERVE TOWARD THE OUTSIDE OF THE TRACK BEFORE TURNING
IN TO THE CORNER

Setting the bike up on the best angle of entry for some corners will involve getting
completely to the side of the track (to open the corner up) before leaning toward
the corner
while still on the throttle. For other corners, it will simply require that
the bike
is completely on the edge of the circuit to open the corner up to the
maximum before braking
is needed.
When two riders are entering a corner on the limit of their front tyres, the rider
taking more
care to set up the bike on the correct angle of entry for that corner
will win time over the other rider.
BY COMING BACK TOO LATE IN PREPARATION FOR THE CORNER, THE RED
LINE RIDER ENDS UP FACING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION FOR THE CORNER.
THIS E XAMPLE IS SIMILAR TO THE LAST TWO CORNERS AT CARTAGENA, SPAIN

WEIGHT TRANSFER
When I have lined up the correct angle of entry whilst still on the throttle but I am approaching my brake marker; I reach out with my finger for the front brake lever
in  preparation for the exact moment I will need it (I use one finger and most riders use two or even three, it's a personal preference). When I roll the throttle off
(a fraction of a second before my brake marker) this automatically makes my brake finger reach the lever more easily and closing the throttle transfers some weight
back onto the front tyre (the front
is light under hard acceleration). In the time it takes to close the throttle and reach for the brake, the weight is just arriving on the
front tyre
as I have reached my brake marker. I prepare my body for the forces of braking and pull the brake lever. Everything I have described here feels like one
fluid movement, not separate individual movements.
1 While still on the throttle, reach out with
your finger approaching the broke marker
2 As the throttle is closed in preparation for
braking, your ftnger reaches the lever easily
3 In the time token to close the throttle
and reach for the broke lever, the weight
is just arriving on the front tyre allowing
for maximum braking

The initial transfer of weight from the rear to the front caused by
closing the throttle, followed immediately by hard braking, causes
the combined weight of the rider and the bike to transfer to the
tyre and front suspension. This results in the front fork initially diving
most
of the way through it's stroke and possibly the rear wheel
coming off of the ground. Because of the latter. I often need to take
a  fraction
of pressure off of the front brake lever to get the rear
wheel back on the ground and settled, and then try again a  second
time
to increase the pressure and take advantage of all the braking
potential the bike has after the initial weight transfer has settled. Fast
riders must take
the opportunity of pulling the brakes harder once
the bike has settled, as this is an area that it is possible to win some
time over other riders who don't.
When relatively upright, I think of this transfer to the front as my
friend and not my enemy. Lots of weight on the front pushes the
front tyre into the asphalt giving it a  bigger contact patch, and so
more grip, which allows you to pull harder on the front brake. Also
it steepens the angle of the front fork, 'head angle' or 'rake', which
results in the bike turning tighter when braking on a slight angle.
The moment I am hard on the front brakes, I bang down through
the gears which often results in the reartyre feeling like it's hovering
and moving about, (even though
it may not be noticeable from the
outside). I use this rear moving around on the brakes as a  gauge.
Without it I'm not always sure where the limit of braking is. I try
to go out onto a  circuit in the very first session and get the back
moving around
on entry as soon as possible. It is the easiest and
safest limit to find. It is much safer and easier to find this limit than
the front pushing or the rear sliding at bigger lean angles.
FAST RIDERS TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF PULLING THE BRAKES
HARDER ONCE THE BIKE HAS SETTLED

SUSPENSION
Now that I've found my bike's limit of braking, if I think this limit is too low I have
to look to bike adjustments to improve this. If the front suspension damping
and/or
springs are too soft, or the bike setup is too front biased (low front/high
rear) the bike
will be unstable on the brakes with too much weight transfer to
the front, too quickly, thus causing the limit of braking to be low. Check that the
front forks
are not on the bottom of the stroke too easily or for too much of the
lap because as soon as the forks completely bottom out or hit a hard/blocked
part of the stroke, the force must go somewhere. At smaller lean angles this will
usually result in the bike trying to 'stand up' (go from part lean, to more upright)
and the back wheel coming off of the ground suddenly.
At the same moment the front forks bottom, the rear picks up off of the ground.
When the rear comes
off the ground suddenly, it is necessary to slightly reduce
front brake pressure
JUst as suddenly which makes it is difficult to get everything
right
and keep it smooth. When the rear comes back down again, out of line
with the front, the bike will weave and wobble, forcing the rider to release the
brakes a
little to gain control and maybe overshoot the corner. When the forks
bottom
repeatedly at greater lean angles the front will  eventually let go, tuck
(loose grip) and end in a crash.
If the front forks can continue to move and absorb bumps when the rider is
braking, they allow the rider to brake harder, keep control, and when the rear
does hover
and move about, barely on the ground, it will do so smoothly. Plus,
there wi ll be a little front fork left over for a 'panic  brake' when the rider has
gone in (entered the turn) a little too hot (fast) and is trying to stay on line, or
simply on track.

HELPING THE FRONT TYRE
When I push I 00% on the brakes into turns at part lean (within the safe area
for maximum braking), and when the front tyre can cope with no more, it
stops turning and starts to push straight ahead. This is a very similar feeling to
a half-flat tyre, not a slide, just a  slight understeer. The bike will be aiming at
the line I want to take, and should go there, but it can't quite stay on that line.
If I keep the same pressure on the tyre all the way into the turn by reducing
the brake pressure slightly as I lean more (see braking diagram on pg 23), the
front will continue to understeer. This is what happens when the rider has
found
the limit of the current front tyre and bike setup during corner entry.
When this happens it feels to me as if the front tyre is being squashed a little
too much out of shape and 'Bulldozes' or understeers straight ahead. (Of
course you can attempt to raise this limit by experimenting with bike set up,
tyres and tyre pressure). This is not a  problem if I am just trying to stop the
bike as fast as possible, it just lets me know I am pushing the limit, but it is a
problem
when I need the bike to turn and it pushes on past where I need it
to start turning. If this happens I know I need to brake earlier for that corner
on the next lap so as not to loose time running off line and destroying the
corner and lap time.
'' KEEP THE SAME PRESSURE ON THE TYRE ALL THE WAY INTO THE TURN
BY REDUCING THE BRAKE PRESSURE SLIGHTLY AS YOU LEAN MORE ''

WEIGHT SHIFTING WITH YOUR UPPER BODY
In Motovudu: Dark Art of Performance, I described in the 'Body Position' section that once my head is on the centreline of the bike and the bike is close to straight
up
and down, I position my backside off to one side in preparation for the next corner. After a long straight while braking into a slow hairpin or corner; I need to
brake in a straight line for some distance until I get closer to the corner before 'braking at an angle toward the corner'. I need to do this to get the 'angle of corner
entry' correct.
During the time
I am maximum braking in a straight line the bike is completely upright, the ru les of 'weight shifting' become slightly different to those for 'braking
toward the corner'.
When the bike is upright it is evenly balanced, but the weight of my backside off to one side throws this balance off slightly So, the moment
the rear
wheel becomes light or picks up off of the ground during maximum braking, the back of the bike starts to drift and move sideways in the direction that my
backside
is positioned. This is not ideal as it is very difficult to turn into a corner when your rear wheel has decided to start heading in the direction of the corner
before you.
In order to prevent this and keep the back wheel in line while the bike is completely upright, I move my head slightly off to the opposite side to that of
my backside, just enough to compensate and get things balanced again. I can feel how much I need to do this like anything requiring balance; the back end of the bike
reacts
immediately and in proportion to the amount I move my head.  However; the moment I start to lean the bike toward the turn and 'brake at an angle toward
the corner', my
head, upper body and backside weight is required on the inside (corner side of the bike) as usual.
1 Move your head to the opposite side to that
of your backside just enough to compensate
2 As you lean the bike toward the tum, your
head, upper body and backside are required
on the same side
3 Simultaneously commit your body and
bike to the corner

WEIGHT SHIFTING WITH YOUR LEG
The rear wheel's tendency to come around during maximum braking at part lean (backing in) is one of the reasons you see top rider's 'weightshifting' by holding
their leg out
As soon as I turn the bike toward the corner under heavy braking the front of the bike moves slightly in the direction of the corner but the inertia of everything
else behind it wants to continue straight ahead. This results in the weight/inertia of the bike and rider behind the front tyre contact patch no longer being evenly
distributed left and right At this same moment, the engine-braked rear tyre is resisting the asphalt's attempts to turn it, so the rear wheel wants to slide out ('back in').
Taking your inside foot off the peg and moving it (about 7 -I 0 kg) toward the inside of the corner, redistributes the balance of weight of you and the bike behind the
front tyre contact patch more
evenly again and so helps prevent the rear wheel sliding out
I have also noticed that taking my foot off of the footrest and moving it close to the asphalt surface and also rearward, allows me to brake slightly harder before the
rear
wheel lifts off the asphalt. This enables me to stop the bike a metre or two earlier which can make the difference between staying on line and not running wide,
or avoiding a collision with a bike in front. I call this my 'panic brake'.

WHEELS IN LINE
As a motorcycle with a large width rear tyre leans over, the weight bias to the front tyre
feels like it is slightly increased, and the rear of the bike feels like it is being raised up.
This is why when you fit a larger width and/or profile rear tyre, you will need to lower
the rear ride height a
little to compensate if you want the bike to feel similar to what
it did with the smaller rear tyre.
The reason
for bringing this up is that when the rear slides out to the side during part
lean/maximum braking, this feeling and the feeling of weight being transferred directly
to the front by the large rear tyre pushing from behind is cancelled out. Because the
weight that
was transferred to the front suspension and tyre now feels slightly reduced,
the front tyre that
was deformed, pushing, understeering and/or threatening to tuck a
moment before,
is relieved just enough to get its shape back, and no longer feels like it's
about to tuck. Of course once that happens it's back to square one ... the limit is raised
during the time the rear
is slightly out to the side so I can now pull slightly harder on the
brake
lever, stopping faster with less chance of the front tucking/folding.
When the rear comes back into line toward the end of the maximum braking area,
some weight feels like it is being transferred back onto the front. It is important to
reduce the front brake pressure at the same time, otherwise there is an increased
risk
of pushing/ tucking the front and crashing. Plus, if the rear wheel comes back into
line too quickly, the seat shoves me in the backside, pushing me forward and onto my
hands. I've learned the hard way to never have stiff arms at this moment. Sure I have to
support my weight but it is very important to let my arms smoothly absorb my weight
(like soft suspension
would). If I don't, eventually the front tyre that is already close to
the limit will suddenly also have my weight thrown on it. It will tuck and I will go down.
As always, it is important to get the wheels back in line and the brakes released while I
still
have the correct corner entry speed. Staying on the brakes and sideways past the
optimum brake
release and turn in point will cost time. This happens if I have simply
braked
too late for the corner and can't get slowed enough for when this brake release
point arrives.

NOYES CAMP, ALCANIZ SPAIN
Of course this 'backing in' technique is not necessary if the front tyre
performance
level is high enough, and bike setup is very good, but from my
experience that doesn't happen
too often in the average motorcycle racer's
career, so there will be times it will help.
More than once I've ended up in a race with a bike setup that turns very well
mid turn and exit. but because of a  front bias setup, the corner entry was
suffering. By using this 'backing in' technique I was able to stop the front push
problem during corner entry then get the wheels back in line and enjoy a
good turning bike on the
throttle.
The easiest way to perfect this technique is to practice it on a dirt bike. The
lower grip levels on the dirt make it a little easier to do, and it's less expensive
when it
all goes wrong. Simply practice maximum braking on a slight angle
towards the corner while banging down through the gears. Keep moving
your braking marker
closer to the corner. At a certain point the rear will start
sliding out to the side allowing you to pull harder on the front brake without
the front tucking. Practice getting the rear back into
line and off of the brakes
in time to enter the turn before losing too much corner speed.
''AT A CERTAIN POINT THE
REAR WILL SLIDE OUT ALLOWING
YOU TO PULL HARDER ON
THE FRONT BRAKE''

ENGINE AND REAR BRAKE
I always use 'maximum engine braking' as a  very useful tool to take
pressure
off of the front, just enough to allow the front tyre to stop
pushing straight
ahead. As I described in the Motovudu: Dark Art of
Performance 'Full Brakes' section, a moment after I start braking, I then
'dip' the
clutch with one finger (use the finger/fingers you prefer) just
enough
to disengage the clutch, 'blip' the throttle to wind the rpm to
maximum and match the next gear down that I have selected. Matching
the rpm
helps prevent the rear chattering and sliding too much. A badly
matched down change that clunks and bangs will set the rear off skipping
and bouncing, making it  more difficult to get the bike stopped in the
shortest distance possible.
The engine brake
and rear brake start to help more once the bike leans
over and more weight is transferred to the rear. I try to use all the engine
brake
I can to help reduce the load on the front, which in turn allows me
to go into the corner a step harder and faster than otherwise possible.
The rear brake
will do the same thing if that's what you prefer to do. It's
down to personal preference.
As always, the rider's job is to find a  way to help the tyres. These are
the types of things that a fast rider finds in order to go faster than more
conventional riding
allows.
'' A BADLY MATCHED DOWN CHANGE THAT CLUNKS AND BANGS
WILL SET THE REAR OFF SKIPPING AND BOUNCING ''

CHAPTER 3: ADVANCED CORNER ENTRY
Do you remember the ru les of corner entry from Motovudu: Dark Art of Performance?
BENDING THE ENTRY
I have found that when I push corner entry to the maximum, the understeer effectively 'bends' my entry line slightly wider than if I enter
with more
in reserve. By 'bend', I mean that the push of the front slightly distorts the line my bike would otherwise take during corner
entry
by understeering a little in the middle of the entry section. Usually it is a problem, but sometimes I can use this to my advantage
because when the bike slows down as it gets closer to the turn (maybe slightly slower than I otherwise would) the bike comes back on a
slightly better line for the exit.

AREA
BENDING
NORMAL
BY BENDING THE ENTRY THE BIKE COMES BACK ON A
BETTER LINE FOR THE EXIT
So, by pushing extremely hard on the way into a turn, I have not only won time on the
entry
by braking later, but I can afford to lose a fraction of mid corner speed to get it
to come back onto line at a slightly better angle for the exit, then pick the bike up off
of the edge of the tyre and also win time on the exit.
Yes, it's a fine line between getting this 'bending' the entry right and getting it wrong,
pushing past the turn
and destroying the whole corner; which does happen when
getting up
to speed, but this is what practice sessions are for. I push as hard as I can and
find my markers so I can replicate an entry that is absolutely on the limit, followed by
a better than average exit. When I get a corner to work like this, I know it will be very
difficult
for another rider to gain time on me there. The difficult  bit is getting it right
every
lap, every corner. That takes serious mental and physical effort. but when you can
do this, you will be ready to ,-ace with the riders at the front.
Please don't make the mistake of thinking this 'Bending' is a big difference in line. It is
only a  subtle difference, like everything when going fast. Making a  difference when
going fast
is often about moving the areas of maximum stress on the tyres.

STEALING A FEW METRES
I mentioned in Motovudu: Dark Art Of Performance, that to enable me to push harder into a turn, I wi ll brake at partial lean while already committing my head and
upper body to the turn. I do this by pushing my upper body off to the inside side of the bike by extending my outside arm to it's maximum, and pushing my head
in the direction that I want to turn. This helps 'steal a few metres' more on full brakes (keeping the bike slightly more upright enabling me t o stay on full brakes for
a few metres longer). It is not hard on my arms as my thigh is 'locked in' hard up against the tank taking part of the weight. I have also noticed that my thigh against
and slightly around the tank helps
to hold the bike down on full lean during the corner while also helping me to hold on.
'Stealing a few metres' also
gives an advantage while trail braking (braking at greater lean angles, outside the maximum braking zone). By holding the bike slightly more
upright. I can continue to brake slightly harder and for longer than would be possible if the bike was at a bigger lean angle. As I come off of the brakes completely,
my body
is already in the correct position fully committed to the turn.
QUALIFYING TIP
Even after I have found the correct bike setup, tyre and tyre pressure to help the front keep its shape at higher entry speeds, and I am helping it with engine braking,
eventually
I will get to the limit of the tyre again. This is when a new front tyre (as well as rear tyre) will help me achieve a lap time I am proud of. A new front w ill
cope with extra fast, hard entries, and help you stay on line at higher than normal levels for a few laps before it drops to its normal strength and grip level.
'' BY HOLDING THE BIKE SLIGHTLY MORE UPRIGHT,
I CAN CONTINUE TO BRAKE HARDER AND FOR LONGER ''

CHAPTER 4: ADVANCED MID CORNER
Do you remember the rules of mid corner from Motovudu: Dark Art of Performance?
·j --I
Choose the correct moment and speed to crack (open) the throttle
Open the throttle extremely softly and smoothly and only enough to stop deceleration
WAIT. Too hard on the gas too early is dangerous and usually slower
------~
CRACKING THE THROTTLE
Once you decide the time is right to crack open the throttle, you need to do it softly and so slightly that the bike stops decelerating but stays strictly
on the line you have chosen at the correct speed. If you open the throttle too much or too early the bike will run wide and off of the line you need,
destroying your turn
and exit. Also, it is dangerous, especially now that the rpm is high because you are utilising maximum engine braking on entry and
there is limited rear grip when you are travelling as fast as possible at full lean. It is important to not try to go faster at this point, but to keep a neutral
throttle
(not accelerating hard or decelerating) and wait for the bike to turn.

### The
skill is knowing when to crack the throttle open, and once you have it cracked, WAIT! Keep the bike turning on that neutral throttle, still turning at
its maximum,
hugging the tight inside line a moment longer, until you can stand the bike up off the edge of the rear tyre and get on the throttle harder,
winning time accelerating
off of the corne~
I try my very best to never go roughly or carelessly from closed throttle to accelerating. I always take care to feel that the rear tyre is there with me,
and is going to stay there, especially at full lean. Not taking care in this area has resulted in a big 'highside' for me on more than one occasion.  Looking
back on those
highsides, I remember feeling that I had only lowered my guard/concentration a fraction, and the result was much like being thrown off
a I st story balcony onto the asphalt.
No matter what type of corner you are dealing with, it is essential to get your bike to turn in the shortest possible time. Even when dealing with more
open, faster turns,
its still important to get the bike turned as quick as possible in order to be able to accelerate as soon as possible.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOT TRY AND GO FASTER AT THIS POINT, BUT TO KEEP A NEUTRAL THROTTLE (NOT
ACCELERATING HARD OR DECELERATING) AND WAIT FOR THE BIKE TO TURN.

CHICANES AND TIGHTER TURNS
In general I find that many riders I help don't have as much difficulty mastering the more open turns but tend to lose
time in the tighter turns and chicanes.
Using a left to right chicane where the throttle is needed as an example (not all chicanes require throttle). Starting
while leaning in the middle of the left turn (first half of chicane) I smoothly roll on the throttle to the point of sliding
the rear while applying a little pressure on the bars to both hold the bike down and keep the bike turning left to the
maximum.
At this point because of the application of the throttle and turn of the bike the suspension is 'loaded up'.
Visually I am focused on the point where I am going to change direction, mid chicane, not too wide. When I reach this
point
and I want the bike t o change direction, I keep the bike turning left while letting it stand up, then close the throttle
while
committing my body to the right at the same time as relaxing my arms to let the handle bars/front tyre go where
they need,
whilst looking to w here I want to go (apex of the second part of the chicane and beyond). A ll of the energy
from turning
left, plus the suspension unloading, helps the bike f lick faster with less effort to full lean on the right side.
(The technique is of course the same in reverse when dealing wit h a right to left chicane where the throttle is required).
The difference here
is using the throttle and continuing to turn left a little in order to 'load the bike up', so when you
let it go it effectively does the work of changing direction for you and quickly, rather than you having to physically force
the bike
left to right in the centre of the chicane which is tiring, slower and can also create huge instability. (see Change
of direction in Motovudu: Dark Art of Performance for further information)
Note: There are some chicanes where you can't use any throttle to assist the side to side transition, but the change of
direction still comes from how you handle the first turn in the chicane.
I use this same technique on tight t urns, but to a slightly lesser degree. While hugging the inside line in the middle of the
turn I smoothly roll on the throttle to the point of sliding the rear. while applying a little pressure on the bars to both
hold the bike down and keep the bike turning to the maximum amount a little longer. The bike wants to stand up but
I'm forcing it to stay down a moment longer. When the t ime is right I let it stand up and get hard on the throttle. The
time
is won through turning faster. and being up off the sidegrip sooner and on to the throttle earlier.

FEELING EDGE GRIP/SIDE GRIP
Going fast is about pushing all area's to the limit, that's what riders/racers do. It is important to understand and be able to find where the limit
of the edge grip of the rear tyre is because fast riders ride around on this and it is constantly changing.  For example, a used tyre will often feel
different than it was in the session earlier. The edgegrip will usually take some warming up to be at its best, but it could also be gone completely.
Once I
am in the 'mid turn' of a corner; at my maximum lean and I have the throttle cracked, I don't keep things constant, I keep the bike turning
online, but give fractionally more throttle, building a little more speed until I can feel the reartyre give a little movement.
Different tyres react
differently, but It is often a squirming feel or it may
go slightly out of line from the front and stay there each time I apply
a little more throttle. Either way, I take it as a  warning that the rear
tyre
will not put up with any more. I keep the throttle in this position,
focusing on turning
and I try not to do anything more that will make the
tyre
completely let go. The aim is to go all the way around the corner
like this, on the edge of grip.
It is much easier to find the limit on the longer turns. I use the long
turns to find out how much side grip I have, so I will then be able to
predict what I will have on the 'quick flick' short turns where I don't
have time to gradually raise the stress on the tyre until I feel the limit.

### It
is important to find out the edge grip level you have available within
the
first few laps. Experienced fast riders can do this in the first few
corners, but
if you are not VERY CAREFUL, you are going to crash.
Note: The biggest dangers. The areas of riding that catch out more riders
than any other area of riding are 'Trail Braking' and the 'Initial crack of the
throttle
'. Especially during the out lap when the tyres are not yet fully hot.

EXTREME CLOSED THROTTLE TURNING (BENDING THE ENTRY)
Remember closed throttle turning from Motovudu: Dark Art of Performance?

### It
is possible to apply this 'closed throttle turning' to the extreme. For example;
imagine a medium-to-fast 90 degree corner that has a straight after it, making it
important to get a good exit. I build up speed until I get the bike on 'maximum
lean-closed throttle' with so much speed that the front understeers for a few
moments
and runs slightly wider in the middle of the entry area, well before the
apex. It then scrubs off enough speed to stop pushing and turns back toward the
turn on a
slightly better line for t he  exit  than is otherwise possible. I am talking
about very slight differences/variations, not metres off line. I think of this as simply
giving an earlier section of a corner a higher workload in order to relieve the
following section of that corner, in order to win time.
I have found that by doing this, it makes it possible to enter a turn extremely fast,
get the majority of the turn done before the apex, and get the bike up off of the
edge
slightly earlier for a good exit. This technique is again 'Bending' the entry
line, but this time I'm doing it while I'm not on the brakes, and while at maximum
lean. If your tyres are good enough you will not need to do this, but a fast riders
job
is to push the tyres to the limit. then find a way to go faster.
'' I THINK OF THIS AS SIMPLY GIVING
AN EARLIER SECTION OF A CORNER A

RELIEVE THE FOLLOWING SECTION OF THAT
CORNER, IN ORDER TO WIN TIME. ''
'BEND'
EXTREME CLOSED THROTTLE TURNING

LOSING A LITTLE TO GAIN A LOT
To go fast on a large capacity bike, as I explained in Motovudu: Dark Art of
Performance, I had to learn to 'lose a little time. to gain a lot'. As a  young
enthusiastic rider
I found this very difficult to do, but it is extremely important
if you are to go fast safely on a big bike. To be honest, it is something I think I
could
have done better at the peak of my career and would work harder on
it if I had my time over again. It's easy to ride as fast as you can without really
thinking, but it is often not the fastest way.
Imagine a long corner that seems to go on and on, like turn 5  and the last
turn at Cartagena. They are basically I 80 deg corners where the fastest way
around

### is to treat them like a double or late apex corner (see Motovudu:

### Dark
Art of Performance).
As I arrive toward the end of the corner, the bike is still at maximum lean on
the edge (sidegrip area) of the rear tyre right at the moment the exit arrives
and
I need to accelerate off of the turn. This makes it impossible to open the
throttle much more before the rear tyre loses grip completely or I head off
the track. The problem is that I am already riding around the corner as fast
as
I can before I try to open the throttle to exit. To go faster, I need to find
a way
to use the drive/exit area of the turn to the maximum. and work back
from there.
I mean the area from the inside near the curb late in the turn, to
the curb on the outside of the turn where I touch the paint before standing
the bike up fully and head off down the straight.
In this exit area the rider with the throttle open the widest wins the most
time, but
it's extremely dangerous to open the throttle hard while at full lean
and still using the edgegrip area of the rear tyre. So here is what I do ...

'' TOWARD THE END OF THE MID-TURN AREA, WHEN THE TIMES COMES TO
LINE UP THE EXIT, I EVER SO SLIGHTLY REDUCE THE THROTTLE TO ALLOW THE
BIKE TO TURN BACK TOWARD THE TIGHT INSIDE LINE ''

I run around the turn as fast as I can like always, but slightly wider than normal in the mid-turn, a metre or three off of the inside line (this also allows me to go in
a bit faster because I have more track to use). Then, toward the end of the mid-turn area, when the time comes to line up the exit, I ever so slightly reduce the
throttle
to allow the bike to turn back toward the tight inside line (if I have enough side-grip left I may not need to reduce the throttle, otherwise I do). The trick is
in the timing of slight reduction in throttle and turning to the tight inside line. Too early and I will need to lean over later to finish the turn and be back in the original
situation.
Leave it too late and I will lose more time than I was hoping to gain. The aim is to time it so that when the bike has finished turning back to the inside with
reduced throttle
and I start to stand the bike up slightly off the edge of the rear tyre, it is the very same moment I arrive at the point on the track that the 'exit area'
starts
and I need to open the throttle and go! Basically this is lining the bike up on a better angle for the exit  (lean angle and bike trajectory/exit angle). When I am
going as fast as I can at full lean using all the available side grip, it is difficult to get the bike to turn any tighter w ithout reducing the throttle slightly. Doing this basically
allows the rider to finish the main part of the turn earlier (because the bike turns tighter with less throttle) and then to pick the bike up off of full lean earlier and
get the throttle open harder, which otherwise would not be possible until much later and further from the corner. This is what I mean when I say you must learn to
lose a little to gain a lot.
I apply this same technique to almost every exit on a lap. It is only the amount I apply it that varies. Some turns you will not actually need to reduce the throttle, but
simply keep
the throttle constant and the bike turning at its maximum a moment longer, opening the throttle a fraction later but harder.
Remember that the entry
and exit are where you can win the most amount of time on a big capacity bike. When riding with or against good level riders, everyone
can brake well, everyone can ride fast around a corner and get the rear on the limit in the exit area. A fast rider will think of new tricks and time them right in order
to get an advantage.
After reading the 'Mid Corner' section you will understand why a good or new rear tyre is so important. If the rear side/edge grip is low, it will be difficult to open
the throttle a fraction while keeping the bike turning tight
in order to 'finish a turn' quickly (especially a tight turn), and it wi ll be difficult to 'load the bike up' in order
to get a good fast 'flick' mid chicane. This combined with the extra drive advantage a good rear tyre gives, adds up to a massive difference in your lap time that a
rear tyre
can make.

CHAPTER 5: ADVANCED CORNER EXIT
Do you remember the rules of corner exit from Motovudu: Dark Art of Performance?
As soon
as I crack the throttle in the mid-corner, after the tyre's have done a number of laps, the rear tyre will start to move. My aim is to keep the
rear tyre on the
limit and moving from the moment I've cracked the throttle in the mid-corner, until I am well out of the turn. Yes, I get more grip from
the rear tyre
as I stand the bike up off of the edge, but I use it immediately by feeding on more throttle, so the tyre will squirm all the way out of the
turn. This is what
fast riders do, use all of the grip they have available.
If  I have achieved a great entry and mid-corner, most of the work preparing for the exit is already complete. When I decide that I have got the bike
turned enough
and can see a nice, relatively straight exit run, I hold myself forward in order to physically stay with the front of the bike while picking it
up off of the edge of the tyre.This 'picking the bike up' feels like the bike literally hinges at the point my backside touches the seat, so the bike can stand
upright a fraction more but
I stay down. Then I try my best to get the throttle open as wide as I can. It is this beautiful rush of acceleration while holding
the throttle wide open that wins time, and this is where my Motovudu saying 'It's not who's first on the gas, it's who's first on FULL gas' comes from.

:t·l , . '

TRANSFERRING YOUR WEIGHT TO THE REAR DURING EXIT
Some riders have told me that they like the feel of their weight on the rear tyre when they are driving off of a turn leaned over. I recognise the feeling of
needing to do this, especially if the weight bias of the bike is toward the front, or the rear grip does not feel trustworthy. Sometimes I have had no choice
but
to transfer some weight to the rear to get some confidence in the rear grip.
I do this transfer of weight during acceleration not by moving my backside rearwards, but by extending my arms and moving my upper body back and up,
effectively moving the centre of gravity up and rearward. To me, it feels much safer and easier to do THIS under hard acceleration than trying to move my
backside,
plus during mid-corner I still have the advantage of sitting forward to improve the turn of the bike. The negative effect of any transfer of weight to
the rear is the bike will tend to wheelie more. Also, if the rear suddenly lets go, it's harder to control or save when you have your weight on it, but the weight
balance is easily adjustable by simply bending your arms again and getting your chest back down towards the tank.
During braking,
I hold my upper body back with my arms, but I still sit forward hard against the tank during entry, mid-corner and exit of all turns. Some riders
sit back from the tank
and go very fast like this, but on a very powerful bike wheelies are a problem during hard acceleration, especially for larger riders. Many
bikes
have 'wheelie control' now, however wheelie control reduces power and acceleration in order to control the wheelie, so the more the rider can help
prevent the wheelie in the first place, the more the bike will be allowed to accelerate.
Note: For more information please see Wheelie Control in Motovudu: Dark Art of Performance.

CHAPTER 6: FILLING IN THE GAPS
Up until now I have focused on breaking down the track/lap into sections and actions as much as possible, to focus on technique. As you develop as a rider and your
technique improves you will
be looking for the final tenths around the track so your 'mind set' has to change slightly. You need to start to look at the lap as a whole
USING YOUR TYRES
You know the feeling when you are on the limit, pushing your tyres hard, on the brakes, turning in, mid turn, full lean or on the throttle driving out of the turn? Once
you are doing all of these things well, you need to find a way to 'fil l in all the gaps' between these points by trying to find time in the areas the tyres are not yet working
hard.
If you feel the tyre is not being pushed in a place between two of these points I have listed, then find a way to go faster there to raise the stress on the tyres
at that
moment to a similar stress level to the point before and afte~ Basically trying to smooth it out by getting close to the limit of your tyres as much as possible
all the way around
the lap. I don't mean stress the tyres for no gain, I mean use what is left to find more time and go faste~
When the rear tyre is new and hot, it feels solid at full lean, to the point you cannot lean over any further and you are going as fast as the bike can in a corner without
running wide. However, when your rear tyre is used the side grip will be more unstable, It w ill move around or even completely let go during much smaller throttle
openings than the new tyre coped wrth. Our job as a rider is to get to the limit of the side grip we have available.
Most people instinctively
have less trust in the front tyre so they sit  toward the back of the bike and don't push when it comes to using the front. If you have a good
front tyre
fitted and its hot, you can trust it much more than the rear at bigger lean angles. On a large capacity bike the front profile is rounded, while the rear has
a much flatter profile to help with drive grip, because of this it is easier to get to the very edge of the rear tyre than the front. Once your front is warmed up, and
you are not on the front brake at big lean angles, you can sit forward, look where you want to go, lean the thing over and trust it, you wont go fast until you do. At
full lean it's the rear tyre with that powerful engine attached to it that you have to constantly feel the limit of and once you have experience of this it should only take
you a corner
or two on each side to feel what rear side grip you have available.
When some brands of rear tyres get worn in the drive area (half lean area), it can still look good in the edge grip /full lean area, but in my experience they are usually
unstable.
I think this is because the rubber in the drive area has been removed and this allows the edge grip area to move around more freely due to the lack of
rubber supporting it. Sometimes a tyres side grip w ill feel bad from the start, other times it w ill initially grip well giving you the confidence to open the throttle more,
and more, but will
all of a sudden have had enough and feel like the side grip level suddenly lowers.  Grip, grip, wham and you are srdeways w ith only just enough t ime
to close the throttle and try and catch it. Other times the side grip wi ll be bad initially but get better once it gets more heat in to it. These are some of the joys of
frnding the limit of your rear tyres side grip, which is all part of a fast riders job list.
CONSISTENCY
Consistency and precision are very important to riding fast on circuit. Until you are able to replicate very closely what you do every lap, you can't be safe. Once a rider
is more comfortable
and practiced with the elements of braking, cornering and exiting, the aim is to replicate what you do every lap. These are hitting the same braking
and turn-in markers, using the same gears, being on the same line every lap, and adjusting them slightly to suit. Consistency and precision help create confidence.

CHAPTER 7: CHOOSING A RACE SERIES
The importance of choosing a  race series or championship that is right for you should not be underestimated. There are a lot of Race events to choose from and
some track day companies now hold races at their events, individual clubs run championships and of course there are national and international competitions.

### Participating
in your first race at a  track day is a  good way to get your first race
experience.
Usually you've spent at least one day on the circuit (5-7 sessions) so
you know where  you are going, you have your braking markers sorted and should
be circulating at a  consistent pace you are comfortable with. These races can give
you a taste of what the procedures of a  race are: sighting lap, grid positioning, warm
up
lap, start and of course the race. You will get more track time than you will get
at a  race meeting and
come away with a good idea of whether racing could be of
interest to you or not, with minimum expense.
Once you decide you want to give racing a go, I would encourage you to look at
how much you want to spend and how often you want to race, or in other words
how much t i
me you can realistically commit to racing. Then do some research!
Some expenses

### to consider:
Bike purchase
Protective equipment such
as Helmet, Leathers, Boots etc

### Tyres
Crash Damage/Repairs

### Spare Parts

### Entry Fees
Insurance and Race license(s)
Bike Maintenance, consumables and Modifications
Travel and Transportation expenses
Food and Accommodation
(if not staying in t he  paddock)
. . . and
last but not least, most of your time.

Make no mistake, bike racing can be an expensive sport. A one-make series often
proves a
popular choice for those starting out or wanting a  competitive field and
great raci
ng where it doesn't depend on how much you have spent on your bike. A
well controlled one-make series can make for a great place to learn racecraft. as the
tactics and skills needed to overtake someone on the same speed bike have to be
applied. The best riders do rise to the top.
Other considerations are how the race series is run. Is there good scrutineering, are
the tracks safe w ith adequate run off and good marshalling? Is there an ambulance
and or medical staff at the track? Is it organised well? I suggest a visit to watch the
race series you are interested in so you can get a first hand look at what is going on
before you
sign up. Also look at how the riders behave on track? Some organisers
let dangerous riding pass without punishment, others don't. Paddock atmosphere
is also important as you will spend more time in the paddock than on track. a good
friendly paddock can make a  huge differenced, and don't be afraid to ask other
riders questions, In general they will be happy to explain anything you want to know
or at least be able to point you in the right direction. If they don't want to, one of
your questions is answered. Finally, I recommend you pick a race series that fits your
current
level of riding, somewhere you'll initially race mid pack where you are not in
over your head which can be demoralising and dangerous, but there are faster riders
that can push you to find new limits and also from whom you can learn.
I
work with riders both at races and at trackdays. In general racing is the best way
to push yourself to a level you would find it hard to achieve at a trackday. However,
trackdays are
the most cost effective way to get lots of track time. Most UK and
European trackday companies run 6
to 7  x 20 minute sessions per group (fast,
medium
or slow group) per day. The problem is some trackdays are over crowded
which
is not good for racers, but you can always phone ahead and find out. with
some trackday companies even running a 4th racer group.
The most important thing for a
developing rider is lots of laps pushing hard on good tracks. I believe it is important to put this ahead of having the latest bike,
performance accessory and gear. Put your money into track time, tyres, brake pads, fuel, oil, travel and food first, then think about the new bike and accessories.

CHAPTER 8: PRACTICE &
QUALIFYING
Make every lap count. No cruising around wasting laps and precious minutes
for any reason. This only gives the hard working riders an advantage.
I go out and push to get the lap times dropping. When they stop dropping
and I get stuck on the same time for a few laps, I take  this as my cue to come
into the
garage and take a break. I have a drink. talk to my team about good
points
and bad points and anything I believe is holding me back. We then make
a decision on what
or if anything needs changing, and then I get back out there
for another push.
I noticed early in my racing career that if I do this, each time I go back out on
track
I am able to push through the old ceiling to the next level, which I could
not do if I stayed out just doing laps. I believe it is the rider's brain/concentration
that
needs a short break, but this only works if I push to my maximum each
time I am on circuit. I also found it useful to get the best lap possible out of
my used tyres before fitting new ones and then get straight back out there.
In general, by making every lap count and always pushing hard straight away, I
slowly
got accustomed to 'riding fast only'. I found that this slowly reduced the
time
I needed to warm up and get going. This is not only useful in practice and
qualifying but also in the first laps of the race.

SLIPSTREAM lNG
I  personally think that I am better off continuing to work hard
on improving
myself and my lap time without a tow, rather than
wasting t ime
looking for it That way if the perfect tow presents
itself. great, If not I have still achieved the best possible time I
could
without a 'tow'.
Getting a
tow (slipstream) from another rider will help the speed
of your bike down a straight If that rider doesn't hold you up
in the corner. and you put the rest of the lap together. you may
improve your
lap time quite substantially but it is very easy to
waste too much time looking for this tow.
The best 'tow'
I ever got was pure luck. I went out on new tyres
and was busy working hard when a slower rider presented
himself exactly in the right place at the right time, twice in one
lapl I put it on pole position at Hockenheim (WSBK 1997), the
fastest circuit on the
calendar on not the fastest bike. I was
simply doing my part of the job as best I could when the 'tows'
presented
themselves.
I  strongly
discourage slipstreaming at track days. Because it is
not a racing environment and you can never tell when the rider
in front may sit up or will shut the throttle on a  straight, with
catastrophic
results.
'' DON'T WASTE TIME LOOKING FOR A TOW,
CONCENTRATE ON WORKING HARD''

I MAKE SURE ALL THE WEIGHT IS ON THE BIKE, NOT ON MY FEET AND SIT AS FAR FORWARD AS POSSIBLE KEEPING MY STOMACH AND LOWER CHEST ON THE TANK

CHAPTER 9: RACE STARTS
A  good start can make or break a race, so I thought it was important that it was included in this book.
With the noise of all the other machines on the grid, and the pressure of getting a good start, actually getting a perfect start is not an easy thing to do. My
motocross background
certainly helped my starts on the asphalt when I was learning, but like everything in life over time you have stronger periods and
weaker periods. I analysed exactly what I was doing off of the line so I knew exactly what I did when I got a good start, and what I did wrong when I got a
bad one.
Below is the process that I decided worked best for me.
When I leave the grid on the start of the sighting lap, I do so as quickly as I can but using lower rpm so I do not get the clutch very hot, because many clutches
will
not cope with two race starts consecutively without being given time to cool down. Even if they do cope with two, the lever position and/or clutch 'bite'
will often not feel exactly the same the second time because of the heat. Two hard starts in a row also ra ises the chance of the clutch slipping during the race.
During the sighting
lap start I get the clutch engaged as soon as possible and accelerate as fast as possible toward the first turn because this is my only
opportunity to predict and practice my first turn braking marker. which will obviously be later than the NORMAL first turn braking marker I use on  a flying
lap. I go past my normal marker still accelerating hard and take a calculated guess where to brake ... NOW! and I see how close I guessed to the ideal brake

### marker:
I take a mental picture of the marker I used and I now know whether I should brake just before or just after that marker during the actual race start.
Now I feel more confident that I have a reasonably accurate marker for the real start in a few minutes.
At the end of the warm-up lap while still rolling toward the grid, I select neutral, allowing plenty of time to muck it up and still select neutral before arriving
at my grid position. The reason
for this is sometimes clutches drag when in gear and make it difficult to get neutral when stationary with the engine running,
and if I can't get neutral I can't be I 00% sure I am in I st gear (race bikes often don't have gear position displays). Also, if it is a long delay before everyone is
ready, a dragging clutch is a hotter clutch, possibly changing the feel and lever position and increasing the chances of'frying' the clutch completely when you
hammer it
off of the start (causing it to slip during the race).
Once I have neutral, I take a look around to see how long until we will be under starters orders and give the engine a rev or two to make sure its rewing
cleanly and there is no chance of it stalling. I also take care that there is no chance of my leg or foot knocking the lever into gear. stalling the bike.
Once we are under starters orders and the marshal standing in front of the grid has raised his flag, before walking off to the side, this is when I hook I st gear
and I can be sure its I st. Making sure all my weight is on the bike, not on my feet, I sit as far forward as possible, keeping my stomach and lower chest on the
tank
to make sure the centre of gravity is as low as possible -helping the front stay on the ground as much as I can. I raise the rpm toward the top of the
range, in the last few I 000 rpm. As the marshal gets to the side of the track I make sure the clutch 'slack' is taken up (the lever movement from fully pulled
in, to where the clutch starts to bite/engage) and I can feel the bike very slightly wanting to roll forward, but it's not yet moving (I use my one finger on the
front brake if it's difficult to hold the bike back with my feet). I now know that if I move the clutch lever at all, the bike will go. I hold the rpm high and the
clutch lever just off of the posrt:ion where it starts to bite and I look at the lights, or if at all possible I look past the lights to where I want to go, keeping the
lights in my peripheral vision, waiting for the moment the red lights will go out.

As I said, it's very hard to hear my own engine over the noise of everyone else's, but as long as the rpm is high, that part of the JOb will be ok. The
lights change and I release the clutch to where it bites hard and launches the bike forward. From my experience I know the rpm will drop a few
I 000 rpm and stay hovering there. Often the initial jump is good, but the temptation is to keep letting the clutch out, especially because everyone
around me
is accelerating at a similar rate and I really want to beat them, but I keep my fingers locked in that position, letting the bite of the clutch
drag the bike and me up to the speed where engine rpm matches first gear wheel speed and the rpm starts rising, signaling the clutch has stopped
slipping. Once this happens I release the clutch fully and wait until the engine rpm increases to the point it is about to hit the limiter and I hook
second
gear. If I still can't hear my own engine and I continue through the rpm range until first gear runs out of speed, the engine will hit the limiter.
but that is the lesser of the two evils. Hitting the limiter for a very short time before I change to second gear loses much less time than letting the
clutch out too much and bogging the engine.
Something to consider ... when motocross riders move to road bikes, they normally get good starts from their first try. This tells me that practicing
race starts on a dirtbike will help nders that have no previous experience with race starts. It is also cheaper and easier to find a place to do it.
One or two feet? I've often thought about whether it's better to have one foot down or two feet down off of the start line. I've noticed that if
I have one foot down the bike can veer in the direction that the leg is down during the time that the front wheel is hovering off the ground. I
chose to use two feet down as there is no negative to this because first gear on a road bike is so long/tall that I have plenty of time to get my left
foot back on the peg before I need to hook second gear. a fair distance from the start line. Until then with two feet down the bike goes in a nice
straight
line while the front wheel is hovering.

CHAPTER 10: OVERTAKING
After years of racing, knowing what side and where on the circuit to overtake is second nature, but I have noticed that for fast riders with less experience this can
be a  major
problem. I regularly have a  rider following me that I am instructing and who is going very well, but they get stuck behind a slower rider I have overtaken.
Often they get frustrated and take an unnecessary risk in order to get past.
Always line up your pass so that you are
overtaki
ng on the inside for the NEXT corner.
This sounds obvious, but
I see the opposite
regularly and it means the overtaking rider
must get
all the way past and turn back across
the front of the rider they have just overtaken,
when
alternatively, if  they had passed on the
inside for the next turn, they would only need
to get beside the rider they are overtaking in
order to get the upper hand.

RIDERS LINE

RIDERS LINE
INCORRECT OVERTAKING
RIDERS LINE
LINE UP YOUR PASS ON THE CORRECT ANGLE FOR THE CORNER
BRAKING ZONE
When overtaking in the braking zone, line up your pass on the correct angle for
the entry of the corner, which should be a very similar angle of entry to that
of the rider you are overtaking. If you enter on a much tighter and completely
different
angle (some riders do this thinking they are being safer), you wi ll have a
much higher risk
of collision and you have made the corner more difficult, risky
and slower for yourself. Plus, if there is a collision, it w ill be more likely to end
in a crash than the small contact that happens when both riders are on a similar
trajector y
and come together.
Because of their lower speeds, slower riders can change direction easier making
it harder
to predict where they will go. Never 'lunge' at the corners hard on the
brakes with a much higher corner entry speed than a rider
in front while closing
in on them at a scary speed. If  you do, eventually you wi ll take both them and
yourself out.

Once you are beside or past a rider in the braking zone, stick to YOUR line. Never swerve out towards the rider you've overtaken before turning back in toward
the corner.
I see this every day I am on circuit. The poor overtaken rider has nowhere to go and has to take evasive action to avoid a collision that could take both
riders out.
I have seen this end in disaster in two different ways. If the overtaking rider is not all the way past, he swerves into the side or front wheel of the
overtaken rider.
When the overtaking rider is all the way past the overtaken rider and then swerves out onto the slower riders line, they avoid collision, but the faster rider brakes
harder
and the slower rider must try to avoid making contact with the back of the rider in front. So I repeat, stick to your t ighter line all the way into the turn. You will
have to reduce your speed a little more than normal to make the turn and get a good exit with this tighter entry line, but you will have the line, and be successfully past.
ONCE YOU ARE BESIDE OR PAST A RIDER IN THE
BRAKING ZONE, STICK TO YOUR LINE

ORDER TO LINE UP
THE E XIT BETTER
GREEN RIDER OVERTAKING RED RIDER
Try to avoid going offline to pass a rider around the outside in mid-corner. If you do,
you
will be forced to go much faster than them covering more ground. with more
lean angle and so more risk. You will usually be doing this on the less clean part of the
circuit that does
not get used as often. The only time this works is if the rider in front
is much slower or if you are lining up the pass for the next turn which is in the opposite
direction. Another risk
of passing a rider around the outside of a corner is if the rider
on the inside
falls off for any reason, you wi ll also be taken down.
Stay strictly to your line in the middle of the corner, getting your bike turned so you
can line up the exit well. Get up off of the edge of your rear tyre early and on the
throttle stop before them, with the aim of driving up beside them on the inside for
the next corner, letting your engine do the work. This way you don't need to get all
the way past them. just beside them. Then to get past, you won't need to take any
more risk in the braking zone than the other rider. Additionally. if you decide that it's
too risky to pass, it is very easy to abort the overtaking manoeuvre by braking a little
earlier
or harder.
Compare this option to braking much later than the rider you want to overtake from
further
back which is very difficult to abort. and if they turn into the corner earlier than
you expected there
is a good chance you will take them and yourself out. You need to
be patient and stick to your lines to get a good exit, but it pays off.
''USE THE ENGINE TO DRIVE UP

''

STAY STRICTLY TO YOUR LINE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CORNER, GETTING YOUR BIKE TURNED SO YOU CAN LINE UP THE EXIT

PASSING SLOWER RIDERS
We all know what it is like to get stuck behind a slower rider and struggle to get past. The important thing to remember is that you caught
them
using your lines which are faster. Don't get sucked into following their lines once you get behind them as you will also get sucked into
doing
their lap times. Keep them in your peripheral vision, look where you want to go on circuit, stick to your lines and you'll find a way past.
It is important to be patient in the mid-corner even if it means waiting behind them in order to line up a good exit.
THE PERFECT PASS
Stick to your line, line up the exit well allowing you to get to full gas before them, drive up close to or beside them, brake  at your normal
brake marker, adjust your speed
to very slightly slower in the centre of the turn, in order to make the turn with the slightly tighter entry line
and get the next exit right.

CHAPTER 11: RIDING FITNESS
As a racer. I spent my whole career trying to find the best way to get fitter and stronger and stay that way. It was
not until very late in my career that I found a good balance that worked well for me. I imagine it is the same for
most sports people. This is what I think ...
Racers are always looking for an edge. I guess this is what makes most of them too quick to believe in things they
don't need.
I was. Someone once told me 'Bananas are good', so I ate them all day every day. Racers are easy
prey for anyone selling fitness junk that is not necessary ... magnetic bracelets, sports drinks for before, during
and after training, bikes, shoes, clothing and anything people can think up to sell.
At the end of the day, like any other human, racers need a good balanced diet, sleep and training. Not too much
or too little of anything. Many racers get into cycling because it is a great sport and one of the best ways to get
your cardio fitness
level up really high. Plus it does not niggle the injuries racers inevitably sustain, like running
does. Pounding the pavement
rattles the screws loose. Because racers are competitive they'll want to beat
everyone they ride with on a
bicycle too. Cycling is hard going at first, but before you know it you are addicted
to it, flying along with ease, eating up the miles/kms. When you are strong on a bicycle it makes you feel very
good, but at the end
of the day we are not cyclists, we are motorcycle racers. Motorcycle racers require less
cardio and legs, but more upper body strength than cyclists (to name just two obvious differences).
When racing at a high level, the only good practice for this is to be testing at that same high level, and this is
very expensive so not usually possible to do often enough to keep a racer 'riding fit'. So the racer will need
other training to keep in good condition. Motocross and enduro are excellent for fitness ... but both come with
risks. Eventually you get hurt doing them. Each racer has to weigh up the benefits verses risks for themselves.
I
think trials riding is hard to beat as a training tool as it trains most of the right muscles and the brain. Also the
maintenance costs are
lower than other motorcycle sports (tyres last a year!) and providing you don't take silly
chances, the risk of injury is lowe~ Finally, the bike control you learn doing trials is excellent. The problem is
that you need the right terrain. So its back to square one, you are going to need to do other types of exercise.
Life is a balance, not too much or too little fun, food, sleep or training. You don't need to be a machine on a
bicycle, you need to be in good shape for riding a motorcycle. So I would advise a young racer to do their
best
to keep in good condition all round. Do some strength and some sort of cardio training often. A racers
schedule can be full of travel, but I personally tried my best to do some type of training every day, and take a
day off here and there.
Finally. don't waste your time. Whatever training you decide to do, push hard so you get the most out of it
more than the opposition.
I believe a racer must do enough hard training that if they ask themselves honestly-
'do I deserve the ride I have. and the ride and results I want? ... the answer will be 'yes'.

HYDRATION
My first Superbike races in Malaysia early in my international career taught me how important hydration is. Coming from winter in my country to race in the heat
and humidity of Malaysia was unbearable, especially at midday wearing a leather suit with an engine pouring heat over me from behind the fairing. I would start the
race well, only to fade terribly and cross the line simply trying not to crash, my physical strength and more importantly, my concentration was almost completely gone.
I experimented a lot over the next 18 months racing in that heat, and found that if I sipped non-stop for the hours leading up to the race, repeatedly urinating clean
and clear until 20 minutes before the race start time, when I'd stop drinking, my stomach would then no longer be full when it came time to race, but I'd be seriously
hydrated. Then
I would take one last pee before getting on the bike and leaving the garage. By doing this I'd keep my concentration and strength through till the end
of the race and won the Malaysian Superbike Championship in 1991.
I used this hydration technique right through until the end of my career. I hope it also helps you.

CHAPTER 12: VUDU TRICKS
VISUAL REFERENCES
As I ride around the circuit trying to go faster each lap, I take note of all the visual references/markers that I can use to get my lines and timing, accurate and consistent.
Visual references are especially useful for braking markers at the end of fast sections, but they are also useful as indicators of what direction to go to when on blind
straights, approaching blind corners, turn in points, brake release, commit to the turn points, apex points, acceleration and exit points. Without these visual references
it
is very difficult to consistently replicate good laps, let alone the best possible lap.
Almost anything you see can be used as a reference point. A change in surface, painted lines, beginning or end of rumble strips/curbing, buildings, tyre walls and air
fences. You name it, if its visible and fixed (not a shadow, car or animal) you can use it to know when to brake, when and how far to let the bike run wide, start turning
in, release the brake and cornmit to full lean, stand the bike up, start to build speed or accelerate hard, and all of this can be adjusted to suit, i.e. just before, at, or just
after the
visual reference point you have chosen.
The trick is
in how to use these references. If I look away from my reference point to the next reference point too early, I will likely not quite make it to that point.
If  I look away too late, I slow myself down. I have found the best solution is to look at the reference point only as long as I need to ensure I will get there, always
looking to the next one just before reaching each point. The whole track is made up of these reference points.
Probably the most common mistake is to not look far enough ahead. I see riders looking at a point a short distance ahead of them, and by doing this they restrict
themselves. When I follow them and wonder why they don't open the throttle between turns, it is usually for this reason. They are often looking at the next apex
when they
could keep the next apex in their peripheral vision, but look to the point they want to reach further down the track. As soon as they do this, they open
the
throttle and feel like the track is bigger and less 'claustrophobic' than before.

### The
other 'must' is commitment. Just looking at a reference point is not enough. I look at it and commit, not just my eyes, but my face, upper body, and I believe I
am going there. The difference, when you do this is surprising. The bike starts to feel like it is following where you have committed to going. Sure there is a limit to
what the bike will do, but by doing what I suggest here I can get the bike to fo llow me at speeds I previously thought were not possible to make the corner at, and
that's a fast riders job, to push to find new limits.
'' I LOOK AT THE REFERENCE POINT ONLY AS LONG AS I NEED
TO ENSURE I WILL GET THERE, ALWAYS LOOKING TOWARD
THE NEXT ONE JUST BEFORE REACHING EACH POINT ''

SEEING THE CIRCUIT IN 30
Riders need to use the contours of the track to both help them, and also as a visual warning of where to take care. As I circulate around a circuit quickly, I take note of
the constantly changing contours of the track and try to use them to help me. As the 'banking' of the circuit becomes positive and I feel the g-forces use up some of
the suspension and force the tyres into the road, (much like a 'berm' or rut on a dirt bike), I open the throttle more to match the extra grip that comes with a positive
camber and the tyre being forced into the asphalt. As the weight comes off again, over the brow of a hill or the track surface drops away to become 'off camber', I roll
the throttle off a little to suit. I try to see the whole circuit in this way as well as simply left and right turns. I do exactly the same while braking, using the cambers to
tell me where I can get away with braking extra hard on positive cambered surfaces while leaning. Where the track is off camber it also warns me where to be careful.

MANAGING WORN lYRES DURING A RACE
It is normal that rear tyre performance drops during a  race, but sometimes the side-grip and half-lean drive performance disappears to the point of serious instability
while applying
any more than the slightest throttle opening. In order to stop the lap time dropping as much as the tyre performance does, I change the style of my
riding
to suit what front and rear grip I have left.
In the early laps I use the riding style that achieves the best times, using the front and rear to the maximum, stopping and turning the bike tight, delaying the
acceleration a moment longer in the tight turns in order to line up the exit and drive hard. As the rear tyre 'drops off'. it can no longer cope with hard driving off
the turns so I figure out a  way to ride fast with minimal throttle openings in all areas except when the bike is close to upright.
I do this by not waiting as long to open the throttle, but I open it very very softly at slightly higher
corner speeds, constantly feeling for how much throttle the rear tyre can take carrying more
speed through the corner and then building speed as best I can with the lack of grip. On new
tyres this style would never be close to as fast unless the circuit was very flowing (very few exits
from
slow turns). With a rear tyre that feels like it can no longer cope with any stress, I have
no choice but
to keep the bike flowing around the track as best I can, knowing that every bit of
corner speed I lose during a turn, the rear will struggle to get it back again because the rear tyre
has
almost no side-grip and completely lets go at lean angles that the front copes with without
a
problem. I simply release the brakes while carrying more speed than normal, lean like hell and
position as much
of my weight on the front tyre as I possibly can, using the front to carry me
through the turn and as far out the other side of the turn as possible. This extra entry and mid
turn
speed will carry me further out of the turn before I need to accelerate.
Sometimes the side-grip disappears to the point that it will not even cope with closed throttle
at full lean before letting go completely. When this happens I am forced to use constant throttle
whenever leaning the bike, which makes the bike turn less and run wide. Once through the turn,
and before
the speed has a chance to drop, I'll 'tickle' the throttle enough to keep the bike rolling
through and far enough out of the corner to get it stood up off of the edge and into the centre
of the rear tyre and accelerate hard again.
When the front tyre performance drops off or wears excessively, it is  a situation that is nothing
short of a  nightmare for a  rider to manage. If everyone else in the race has the same problem,
OK, it's still a  race, but iffor some reason it's only you ... in short ... You. Are. Screwed.
