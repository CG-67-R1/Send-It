## 🔧 Global Rule

**All tyre pressures are expressed in PSI and refer to TARGET HOT / RUNNING pressure unless explicitly stated otherwise.**

Cold pressure is only a means to reach the hot target.

**Always measure hot pressure immediately after pit-in at operating temperature (do not wait).**

## Weather → Tire Choice & Pressure Rules

### Cold Track / Cold Air

**Signals**:
- Ambient air temp ≤ 15°C
- Track surface temp ≤ 20°C

**Common Risks**:
- Cold tear / graining from insufficient carcass temperature
- Front-end push from tyre never stabilising in operating window

**Tire Choice Bias**:
- Prefer compounds that tolerate low temp without tearing (often not the softest option if you cannot keep heat)
- Use warmers correctly; do not overheat them in cold conditions

**Pressure Bias**:
- ❌ **Do NOT drop hot pressure to chase grip**
- ✅ **Stay in target hot PSI window**
- If tearing occurs: Fix warmers strategy first, then consider +0.5 to +1.0 psi hot, not less

**Suspension Bias** (goal: increase compliance and grip without creating wallow):
1. Reduce compression slightly
2. Increase rebound slightly (small steps)
3. Reduce preload slightly (increase sag a touch)
4. Only then consider spring changes

---

### Hot Track / Hot Air

**Signals**:
- Ambient air temp ≥ 28°C
- Track surface temp ≥ 40°C

**Common Risks**:
- Overheating / hot tear
- Greasy feel / rear spin glaze if pressure/compound mismatch

**Tire Choice Bias**:
- Harder compound or higher-temp compound range as heat rises
- Avoid overly soft compound if pace/track temp will overheat it

**Pressure Bias**:
- If greasy → check you're not over the top of hot PSI window
- Small changes only: ±0.5 psi hot
- Avoid exceeding the top of the hot-pressure window (overpressure reduces contact patch and can feel 'skatey')

**Suspension Bias** (goal: control carcass load and prevent excessive heat generation):
1. Increase compression slightly (support)
2. Reduce rebound slightly if tyre is not recovering between hits
3. Verify ride height/geometry before large damping swings

---

### Wet / Drying

**Signals**:
- Standing water
- Wet track
- Drying line with damp patches

**Common Risks**:
- Hydroplaning risk on standing water
- Overheating rain tyre on drying line

**Tire Choice Bias**:
- Rain tyre for standing water
- Intermediate / grooved if allowed; otherwise adjust slick strategy only if rules permit

**Pressure Bias** (Use Bridgestone delta logic universally unless brand says otherwise):
- **Standing water**: +1.5 psi
- **Fully wet**: No change
- **Drying track**: -1.5 psi
- Adjust based on water amount: more water can justify slightly higher pressure; drying line can justify slightly lower than wet baseline

**Suspension Bias** (goal: maximise mechanical grip and feedback):
1. Soften compression slightly
2. Soften preload slightly
3. Small rebound changes only after grip is stable

## Warmers Temperature Guidance

### Dry Slicks

**Cold Surface**:
- Warmer temp: 70°C
- Minimum time: 60 minutes
- **Reason**: Avoid overheating on warmers then cooling rapidly on track (skews grip perception)

**Hot Surface**:
- Warmer temp: 90°C
- Minimum time: 60 minutes

### Rain Tyres

**Michelin Power Rain** (if warmers used):
- Cold surface: 30°C
- Hot surface: 50°C

**General Rule**: Warmers help reach operating pressure faster; do NOT start with lower pressure just because you used warmers.

---

## Wear Diagnosis & Fix Order

### Fix Order Rule

1. **Confirm hot pressure immediately after pit-in**
2. **Move pressure toward the brand's target HOT/running window**
3. **Adjust warmers strategy (temp/time) for cold/hot surface**
4. **Re-evaluate compound choice for conditions + pace**
5. **Only then tune suspension in small steps**

---

### Wear Patterns

#### Cold Tear or Graining

**Likely Causes** (ranked):
1. Tyre not reaching/staying in operating window (cold track / short sessions / cautious pace)
2. Compound too soft for cold conditions and/or pace
3. Hot pressure too low (excess carcass flex can shred surface at low temp)
4. Suspension too stiff (esp. compression) reducing mechanical grip

**Suggested Fixes**:
- Use warmers correctly; avoid setting warmers too hot in cold conditions
- Move hot pressure into target window (do not chase grip by dropping pressure)
- Consider harder or more temperature-tolerant compound if you cannot keep heat
- Soften compression slightly; reduce preload slightly

---

#### Hot Tear / Overheating / Greasy

**Likely Causes** (ranked):
1. Compound too soft for track temp/pace
2. Hot pressure too high (reduced contact patch / 'skate') OR too low (excess flex generating heat)
3. Suspension allowing excessive squat/spin (heat generation)
4. Track surface very abrasive

**Suggested Fixes**:
- Verify hot pressure immediately and correct to target window
- Move to harder/higher-temp compound range
- Add a touch of support (compression) if the bike is overloading the tyre
- Reduce unnecessary wheelspin (riding + electronics + setup)

---

#### Center Wear Fast

**Likely Causes** (ranked):
1. Hot pressure too high
2. Too much straight-line throttle load vs compound choice
3. Overheating due to ambient/track temp

**Suggested Fixes**:
- Reduce hot pressure toward window
- Choose compound that tolerates heat/drive load
- Check gearing/throttle application (avoid long spin-up on edge-to-center transition)

---

#### Edge Tearing

**Likely Causes** (ranked):
1. Pressure/compound mismatch at lean (not in operating window)
2. Too much rebound (tyre not recovering; 'packs down')
3. Too stiff compression on bumps/abrasive surface

**Suggested Fixes**:
- Correct hot pressure to target window
- Reduce rebound slightly (small steps)
- Soften compression slightly if surface is harsh/abrasive

## Brand Pressure Anchors (PSI)

### Dunlop

- Front 120/70: **34.5-36.5 psi** (target hot)
- Rear 180/190/200: **21.5-25.0 psi** (target hot)

**Wet Examples**:
- Front: **32.0-35.0 psi** (target hot)
- Rear: **30.0-33.0 psi** (target hot)
