## Quick "Always Do This First" Rules

1. ✅ **Hot pressure reading immediately after pit-in** (don't wait)
2. ✅ **Change pressure before suspension** for most wear problems
3. ✅ **If chasing tears for hours**: Probably wrong compound for surface temp + pace

---

## Fix Order Rule (General)

For most wear problems, follow this order:

1. **Confirm hot pressure immediately after pit-in**
2. **Move pressure toward the brand's target HOT/running window**
3. **Adjust warmers strategy (temp/time) for cold/hot surface**
4. **Re-evaluate compound choice for conditions + pace**
5. **Only then tune suspension in small steps**

## Wear Patterns

### 1. Cold Tear / Cold Tearing

**What It Looks Like**:
- Rough, torn "shredded" surface on the drive edge
- Often looks like the rubber is being ripped
- Deep tears into the carcass
- Fingernail-shaped tears
- Can peel back sizable chunks of rubber
- Pattern of uneven lines across a segment of the tyre
- **Key Test**: Can you get your thumbnail/fingernail under the tears? (Yes = cold tear)

#### Severity Levels

##### Mild Cold Tear (Early Stage)
**Visual Appearance**:
- Fine, shallow "fingernail" rips clustered in a band on the shoulder
- Surface looks roughened and torn but not deeply gouged
- Tears are short and tight (not long flaps)
- Damage mostly on one "drive band" rather than across whole edge

**Typical Conditions**:
- Cool track temp
- Tyre not quite in operating window
- Often shows up early in the day
- After slow/stop-start session

**Fix**: Small pressure adjustment, correct warmers strategy

---

##### Moderate Cold Tear
**Visual Appearance**:
- More pronounced tearing spread across wider shoulder area
- Edges of tears look sharper and deeper than mild
- Can visually see depth and directionality of the ripping
- Torn texture is more consistent across the band (not just a few spots)

**Typical Conditions**:
- Cold surface + pressure/compound mismatch for pace
- Tyre surface gets worked, carcass doesn't stabilise

**Fix**: Pressure correction to target window, consider compound change, warmers adjustment

---

##### Severe Cold Tear
**Visual Appearance**:
- Deep tearing you can often catch a fingernail under
- Larger "chunks" or longer flaps rather than small roughness
- Usually concentrated on drive edge (rear) but can be seen on front shoulder too
- Deep carcass-level ripping
- When torn texture becomes continuous along shoulder, trending toward severe
- If texture becomes chunky and deeply undercut, trending toward severe

**Typical Conditions**:
- Significant pressure/compound/conditions mismatch
- Often past "small tweaks" stage

**Fix**: Major pressure correction, compound change likely needed, warmers strategy review, may need different tyre for conditions

**Note**: Once severe, often past "small tweaks" and into "wrong tyre/conditions/pressure strategy"

**Common Causes** (ranked):
1. **Tyre over-inflated (pressure too high)** - Primary cause
   - Contact patch too small
   - Cannot generate widespread heat
   - Surface super-heats quickly while carcass stays cold
   - Surface polymers give way, surface ripped off
2. Tyre carcass not in temp window (cold track / short sessions / slow pace)
3. Compound too soft for conditions/pace
4. Suspension too stiff (esp. compression) reducing mechanical grip

**Note**: After session, check pressure once tyre has cooled completely. In most cases, pressure is too high.

**Fix Order**:
1. Confirm hot pressure immediately after pit-in, adjust toward brand's target hot window
2. Warmers: correct temp/time (don't cook on warmers then let it cool on track)
3. If still tearing: go more temperature-tolerant/harder compound for those conditions
4. Then suspension: soften compression slightly; reduce excessive "packing" (too much rebound)

**Note**: **Primary cause is over-inflation (pressure too high)**. The over-inflated tyre has too small a contact patch, cannot generate widespread heat, so the surface super-heats while the carcass stays below operating temperature, causing the surface to be ripped straight off. While cold tear can theoretically occur from pressure too low in some cases, the vast majority of cases are from pressure too high.

---

### 2. Hot Tear / Overheating Tear

**What It Looks Like**:
- Smeared, "melted then torn" texture
- Sometimes with a wavy look
- Fairly shallow tears (less deep than cold tear)
- More spread out
- Arc shape from centrifugal force (tears arc down toward center of tyre)
- Cannot get fingernail deep under them (unlike cold tear)
- Texture looks more melted/smeared than pulled, rather than "ripped off a cold carcass"
- **Key Test**: Can you get your fingernail under the tears? (No = hot tear, shallow)

**Primary Cause**: **Tyre under-inflated**
- Contact patch too large on ground
- Tyre overheats (whole tyre, not just surface)
- Surface gets hot and is melted off quickly
- Pitched away due to centrifugal force from spinning
- Rubber comes off with less effort (not ripped off cold carcass)
- Tears are shallower because whole tyre is overheating

#### Severity Levels

##### Mild-Moderate Hot Tear
**Visual Appearance**:
- Shallow, spread-out tearing (not deep fingernail rips)
- Tear marks arc down toward center of tyre (classic hot-tear cue)
- Texture looks more melted/smeared than pulled
- Surface damage obvious but not chunking
- Rough, smeared shoulder strip
- More texture than chunking; mainly surface deformation

**Severity Cues**:
- ✅ Shallow, spread-out tearing
- ✅ Arc shape toward center
- ✅ Melted/smeared texture
- ✅ Surface damage but not chunking
- ✅ Early/mid-stage

**Fix**: Pressure correction to target window, small adjustments

---

##### Moderate Hot Tear
**Visual Appearance**:
- Broad shoulder band of tearing with "pulled" texture
- Transition from smoother center to clearly distressed shoulder
- More aggressive than mild, but still mostly surface-level tearing
- Tears wider and more numerous, but not huge chunks missing

**Severity Cues**:
- ✅ Wider and more numerous tears
- ✅ Broad shoulder band
- ✅ Still mostly surface-level
- ✅ Not huge chunks missing

**Fix**: Pressure correction to target window, consider compound change, reduce wheelspin

---

##### Severe Hot Tear / Overheating Damage
**Visual Appearance**:
- Chunking / missing rubber and heavy tearing
- Surface looks overcooked, with torn pieces breaking away
- Heavy shredding
- This is the "you're past small tweaks" end of the spectrum

**Severity Cues**:
- ✅ Chunking / missing rubber
- ✅ Heavy tearing and shredding
- ✅ Overcooked appearance
- ✅ Torn pieces breaking away
- ✅ Past "small tweaks" stage

**Fix**: Major pressure correction, compound change, reduce wheelspin, suspension control, may need new tyre

**Note**: If it looks like this, you're usually into pressure window + compound + wheelspin/suspension control territory, not just "1 click" changes.

**Common Causes** (ranked):
1. Compound too soft for track temp/pace
2. Pressure out of window (too low = excess flex/heat, too high = reduced contact patch/slide/heat)
3. Excessive wheelspin
4. Suspension allowing excessive squat/spin (heat generation)
5. Track surface very abrasive

**Fix Order**:
1. Verify hot pressure immediately and correct to target window (small steps, ±0.5-1 psi)
2. Move to harder compound / higher-temp option
3. Reduce wheelspin (electronics/riding) and add a touch of support (rear compression/geometry) if it squats and spins

**Note**: Hot tear can occur from pressure too low (excess flex generates heat) OR too high (reduced contact patch causes sliding/heat). Key is "out of window."

---

### 3. Graining

**What It Looks Like**:
- Little rolled balls/pills of rubber
- Surface looks torn but "rolled", not melted
- Distinct from cold tear (rolled vs ripped)

**Common Causes**:
- Tyre sliding at low temp
- Surface not bonding (often cold track + aggressive inputs)

**Fix Order**:
1. Bring tyre into temp window (warmers/pace)
2. Correct hot pressure
3. Smoother load application
4. Consider compound change if it never stabilises

---

### 4. Blistering

**What It Looks Like**:
- Raised bubbles/blisters, sometimes a "boiled" look
- Can progress to tread lifting or local delamination (small areas that look like they've "puffed up" then torn)
- Distinct from hot tear (bubbles vs smeared)

**What's Actually Happening**:
- The tread layer overheats and volatile components/gases form under/within the rubber
- Creates bubbles and local separation
- Bond/adhesive failure between carcass and tread rubber after overheating

**Common Causes** (ranked):
1. **Compound too soft for track temp / ambient / pace** (classic)
2. **Sustained overheating events**: long fast sessions, big spin-up on exits, or repeated "too-hot" laps with no cool-down
3. Hot pressure too high can shrink contact patch and push tyre into worse heat state (not always root cause, but can be amplifier)

**Fix Order**:
1. **Change compound/spec**: Go harder or a construction intended for hotter conditions
2. **Verify hot pressures** (don't guess—measure immediately off-track). If consistently over target hot pressure, you're often running tyre too "tight" for the day
3. **Reduce prolonged spin** (electronics, throttle timing, gearing, rider)
4. **If you can't change tyre**: Shorten sessions / add a cool-down lap, and avoid "hero laps" on a tyre that's already cooking

---

### 5. Cupping / Scalloping

**What It Looks Like**:
- Alternating high/low "cups" around the tread
- Usually on front tyre

**Common Causes**:
- Imbalance/misalignment
- Worn suspension components
- Can be worsened by poor damping control

**Fix Order**:
1. **Wheel balance/alignment + mechanical inspection first** (mechanical issue)
2. Then damping tuning (often rebound control)

**Note**: This is primarily a mechanical issue, not a pressure/compound issue.

---

### 6. Feathering / Sawtooth Edges

**What It Looks Like**:
- **Run your hand across the tread**:
  - One direction feels smooth
  - The other feels sharp/stepped ("heel-toe" / sawtooth)
- More obvious on treaded fronts (supersport/trackday tyres)
- Less visible on true slicks because there are no tread blocks to "step"
- Often on front tyre

**Common Causes**:
- Braking + turn-in load repeatedly deforming tread blocks
- Damping balance issues can make it worse
- A common "tell": raised edge patterns can correlate with rebound being too fast/too slow (not perfect, but a real starting point)

**Fix Order**:
1. **Pressure check first** (wrong pressure can make everything else look guilty)
2. **Small damping change, not a big swing**:
   - If tyre looks like it's being "scrubbed"/stepped badly on entry, try small rebound adjustment (1-2 clicks) and re-check wear after session
3. **Confirm geometry isn't extreme** (too much weight transfer / wrong ride height can drive front into ugly wear during braking)

**Reality Check**: There isn't one universally accepted "if you see X, rebound is Y" rule. Treat it like a diagnostic hint, not gospel.

---

### 7. Chunking / Tearing Chunks Out

**What It Looks Like**:
- Pieces missing (sharp-edged voids), not just "tears" or surface smear
- Usually shows as localized missing rubber, sometimes after an overheating event
- Sharp-edged damage
- Common on abrasive tracks

**What's Actually Happening**:
- Bond/adhesive failure between carcass and tread rubber after overheating
- Large pieces can detach
- Cycle World describes chunking as bond/adhesive failure after overheating

**Common Causes** (ranked):
1. **Too much heat + abrasion**: Abrasive surface + soft compound + long drive/spin = rubber and bonding get punished
2. Under-temp sliding can also rip rubber (but that starts to look like cold tear/graining rather than "true chunking")

**Fix Order**:
1. **Correct compound for the surface/temp** (go harder or different construction)
2. **Get hot pressure in range** (under-inflation can overheat and promote destructive wear patterns)
3. **Reduce spin / wheelie/TC cycling** (smooth drive off the corner)
4. **If it looks like tyre is being "hammered"**: Soften harsh compression slightly (front or rear depending on where damage is) and re-check

---

### 8. Pickup / Marbling

**What It Looks Like**:
- Blobs/streaks of rubber stuck to the tyre
- Rubber pickup from track

**Common Causes**:
- Riding off-line through marbles
- Too-cool tyre on slow laps

**Fix Order**:
1. Clean tyre
2. Avoid marbles
3. Keep heat in the tyre (pace/warmers)

**Note**: Simple fix - clean and avoid marbles.

---

### 9. Flat-Spotting / Squared-Off

**What It Looks Like**:
- Flattened center band
- Accelerated wear in the middle
- Rear tyre typically

**Common Causes**:
- Lots of straight-line time
- High hot pressure
- High power/traction control intervention

**Fix Order**:
1. Ensure hot pressure isn't high
2. Choose compound that tolerates heat/drive load
3. Review gearing/ride style

---

### 10. Rain Tyre Overheating on Drying Line

**What It Looks Like**:
- **Smeared, glossy rubber** rather than clean tearing
- Surface can look **melted or "polished"**, sometimes with light tearing layered on top
- **Overheated and greasy appearance** (not sharply ripped like cold/hot tear on slicks)
- Damage often appears **very quickly** (sometimes in 1-2 laps) once riders commit to dry line
- **Asymmetric wear**, concentrated where tyre runs on dry line
- **Key Visual Cue**: Unlike cold or hot tear on slicks, rain tyres on drying line often look overheated and greasy, not sharply ripped

**Symptoms**:
- Grip drops off suddenly - riders report tyre feeling fine one lap, vague or sliding the next
- Tyre feels greasy on drying line
- Damage appears quickly (1-2 laps)

**Common Causes**:
- Rain tyres can overheat fast when the track dries
- Rain tyres rely heavily on water cooling - once cooling disappears, tyre overheats
- Warmers strategy matters (if used, keep temps low)
- Riding on dry line when track is drying

**Fix Order**:
1. **Switch tyre when practical** - If clear drying line forming, rain tyre is on borrowed time
2. **Reduce time on dry line** - Deliberately touch damp patches where safe to cool the tyre
3. **Pressure discipline** - Stay aligned with wet guidance pressures, do NOT chase grip by dropping pressure once overheating starts
4. **Manage pace** - Back the bike down slightly if switching tyres is not immediately possible
5. **Warmers strategy** - If warmers used on rains, keep temps low (typically ~30-50°C depending on brand) and duration short

**Important Coaching Note**:
> "If a rain tyre starts to feel greasy on a drying line, the tyre is already overheating. You're not fixing it — you're deciding how quickly you destroy it."

**Critical Understanding**:
- Rain tyres rely heavily on water cooling
- Once that cooling disappears, **no suspension adjustment will save the tyre**
- Chasing clicks here usually masks the real issue and destroys the tyre faster
- This is a **tyre choice issue**, not a suspension issue

---

### 11. Suspension-Related Wear

**What It Looks Like**:
- Unusual wear or tearing
- Non-uniform tear width (changes as you follow it around)
- Tear not continuous (affected area, then clean, then damage, then clean again)
- Raised edges on tread (leading edge = rebound too slow, back edge = rebound too fast)

**Common Causes**:
- Suspension settings asking tyre to act as part of suspension
- Incorrect spring rate (too hard or too soft)
- Rebound out of adjustment
- Compression out of adjustment
- Combination of rebound and compression issues

**Diagnostic Questions**:
1. Do you have the correct spring? (too hard/soft puts strain on tyre)
2. Is the affected area uniform in width? (non-uniform = suspension issue)
3. Does the tear go all the way around? (if not continuous = suspension issue)
4. Are the edges of the tread raised? (leading edge = rebound too slow, back edge = too fast)

**Fix Order**:
1. Verify correct spring rate for weight
2. Check rebound settings (leading edge raised = too slow, back edge = too fast)
3. Check compression settings
4. Adjust in small steps

**Note**: Suspension-related wear can look like pressure problems. Check suspension if pressure adjustments don't help.

### 12. Geometry-Related Wear

#### Not Enough Weight on Front

**What It Looks Like**:
- Much smaller band of tearing (5-10mm thick)
- Usually about halfway between center and edge
- Uniform all the way around
- Looks similar to hot tear on rear

**Common Causes**:
- Not enough weight on front tyre
- Tyre cannot get to operating temperature
- Front tyre pushes and drags across ground (not rolling)

**Fix**: Adjust geometry to put more weight on front

---

#### Too Much Weight on Front

**What It Looks Like**:
- Edge third of tyre showing wear
- Large affected area
- Uniform around circumference

**Common Causes**:
- Too much weight on front
- Front end too soft in conjunction with too much weight
- Front plows across ground rather than rolling

**Fix**: Adjust geometry to reduce front weight, or stiffen front end

---

### 13. Center Wear Fast

**What It Looks Like**:
- Accelerated wear in center of tyre
- Flattened center band

**Common Causes** (ranked):
1. Hot pressure too high
2. Too much straight-line throttle load vs compound choice
3. Overheating due to ambient/track temp

**Fix Order**:
1. Reduce hot pressure toward window
2. Choose compound that tolerates heat/drive load
3. Check gearing/throttle application (avoid long spin-up on edge-to-center transition)

---

### 14. Edge Tearing

**What It Looks Like**:
- Tearing on edges of tyre
- At lean angles

**Common Causes** (ranked):
1. Pressure/compound mismatch at lean (not in operating window)
2. Too much rebound (tyre not recovering; "packs down")
3. Too stiff compression on bumps/abrasive surface

**Fix Order**:
1. Correct hot pressure to target window
2. Reduce rebound slightly (small steps)
3. Soften compression slightly if surface is harsh/abrasive

---

### 15. Tire Discoloration (Blue Tires)

**What It Looks Like**:
- Blue/green tint on tyre surface
- After tyres have been used and cooled

**What It Means**:
- Oils in tyre coming to surface after heat cycles
- NOT necessarily finished tyres
- Oils are scrubbed off when riding again
- Each heat cycle loses oils (tyre becomes less effective over time)

**Fix**: None needed - this is normal. Tyre effectiveness decreases with heat cycles.

---

### 16. Good Wear Pattern

**What It Looks Like**:
- Pattern like "beach where the tide has gone out"
- Smooth, even wear
- Good longevity

**What It Means**:
- Tyre is wearing correctly
- May not be absolute optimum performance (racers often sacrifice life for performance)
- Good longevity expected

## Cold Tear vs Hot Tear - Quick Comparison

| Characteristic | Cold Tear | Hot Tear |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| **Cause** | Over-inflation (too high) | Under-inflation (too low) |
| **Heat** | Limited, uneven | Even but excessive |
| **Depth** | Deep, fingernail-shaped | Shallow, spaced out |
| **Test** | Can get fingernail under | Cannot get fingernail under |
| **Texture** | Rough, torn, "ripped" | Melted, smeared, "overcooked" |
| **Pattern** | Straight/parallel lines | Arc toward center |
| **Rubber** | Easily peeled | Little ability to lift |

**Key Tests**:
1. "Can you get fingernail under?" (Yes = cold, No = hot)
2. "Do tears arc toward center?" (Yes = hot, classic cue)
3. "Melted or ripped?" (Melted = hot, Ripped = cold)

---

## Prevention Strategies

### Regular Tire Pressure Checks
- Check before hitting the track
- Ensure meets manufacturer recommendations
- Use quality digital tire pressure gauge
- Check hot pressure immediately after pit-in
- Regular monitoring reduces risk significantly

### Adjust for Track Conditions
- **Wet**: Lower pressure slightly (enhances grip)
- **Cold**: Stay in target window (don't drop to chase grip)
- **Hot**: Small adjustments only (±0.5 psi)
- **Track-specific**: Adjust for surface, temperature, characteristics

### Tire Temperature Monitoring
- Use tire temperature sensors for real-time data
- Monitor temperature changes during session
- Enables quick pressure adjustments
- Prevents both cold and hot tear

### Effective Pressure Management
- Always measure hot pressure immediately after pit-in
- Adjust toward brand's target hot/running window
- Small steps: ±0.5-1.0 psi
- Don't chase grip by dropping pressure
- Use correct warmers strategy

### Driving Style Awareness
- Match pace to conditions
- Smooth inputs reduce wear
- Aggressive driving + under-inflation = hot tear risk
- Don't push too hard in cold conditions (cold tear risk)

---

## Quick Reference by Symptom

### Rough/Torn Surface
- **Cold tear**: Deep, fingernail-shaped, can peel back chunks
- **Hot tear**: Shallow, smeared, wavy, arc shape
- **Graining**: Rolled balls/pills (not melted)
- **Chunking**: Pieces missing, sharp edges

### Bubbles/Blistered
- **Blistering**: Bubbles/blisters, "boiled" patches

### Cups/Scallops
- **Cupping**: Alternating high/low cups (mechanical issue first)

### Edges
- **Feathering**: One direction smooth, other sharp/stepped
- **Edge tearing**: Tearing at lean angles

### Center
- **Flat-spotting**: Flattened center, accelerated center wear

### Other
- **Pickup/Marbling**: Rubber stuck to tyre (clean and avoid)
- **Rain tyre overheating**: Rain tyre smears on drying line
- **Suspension-related**: Non-uniform, not continuous, raised edges
- **Geometry-related**: Weight distribution issues

---

## Weather Considerations

### Cold Conditions
- **Risk**: Cold tear, graining
- **Pressure**: Stay in target hot window (don't drop to chase grip)
- **Compound**: Consider harder/more temperature-tolerant
- **Warmers**: Correct temp/time (don't overheat on warmers)

### Hot Conditions
- **Risk**: Hot tear, blistering, overheating
- **Pressure**: Small steps ±0.5-1 psi, avoid exceeding top of window
- **Compound**: Harder/higher-temp option
- **Warmers**: Adjust for hot surface

### Wet/Drying
- **Risk**: Rain tyre overheating on drying line
- **Pressure**: Use Bridgestone deltas (standing water +1.5 psi, drying -1.5 psi)
- **Tyre**: Switch when practical, manage pace
