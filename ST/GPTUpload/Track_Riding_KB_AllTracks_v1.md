## MALLALA_S00 — Overview & key themes
**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** Mallala Motorsport Park (SA) Mallala is a 2.6 km, 9-10 turn circuit in South Australia known for its flat layout and heavy braking zones . The track surface is generally bumpy in places, notably a bump at the apex of Turn 1 and a compression dip exiting the final corner.
**Stable reference points:** Big bikes approach at high speed (~200+ km/h) and must brake hard (around the 200m marker for a 1000cc) to about 3rd gear for this medium-speed right.; Braking markers: there are boards (150m/100m) – a 600cc might brake around the 100m, a 1000cc around 120m mark to be safe.; Braking: markers at 100m/50m – a 600cc can go to ~75m, a literbike should brake by 100m because the approach is still quite fast.
**Hazards / surface:** The track surface is generally bumpy in places, notably a bump at the apex of Turn 1 and a compression dip exiting the final corner.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Good brake cooling and pad life are essential on superbikes here. Big bikes approach at high speed (~200+ km/h) and must brake hard (around the 200m marker for a 1000cc) to about 3rd gear for this medium-speed right.
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size 600cc bikes should do most braking upright then ease off as you tip in, aiming to carry momentum. Braking markers: there are boards (150m/100m) – a 600cc might brake around the 100m, a 1000cc around 120m mark to be safe.
- **300/small:** Small bikes (300cc) can often take Turn 1 with just a slight roll-off, maintaining high corner speed. Small bikes can often take this flat-out, maximizing drive onto the straight.
**Overtake / passing:** The track is also relatively narrow (about 8-10 m wide) which demands precise lines and can make passing challenging. After a long fast run, this is a prime overtaking spot requiring hard braking from top speed.
**Confidence:** Medium (overview from uploaded guide; corner sequence corrected based on rider note).
**Source notes:** Source: Motorcycle Track Guides_ Mallala, Mac Park, One (Wakefield), Morgan Park, Wanneroo (1).pdf. Note: rider correction—Mallala T1 described as right kink with dip → double-apex left; no 2–3 esses.

## MALLALA_S01 — Start/Finish → Turn 1 kink → setup into Turn 2
**Shape:** Kink / lead-in complex
**Priority / what matters:** Get the bike settled early; prioritize the line that gives you a clean, calm entry to the next left complex.
**Stable reference points:** Start/finish line; pit wall end; marshal post (add exact ID); edge of kerb start/end (add).
**Hazards / surface:** Draft mentions an apex bump at 'Turn 1' and that bumpy areas exist (validate on-bike).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Treat as stability-first. Brake/settle early if needed; avoid loading the front over bumps while turning.
- **600/midsize:** Most braking upright; keep a little momentum to avoid dead-throttle; focus on line to next left.
- **300/small:** Momentum-first: minimize roll-off; prioritize a smooth arc that preserves speed.
**Common mistakes:** Over-commit to the kink and end up out of position for the next left; late/abrupt input over bumps.
**Overtake / passing:** Generally not a safe dive area unless fully alongside early; better to focus on exit to set up the next braking zone.
**Confidence:** Medium (shape from Champions map; some hazards from draft need validation).
**Source notes:** Champions Ride Days map for numbering; draft PDF text contains inconsistent numbering and an 'esses 2–3' description.

## MALLALA_S02 — Turn 2 (tight left on inner loop)
**Shape:** Tight left / hairpin-ish
**Priority / what matters:** Exit matters more than entry: aim for a late-ish apex that opens your drive toward the next section.
**Stable reference points:** Inside kerb beginning; outside exit kerb end; marshal post (add).
**Hazards / surface:** Potential bump/transition on entry/inside (validate).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Square it off if needed for a stable drive. Be deliberate with pickup/drive to avoid spin.
- **600/midsize:** Blend corner speed + exit: carry speed in, but don't pinch the exit.
- **300/small:** Keep it rolling; avoid over-slowing—tiny mistakes here echo down the next run.
**Common mistakes:** Turning in early and pinching the exit; rushing throttle before the bike is pointed.
**Overtake / passing:** Viable if there's a clear braking zone and the inside stays predictable; otherwise set up a cutback.
**Confidence:** Medium
**Source notes:** Champions map geometry; class guidance is principle-based.

## MALLALA_S03 — Turn 3 (far-left end of top loop)
**Shape:** Hairpin / 180-ish (map suggests tight end)
**Priority / what matters:** Get the bike turned efficiently and prioritize a strong, straight drive onto the long top section.
**Stable reference points:** End of kerb/paint; outside barrier alignment (add); marshal post (add).
**Hazards / surface:** If surface is narrow/bumpy, keep inputs smooth (validate).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Point-and-shoot. Control wheelspin on exit; pick up early.
- **600/midsize:** Late apex helps exit; keep engine in meat of torque band.
- **300/small:** Maximize corner speed and exit—this feeds a long run where bigger bikes stretch legs.
**Common mistakes:** Over-slowing (300s); over-squaring and losing flow (600s); spinning/standing up too early (SBK).
**Overtake / passing:** Classic brake-and-turn passing zone if run-off and sightlines are good.
**Confidence:** Low–Medium (needs rider validation of corner severity).
**Source notes:** Champions map indicates a tight end-of-loop corner.

## MALLALA_S04 — Turn 4 (long top section / sweeper)
**Shape:** Fast sweeper / long radius
**Priority / what matters:** Carry speed while keeping a line that preserves track width for the next right-side complex.
**Stable reference points:** Entry kerb start; mid-corner seam/patch (add); exit kerb start (add).
**Hazards / surface:** Crosswind/bumps can make it feel vague—stay loose and prioritize repeatability.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Throttle discipline: enough to keep settled; don't force the front on entry.
- **600/midsize:** Use a late apex if it opens the next section; keep momentum.
- **300/small:** Often near-pinned if the line is clean—focus on smoothness and minimizing lean-angle corrections.
**Common mistakes:** Running wide and compromising next corner; abrupt throttle changes mid-lean.
**Overtake / passing:** Usually not ideal unless there’s a big speed delta; safer to set up the next braking zone.
**Confidence:** Medium (aligns with draft concept of a long sweeper).
**Source notes:** Draft PDF describes a long left sweeper; Champions map shows a long top segment.

## MALLALA_S05 — Turn 5 (top-right bend)
**Shape:** Medium-speed bend / direction change
**Priority / what matters:** Prioritize exit line that gets you straight and stable onto the right-side run.
**Stable reference points:** Outside edge/paint; inside kerb (add).
**Hazards / surface:** May be dusty/off-line (common at sandy venues—validate at Mallala).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Stay composed; avoid aggressive turn-in that forces TC cuts on exit.
- **600/midsize:** Smooth roll-on; keep the bike pointed early to gain speed on the run.
- **300/small:** Momentum; minimize lean-to-lean transitions.
**Common mistakes:** Turning too early and running out of exit; trying to pass mid-corner.
**Overtake / passing:** Better on exit with drive rather than on entry.
**Confidence:** Low–Medium
**Source notes:** Geometry inferred from Champions map; needs local rider notes.

## MALLALA_S06 — Turn 6 (right-side run / slight bend)
**Shape:** Fast kink / setup
**Priority / what matters:** Be in the correct place early for the big braking zone into the bottom hairpin.
**Stable reference points:** Track edge line; braking board (if present); marshal post (add).
**Hazards / surface:** If camber changes or bumps exist, keep the bike neutral and avoid sudden inputs.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Short-shift if wheelspin; keep it stable for braking.
- **600/midsize:** Use it to set the braking line; don't drift out unnecessarily.
- **300/small:** Mostly line/positioning; stay smooth to preserve speed.
**Common mistakes:** Late movement across track before the braking zone; adding unnecessary lean.
**Overtake / passing:** No—focus on setup for next corner.
**Confidence:** Low–Medium
**Source notes:** Segment scaffolding only; fill with rider reference points.

## MALLALA_S07 — Turn 7 (bottom-right hairpin)
**Shape:** Tight hairpin / major braking
**Priority / what matters:** Consistency + exit. Get braking done earlier than you want, then turn once and drive out cleanly.
**Stable reference points:** Braking boards (if present); end of right-side wall/line; inside kerb start (add).
**Hazards / surface:** Downhill/weight transfer risk if approach falls away; risk of rear lightness (validate).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Brake stability is key; sacrifice entry speed to protect exit traction.
- **600/midsize:** Controlled trail-brake if surface allows; aim late apex to open drive.
- **300/small:** Carry as much corner speed as you can without running wide; keep it flowing.
**Common mistakes:** Over-braking late; turning while still too loaded; missing the late apex and killing drive.
**Overtake / passing:** Prime passing zone (classic hairpin) if the braking zone is predictable.
**Confidence:** Medium (hairpin + draft alignment).
**Source notes:** Draft explicitly calls this Southern Hairpin; Champions map shows a major bottom hairpin.

## MALLALA_S08 — Turn 8 (bottom-mid kink / connector)
**Shape:** Kink / transition
**Priority / what matters:** Use it to position the bike for the last corner and maximize your drive onto the main straight.
**Stable reference points:** Kink apex kerb; seam/patch (add).
**Hazards / surface:** Undulation/compression mentioned in draft for final section (validate).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Keep body light; avoid harsh bar inputs if the bike moves around.
- **600/midsize:** Smooth, quick transition; avoid extra steering corrections.
- **300/small:** Treat as momentum link—stay on a steady throttle where possible.
**Common mistakes:** Over-slowing and turning it into a 'corner' rather than a setup link.
**Overtake / passing:** Not ideal; usually single line.
**Confidence:** Low–Medium
**Source notes:** Draft describes a fast section into the straight; Champions map shows a wiggle before T9.

## MALLALA_S09 — Turn 9 (final corner onto main straight)
**Shape:** Final turn / drive corner
**Priority / what matters:** Exit is everything: line it up so you can pick the bike up early and drive without drama.
**Stable reference points:** Inside kerb; track-out kerb start; pit entry/exit line (if present).
**Hazards / surface:** Draft mentions a compression/dip on exit of final corner (validate).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Be patient until you can pick it up; manage wheelspin/wheelie; use full exit.
- **600/midsize:** Balance: carry speed but still prioritize drive; smooth roll-on.
- **300/small:** High corner speed + early throttle; avoid running wide because you can’t ‘power out’ to fix it.
**Common mistakes:** Early apex and running out of road; rushing throttle while still leaned on a bumpy exit.
**Overtake / passing:** Usually ‘no’—too risky to pass on the outside on exit. Better to set up a draft on the straight.
**Confidence:** Medium
**Source notes:** Draft describes a critical final turn; Champions map indicates last corner before main straight.

# McNamara Park Raceway (Mac Park)
- Layout: Main circuit
- Direction: Not specified (see track map/guide)
## MACPARK_S00 — Overview & key themes
**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** MacNamara Park “Mac Park” (SA) McNamara Park (“Mac Park”) is a 2.4 km motorcycle-only circuit near Mount Gambier , SA, featuring 12 corners and notable elevation changes. It’s a dedicated bike track with a recently fully resurfaced 10m-wide tarmac, so grip is generally very good. Riders will encounter blind rises, off-camber turns, and frequent...
**Stable reference points:** Pick a reference, like a tree or flagpole beyond the crest, to aim your turn-in.; The good news: Turn 8 has good banking (the track designers knew bikes would be flying here).; Reference: there’s a braking marker near a marshal hut – on a 600cc start braking at that marker; on a superbike, brake a bit earlier until you gauge it.
**Hazards / surface:** The layout is undulating and technical, mixing slow hairpins with fast sweepers over crests. Riders will encounter blind rises, off-camber turns, and frequent direction changes, so a nimble setup and good suspension compliance are key here.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes must square off this hairpin: get the bike stopped, quick steering input to snap it around, and then drive out. Superbikes should be cautious of wheelspin on landing from T2’s crest – feed in throttle once the suspension settles, then flick right.
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size 600s should brake hard and deep (watch for slightly uneven pavement transitions at the turn-in – the new surface is smooth but there’s often dust off-line from the nearby camping area). 600s: be mindful that the exit drops downhill, so any mid- corner speed too high will push you wide when the camber disappears.
- **300/small:** Small bikes can be very aggressive here – you might not even need first gear as their corner speed is higher; focus on a late apex to carry speed out. Lightweight bikes can take T2 nearly full throttle, as their lower power won’t launch them over the crest too violently.
**Confidence:** Medium (overview extracted from uploaded guide; validate on-track markers).

## MACPARK_S01 — Turn 1 (Hairpin aka “The Hairpin”)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** hand hairpin (nearly 180°). It’s very slow – likely 2nd gear on most bikes, maybe 1st on a big bike. Small bikes can be very aggressive here – you might not even need first gear as their corner speed is higher; focus on a late apex to carry speed out.
**Hazards / surface:** Heavy braking is needed but the braking zone is slightly uphill, which helps slow the bike (use the incline to your advantage). Mid-size 600s should brake hard and deep (watch for slightly uneven pavement transitions at the turn-in – the new surface is smooth but there’s often dust off-line from the nearby camping area).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes must square off this hairpin: get the bike stopped, quick steering input to snap it around, and then drive out.
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size 600s should brake hard and deep (watch for slightly uneven pavement transitions at the turn-in – the new surface is smooth but there’s often dust off-line from the nearby camping area).

## MACPARK_S02 — Turns 2–3
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** hairpin, accelerate and spot the crest ahead – T2 goes over a blind rise. All bikes should keep a tight line through T2 (hug the inside left) because as you crest, the bike may unload. There’s not much braking here, it’s more about line: exit T3 on the left side of the track, which positions you for Turn 4.
**Hazards / surface:** hairpin, accelerate and spot the crest ahead – T2 goes over a blind rise. All bikes should keep a tight line through T2 (hug the inside left) because as you crest, the bike may unload.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes should be cautious of wheelspin on landing from T2’s crest – feed in throttle once the suspension settles, then flick right.
- **300/small:** Lightweight bikes can take T2 nearly full throttle, as their lower power won’t launch them over the crest too violently. Mid and small bikes can usually flick into T3 with maybe a small throttle blip – maintain momentum.
**Confidence:** Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).

## MACPARK_S03 — Turn 4 (Left-hander)
**Shape:** Corner / complex
**Priority / what matters:** falls away at exit. It’s a classic “tip in and tighten” corner . 600s: be mindful that the exit drops downhill, so any mid- corner speed too high will push you wide when the camber disappears.
**Hazards / surface:** Small bikes: trail brake slightly and cut a smooth arc – you have the advantage of less weight, so carry speed. 600s: be mindful that the exit drops downhill, so any mid- corner speed too high will push you wide when the camber disappears.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** 1000s: Approach in maybe 3rd gear , drop to 2nd, and don’t be greedy with speed.
- **600/midsize:** 600s: be mindful that the exit drops downhill, so any mid- corner speed too high will push you wide when the camber disappears.
- **300/small:** Small bikes: trail brake slightly and cut a smooth arc – you have the advantage of less weight, so carry speed.

## MACPARK_S04 — Turn 5 (Right-hand sweeper)
**Shape:** Esses / S
**Priority / what matters:** faster and has positive camber, allowing higher entry speed. Many riders consider Turn 5 part of a “esses” with Turn 4 – effectively a direction change to the right. On a small bike, this is likely full throttle or a slight lift – take it as a big sweeper , using all the track on exit.
**Hazards / surface:** On a small bike, this is likely full throttle or a slight lift – take it as a big sweeper , using all the track on exit. Any wheelies from the crest should be managed by short-shifting if needed.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: This is a spot where your power can really shine – get the bike turned and upright as soon as possible in the exit and hammer the throttle.
- **600/midsize:** On a 600, roll on strong from mid-corner – 16 17 18 18 3 the camber will support you, but be ready to pick the bike up as the camber flattens at exit.
- **300/small:** On a small bike, this is likely full throttle or a slight lift – take it as a big sweeper , using all the track on exit.

## MACPARK_S05 — Turns 6–7 (Chicane and Sweeper)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** 7. Turn 7 is one of the fast sweeping turns on the track – a long, high-speed left that crests a hill. This turn is blind – you don’t see the exit until you’re at the apex on the crest.
**Stable reference points:** Pick a reference, like a tree or flagpole beyond the crest, to aim your turn-in.
**Hazards / surface:** Turn 7 is one of the fast sweeping turns on the track – a long, high-speed left that crests a hill. This turn is blind – you don’t see the exit until you’re at the apex on the crest.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Mid-size and superbike riders need real commitment here. 1000cc bikes: likely 4th or even 5th gear pinned, then a brief roll-off or slight tap of rear brake at the apex of 7 if the bike feels light.
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size and superbike riders need real commitment here. 600cc bikes can often take this in 4th gear , feathering only slightly at the apex if needed.
- **300/small:** Small bikes can usually stay fully pinned through 6 and into 7.
**Confidence:** Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).

## MACPARK_S06 — Turn 8 (Fast Right)
**Shape:** Sweeper
**Priority / what matters:** form an S-shaped sequence at high speed. As you come off the left sweeper , the track immediately transitions right.
**Stable reference points:** The good news: Turn 8 has good banking (the track designers knew bikes would be flying here).
**Hazards / surface:** There’s a slight downhill here and Turn 8 is fast – likely one gear lower than 7. Superbikes should apex Turn 8 a bit late – there’s a slight dip at the inside that can unsettle if you hit it too early.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes should apex Turn 8 a bit late – there’s a slight dip at the inside that can unsettle if you hit it too early.
- **300/small:** Small bikes: flick right and stay on throttle – your bike will handle it, just shift weight quickly and use a late apex.
**Confidence:** Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).
**Source notes:** Source: Motorcycle Track Guides_ Mallala, Mac Park, One (Wakefield), Morgan Park, Wanneroo (1).pdf. Extracted from guide text for: Turn 8 (Fast Right).

## MACPARK_S07 — Turn 9 (Hairpin
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** some spectator areas (hence often called Clubhouse). You approach T9 after a short straight from T8, carrying a lot of speed, so this is a serious braking zone. The corner itself is a bit off-camber , especially on exit, so expect the bike to want to drift out.
**Stable reference points:** Reference: there’s a braking marker near a marshal hut – on a 600cc start braking at that marker; on a superbike, brake a bit earlier until you gauge it.; Superbikes should prioritize a smooth drive out, as any wheelspin will be punished on the short chute to Turn 10.
**Hazards / surface:** The track goes slightly uphill into T9, which helps braking stability. The corner itself is a bit off-camber , especially on exit, so expect the bike to want to drift out.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Reference: there’s a braking marker near a marshal hut – on a 600cc start braking at that marker; on a superbike, brake a bit earlier until you gauge it. 600s and 1000s: get down to 2nd gear , maybe 1st for a very tight line.
- **600/midsize:** Reference: there’s a braking marker near a marshal hut – on a 600cc start braking at that marker; on a superbike, brake a bit earlier until you gauge it. 600s and 1000s: get down to 2nd gear , maybe 1st for a very tight line.
- **300/small:** Small bikes can cheat a bit and trail brake late, as their corner entry speed is less.
**Confidence:** Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).

## MACPARK_S08 — Turns 10–11 (Esses)
**Shape:** Chicane
**Priority / what matters:** chute out of T9 – not much time to breathe. Turn 10 is blind entry (it goes over a small crest). Aim for a late turn-in once you crest; that sets you up for immediate Turn 11 right.
**Stable reference points:** chute out of T9 – not much time to breathe.; The surface here is smooth, and the curbs are low if you need to use them.; Most riders will clip a bit of inside curb on both 10 and 11.
**Hazards / surface:** Turn 10 is blind entry (it goes over a small crest). Aim for a late turn-in once you crest; that sets you up for immediate Turn 11 right.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes should be careful not to punch the throttle too early out of 11, as the bike will still be leaned and can spin up.
- **300/small:** Small bikes can often flick left-right with no braking, just a throttle maintenance.
**Confidence:** Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).

## MACPARK_S09 — Turn 12 (Final corner)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** the main straight. Turn 12 is critical for lap time. Line: Try to late-apex Turn 12 so that you can stand the bike up on the exit.
**Stable reference points:** 600s: roll in with medium throttle, find the apex (there’s usually a cone or tire mark as a reference), then once you see the straight, pour on the gas.; Use all the exit width – there’s extra pavement on the exit curb, which is forgiving.; Liter bikes could consider standard gearing; they have plenty of power for the short chutes, and too short gearing will just cause wheelies.
**Hazards / surface:** It’s a long constant-radius left with some slight positive camber. Entry is slightly downhill, then it levels out through the turn.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: you must be patient initially.
- **600/midsize:** 600s: roll in with medium throttle, find the apex (there’s usually a cone or tire mark as a reference), then once you see the straight, pour on the gas. A 600cc might gear one tooth shorter on the rear sprocket than at a fast track, to punch out of the hairpins.
- **300/small:** Short gearing can help a 300cc get drive up the hills.
**Confidence:** Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).

# One Raceway (Wakefield Park)
- Layout: Main circuit
- Direction: Not specified (see track map/guide)
## ONERACE_S00 — Overview & key themes
**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** One Raceway – Wakefield Park (NSW) (Formerly Wakefield Park Raceway) in NSW, this 2.2 km track (recently rebranded “One Raceway”) is a tight, technical circuit renowned for being a club-level rider training ground. With 10 turns packed into its length, Wakefield (One) Park emphasizes cornering skill over outright speed. Key features include the...
**Stable reference points:** The track has no significant elevation except a small rise and dip at the “Fish Hook” section, but its layout punishes poor lines because most corners lead directly into the next.; Use the curb on the inside lightly if needed.; For bikes: pick your brake marker (there’s typically a 100m board; a superbike might brake ~110m, a lightweight at 70m).
**Hazards / surface:** The track has no significant elevation except a small rise and dip at the “Fish Hook” section, but its layout punishes poor lines because most corners lead directly into the next.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** For bikes: pick your brake marker (there’s typically a 100m board; a superbike might brake ~110m, a lightweight at 70m). 600s and 1000s: get the bike slowed and square up the exit.
- **600/midsize:** 600s and 1000s: get the bike slowed and square up the exit. The approach: you are accelerating uphill, likely in 3rd or 4th gear on a 600cc by the time you crest.
- **300/small:** Smaller bikes (sub-400cc) can often go through T1 flat out, as their top speed isn’t as high – they should take advantage of that and carry max speed. For bikes: pick your brake marker (there’s typically a 100m board; a superbike might brake ~110m, a lightweight at 70m).
**Common mistakes:** A common saying is “keep it high (left) exiting 4 to get a good line into 5” – meaning keep your trajectory towards the left side. This means it’s easy to overshoot the apex or run wide if you haven’t shed enough speed early.
**Overtake / passing:** This is a prime overtaking spot (outbraking someone into T2 or cutting back underneath at exit), so be prepared for different lines in traffic. T4 itself isn’t a passing zone usually; it’s all about the setup.
**Confidence:** Medium (overview extracted from uploaded guide; validate on-track markers).

## ONERACE_S01 — Turn 1 (Left Kink)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** corner , more of a bend, but it sets up for Turn 2. The crucial fact here: you can usually take Turn 1 faster than you think, but it will limit your Turn 2 if overdone. The track edge on exit of T1 comes quickly; aim to be about mid-track or just left of center after the kink to line up for braking into Turn 2.
**Stable reference points:** Use the curb on the inside lightly if needed.
**Hazards / surface:** Big bikes will approach ~200 km/ h and may need a slight lift or brush of brake just to get weight forward, then turn in left and hug the inside. Use the curb on the inside lightly if needed.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **300/small:** Smaller bikes (sub-400cc) can often go through T1 flat out, as their top speed isn’t as high – they should take advantage of that and carry max speed.

## ONERACE_S02 — Turn 2 (Right Hairpin)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** Wakefield – it leads onto an uphill straight and any time lost here hurts all the way up the hill. Heavy braking is done in a straight line – the track has good runoff here, but you want to get braking done early and straight to avoid unsettling the car/bike (this advice was for cars but applies to bikes too)....
**Stable reference points:** For bikes: pick your brake marker (there’s typically a 100m board; a superbike might brake ~110m, a lightweight at 70m).
**Hazards / surface:** For bikes: pick your brake marker (there’s typically a 100m board; a superbike might brake ~110m, a lightweight at 70m).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** For bikes: pick your brake marker (there’s typically a 100m board; a superbike might brake ~110m, a lightweight at 70m). 600s and 1000s: get the bike slowed and square up the exit.
- **600/midsize:** 600s and 1000s: get the bike slowed and square up the exit.
- **300/small:** For bikes: pick your brake marker (there’s typically a 100m board; a superbike might brake ~110m, a lightweight at 70m).
**Overtake / passing:** This is a prime overtaking spot (outbraking someone into T2 or cutting back underneath at exit), so be prepared for different lines in traffic.

## ONERACE_S03 — Turn 3 (Left Bend over Crest)
**Shape:** Corner / complex
**Priority / what matters:** over the crest of the hill. Many riders don’t even consider it a “turn” as much as a necessary line adjustment. It’s important to not drift too far right after Turn 3, because Turn 4 is a left and you’ll need to be on the left side of the track for it.
**Hazards / surface:** over the crest of the hill. The approach: you are accelerating uphill, likely in 3rd or 4th gear on a 600cc by the time you crest.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **600/midsize:** The approach: you are accelerating uphill, likely in 3rd or 4th gear on a 600cc by the time you crest.
- **300/small:** Small bikes can probably stay full throttle through Turn 3, just slight lean.

## ONERACE_S04 — Turn 4 (Left-hander)
**Shape:** Straight / link
**Priority / what matters:** some natural camber because it’s on a hillside. You drop a little into it. It’s important for setting up Turn 5 ahead.
**Hazards / surface:** You drop a little into it. Ideally, you approach T4 from mid-track (since you wisely stayed a bit left over the crest of T3) and carry good speed through T4.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes might approach in 4th but downshift to 3rd, feathering throttle.
- **600/midsize:** 600cc bikes can often take this in 3rd gear with a maintenance throttle – the camber will help grip.
**Common mistakes:** A common saying is “keep it high (left) exiting 4 to get a good line into 5” – meaning keep your trajectory towards the left side.
**Overtake / passing:** T4 itself isn’t a passing zone usually; it’s all about the setup.

## ONERACE_S05 — Turn 5 (Right-hander)
**Shape:** Straight / link
**Priority / what matters:** There is a short straight (more like a link) between 4 and 5, but if you exited 4 correctly, you won’t be 21 22 23 23 24 25 26 25 26 6 fully to the right edge – you’ll be about mid-track, which is ideal to dive into Turn 5. This corner is critical for the run down into the Fish Hook (Turns 6-7). Many lap times are...
**Hazards / surface:** It’s slightly downhill entry, but then the track falls more steeply after the apex, so anticipate the weight shift. 600s and 1000s: better to err on a slightly slow-in, fast-out approach.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** 600s and 1000s: better to err on a slightly slow-in, fast-out approach. The bike will lighten a bit at T5 exit as the hill drops – be ready; a superbike might wag the bars or spin slightly here.
- **600/midsize:** 600s and 1000s: better to err on a slightly slow-in, fast-out approach.

## ONERACE_S06 — Turns 6 & 7 (“The Fish Hook”)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** immediate right that looks like a hook or hairpin/chicane combination. Essentially, Turn 6 is a fast right kink and Turn 7 a tight left hairpin at the bottom of the hill. Approaching from Turn 5’s exit, you go down a short hill into a shallow right curve (T6).
**Stable reference points:** Use the pavement change or a cone as a marker , and drop anchor hard.; Once in the bowl, hug the curb.
**Hazards / surface:** Use the pavement change or a cone as a marker , and drop anchor hard.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: upright the bike as much as you can, even if it means braking a touch earlier , to get maximum decel. Superbike riders: stand it up and pin it – you’ll be full throttle through the next sweeps if you do it right.
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size bikes: trail brake down into the bowl, but keep a bit of throttle to maintain stability as you’re leaning left (the banking will help “catch” you).
**Overtake / passing:** Smaller bikes can dive into the Fish Hook really deep and use that banking to catch them – you might even pass bigger bikes here by braking later .

## ONERACE_S07 — Turn 8 (Left kink)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** kink in this downhill run. For bikes, it’s usually just a slight lean at full gas. Turn 8 sets you up for Turn 9.
**Hazards / surface:** For bikes, it’s usually just a slight lean at full gas. The track has a few undulations here.

## ONERACE_S08 — Turn 9 (Fast Right Sweeper)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** This is a very fast right-hand bend that in many cases is just a slight roll-off and lean. There’s a gentle rise on entry to T9 which can unsettle the bike. Try not to over-slow – keeping speed is crucial.
**Stable reference points:** The corner has a bit of exit curb inside – but beware using too much inside curb on T9, it can upset the chassis if you hit it at lean.; Let the bike run out to the left exit curb as you accelerate out.
**Hazards / surface:** This is a very fast right-hand bend that in many cases is just a slight roll-off and lean. Superbikes: you might approach T9 in 5th gear 27 27 27 28 11 29 7 topping 200 km/h; a slight roll or tap of brake to get weight forward is needed .
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: you might approach T9 in 5th gear 27 27 27 28 11 29 7 topping 200 km/h; a slight roll or tap of brake to get weight forward is needed .
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size bikes (600) often just do a quick downshift or tiny lift, then throw it in – it’s a rush because you’re still probably above 150 km/h through T9.
- **300/small:** Small bikes likely can keep it pinned through T9 if the rider has the courage, maybe a minor throttle feather .
**Overtake / passing:** T9 is critical for setting up an overtake into Turn 10 – in car racing, this sets up passing on the straight, but on bikes it’s more about maintaining momentum.

## ONERACE_S09 — Turn 10 (Final Hairpin, “The Sweeper”)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** that leads onto the main straight. It’s about 135° and heavily banked on the inside. The exit of Turn 10 is crucial not only for finishing the lap but it dictates your speed across the start/finish and into Turn 1 of the next lap.
**Stable reference points:** Line: aim to apex about a meter late of the geometric center – basically don’t hug the curb from the start, come in late and tight.; The exit of Turn 10 is crucial not only for finishing the lap but it dictates your speed across the start/finish and into Turn 1 of the next lap.; Common mistake: rushing the apex and missing it, resulting in running wide onto the exit curb or grass.
**Hazards / surface:** Approach is slightly downhill: about 70% of your braking is on level ground, but the last part the track falls away as you tip in. Superbikes: you’ll come into T10 hot (probably 5th gear on that short straight) – drop to 2nd gear , maybe even 1st.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: you’ll come into T10 hot (probably 5th gear on that short straight) – drop to 2nd gear , maybe even 1st. Superbikes will often wheelie or spin slightly cresting onto the straight – it’s okay if you’re pointed right.
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size and small bikes can handle a bit more entry speed due to lower mass – but even on a 300, rushing T10 will kill your drive and possibly send you off-line. A 600cc should be set for versatility: medium stiffness, perhaps raise rear ride height a tad to help quick transitions, and make use of that front-end feel in hairpins.
- **300/small:** Mid-size and small bikes can handle a bit more entry speed due to lower mass – but even on a 300, rushing T10 will kill your drive and possibly send you off-line. Setup for classes: A lightweight bike (e.g.
**Common mistakes:** This means it’s easy to overshoot the apex or run wide if you haven’t shed enough speed early. Common mistake: rushing the apex and missing it, resulting in running wide onto the exit curb or grass.

# Morgan Park Raceway (Circuit K)
- Layout: Circuit K (2.97 km)
- Direction: Not specified (see track map/guide)
## MORGAN_S00 — Overview & key themes
**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** Morgan Park Raceway (QLD) – 2.97 km Circuit K Morgan Park (Warwick, QLD) is a 2.9 km circuit with 12 turns used in ASBK. It’s characterized by significant elevation changes and undulation, giving it a very technical character.
**Stable reference points:** It’s characterized by significant elevation changes and undulation, giving it a very technical character.; Turn 3 (Blind Left-hander by the Wall) – A notorious blind crest left.; As you power up from T2, you approach a left turn (T3) with a concrete wall tight on the inside that blocks your view through the corner .
**Hazards / surface:** It’s characterized by significant elevation changes and undulation, giving it a very technical character. Riders face a bit of everything: a blind crest turn (Turn 3), a mix of tight hairpins (T4 and T7 chicanes) and fast sweepers (the Turns 8-9 kink combo), plus a banked high-speed corner (Turn 10) and a final tricky chicane (Turns 11-12) onto the main straight.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Approach: You come off the front straight quite fast (over 200 km/h on a superbike). Mid-size and superbikes: enter T1 on the right, gradually braking or rolling off through the right-hand part, keeping some brake all the way to the midpoint of T2.
- **600/midsize:** Mid-size and superbikes: enter T1 on the right, gradually braking or rolling off through the right-hand part, keeping some brake all the way to the midpoint of T2. 600s: practice a bit of late braking in Friday practice here; you can make up time or positions with confident braking and a tight inside line.
- **300/small:** Small bikes can almost go full throttle through T1 and just a slight chop for T2, as their cornering speed is high relative to power . Small bikes: you can nearly go flat through here, just a slight lift for stability.
**Common mistakes:** The track undulates over the Southern Downs hillside, which means you need to be aggressive yet precise – many corners flow into one another and any mistake carries on through subsequent turns. There’s plenty of run-off and it’s a common pass attempt area, as Mike Jones notes “a really good opportunity for overtaking”.
**Overtake / passing:** Turn 4 (Heavy Braking Right-Hairpin) – After the intensity of Turn 3, you get a prime overtaking spot: Turn 4 is a tight right-hand hairpin at the end of an uphill-to-flat straight. There’s plenty of run-off and it’s a common pass attempt area, as Mike Jones notes “a really good opportunity for overtaking”.

## MORGAN_S01 — Turns  1  &  2  (Right-Left  Sweepers)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** immediately followed by a left (T2) up a hill. In reality, riders treat T1/T2 as one large “S” shaped sweeper . The key is to combine them into one arc.
**Hazards / surface:** Turn 1 is a kink to the right – roll off slightly or maintenance throttle through it, and prepare to tip left for Turn 2. Small bikes can almost go full throttle through T1 and just a slight chop for T2, as their cornering speed is high relative to power .
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Approach: You come off the front straight quite fast (over 200 km/h on a superbike). Mid-size and superbikes: enter T1 on the right, gradually braking or rolling off through the right-hand part, keeping some brake all the way to the midpoint of T2.

## MORGAN_S02 — Turn 3 (Blind Left-hander by the Wall)
**Shape:** Corner / complex
**Priority / what matters:** approach a left turn (T3) with a concrete wall tight on the inside that blocks your view through the corner . This is “probably the most exciting corner on the whole circuit” – because you must commit to the left-hand line without seeing the exit.
**Stable reference points:** approach a left turn (T3) with a concrete wall tight on the inside that blocks your view through the corner .; The wall is right at apex, so riders aim to get as close to it as possible (some joke “kiss the wall” – figuratively!).; Aim your bike toward the wall as you crest.
**Hazards / surface:** Aim your bike toward the wall as you crest. Small bikes: you can nearly go flat through here, just a slight lift for stability.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** On a superbike, many riders will not fully open throttle until they’ve cleared T3 because the bike’s front is light and you’re leaned – it’s a finesse corner .
- **300/small:** Small bikes: you can nearly go flat through here, just a slight lift for stability.

## MORGAN_S03 — Turn 4 (Heavy Braking Right-Hairpin)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** Turn 4 is a tight right-hand hairpin at the end of an uphill-to-flat straight. It’s a classic “slow corner = heavy braking” situation. Superbikes: you’ll approach faster , so focus on stability – braking upright then trailing slightly as you turn.
**Hazards / surface:** Small bikes can dive very deep and still make the corner due to lighter weight. Superbikes: you’ll approach faster , so focus on stability – braking upright then trailing slightly as you turn.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: you’ll approach faster , so focus on stability – braking upright then trailing slightly as you turn.

## MORGAN_S04 — Turn 5 (Long Sweeping Left)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** somewhat long and sets up Turn 6 immediately after . Mike Jones describes it as a “long sweeping left hander” where you “drive the bike really hard into 5”. There’s also an element of compromise: if you exit T4 tight, you can attack Turn 5 better .
**Hazards / surface:** Small bikes: you might not even need to brake before Turn 6 because your corner speed can be high; you might roll off slightly at the end of T5 to load the front.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** 600s and 1000s: commit to throttle through T5, then just as you reach max lean and see Turn 6 ahead, apply the brakes.
- **600/midsize:** 600s and 1000s: commit to throttle through T5, then just as you reach max lean and see Turn 6 ahead, apply the brakes.
- **300/small:** Small bikes: you might not even need to brake before Turn 6 because your corner speed can be high; you might roll off slightly at the end of T5 to load the front.

## MORGAN_S05 — Turn 6 (Right-Hand Flick)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** kink in the middle of the S-bend (forming a chicane with T5). It’s a bit of a “change-of-direction” chicane: left T5 into right T6. The apex of T6 is important because it sets the timing for changing direction into 7.
**Stable reference points:** Small bikes: can perhaps do a small lift and throw it right, using inside curb.
**Hazards / surface:** There’s a dip or slight off-camber at T6 entry, making it tricky – Mike Jones noted you start braking while the bike is at max lean left, then pick it up and change direction to the right. You want to pick the bike up slightly while braking to get grip on the front as you turn right.

## MORGAN_S06 — Turn 7 (Left-hand tight corner)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** (almost hairpin-ish) immediately after the quick Turn 6 right. Jones calls 4-5-6 “the complex” and says he prefers to “slow up a little, get a really good line as you change direction from right to left” (6 to 7) and focus on drive out of 7. That tells us: don’t rush the entry to 7; rather , set the bike direction...
**Stable reference points:** There aren’t strong reference markers; it’s about feel, and many find Turn 7 deceptively tight and tough to be consistent .
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes/600s: likely 2nd gear , maybe short shift to 3rd as you pick up the bike.
- **600/midsize:** Superbikes/600s: likely 2nd gear , maybe short shift to 3rd as you pick up the bike.
- **300/small:** Small bikes: you might carry more corner speed and less worry about exit power , but still keep it tidy and maximize drive – you need all the speed onto the straight.

## MORGAN_S07 — Turns 8 & 9 (Fast Esses
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** Turn 7 hard, you go down a hill into a flat-out left kink (T8) immediately followed by a flat-out right kink (T9). Motorcyclists often treat 8 and 9 as a single high-speed snake. The combined exit of 9 you should drift back left, setting up for Turn 10.
**Stable reference points:** The bike may wallow or slide – just stay loose and let it.; These kinks have gentle curbing that you can touch if necessary.
**Hazards / surface:** Mike Jones describes this as “through the fast turns 8 and 9…very high speed, over 200km/h, bike dancing, try to let it move by standing on the pegs slightly”. Turn 9 has a crest on entry and is taken nearly flat as well, just a slight decel while flipping from left to right.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Indeed, Turn 8 is a left that you take at full throttle in 5th gear on a 1000cc .
- **600/midsize:** On a 600, likely flat out through 8, slight lift or upshift, then flat through 9.
- **300/small:** On a small bike, you’re probably pinned throughout and just sweeping the esses with minor body English corrections.
**Confidence:** Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).

## MORGAN_S08 — Turn 10 (Fast Banked Right)
**Shape:** Chicane
**Priority / what matters:** the high-speed section. You’ve just blasted through 8/9 and now approach T10 still carrying big speed. So focus on exit drive: “Fire yourself out of there as hard and fast as you can, towards the last chicane”.
**Hazards / surface:** Perhaps drop 1-2 gears (600 in 4th, big bike 4th or maybe down to 3rd).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** On a 600/1000, trail braking into the banking is effective. Mid-corner , it’s maybe a medium-fast turn (say 120-140 km/h on superbike).
- **600/midsize:** Perhaps drop 1-2 gears (600 in 4th, big bike 4th or maybe down to 3rd). On a 600/1000, trail braking into the banking is effective.
- **300/small:** On a small bike, you might barely brake – just roll and pitch it in.
**Overtake / passing:** It’s also a good overtaking spot because the banking allows inside passes without washing out . You can go in deep on the inside line (hence the passing opportunity).
**Confidence:** Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).

## MORGAN_S09 — Turns 11 & 12 (Final Chicane onto Main Straight)
**Shape:** Chicane
**Priority / what matters:** the short straight out of T10, you must brake hard and flick right for Turn 11 then immediately left for Turn 12 (which exits onto the main straight). Turn 11 is a sharp right, basically the entry to the chicane. You could enter really quickly and make up time on entry, but then you have to slow a lot to change...
**Stable reference points:** The chicane curbs are usable; many riders take a bit of curb on both 11 and 12 to straighten it out.
**Hazards / surface:** Turn 12 left is slightly uphill onto the straight, and there’s a crest on the exit that can unsettle the bike if you’re not upright. So the goal is to have the bike upright over that crest while at full throttle.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: be cautious of too much throttle while still leaned in T12 – the crest can cause a momentary loss of grip. 1000s – consider anti-wheelie strategies (electronic or setup) because of many rises; perhaps lower front end a tad (or raise rear) to shift weight forward to help front stay in contact over crests, but careful not to induce headshake in the fast stuff – a steering damper is your friend here.
- **600/midsize:** 600s – a middle-ground setup, maybe slightly front-biased for all the direction changes (these bikes thrive at Morgan Park).
- **300/small:** Small bikes: can maybe carry a bit more entry speed as they flick easier , but they too benefit from a good exit drive. Class-specific:Lightweights – focus on maintaining momentum; you can likely run slightly softer springs to maximize grip and you won’t overpower the track, just keep corner speed high.

**Stable reference points:** Wanneroo Raceway (WA) – Barbagallo Wanneroo Raceway (formerly Barbagallo) in Western Australia is a 2.41 km clockwise circuit known for its natural sand-hill terrain, featuring significant elevation changes including the famous “Basin” (Kolb Corner) and a high-speed hilltop sequence.; Superbikes might brake at around the 150m board, drop one gear and tip in around 160+ km/h.; Line: aim inside early (there’s a curb/apex on right) and let the bike drift out mid-corner .
**Hazards / surface:** Wanneroo Raceway (WA) – Barbagallo Wanneroo Raceway (formerly Barbagallo) in Western Australia is a 2.41 km clockwise circuit known for its natural sand-hill terrain, featuring significant elevation changes including the famous “Basin” (Kolb Corner) and a high-speed hilltop sequence. It’s a busy, demanding track with a bit of everything: a fast Turn 1, a steep drop into a bowl hairpin (Turn 6), and a final sweeping turn onto the straight .
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes might brake at around the 150m board, drop one gear and tip in around 160+ km/h. A superbike might even wheelie slightly cresting here; short-shift or lean forward to keep it down.
- **600/midsize:** T3 itself has some camber and is not too tight – you could take it in say 3rd gear on a 600. Mid bikes (600): focus on mid-corner front grip – this corner demands trust in the front tire.
- **300/small:** Small bikes may not brake at all. Small bikes: you can be more aggressive – later braking (less mass to manage), and you might even be able to trail brake deep because the banking will catch you.
**Common mistakes:** Sand runoff areas mean any off-line excursions can be perilous (the sand traps here are deep and unforgiving). If you run wide, you’ll hit the curbing or sandy runoff; many crashes happen from running off here.
**Overtake / passing:** If riding the motorcycle short circuit, T3 might be bypassed, but on full course you have this right- left combo.

## WANNEROO_S01 — Turn 1 (“Cat Corner”)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** It’s a sweeping turn that you enter at high speed after the ~800m straight. There is a dip as you turn in, and the outside of the turn has been known to accumulate dust (from drift events or wind blowing sand). The corner has a bit of camber on entry that goes neutral on exit.
**Stable reference points:** Superbikes might brake at around the 150m board, drop one gear and tip in around 160+ km/h.; Line: aim inside early (there’s a curb/apex on right) and let the bike drift out mid-corner .; If you run wide, you’ll hit the curbing or sandy runoff; many crashes happen from running off here.
**Hazards / surface:** There is a dip as you turn in, and the outside of the turn has been known to accumulate dust (from drift events or wind blowing sand). Superbikes might brake at around the 150m board, drop one gear and tip in around 160+ km/h.

## WANNEROO_S02 — Turn 2
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** layouts; in the motorcycle layout it might be counted if a chicane was added, but traditionally Turn 2 is a sweeping left that transitions from the T1 exit towards the back section. It’s taken flat out usually. No braking for T2 per se; focus on positioning for Turn 3.
**Hazards / surface:** The main challenge in this area is setting up for the next corner and dealing with the crest – the bike may get light after T1 into T2. A superbike might even wheelie slightly cresting here; short-shift or lean forward to keep it down.

## WANNEROO_S03 — Turn 3
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** with Turn 4. Essentially, after the gentle left kink (T2), you flick right for T3, which leads into a quick left T4.
**Hazards / surface:** Braking: a slight dab for T3 as needed.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **600/midsize:** T3 itself has some camber and is not too tight – you could take it in say 3rd gear on a 600.
- **300/small:** Small bikes may not brake at all.
**Overtake / passing:** If riding the motorcycle short circuit, T3 might be bypassed, but on full course you have this right- left combo.

## WANNEROO_S04 — Turn 4
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** slightly toward the “Basin” hairpin. Turn 4 is usually taken with just a lean flick; any braking you do for T3 covers T4 as well. So get the bike to the right at T3 exit, then cut T4 left, and drift out right again after it.

## WANNEROO_S05 — Turn 5
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** straight segment. I’ll interpret Turn 5 as the braking zone approach to the Basin.
**Stable reference points:** Use the right side of track, there might be brake markers (100m, 50m).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** The straight isn’t very long, so on a superbike you only have a second or so before you must clamp down from maybe ~180+ km/h.

## WANNEROO_S06 — Turn 6 (“Kolb Corner” a.k.a. “The Basin”)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** of a hill, heavily banked like a bowl. Locals call it “The Basin” because you drop into it and climb out. Mid bikes (600): focus on mid-corner front grip – this corner demands trust in the front tire.
**Hazards / surface:** Locals call it “The Basin” because you drop into it and climb out. For bikes: approach is downhill, so braking is tricky – your rear lightens (it will slide or wag if you’re hard on brakes).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes: brake a bit earlier than you think, because going downhill reduces braking effectiveness. Superbikes: as you pick up throttle, the bike will want to squat deep in the rear because of the banking and climb (the rear “rolls over” as Frosty said).
- **600/midsize:** Mid bikes (600): focus on mid-corner front grip – this corner demands trust in the front tire.
- **300/small:** Small bikes: you can be more aggressive – later braking (less mass to manage), and you might even be able to trail brake deep because the banking will catch you.

## WANNEROO_S07 — Turn 7
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** gentle left curve which is Turn 7. It’s taken flat out; the main thing is that near the crest after T7, you have to set up for the final turn.
**Stable reference points:** Superbike/1000cc: likely a significant crest – many riders will short-shift or roll a fraction to keep wheel down, then back on throttle.
**Hazards / surface:** It’s taken flat out; the main thing is that near the crest after T7, you have to set up for the final turn. Also, as you crest Turn 7, bikes often go light or wheelie (this might actually be the infamous “jump” section that caused safety concerns years ago for bikes).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbike/1000cc: likely a significant crest – many riders will short-shift or roll a fraction to keep wheel down, then back on throttle.
- **300/small:** Small bikes: full throttle, minimal drama.

## WANNEROO_S08 — Turn 8 (Final Corner)
**Shape:** Sweeper
**Priority / what matters:** that leads onto the pit straight. It’s a bit banked on entry and has a dip (known historically as “The Bowl” as well by some, but let’s avoid confusion – we already have a bowl). Plus, this corner tightens a bit late and the exit drops away (which can cause wheelspin or wheelies).
**Stable reference points:** Braking: There’s usually a brake marker ~100m.; Line: aim a little early apex then hold tight – you don’t want to run wide mid-corner or you’ll hit exit curb oddly.; Use all the exit – there’s concrete run-off which is often used; just be mindful of any dust there.
**Hazards / surface:** It’s a bit banked on entry and has a dip (known historically as “The Bowl” as well by some, but let’s avoid confusion – we already have a bowl). The corner is tricky: you come in from a crest, needing to brake and turn left while going downhill.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** 600/1000: get the bike turned and squared up for exit because the main straight is short-ish but you still need a drive. Set up for good mid-corner stability (a little softer front maybe because they don’t have as extreme weight shift as 1000s).
- **600/midsize:** The corner radius is such that it’s about medium speed (say 3rd gear on a 600). 600/1000: get the bike turned and squared up for exit because the main straight is short-ish but you still need a drive.
- **300/small:** 57 15 Classes:Lightweights – exploit the nimbleness in Basin and quick flick T3-T4. srsltid=AfmBOooCOxDLEa2MGlmuXMdcaQryMSJKw2REICgtjTeNcYscVgGZ1n0F BigPond 400 - The Official Site of Mark Winterbottom https://markwinterbottom.com/events/races/2008/5/bigpond-400 Wanneroo Raceway - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanneroo_Raceway 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 10 8 9 11 12 13 14 15 37 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 72 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 33 34 35 36 68 69 70 71 20 32 38 58 59 61 60 63 64 65 66 67 62 17

# The Bend Motorsport Park (International Circuit)
- Layout: International Circuit (4.95 km)
- Direction: Not specified (see track map/guide)
## BEND_INT_S00 — Overview & key themes
**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** The Bend Motorsport Park (International Circuit, 4.95 km) – Motorcycle Track Guide Official track map of The Bend Motorsport Park – International Circuit (4.95 km, 18 turns). The layout features a 1 km uphill main straight and a mix of fast sweeping sections and tight technical bends. A well set-up bike that balances front-end confidence (for...
**Stable reference points:** The circuit is wide and forgiving of lines in places, but that very openness means scarce visual reference points – you often feel like you’re “running blind” and must create your own markers on the vast pavement .; Corner-by-Corner Breakdown and Lines Turn 1 – “Big Stop” Hairpin (Right): After the long uphill start/finish straight (which crests then levels off near the braking zone), Turn 1 is a first-gear right-hand hairpin that requires shedding massive speed – from ~280–290 km/h down to about 85 km/h.; There are marker boards (300 m, 200 m, 100 m) on rider’s left – a good reference is to begin braking around the 200 m board on a superbike (earlier ~250 m when learning, or on smaller bikes).
**Hazards / surface:** Wind can also be a variable at this open rural circuit, and dust or sand can reduce grip off the racing line on windy days (keep this in mind when offline or overtaking).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** The result is a long lap (around 1m54s for superbikes) that is “long and technical…but a bucket load of fun”. You’ll hit top speed (approaching ~290 km/h on a 1000cc superbike) on the 1 km straight , then slam into heavy braking for Turn 1.
- **600/midsize:** Gear: Superbikes drop to 2nd gear (some even 1st if geared tall) for Turn 1; a 600cc or 400cc will also use 2nd if possible, to avoid excessive wheelspin or bogging on exit. Gear: 600s and 1000s will be in 3rd gear through this left-right (maybe short-shifting to 3rd for smoother transition); a 400 might hold 4th through T2 and downshift to 3rd for T3.
- **300/small:** There are marker boards (300 m, 200 m, 100 m) on rider’s left – a good reference is to begin braking around the 200 m board on a superbike (earlier ~250 m when learning, or on smaller bikes). Gear: Superbikes drop to 2nd gear (some even 1st if geared tall) for Turn 1; a 600cc or 400cc will also use 2nd if possible, to avoid excessive wheelspin or bogging on exit.
**Common mistakes:** Overall, the track “is simply amazing” and a joy once you learn it, but it demands respect – any mistake in the technical sequences will compound and cost you all the way through the lap. Common mistakes: Out-braking yourself into T1 (there’s generous runoff, but time lost) and early apexing – which leaves you running wide and slow on exit.
**Overtake / passing:** It’s one of the best overtaking spots on the track due to the huge braking zone. But it’s also a passing opportunity: a rider who brakes extra-deep can dive inside at T6’s entry.

## BEND_INT_S02 — Turns 2–3
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** and it’s deceptively tricky. There’s a rise and dip through here – “a lot of undulation… which TV won’t show” – and the bike transitions from full lean right to left. The exit of Turn 3 is crucial; get on the gas early and drive out cleanly, using all the track width.
**Stable reference points:** There is a bit of curb on the outside – you can run onto it on exit if needed, as the runoff is forgiving here.
**Hazards / surface:** There’s a rise and dip through here – “a lot of undulation… which TV won’t show” – and the bike transitions from full lean right to left. Only a slight brake or roll-off may be needed as you flick left.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Gear: 600s and 1000s will be in 3rd gear through this left-right (maybe short-shifting to 3rd for smoother transition); a 400 might hold 4th through T2 and downshift to 3rd for T3.
- **600/midsize:** Gear: 600s and 1000s will be in 3rd gear through this left-right (maybe short-shifting to 3rd for smoother transition); a 400 might hold 4th through T2 and downshift to 3rd for T3.

## BEND_INT_S03 — Turns 4–5
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** sweeping section. Turn 4 is a slight right-hand kink taken almost flat-out, and Turn 5 is a fast left-hand sweeper . The track slightly crests and drops away through these turns, and the camber falls off towards the outside, which “draws you out” wide at the exit.
**Stable reference points:** For Turn 4 (right kink), pick a turn-in reference – perhaps a distant tree, flag post, or brake marker board on the right (even though you won’t brake much, a board or painted curb can cue your tip-in).; The apex is blind, but as you tip in, look for the inside curb appearing and apex mid- curb.; You can use the exit curb, but too much speed will still risk running off.
**Hazards / surface:** Turn 4 is a slight right-hand kink taken almost flat-out, and Turn 5 is a fast left-hand sweeper . The track slightly crests and drops away through these turns, and the camber falls off towards the outside, which “draws you out” wide at the exit.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** This “run to Turn 5 is quite quick” – on a superbike you’ll reach 5th gear and about 230 km/ h through Turn 4. Turn 5 requires a quick brush of the brakes to shed a bit of speed (superbikes drop to ~195 km/h).
- **600/midsize:** Gear: 1000cc in 5th gear through 4, down to 4th for 5; 600cc around 5th->4th; 400cc maybe 5th pinned through both if you can keep momentum.
- **300/small:** Gear: 1000cc in 5th gear through 4, down to 4th for 5; 600cc around 5th->4th; 400cc maybe 5th pinned through both if you can keep momentum.
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Turning in too early (you’ll run off as the track falls away) and not trusting the bike’s grip through the blind entry.

## BEND_INT_S04 — Turn 6
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** the fast T5, you’ll be accelerating on a short straight (briefly up to maybe 200+ km/h on literbikes) and then braking hard for Turn 6, a tight left-hand hairpin that goes on forever. It’s described as “a weird corner – a long left-hander that comes back on itself”. The off-camber means if you hug the inside too...
**Stable reference points:** Braking: There is a brake marker board (100 m) – a superbike might start braking just after the 150 m mark, a 600 around 150 m, and a 400 closer to 100 m, since their entry speeds are lower.; Tip: There’s a flag marshal post** on the outside of Turn 6 – as you approach, it can serve as a visual cue to judge where the corner wraps back.; Only when you see the end of the guardrail or flag station on exit can you really hammer the throttle.
**Hazards / surface:** Think of it as a bowl or carousel, except it’s off-camber . The off-camber means if you hug the inside too early, you might lose the line, so don’t be afraid to let the bike run a little wide mid-turn, then pull it back tight for exit.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** the fast T5, you’ll be accelerating on a short straight (briefly up to maybe 200+ km/h on literbikes) and then braking hard for Turn 6, a tight left-hand hairpin that goes on forever. Braking: There is a brake marker board (100 m) – a superbike might start braking just after the 150 m mark, a 600 around 150 m, and a 400 closer to 100 m, since their entry speeds are lower.
- **600/midsize:** Braking: There is a brake marker board (100 m) – a superbike might start braking just after the 150 m mark, a 600 around 150 m, and a 400 closer to 100 m, since their entry speeds are lower. You’ll be in 2nd gear (perhaps even 1st on a 600/400).
- **300/small:** Braking: There is a brake marker board (100 m) – a superbike might start braking just after the 150 m mark, a 600 around 150 m, and a 400 closer to 100 m, since their entry speeds are lower. You’ll be in 2nd gear (perhaps even 1st on a 600/400).
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Charging in too fast and running wide (especially given the off-camber – you’ll end up way outside and slow out, or worse, onto the runoff).
**Overtake / passing:** But it’s also a passing opportunity: a rider who brakes extra-deep can dive inside at T6’s entry.

## BEND_INT_S05 — Turns 7–8–9–10
**Shape:** Double-apex
**Priority / what matters:** speed esses sequence: a left-right-left-right combination (Turns 7–10) taken in rapid succession. This is widely considered “the hardest section of the track” because the corners flow one into the next, and crucially, the entry is completely blind.
**Hazards / surface:** Turn 7 is a fast kink (right) over a crest – as you crest, begin to turn in left for Turn 8 without seeing the apex of 8 yet. Turns 7/8 are taken almost as one big chicane; roll the throttle only slightly to settle the bike.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Approach Turn 7 uphill and stay on throttle – on a superbike you’ll be in 4th gear , flicking right then left.

## BEND_INT_S07 — Turn 10 (Right)
**Shape:** Esses / S
**Priority / what matters:** essentially the exit of the esses. It tightens more, so you may need to downshift (perhaps to 3rd gear). Hug the right-side apex curb and really focus on drive, because there’s a short straight after Turn 10.
**Stable reference points:** Hug the right-side apex curb and really focus on drive, because there’s a short straight after Turn 10.; This sector will really separate riders; it’s where lap times can swing significantly.
**Hazards / surface:** Look as far ahead as you can (even though it’s blind, look through the blind crest to where you expect the track to go).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Gear: 1000cc in 4th gear through 7-8, downshift to 3rd by Turn 10; 600cc similar; 400cc may hold 5th then 4th.
- **600/midsize:** Gear: 1000cc in 4th gear through 7-8, downshift to 3rd by Turn 10; 600cc similar; 400cc may hold 5th then 4th.
- **300/small:** Gear: 1000cc in 4th gear through 7-8, downshift to 3rd by Turn 10; 600cc similar; 400cc may hold 5th then 4th.
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Turning in wrong for Turn 8 and subsequently getting out of sync (when one part is off, the rest cascade in a “painful” way).

## BEND_INT_S08 — Turn 11
**Shape:** Esses / S
**Priority / what matters:** (between T10 and T11). Turn 11 is a fast right-hander that comes just after a crest. The corner opens up on exit.
**Stable reference points:** However , there’s a catch: a very high inside kerb.; As the iRacing guide notes, you want to “stay to the left until you see the kerb, then flick it in and lean on the camber”.; In other words, don’t turn in too early – that tall apex kerb will unsettle you (or behead your toe/peg!).
**Hazards / surface:** Turn 11 is a fast right-hander that comes just after a crest. Instead, delay apex slightly: trail-brake in uphill, wait until that kerb is visible, then tip in decisively.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Superbikes approach in 4th gear , then flick right into T11 at about 160–165 km/h. Gear: 1000s in 4th gear , 600 maybe 4th, 400 could be 5th pinned and barely roll off.
- **600/midsize:** Gear: 1000s in 4th gear , 600 maybe 4th, 400 could be 5th pinned and barely roll off.
- **300/small:** Gear: 1000s in 4th gear , 600 maybe 4th, 400 could be 5th pinned and barely roll off.
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Turning in too early and hitting that kerb (which can bounce the bike off-line), or conversely, apexing too late and missing the camber window – you’ll run wide onto the outside curb which, with less banking, can be sketchy.

## BEND_INT_S09 — Turn 12
**Shape:** Straight / link
**Priority / what matters:** left-hand corner that leads onto the back straight. This is a heavy braking zone but slightly downhill or flat, and as Winterbottom notes, “the exit here has no run off” – so any mistake at exit can be costly. Exit: Prioritize a clean exit – as you stand the bike up, feed in throttle and use the full track width at...
**Stable reference points:** Hug the inside at the apex, but watch the curb; beyond it is dirt with very little paved runoff.; Exit: Prioritize a clean exit – as you stand the bike up, feed in throttle and use the full track width at exit (there is no extra asphalt outside the curb, so you must flirt right to the edge of that curb).
**Hazards / surface:** This is a heavy braking zone but slightly downhill or flat, and as Winterbottom notes, “the exit here has no run off” – so any mistake at exit can be costly. Bikes will drop to around 100–110 km/h mid-corner (2nd gear for most classes).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** You won’t have a ton of time, so it’s a quick downshift or two (superbikes from 4th to 2nd) and a firm brake bite. Gear: 2nd gear for 1000s/600s; a 400 might even use 3rd if gearing is short (to avoid an extra shift) but likely 2nd as well for torque.
- **600/midsize:** Gear: 2nd gear for 1000s/600s; a 400 might even use 3rd if gearing is short (to avoid an extra shift) but likely 2nd as well for torque.
- **300/small:** Gear: 2nd gear for 1000s/600s; a 400 might even use 3rd if gearing is short (to avoid an extra shift) but likely 2nd as well for torque.
**Common mistakes:** This is a heavy braking zone but slightly downhill or flat, and as Winterbottom notes, “the exit here has no run off” – so any mistake at exit can be costly. Common mistakes: Not fully preparing the bike after Turn 11 – many riders are late to stabilise from the right flick and thus brake and turn for T12 in a hurry, leading to overshooting.
**Overtake / passing:** Passing: Turn 12 itself isn’t a major passing spot (since passing would mean lunging inside as someone comes off T11 lean – risky). But a better drive out of T12 can set you up to draft and pass on the back straight that follows.

## BEND_INT_S10 — Turn 13
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** end of the back straight. It’s unique because it goes uphill and features a camber change mid-corner . Entry is on-camber (so you can carry good speed in), but then the camber falls off on exit, almost like the corner “flattens out” or even off-cambers as it crests.
**Hazards / surface:** Entry is on-camber (so you can carry good speed in), but then the camber falls off on exit, almost like the corner “flattens out” or even off-cambers as it crests. Approach in 4th gear , then brake moderately – you’re dropping to about 130–135 km/h in the apex.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Gear: 1000s in 3rd gear typically (maybe high 3rd); 600 in 3rd; 400 could hold 4th if momentum allows or 3rd if needing grunt.
- **600/midsize:** Gear: 1000s in 3rd gear typically (maybe high 3rd); 600 in 3rd; 400 could hold 4th if momentum allows or 3rd if needing grunt.
- **300/small:** Gear: 1000s in 3rd gear typically (maybe high 3rd); 600 in 3rd; 400 could hold 4th if momentum allows or 3rd if needing grunt.
**Common mistakes:** Line: Because of the camber shift, a common tactic is to apex early-mid while the camber is helping, then be ready as the bike wants to drift out when the banking disappears. Speaking of which: any mistake through Turn 13 (e.g.
**Overtake / passing:** missed apex, too slow or too wide) “will offer an opportunity to pass at the next corner”.

## BEND_INT_S11 — Turn 14
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** Turn 13. It’s one of the slowest corners (around 80 km/h again) and definitely an overtaking spot if you have a run. You’re still leaned right exiting 13, so you have to upright and brake quickly.
**Stable reference points:** So your braking marker should be conservative – perhaps a shade earlier than you think, especially on worn tires.; If you’re trying to pass someone, you need to be significantly alongside at turn-in or you’ll both tangle; as Winty noted, “if you’re going to make a move there you have to be a LOT quicker”.; There might be a cone or barrier marking the apex – clip it as you finish braking.
**Hazards / surface:** The track here is flat, maybe even slightly downhill into 14, with no helpful camber . But caution – coming off the slowest point, it’s easy to over-apply throttle and spin up or wheelie.
**Common mistakes:** A late apex is mandatory – otherwise you’ll either run off inside or overshoot outside. Common mistakes: Going in too hot (you’ll either overshoot wide – there is moderate runoff, but you’ll lose heaps of time – or you might tuck the front trying to hold a tight line).
**Overtake / passing:** If you’re trying to pass someone, you need to be significantly alongside at turn-in or you’ll both tangle; as Winty noted, “if you’re going to make a move there you have to be a LOT quicker”.

## BEND_INT_S12 — Turns 15–16
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** Turns 15 and 16, a pair of medium-speed bends that form an S-shape. These look like minor kinks on paper , but in reality they are real corners – “you cannot treat it as a kink… looks easier on track walk than when you’re at speed”. As soon as you exit 15, set up for Turn 16 (left).
**Stable reference points:** Line: use all the track between 15 and 16; drift out after 15 to the right-hand edge, then toss it left for 16, hitting the inside curb of 16 at the midpoint.; No real braking is needed for 16 if you got your speed right in 15 – you can carry significant speed and even accelerate through 16.
**Hazards / surface:** Many riders find a nice rhythm through 15-16 when done correctly: you flick right, apex, then left with maybe slight throttle lift and right back on gas through 16.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Gear: 1000cc likely 3rd gear through both; 600 maybe 3rd; 400 possibly 4th through 16.
- **600/midsize:** Gear: 1000cc likely 3rd gear through both; 600 maybe 3rd; 400 possibly 4th through 16.
- **300/small:** Gear: 1000cc likely 3rd gear through both; 600 maybe 3rd; 400 possibly 4th through 16.
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Misjudging Turn 15 – it tightens, so if you go in like a gentle kink, you’ll end up wide which ruins 16.

## BEND_INT_S13 — Turn 17
**Shape:** Straight / link
**Priority / what matters:** comes after a short burst out of 16. You’ll be accelerating out of Turn 16 (on a superbike perhaps up to 4th gear briefly, then back to 3rd or 2nd for 17). Line: Aim for a late apex again – the straight to the finish isn’t super long, but exit speed still matters for possibly defending into 18 or carrying momentum.
**Stable reference points:** Entry: There’s likely a 100 m board on the left; start braking hard as you approach it.
**Hazards / surface:** The corner is about as tight as Turn 14 (maybe slightly more open, but not by much).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** You’ll be accelerating out of Turn 16 (on a superbike perhaps up to 4th gear briefly, then back to 3rd or 2nd for 17).
- **300/small:** Exit: There’s only one more turn, so you can afford to give the throttle pretty hard on exit – any wheelspin here can be managed since tires don’t need to last beyond next 300 m.
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Getting greedy and overshooting (especially while attempting a pass).
**Overtake / passing:** This is a prime overtaking spot – a heavy braking into a slow corner after some high-speed bends. Many last-lap passes happen here.

## BEND_INT_S14 — Turn 18
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** that feeds onto the 1 km pit straight. Unlike many circuits with a super-slow final turn, Turn 18 at The Bend is a bit faster and flowing – about 120–125 km/h mid-corner for Superbikes. So it’s mostly an immediate left turn-in after exiting 17.
**Stable reference points:** Use all the exit curb if needed – just don’t run into the grass.; The pit wall will come up on your right as you drive out.
**Hazards / surface:** Also watch for highside risk – cold tires early in a session or worn tires later can spin up as you crank on throttle exiting onto the straight’s slight incline.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Unlike many circuits with a super-slow final turn, Turn 18 at The Bend is a bit faster and flowing – about 120–125 km/h mid-corner for Superbikes. Electronics (TC) will help on a 1000cc, but on a 600 or 400 it’s up to your wrist.
- **600/midsize:** Electronics (TC) will help on a 1000cc, but on a 600 or 400 it’s up to your wrist. Gear: 2nd or 3rd depending on bike torque – most 1000s will use 2nd for a punchy exit; a 600 might hold 2nd; a 400 could perhaps use 3rd if geared short to avoid an extra shift mid-straight.
- **300/small:** Electronics (TC) will help on a 1000cc, but on a 600 or 400 it’s up to your wrist. Gear: 2nd or 3rd depending on bike torque – most 1000s will use 2nd for a punchy exit; a 600 might hold 2nd; a 400 could perhaps use 3rd if geared short to avoid an extra shift mid-straight.
**Common mistakes:** Common mistakes: Rushing in and missing the drive. Also watch for highside risk – cold tires early in a session or worn tires later can spin up as you crank on throttle exiting onto the straight’s slight incline.
**Overtake / passing:** It’s critical because it dictates your speed down the enormous straight (and thus your lap time and ability to pass/ defend into T1). Often, fights into Turn 18 can decide a race: “if someone passes at Turn 18 there could be an over and under on the run out”.

Elevation & Camber: Significant elevation differences: the run from Turn 2...
**Stable reference points:** Elevation & Camber: Significant elevation differences: the run from Turn 2 (Southern Loop) down to Turn 4 (Honda, now Miller) drops downhill, then climbs up through Turn 5 (Siberia) and Turn 6/7 towards Lukey Heights.; Wind can be a factor here: the circuit’s exposed to Bass Strait, and strong winds can affect braking and bike stability (a tailwind down the main straight can push your brake marker deeper; a crosswind can nudge you off line in Turn 3).; Braking: drop two gears (from 6th to 4th on a 1000cc) and brake around the 150m marker (big bikes) or ~100m for 600cc.
**Hazards / surface:** Elevation & Camber: Significant elevation differences: the run from Turn 2 (Southern Loop) down to Turn 4 (Honda, now Miller) drops downhill, then climbs up through Turn 5 (Siberia) and Turn 6/7 towards Lukey Heights. Lukey Heights (Turn 8) itself is a crest – blind and steeply uphill on entry, then a quick drop to the Turn 9 hairpin (MG).
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Approach in top gear (~300 km/h on a superbike). Braking: drop two gears (from 6th to 4th on a 1000cc) and brake around the 150m marker (big bikes) or ~100m for 600cc.
- **600/midsize:** Braking: drop two gears (from 6th to 4th on a 1000cc) and brake around the 150m marker (big bikes) or ~100m for 600cc. On a 600, it’s often full throttle, touching the rev limiter in 4th by corner exit; on a 1000, a slight roll or downshift might be needed depending on gearing and tire grip.
- **300/small:** Approach in top gear (~300 km/h on a superbike). Riding Tips by Class: - 300–400cc: The little bikes can keep corner speed extremely high at Phillip Island.
**Common mistakes:** Mistakes: Many sit up 28 18 7 29 30 2 31 32 4 or roll off too much – it’s incredible how deep you can go while still making the turn. Common error: pulling over too far right between the two apexes – it’s not necessary and wastes time.
**Overtake / passing:** Overtaking: A good exit from T2 often allows passing into Turn 3. Getting through T3 fast is exhilarating and sets up passes into Turn 4 by carrying momentum.

**Priority / what matters:** high speed – scrub speed gently or a quick downshift. Enter mid-track, aim straight at the first apex and clip it, then let the bike drift out in the middle of the Loop. As the radius tightens for second apex, bring it back in and apex late on exit.
**Hazards / surface:** The mid-corner is slightly off-camber and can feel like the bike wants to fall in or run wide alternately – stay relaxed. Traction is important here – keep RPMs up to avoid bogging (gearing such that you don’t drop below 2nd gear).
**Common mistakes:** Common error: pulling over too far right between the two apexes – it’s not necessary and wastes time.
**Overtake / passing:** Overtaking: A good exit from T2 often allows passing into Turn 3.

## PHILLIP_S03 — Turn  3  (Stoner  Corner)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** Southern Loop and accelerating downhill. Flick right with minimal or no brake – just a throttle roll-off. Exit on the left edge of track, setting up for Turn 4 braking.
**Hazards / surface:** The track drops away at the apex and is bumpy; the front may get light and drift as you turn at high speed (~200+ km/h).
**Overtake / passing:** Getting through T3 fast is exhilarating and sets up passes into Turn 4 by carrying momentum.

## PHILLIP_S04 — Turn 4 (Miller Corner, formerly Honda Corner)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** high speed downhill. This is one of the best overtaking spots on the lap . Typically downshift to 2nd (or 1st for some bikes, though many prefer 2nd to avoid excessive wheelspin on exit).
**Stable reference points:** Brake marker depends on wind: with a headwind you can brake ~20m later than with a tailwind.; Visual: Brake in a straight line aiming at the large tire wall ahead, then turn late so you almost clip the inside curb twice (entry and exit).
**Overtake / passing:** This is one of the best overtaking spots on the lap . Passing: Outbrake up the inside – it’s wide, and late-brakers shine here.

## PHILLIP_S05 — Turn 5 (Siberia)
**Shape:** Straight / link
**Priority / what matters:** of grip here. Accelerate out of Turn 4 and flick left; leave it in 2nd gear (gearing usually perfect to pull through without a shift). A tight exit (stay left on exit curbing) is vital to set up the fast Hayshed section.
**Stable reference points:** A tight exit (stay left on exit curbing) is vital to set up the fast Hayshed section.; The outside of Siberia exit has bumps near the curbing – but also note it can be bumpy near the outside curb when the front is light (some wheelspin or wobble may occur).
**Hazards / surface:** Brake lightly on entry – carry speed. Turn in from mid-track or slightly wide, aim for a late apex (right as corner ends) to launch onto the straight that follows.

## PHILLIP_S06 — Turn 6 (Hayshed)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** right under the “Hayshed” (an old shed landmark). On a 600, it’s often full throttle, touching the rev limiter in 4th by corner exit; on a 1000, a slight roll or downshift might be needed depending on gearing and tire grip. Use all the track on exit.
**Stable reference points:** There’s a bump right at the inside curb – many riders just let the bike wheelie over it and keep accelerating.

## PHILLIP_S07 — Turn 7 (Lukey Heights entry)
**Shape:** Corner / complex
**Priority / what matters:** Heights, sometimes not counted separately (often Turn 7/8 collectively). You’re still leaned left from Hayshed? Lean over hard from inside white line to outside by exit.
**Hazards / surface:** It’s an uphill left that never really settles 2 5 33 34 35 35 36 37 38 39 40 39 30 41 41 42 43 28 44 45 46 5 the bike until you crest.

## PHILLIP_S08 — Turn 8 (Lukey Heights proper): The cresting blind right at the top. One of the trickiest corners
**Shape:** Corner / complex
**Priority / what matters:** charge uphill, then tip right over the blind crest. Downshift one gear (4th→3rd usually) just before tipping in – engine braking plus uphill helps slow you. A strong run through Lukey sets up a pass into MG, or prevents one.
**Stable reference points:** You apex atop the hill, then as you crest you’re already on the right edge curbing.
**Hazards / surface:** charge uphill, then tip right over the blind crest. A small bump on the inside entry can unsettle; right after it, get back on throttle to settle the chassis and pull you over the rise.

## PHILLIP_S09 — Turn 9 (MG Hairpin): A tight downhill right hairpin. Braking as you come off Lukey is tricky
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** from crest to steep downhill, so load on the front is high (easy to bottom forks) and it’s easy to misjudge. Many bikes use either 1st or 2nd gear here. Gear choice: Some prefer 2nd to avoid a 1st-2nd upshift mid-corner exit and to soften the hit on corner exit.
**Hazards / surface:** from crest to steep downhill, so load on the front is high (easy to bottom forks) and it’s easy to misjudge. There’s a notable bump out wide at entry – best to avoid the far outside line and instead brake more down the middle of the track.
**Common mistakes:** Passes here are common: outbrake up the inside (but beware the inside can be dirty).

## PHILLIP_S10 — Turn  10: A  shallow  left  kink  immediately  after  MG.  Not  really  a  corner  you  aim for
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** acceleration zone where you’re still leaned. Coming out of MG, pick the bike up and accelerate hard. Use all the track at exit; there’s concrete run-off that can save you if slightly wide.
**Stable reference points:** Use all the track at exit; there’s concrete run-off that can save you if slightly wide.
**Hazards / surface:** Use all the track at exit; there’s concrete run-off that can save you if slightly wide. The front gets light downhill here (a lot of weight on the front from braking, then suddenly as you accelerate down a dip – easy to lift the front).

## PHILLIP_S11 — Turn 11
**Shape:** Straight / link
**Priority / what matters:** corner worldwide. Approach is a brief straight – snick up to 5th gear on a 1000cc just before tipping in . When you do reach that inside curb, immediately dial in throttle hard – the exit leads onto a rise onto the front straight.
**Stable reference points:** When you do reach that inside curb, immediately dial in throttle hard – the exit leads onto a rise onto the front straight.; As you drive out, the bike is still heeled over but you’re already full throttle and tucked in by the time you hit the exit curbing.; If you nail it, you’ll hit the outside edge by start/finish in top gear , front skimming over bumps, and carry an extra 5-10 km/h down the straight.
**Hazards / surface:** Turn in from far right, brave and early, and drop the bike onto your left knee. The front will go light (even weave) over the crest as you go past pit entry – it’s normal.

# Queensland Raceway (National Circuit)
- Layout: National Circuit (3.12 km)
- Direction: Clockwise
## QR_S00 — Overview & key themes
**Shape:** Overview
**Priority / what matters:** Queensland Raceway (QLD) Track Guide Queensland Raceway “National Circuit” layout (6 corners, nicknamed “the Paperclip”). Track Map & Layout: Queensland Raceway is a 3.12 km clockwise circuit with a simple “paperclip” layout – essentially two straights with four right-angle corners and two kinks. The circuit’s simplicity is deceptive: each...
**Stable reference points:** The design is flat – no significant elevation changes – and all turns except 3/4 are flat 90° bends.; It opens onto the short chute to Turn 2.; There’s an early inside curb but ignore it – aim to apex past the midpoint.
**Hazards / surface:** It has 6 corners: Turn 1 (fast right sweeper), Turn 2 (left hairpin), Turn 3/4 (a right-left switchback forming the “flip-flop” or “dipper”), Turn 5 (right hairpin at end of back straight), and Turn 6 (final right kink onto main straight). Surface & Grip: The asphalt is wide (12 m) and was historically bumpy, but recent updates have improved it.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Entry is around fifth gear on a 600cc, perhaps fourth on a 1000cc (depending on gearing). On a 300, it’s probably flat; on a 600/1000, maybe a slight maintenance throttle then full gas once pointed.
- **600/midsize:** Entry is around fifth gear on a 600cc, perhaps fourth on a 1000cc (depending on gearing). On a 300, it’s probably flat; on a 600/1000, maybe a slight maintenance throttle then full gas once pointed.
- **300/small:** On a 300, it’s probably flat; on a 600/1000, maybe a slight maintenance throttle then full gas once pointed. Riding Tips by Class: - 300–400cc: These lightweight bikes can exploit QR’s simple layout by carrying maximum corner speed.
**Common mistakes:** Common issues: Rolling off too much (carry more speed and trust the bike). Bonus: On starts, T1 is a common passing opportunity since many bikes don’t need to brake off the grid – a brave rider can hold it pinned around the outside.
**Overtake / passing:** Bonus: On starts, T1 is a common passing opportunity since many bikes don’t need to brake off the grid – a brave rider can hold it pinned around the outside. Passing: prime spot by outbraking someone on the inside.

## QR_S01 — Turn 1 (Kitty’s Corner)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** like a fast kink. On many bikes, you barely brake – maybe a slight roll-off or light brake tap.
**Stable reference points:** It opens onto the short chute to Turn 2.
**Hazards / surface:** On many bikes, you barely brake – maybe a slight roll-off or light brake tap. Reference: The track rises ever so slightly on entry; use the start of that rise plus a change in track surface color as a turn-in cue.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** Entry is around fifth gear on a 600cc, perhaps fourth on a 1000cc (depending on gearing).
- **600/midsize:** Entry is around fifth gear on a 600cc, perhaps fourth on a 1000cc (depending on gearing).

## QR_S02 — Turn 2 (Turn 3 on some car maps, aka “The Kink” leading to “The Switchback”)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** hand hairpin. After T1, you must brake hard for T2. It’s a classic heavy braking zone – straight line braking is key, as the track is slightly uphill into T2 which helps slow you.
**Stable reference points:** There’s an early inside curb but ignore it – aim to apex past the midpoint.; Best to “hug the 55 59 23 60 10 paint” all around the inside on exit – staying tight can block others and also shorten distance.; There is ample concrete run-off if you overcook it, but rejoin carefully to avoid a penalty or collision.
**Hazards / surface:** It’s a classic heavy braking zone – straight line braking is key, as the track is slightly uphill into T2 which helps slow you. Accelerate hard out; there is minor off-camber on exit (outside edge drops away slightly), so going wide means less grip.
**Common mistakes:** Riders often make a common mistake here of turning in too soon, hitting inside then drifting too wide on exit.
**Overtake / passing:** Passing: prime spot by outbraking someone on the inside. Off the start, you can guarantee to pass a few if you hug tight all through T2’s inside.

## QR_S03 — Turn 3/4 (The Switchback or “esses”)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** left in quick succession. Turn 3 is a shallow right kink, Turn 4 a tighter left. As you exit T2, drift to track right.
**Stable reference points:** Clip the inside left curb at Turn 4 apex.; Watch for the dirt just beyond curbs – running slightly off can be hazardous due to drop-off edges about 10cm to the dirt.
**Hazards / surface:** Approach: After exiting T2, short-shift and tuck in, keeping slight right lean (T3 is just a bend). Watch for the dirt just beyond curbs – running slightly off can be hazardous due to drop-off edges about 10cm to the dirt.
**Common mistakes:** If someone runs wide out of T2, you can shoot straight through T3/4 and pass them before Turn 5.

## QR_S04 — Turn 5 (Spitfire or “Thunderbolt” Hairpin)
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** hairpin. This is similar to Turn 2 in shape but opposite direction. Apex: mid-corner , not too early – if you hug inside too early, you’ll run wide off exit.
**Stable reference points:** Use markers (boards or fence posts) for consistency.; Beware the exit curb drop: the outside of Turn 5 exit has a 10cm drop to dirt – don’t run off or you likely won’t rejoin without incident.
**Hazards / surface:** Trail-braking into Turn 5 is risky due to minimal camber and a slightly bumpy braking zone. Off-camber exit means it’s easy to spin up the rear – you might see some riders backing it in or sliding out here when pushing.
**Common mistakes:** Wheelies: as you drive out of Turn 5 uphill onto the short link, the front might lift (common on big bikes) – short-shift or feather to keep it down for Turn 6.
**Overtake / passing:** Passing: prime spot due to the long straight preceding – outbrake on the inside. There are multiple viable lines (you can enter shallow and block pass, or do a wide entry and cutback exit).

## QR_S05 — Turn 6 (Final Corner onto Main Straight)
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** corner – more of a bend you accelerate through. Line: after Turn 5, you’re on left side; keep left to set up maximum radius through 6. Crucial: get the bike upright as early as possible out of 6 for drive.
**Stable reference points:** There is a concrete apron on exit – you can use it.; Visual: Turn 6 itself has few markers; you usually sight the pit entry on right or the lighting pole beyond the straight as you exit.; Since it’s so fast, do minimal steering – let the bike run out to the exit curbing.
**Hazards / surface:** On a 300, it’s probably flat; on a 600/1000, maybe a slight maintenance throttle then full gas once pointed. This turn is slightly banked which helps grip.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** On a 300, it’s probably flat; on a 600/1000, maybe a slight maintenance throttle then full gas once pointed.
- **600/midsize:** On a 300, it’s probably flat; on a 600/1000, maybe a slight maintenance throttle then full gas once pointed.
- **300/small:** On a 300, it’s probably flat; on a 600/1000, maybe a slight maintenance throttle then full gas once pointed.
**Common mistakes:** Mistakes: the most common is not getting back on throttle early 61 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 11 enough – every mph lost here multiplies down the long straight.
**Overtake / passing:** Because of the long straight, drafting is huge – you can gain a bike length or more by staying tucked behind someone exiting 6, then pop out to overtake into Turn 1.

Track Map & Overview: Broadford’s road circuit is a tight 2.16 km track in rural Victoria featuring 12 turns in a mostly clockwise layout (11 right, 1 left – actually the track has...
**Stable reference points:** The final Turn 12 drops off- camber downhill onto the main chute.; Grip is decent in dry but drops significantly if offline (racing line quite narrow).; Broadford is famous for minimal margin of error: natural terrain limits run-off, and some walls/embankments are not far – avoid crashing, it’s easy to get collected if you fall in the racing line .
**Hazards / surface:** Broadford State Motorcycle Complex (VIC) Track Guide Broadford Road Circuit track map (2.16 km, 12 turns), with slight elevation and multiple off-camber corners. Elevation: The track flows over gentle hills – a climb up to Turn 1, dipping down the back straight, and a slight downhill run into Turn 10/11.
**Bike-class notes:**
- **SBK/1000:** - 1000cc Superbike: Broadford is challenging for liter bikes – they often can’t unleash full power except a brief squirt on back straight and front straight. Key for 1000s: electronics and throttle control.
- **600/midsize:** - 600cc Supersport: Medium bikes do well here – they have enough power to challenge straights but nimble for tight corners. Key will be managing power in off-cambers – a 600 can spin up out of T2, T5, T12 if you’re ham-fisted.
- **300/small:** Riding Tips by Class: - 300–400cc: Broadford is a playground for small bikes – you can utilize agility and corner speed to the max. Turn 1 might be nearly full throttle on a 300 once you know the line, due to lower speed and less risk of tire overload.
**Common mistakes:** Broadford is famous for minimal margin of error: natural terrain limits run-off, and some walls/embankments are not far – avoid crashing, it’s easy to get collected if you fall in the racing line . Common: Many highsides occur here from opening throttle at the wrong point (mid-corner when off-camber).
**Overtake / passing:** Off the start, this is a great place to overtake by hugging the inside all through – you can pass multiple people by staying tight from T1 entry all the way through T2 (others will drift out, you slip inside). If passing, note others might be unsettled cresting the hill.

**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** straight. After T2, you crest a small hill then go downhill flat out. Essentially, as you exit T2 stand the bike up and aim from the far left of track straight to the right side by Turn 5 entry, effectively ignoring the labeled T3/4.
**Hazards / surface:** After T2, you crest a small hill then go downhill flat out. Turn 3 is a slight right kink, Turn 4 slight left kink – but the fast line is straightlining them.

## BROADFORD_S03 — Turn 5 (UpHill Hairpin
**Shape:** Hairpin
**Priority / what matters:** short climb (“the ramp”). The braking is uphill, which is handy – you can brake late, using the hill as a stopper . Off-camber on exit – traction is there but limited.
**Stable reference points:** Use all the exit (there’s no curb, just track edge then grass – falling off here means a drop to dirt which is trouble).
**Hazards / surface:** But careful: as you crest into the turn, the rear may lift or skip. Off-camber on exit – traction is there but limited.
**Common mistakes:** Many overshoot by not realizing how slow it is at top.
**Overtake / passing:** Passing: Great spot – you can sneak inside at apex because speed is low. It's vital to drive hard off T5 – there’s a crucial downhill run to Turn 6 where passing is possible if you exited better .

## BROADFORD_S04 — Turn 6 (The Kink): A fast right kink at bottom of the hill after T5. Honestly, it’s barely a turn
**Shape:** Kink
**Priority / what matters:** courage test leading into the braking for Turn 7. You come downhill from T5 and T6 is just a bend you must not run off. Hug the right side on exit of T5, then let the bike drift left as you accelerate through T6, already setting up for next braking.
**Stable reference points:** There’s a drop-off dirt beyond the curb – don’t touch it or you likely won’t recover.
**Hazards / surface:** There’s a drop-off dirt beyond the curb – don’t touch it or you likely won’t recover. Usually flat-out or a slight roll depending on bike.

## BROADFORD_S06 — Turn 7 (right): flick right, moderate speed. Immediately flick left for Turn 8
**Shape:** Esses / S
**Priority / what matters:** Steering speed is key: snap the bike side to side fast. If you lazily hang off or move slow, you waste time. It’s off-camber exit again for T8 to T9.
**Stable reference points:** Use curbs?; There are slight curbs but these can unsettle if you hit them – best not to unless you absolutely have to (they have some camber helping hooking bike).
**Hazards / surface:** It’s off-camber exit again for T8 to T9. Because T8/9 is off-camber , it’s easy to spin up out of T9 – be ready.
**Common mistakes:** Mistakes in 7-9: going in too hot, which forces you to miss left apex and then you’re late to throttle at T9 – losing drive uphill.
**Overtake / passing:** If battling, a skilled rider might brake early and square T8 to block pass someone diving inside at 9. But passes here often slow both parties.

## BROADFORD_S07 — Turn 10 & 11 (Favorite “Twin Apex” Rights)
**Shape:** Double-apex
**Priority / what matters:** positively cambered. Many riders love these – lots of grip and you can carry big corner speed. Ideally, use all the track on entry and exit – a wide approach, not braking too hard but just enough to tuck the front in, then as soon as you lean, maintenance throttle then accelerate.
**Stable reference points:** Use up the exit – running out near curbing sets you up for Turn 12.
**Hazards / surface:** After accelerating uphill out of T9, you approach T10 – no heavy braking, just a roll-off and perhaps drop one gear . Turn 10: a sweeping right, goes uphill slightly and is banked – trust the grip and carry roll speed .
**Common mistakes:** Because T10-11 has so much grip, a common mistake is under-using it – accelerate harder!

**Priority / what matters:** chute. It’s quite tight and falls away – heart in mouth moment especially on worn tires. The exit is critical for start/finish speed.
**Stable reference points:** chute.; The exit is critical for start/finish speed.; There’s a wall outside track at exit – do not drift wide; if you think you will, straighten and go off rather than hitting the wall.
**Hazards / surface:** Approach: Slight crest as you turn – front gets light then you drop down. There’s a big elevation drop on exit – the bike might slide or the front push.
**Common mistakes:** Many final-lap passes happen by outbraking into 12 (not common, but possible if someone leaves door open) or by squaring off under someone in 12 and drag racing to the line. Mistakes: grabbing a handful of front on entry – weight off front going downhill leads to easy tuck.
**Overtake / passing:** Many final-lap passes happen by outbraking into 12 (not common, but possible if someone leaves door open) or by squaring off under someone in 12 and drag racing to the line. So ideally, finish overtakes earlier .
**Confidence:** Medium (auto-extracted summary; validate exact markers/lines).
