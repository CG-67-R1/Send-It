Starting out \nas  a single event but  evolving into  what \nis now a fortnight-long festival, the TT \nhas  a unique atmosphere as  thousands \nof fans flock to watch the fastest race \nbikes in the world compete against the \nbackdrop of the  stunning scenery of this \nbeautiful island, ranging from the  streets \nof the  capital, Douglas, to the  rugged \napproaches of Snaefell Mountain and to \npicturesque villages such as  Ballaugh \nand its famous bridge. Na other motor- \ncycle racing event offers a spectacie to \nmatch it. \nOver the years, average lap speeds \nhave increased from 40mph to a \nfearsome 130mph+, and lap times have \nshrunk from 45 to just under 17  minutes. \nThis comprehensive story of speed at \nthe TT Races looks at every aspect of \nhow those figures have been achieved: \nthe  irresistible attraction of ever more \npowerful motorcycles to competitors \nand spectators alike, the  greater soeeds \nthat have resulted, the technological \nadvances that have allowed power \noutput to increase from less than 10bhp \nin the  early days to over 200bhp now, \nthe  riders who have mastered those \nincreases, and the  development of the \nroads and the  race regulations that have \nalso played their part. \nAn  authoritative text supported by \nover 200 photos and maps covering \nevery era  of the TT,  make this  an \nessential addition to the  library of any \nmotorcycling aficionado. \nae \nLIBRARIES NI \nwr \nw \nN \nO \nO \n0) \nN \nOo \nOD \nO - \n249 2 -   LLOO0/ENS0¢ \nJa\\Se} \n: \n808s \n| \n| \n94} \nJe \npead \n01/11/2017 \nBertrams \nGIAVG LHOIMS \n\nSPEED arr \nTT RACES «=. \nFASTER \n>> \n>> \n>> \n>77>>) \n\n\n\nSPEED amu: \nTT RACES §:: \nAND \nFASTER \n2222393739393) > \nDAVID WRIGHT \nTHE CROWOOD PRESS \n\nFirst published in 2017 by \nThe Crowood Press Ltd \nRamsbury, Marlborough \nWiltshire SN8 2HR \nWww.crowood.com \n© David Wright 2017 \nAll  rights reserved.

For  two weeks, \nthe  roads that make up the  37% miles of the  famed Isle  of \nMan Mountain Course are given over to  top motorcycle \nracers, to  ride the  fastest bikes of the  day in pursuit of one \nof the  most highly coveted prizes in  motorcycle racing: a \nTourist Trophy. \nThis is the  way it has  been for  110  years, during which \ntime the  annual event has  evolved from a single race into a \nfestival of motorcycling. But  however varied the  interests \non  show, the  main reason for  the  high-octane atmosphere \nthat envelops the Island during those two weeks is  the \nunfettered spectacle of raw speed generated by racing over \nthe public roads of the  TT  Mountain Course. \nIt was the  opportunity to  break free from the  shackles \nof mainland Britain’s then 20mph speed limit and to  ride \nfaster than the  next man that brought the  first motorcycle \nTT to  the  Isle of Man in  1907. Recognized from the  outset \nas  being one of motorcycling’s greatest challenges, for over \na century the island has attracted the very best road racers, \nwhile successive generations of followers have crowded the \nroadside banks and marvelled at  the  way in  which riders \nhave gone ever faster at this unique event. \nIn  the  following pages you can read about the  attrac- \ntion of speed to  competitors and  spectators, and how faster \nmotorcycles have caused the time required to lap the Moun- \ntain Course to  shrink from 45  minutes to  under 17  min- \nutes. Also considered are  how changes to  the roads and the \nrules of racing have affected race speeds, plus the  many \nfactors in the  development of racing motorcycles that have \ncontributed to  lap speeds growing from an  average of just \nover 40mph to  well in  excess of 130mph. All  this is inter- \nwoven with the  history of the  event and will leave you in \nno  doubt that it is speed that has shaped most aspects of the \nnow legendary TT  races. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nA book like this cannot be written without assistance across \nmany areas and I am  grateful for  the  support provided by \nStan Basnett, David and Joan Crawford, Ralph Crellin, \nTony East, Geoff Judges, Paul Wright, Manx National Her- \nitage and the VMCC Library.

Through successive genera- \ntions of  TT  racing, spectators have marvelled as  riders have \nexhibited their skills and  courage over those public roads, \nwhile extracting maximum performance from their \nmachines. Each will have given their all, but  history \nconfirms that it has always been the fastest riders who \ncommanded the  most attention, received the  great- \nest  publicity and entered the  record books. \nMuch has  been written to  explain man’s wish to \ntravel ever faster, but just one  week after the first TT \nrace in  1907, when the  event faced criticism from \nsome quarters, The  Motor Cycle magazine neatly sum- \nmarized the  situation with the words: ‘It is useless to \nsay that fast speeds are  not  to  be encouraged, human \nnature being what it is.’ \nTop motorcycle racers have always demanded the \nvery best motorcycles to  ride and over a  century of \neffort has  now been committed to  developing more \npowerful racing engines, together with improved \ntransmissions, suspension, brakes, tyres, electrics \nand the like, all  with the aim of  putting better \nmachines into the hands of riders, to travel ever faster \naround the 37%4-mile lap of the TT Mountain Course. \nHas all that effort been successful? Well, in the  first \nrunning of the  race for  the  Tourist Trophy over the \nMountain Course in  1911, winner Oliver Godfrey \nthrilled spectators with speeds they had never before \nexperienced, as  he  rode his  clObhp Indian to  first \nplace at  a  race average speed of 47.63mph, reach- \ning perhaps 65mph in  the  process. In  2016 Michael \nDunlop \ndid \nexactly \nthe \nsame \nwith \nhis \n220-plus \nbhp \nBMW as  he  rode to  victory at  a  race average speed \nof \n130.68mph, \nwhile \nhitting \nclose \nto \n200mph. \nThat \nsimple \ncomparison \nreflects \nover \n100 \nyears’ \ngrowth \nin \npower \nand \nspeed, \nsubstantial \ntechnical \nprogress \nand \nan  awful lot of excitement. \nSt John’s \nCourse \n| OVIC  BATES Cartographer Ltd  2016 \nEARLY TT  RACES \nThe first Tourist Trophy race for  motorcycles was run in \n1907, over ten  laps of a  15'/-mile circuit in the  west of the \nisland called the  St John’s Course. \nIt presented a  challenge for  motorcycles of the  era, for \nthey were still in  an  early stage of development. Though \nbilled as  a  race, out  and  out  speed was not  the  main target \nTo  Ramsey \n© Kirk  Michael \n/Cronk-y-Voddy \nKnocksharry ) \n\\  f \n} \nLaurel Bank \nBallig Bridge \nsejinog oL \nTo  Castletown \nThis is the St John’s Course, used from 1907 to  1910. \n\n8  M  GATHERING MOMENTUM \nRiders tackle the sharp downhill turn at  Douglas Road \nCorner, Kirk Michael, on  the St John’s Course. \nof the  first event: in  words of the  day, the  Tourist Trophy \nrace was created ‘for the  development of the  ideal tour- \ning motorcycle’. To help achieve that ideal, machines were \nequipped with silencers, had to  carry a  specified mini- \nmum weight of tools, be  fitted with a  proper saddle and \nuse  touring-type mudguards. The regulation that had  most \ninfluence on  speeds, however, was the  one that specified \nfixed allocations of fuel for  the  race. This was limited to \n1 gallon for  every 90  miles of race distance for  single-cyl- \ninder machines and 1 gallon per 75  miles for  those with \nmore than one cylinder. For many competitors the  effect \nof that regulation was to  govern the  speed at  which they \ncould ‘race’, because trying to  run at  maximum throttle \nwould see  them use  up their fuel before completion of the \n158-mile total distance. \nAfter spending their practice sessions seeking the  right \nbalance between speed and economy, twenty-five riders \nlined up  in  front of the  historic Tynwald Hill at  St John’s \nto  start the  first TT. As  there were no  specified standards \nfor  riding gear, they turned out  in a selection of leather, \ntweed and oilskins. Wearing additional belts and pouches \nfor  spare parts and  sometimes a  spare inner tube over the \nshoulder, they probably looked a  motley crew, but  they \nwere courageous pioneers, for few would have ridden a race \nthat was anything like the  one that faced them on  28  May \n1907. Dispatched in pairs at one  minute intervals, all had to \nride with fuel consumption in mind; the amount remaining \nin each rider’s tank at the end was  measured and publicized. \nFastest rider on  a  twin-cylinder machine in  1907 was \nRem Fowler ona Norton. Suitably braced with ‘a glassful of \nneat brandy tempered with a little milk’ before starting, he \nreturned a  race average speed of 36.22mph, set  the  fastest \nlap of the  day at  42.91mph, and had a petrol consumption \nfigure \nof \n87mpg. \nFastest \nov \nerall \nand \nwinner \nof \nthe  \nnewly \ncreated \nTourist \nTrophy \nwas \nfirst \nman \nhome \non \na \nsingle- \ncyl- \ninder \nmachine, \nCharlie \nCollier. \nOn \nhis \nfamily-built \nMatch- \nless, \nhe \nrode \nto \na \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nof \n38.22mph, \nwith \na \nfastest \nlap \nof \n41.81mph \nat \n94.5mpg. \nFowler had an  eventful race, with delays to  progress \ncaused by falling off twice, repairing a  front-wheel punc- \nture, changing several sparking plugs, tightening his  drive \nbelt twice and fixing a  loose mudguard. Such problems \nwere quite usual in  early TT  races, meaning that competi- \ntors needed to have mechanical skills as  well as  riding ones. \nIn contrast to  the many difficulties experienced by Fowler, \noverall winner Collier had a relatively trouble-free run  dur- \ning the  4 hours, 8 minutes and 8 seconds it  took him to \ncomplete the  first race for  the  magnificent silver Tourist \nTrophy, a gift to the organizers from the  Marquis de Mouz- \nilly St Mars. \nThe motorcycles used in  1907 were still recognizably \nderived from pedal cycles but  they were not  easy to  con- \ntrol. While trying to  race at  speed over poor road sur- \nfaces, riders had to  juggle levers to  achieve the  right bal- \nance between mixture strength, spark timing and throttle \nopening, whilst also remembering to  top  up  the  drip-fed \ntotal-loss lubrication system by  operating a  manual oil \npump at  regular intervals. The bikes were tall  with wide \nhandlebars, had  virtually no  springing and  possessed only \npoor brakes. Tyres were of a narrow 24-inch beaded-edge \nsection and were inflated to  high pressures to  help them \ngrip the  rims. Most lacked any  form of clutch or  gearbox, \nso  the  single gear chosen had to  be a  compromise between \nReady \nfor  \nthe \nfray \nprior \nto  \nthe \n1908 \nTT, \nCaptain \nSir \nRobert \nKeith \nArbuthnot, \nBt, \nshows \noff \nhis \nTriumph, \na \ntypical \nmachine \nof \nthe \nday. \n\ngaining \nthe \nbest \nspeed \non  \nthe \nflat \nwhile \nretaining \nthe \nability \nto climb \nhills \nand \nnegotiate \nsharp \nbends. \nThe \ndirect \ndrive \nfrom \nengine \nto  \nrear \nwheel \nwas \nusually \nby \nleather \nbelt. \nAs \nraces \nran \nover \nroads \nlittered \nwith \nhorseshoe \nnails \nand \nsharp \nstones, \npunctures \nwere \nfrequent. \nTop \nspeed \nwas \nsaid \nto \nbe \nabout \n65mph. \nConfirming that speed was important to  all  who took \npart in  the  first TT, the  Triumph Engineering Company \nLtd’s post-race advertising claimed that ‘The Triumph \nmade faster time than any machine in the race after deduct- \ning time lost for  repairing punctures’. However, the  Nor- \nton  Manufacturing Company Ltd countered with an  adver- \ntisement saying ‘The fastest machine in the Tourist Trophy \nwas the  Norton twin, in  spite of misleading statements to \nthe  contrary’. \nGETTING FASTER \nPedals, previously used for starting and to aid hill-climbing, \nwere banned for  1908. That had little effect on  race speeds, \nbut  the  elimination in  1909 of the  fixed petrol allowance \nand the  freedom given to  run without silencers certainly \ndid, because it allowed for  full  throttle all the  way, where \nmachine and road conditions allowed. This meant that as \nwell as  meeting the  need for  speed, riders could satisfy \nanother aspect of human nature —  trying to  defeat their fel- \nBallacraine \nwas \napproached \nfrom \nthe \nopposite \ndirection \nin \nthe \nearly \nTT  \nraces. \nIn  \n1910 \nthe  \norganizers \nramped \nthe \noutside \nof \nthe \ncorner \nto \nhelp \nthe \nsingle-speed \nmachines \nmaintain \nmomentum \nfor \nthe \nclimb \nthat \nfollowed \nup \nto  \nBallaspur. \nNot \neveryone \ngot \nit \nright \nand \nthere \nwere \nspills. \nHowever, \na \ndoctor \nfrom \nPeel \nwas \non \nhand \nand \nhis \ncar \ncan \nbe \nseen \nhere, \nparked \non \nthe \ncourse \nand \nwith \nthe \nhandles \nof \na \nstretcher \nsticking \nout \nof \nthe \nwindow. \nGATHERING MOMENTUM #9 \nlow riders. Asaresult, Harry Collier (brother of 1907 win- \nner  Charlie) brought his  Matchless home in  a  time almost \n25  per  cent faster than previous winners, pushing the  race \naverage speed up to  49.01mph and  setting the  fastest lap of \n52.27mph. That was a huge increase from the previous fast- \nest  lap of 42.91mph and  provided an  early example of how \nrule changes can  impact on  race speeds. \nThe speeds achieved in  1909 may not  sound fast  to  cur- \nrent TT  fans, but  they would have impressed those who \nsaw and read about them. The maximum speed allowed \non  the  roads of Britain at  the  time was  20mph (14mph on \nthe  Isle of Man), and with a low level of vehicle ownership, \nfew people had any  experience of what it was like to  travel \nat  60-plus mph. They would have been in justifiable awe of \nthose early racers. \nA  force to  be  reckoned with in  the  early years of TT \nracing, past winners Charlie and Harry Collier took their \nMatchless machines to  first and second places at  the 1910 \nTT, although it was Harry Bowen on  his  BAT who set  the \nfastest lap at  53.15mph, in  what turned out  to  be  the  last \nTT  to  be run over the  St John’s Course. \n1911: THE MOUNTAIN COURSE \nThe Isle  of Man Tourist Trophy races were organized by \nthe  Auto Cycle Union (ACU), who governed motorcycle \nsport in  most of Britain. In a  deliberate attempt to  hasten \nmotorcycle development, in particular to advance the adop- \ntion of variable gears, it moved the  races from the  St John’s \nCourse to  the  far  more demanding Mountain Course in \n1911. No  one could have realized what a  profound effect \nthat move would have on  motorcycle development over the \nnext 100  years, for the Mountain Course became a test-bed \nfor  almost every new design feature, with manufacturers \nconfident that if a  new development could withstand the \nrigours of a TT race, then it was  fit to  market to the general \npublic. \nEarly TT  meetings comprised just a  single race, with \nclasses for single- and multi-cylinder machines. But  in  1911 \ntwo separate races were run, carrying the  titles of Senior \nand  Junior, in  which singles and multis raced each other. \nThe multis (almost exclusively twins) were permitted to \nrun  with a greater engine capacity; for the  Senior they had \nan  upper limit of 585cc with singles limited to  500cc, while \nin the Junior, twins could be up to  340cc and singles 300cc. \nRace distances were five laps and 187’ miles for  Seniors \nand  four laps covering 150  miles for Juniors. \nMachines entered for  the  smaller class were considered \n‘Lightweights’ of the  day and  some manufacturers wanted \nto  retain pedals for the  race. However, determined to  spur \non  the  development of smaller machines, the  ACU refused \n\n10  M  GATHERING MOMENTUM \nTo ANDREAS S//To BRIDE \nGuthrie \nMemoria \nVerandah \nSnaefel ye «30m (1,300ft) \n2  o Bungalow Bridge \n( Se eee \nBungalow \n2,034fi \n31m \nBrahdywell ‘Hailwood Rise \nDuke's |/¥32nd Milestone \n\\\\  Windy Corner \n\\Haridley’s \n11thAtilestone \n(“oy ‘UX’S \nCronk-y-Voddy \nKeppel Gate Vv \nCreg Wylley’s \nGlen Helen \nBin\\Ballacraing._| \nae \nThe route of the TT Mountain Course. \ntheir request. Meanwhile, as  has always been the  case with \nthe Tourist Trophy meeting, other people had ideas on  how \nthe event should be run, with the motorcycle press floating \nthe  notion of a  minimum weight limit for  riders because \nthey believed that those of  small stature would gain an \nunfair advantage on  the  climb of the  Mountain. Indeed, \ntheir proposal was that any  rider weighing less  than 140— \n150lb (63—68kg) in full  riding gear should be barred from \nthe  event. There were dissenting voices on  other aspects, \ntoo; for  example, not  everyone agreed with moving the \nTT  to  the  Mountain Course. There were claims that the \nParliament Square \nWS = as \n*The 33rd \n34m \nKate’s Cottage 4 \ndescent from Snaefell would be \ndangerous, even though the real \nconcern for  most was the 1,400ft \n(430m) ascent of  ‘the Mountain’, \nparticularly as  the  iron engines of \nthe  day were known to  lose power \n= — \nwhen hot. \nWhen first used for motorcycles \nin  1911, the  Mountain Course over \nSnaefell (Snow Mountain) was  3712 \nmiles long and its route was almost \nthe  same as  today’s, except that on \nthe  outskirts of Douglas at  Cronk \nny  Mona, riders turned right and \nrode through Willaston to  reach \nthe  top  of  Bray Hill, rather than \ngoing via  Signpost Corner, Gover- \nnor’s Bridge and the  Glencrutchery \nRoad as  they do  today. The start \nand finish were located on  a flat \nstretch of road after the  bottom of \nBray Hill before it commenced its \ndescent to  the  Quarter Bridge. \nOn the approach to that first 1911 \nMountain Course TT it  became \nclear that most manufacturers had \naccepted the need for variable gears \nand examples of most of the  avail- \nable types could be  seen. A report \nof the  time told of ‘compound and \nSF's Bridge epicyclic gears in the  back hub  and \nand on  the  engine-shaft, counter-shaft \ngears, and  direct gears by means of \nexpanding engine pulleys with and \nwithout the  rear wheel moving in \n“DOUGLAS \n\\, \nBoe ~ \nunison to  maintain the correct ten- \nsion of the  belt’. \nAmong manufacturers taking \non  the  challenge of the new course \nwere \nTriumph, \nRex, \nScott, \nIndian, \nMatchless, \nHumber, \nForward, \nNorton, \nZenith, \nPremier, \nSinger \nand \nRudge- \nWhitworth. \nMost \nclaimed \nthey \nwere \nrunning \nstandard \ncatalogue \nmodels, \nbut \nthere \nwas \nalready \na \nrecognition \nof \nthe \nbenefit \nto \nsales \nfrom \nwinning \na \nTT, \nwith \nmuch \ntime \nand \neffort \nput \ninto \nthe \npreparation \nof \nthe \nmachines \nentered. \nThose \nwho \nsaw \nthe \ninsides \nof \nfactory-prepared \nmotorcy- \ncles \ntold \nof \ncomponents \npolished \nto \na \nmirror \nfinish \nwhile, \nto \ncope \nwith \nthe \nbumpy, \npotholed \ncourse, \nthere \nwas \naddi- \ntional \nbrazing, \nmuch \nuse  \nof \nsplit \npins \nand \nbinding \nwith \ninsu- \nlating \ntape. \n\nSPEEDS \nNo  \none \nreally \nknew \nwhat \nrace \nspeeds \nwould \nbe  \nachieved \nover \nthe \nnew \ncourse \nin 1911.There \nwere \npre-race \nreports \nthat \nthe \nfancied \nOliver \nGodfrey \nhad \nbeen \ntimed \nat \n80mph \non \nan \nIndian \nat \nBrooklands, \nbut \nhe \nwas \nprobably \nriding \na \nbike \nthat \nwas \nlarger \nthan \nthe \n585cc \nlimit \nset \nfor \ntwin-cylinder \nmachines \nat \nthe \nTT. \nIn \naddition, \nthe \npoor \nroad \nsurfaces \non \nthe \nisland \nwould \ncertainly \nreduce \nmaximum \nspeed \nfrom \nthat \nachieved \nat \nBrooklands’ \nconcrete \nbow]. \nAnother \nreport \ntold \nhow \npast \nwinners \nthe \nCollier \nbrothers \nhad \ntheirTT \nmachines \nready \nin \ngood \ntime, \nand \nCharlie \nwas \nsaid \nto have \nreached \n68mph \non \nthe \nroad, \nwith \nhis \nnew \nexpanding \nand \ncontract- \ning \nengine \npulley \ngiving \nratios \nof \nbetween \n3:1 \nto \n5:1. \nOf \nthe \n‘Lightweights’ \nin \nthe \nJunior \nrace, \nit \nwas \npredicted \nthat \na \nfew \nwould \nreach \n55mph \nand \nmany \n50mph, \nperhaps \nfaster \ndownhill. \nMeanwhile, \nthe \nIsle \nof \nMan \nauthorities \nhad \nbeen \ndebating \nwhether \nto increase \nthe \nisland’s \noverall \nspeed \nlimit \nfrom \n14 \nto \n20mph, \nbut \nfaced \nwith \ndifficulties \nof \nenforcing \neither \nfigure, \nit \nvoted \nto \nabolish \nthe \nlimit \ninstead. \nPre-practice reports on  the  condition of the  roads were \nnot  encouraging but have to  be judged by standards of the \ntime, for  the  surfaces were still ‘unmade’, being of rolled \nmacadam with no  tar  binding. It was clear from the  first \nlap of practice that the section from Ginger Hall to Ramsey \nwas in  very poor condition, as  was the  Mountain Road, \nwhich was strewn with loose stones and  was described by \nThe Isle  of Man Weekly Times as  ‘dreadful’. The same newspa- \nper urged that Bray Hill be swept before riders tackled it at \nwhat it said would be 70mph. \nPractice sessions were all  early morning and started \nfrom the  Quarter Bridge on  the  outskirts of Douglas. Per- \nhaps seeking to  minimize disturbance to  local inhabitants \naround the  course, the  ACU decreed that practice would \nbe allowed for just one  week prior to  racing in  1911. How- \never, after representations from the  traders and  hoteliers \nof Douglas, who sought to  maximize income from the TT, \nthis was extended to  two weeks of practice, all  of which \nBray \nHill \nin \nDouglas, \njust \na \nfew \nyears \nbefore \nuse \nin \nthe \nfirst \nMountain \nCourse \nTT \nin \n1911. \nWinner of the 1911 Junior TT, Percy Evans (Humber), \ntakes a tight line at the tricky Ramsey Hairpin. \ntook place over open roads. That decision to  extend the \npractice period was an  early example of peripheral com- \nmercial interests influencing the running of the TT, as  they \ndo to  this day. \nGiven the conditions in the first year of using the  Moun- \ntain Course, it is not  surprising that there were accidents \nto  riders during practice and, regrettably, the  TT  saw its \nfirst fatality when Victor Surridge fell  from his  Rudge at \nGlen Helen. \nBoth the  Junior and Senior TT  races of 1911 were held \nin  dry weather, with the  former run on  Friday, 30  June \nwith thirty-seven entries over four laps, and the  latter on \nMonday, 3 July with sixty-seven entries over five  laps. The \nman who rode to  victory in  the 150-mile Junior TT  was \nPercy Evans on  a  twin-cylinder Humber with belt drive \nand three-speed hub gear. He  averaged 41.45mph and set \nthe  fastest lap of 42.00mph, finishing well ahead of Harry \nCollier (Matchless) in second place. \nRacing bikes of the  day generally ran  with small-bore, \nstraight-through exhausts, which gave them a  crackling \nnote. Riders would also have been able to  hear a  regular \nslap-slap from their belt drives, sundry clickings from the \nexposed valve gear and usually a  loud knocking from the \nengine when it was put under load at low  revs. \nDISQUALIFICATION \nIn  the 1911 Senior race, the  two most fancied runners, \nCharlie Collier and French-Canadian ace  Jake de  Rosier, \nbattled closely for  the  lead on  the  first few  laps, until de \nRosier fell  at  Kerromoar. Limping in  to  what was then \nnamed the  Ramsey Depot (what we  now call  the  Pits, of \nwhich there was another at  Braddan Church), de  Rosier \nborrowed tools to  fix  his  Indian and, although he rode on \nto  the  finish, he  was disqualified for  what the  organizers \nclassed as  ‘receiving outside assistance’. \n\n12  M  GATHERING MOMENTUM \nJake de  Rosier urges his  Indian through Stella Maris as  he \nleaves Ramsey to  commence the Mountain climb in  1911. \nMeanwhile, Collier and his  twin-cylinder JAP-engined \nMatchless were eventually beaten into second place by \nOliver Godfrey on  his two-speed, chain-driven, twin-cyl- \ninder Indian. The latter’s average race speed was  47.63mph, \nwhile the  fastest lap  went to  Frank Philipp (Scott) at \n50.1lmph. Thus the 1911 event established the  first race \naverage speeds and fastest lap  speeds for  the Mountain \nCourse, so  offering a  target for  future years and causing \none  publication to  speculate ‘is  a 6(0mph or  even a  70mph \nTT possible in the future?’. \nMention has  been made of Jake de  Rosier’s disqualifi- \ncation and, although Charlie Collier was initially credited \nwith second place, he  too  was disqualified. In  his  case it \nwas for taking on  fuel at  other than the  authorized depots \nat  Ramsey and  Braddan. \nDe  Rosier was probably the  top racer in North America \nat the  time while Collier held a  similar position in Britain, \nso the serious penalties incurred by those star  riders showed \nhow important it  was to  be  fully prepared for  a  TT  race \n—  in  all  respects. De  Rosier’s Indian would undoubtedly \nhave received the most careful mechanical preparation, but \nfailure to  secure his  tool-bag properly meant that he  lost \ntools during the  race and thus had to  borrow some when \nhe  stopped at  Ramsey, so  leading to  his  disqualification. \nQuite how past-winner Collier managed to miscalculate on \nfuel and thus be forced to borrow some at Ballacraine is not \nknown, for he was  such an  experienced racer. However, it \nis worth mentioning that the  TT  was still the  only race of \nits  kind run  in  Britain. Collier had  taken part in point-to- \npoint road races on  the  Continent, but  in  Britain his  only \nopportunities to  race were on  some of the  larger boarded \ncycle-tracks, in relatively short hill-climbs, at the concrete \nspeed bowl of Brooklands, or,  if he had chosen to,  in  the \noccasional sand race. \nBoth of the  1911 races provided victories for twin-cylin- \nThe intrepid Charlie Collier speeds over Ballig Bridge on \nhis  Matchless. \nder  machines, and  the  fact  that they were fitted with vari- \nable speed gearing was no  doubt to  the  satisfaction of the \norganizing ACU. Yet while the event as  a whole was  consid- \nered a  success, and  manufacturers learned valuable lessons \nfrom it, many of them were far  from happy with the  still \nyoung Isle  of Man Tourist Trophy meeting. \nal +30 eee Ss  baal THE MOTOR CYCLE. ise ee > \n“THE INEVITABLE \"sum \na, ae \nTOURIST TROPHY Ri as \na \n* ‘A FOREGONE “CONCL USIO \na To  all  who knew THE SUPERB \nQUALITY of these ee Tyr \nist \nDAY  \n(Junior \nTourist \nTrophy): \n3s \n-P.J. \nEVANS \nona \npete \n\"FH \n & \n2nd \nDAY \n(Senior \nTourist \n' \nTro \nEe \nSe \n©. \n6 \nGODFREY \n- \non \nan \n“a \n_ \nff \nAt \nthe \nSpeed \nTrials, \npe \n{2 \nCOD... \nBolton, \non \na. \nMartin: \n2 \nial \n; \nTyres, \nwon  \nthe \nflying \nsma \nacco \nhe \n» \n= \nim \n39 \nseconds. \nWnite for Booklet, \"Tha History Bi ‘the  Motor i: post fi \n|   \nCONTINENTAL \nTYRE \n&  \nRUBBER \n| \nae \nral \n, \n- \nPl \nos \nTHURLOE \nPLACE, \nre \na \n¥ \nBIRMINGHAM. \nBRISTOL. \nDUBLIN. \nGLASGO \nnoe \naS \n= \nz  \n* \nIm  \nanuwering \nhis \ndeertivement \nit \nia \ndesirable \n$5 \niention \npce \n—e \nTeh \nThe \nContinental \nTyre \nand \nRubber \nCo. \n(GB) \nLtd \nadvertised \nthe \nsuccessful \nuse \nof \nits  \nproducts \nby \nJunior \nand \nSenior \nwinners \nof \n191. \n\n1912: DISCONTENT \nSoon \nafter \nthe \n1911 \nTT, \nmanufacturers \nvoiced \ntheir \ndis- \npleasure \nwith \nthe \nevent. \nMany \nand \nvaried \ncomplaints \nwere \naired: \nthat \nthe \nMountain \nCourse \nwas \ndangerous, \nthat \nthey \ndid \nnot \nlike \ntwin- \nand \nsingle-cylinder \nmachines \ncompeting \nin \nthe \nsame \nrace, \nthat \nthe \noriginal \nconcept \nof \nusing \ntour- \ning \nmachines \nwas \nbeing \nlost, \nthat \nit \nwas \nexpensive \nto \ntake \npart \nin, \nthat \nit \ninterrupted \nproduction \nat their \nfactories, \nto \nname \nbut \na \nfew. \nGiven \nthe \nconcerted \nnature \nof \nthese \ncom- \nplaints, \nit \nseems \nthat \nthese \nwere \nnot \njust \nthe \nusual \ngripes \nfrom \nbad \nlosers \nbut \nreal \nconcerns. \nSuch \nwas \nthe \nstrength \nof \ntheir \nfeelings \nthat \nthe \nmajority \nsigned \na \nbond \nnot \nto \ntake \npart \nin \n1912, \nwitha \nfinancial \npenalty \nfalling \non \nanyone \nwho \nbroke \nits \nterms. \nNot all  manufacturers were party to  that bond, The \nScott Motorcycle Company and H.  Collier &  Sons Ltd \n(makers of Matchless machines) being amongst those who \nrefused to  sign, but  it left  the  ACU to  run an  event that \nwould be mostly made up of private runners. Having previ- \nously relied on  the  entry fees and voluntary contributions \nfrom manufacturers to  help fund the running of the  event, \nthis was a real blow to  the  ACU and could easily have fin- \nished the TT  after just one year’s running on  the Mountain \nCourse. To its credit, the ACU decided to take the financial \nrisk and go ahead with the  1912 races. \nSales of motorcycles were booming and in  a  crowded \nmarket, with little other than the  views expressed in  the \nfew motorcycling magazines of the day to go on,  the buying \npublic still looked for honest pointers as  to  which machines \nto  buy. TT  results could help provide those pointers. \nA FRENCH TT? \nEven today the Isle of Man TT races cannot be run  without \nthe  annual approval of Tynwald, the  Manx government, \nand the  ACU were kept waiting for  that approval for  the \n1912 races. Perhaps in  an  attempt to  provoke a  decision, \nthe  motorcycle press wrote about how easy it was to  get \npermission to  run  road races in France and  that, for many, \nit would actually be simpler to  get there rather than to  the \nIsle of Man! This notion began to  build momentum and \neven found support in the French motorcycle press. In Janu- \nary 1912 the  ACU decided to  write to  the  Manx authori- \nties and press for  a  decision. If an  early response was not \nforthcoming, it resolved ‘to  communicate with one  of the \nprincipal French motorcycle clubs with a  view to  holding \nthis \nimportant \nevent \nin \nFrance’. \nTynwald’s \napproval \nwas \nreceived before the  end  of the  month. \nREDUCED ENTRIES \nCome \nthe \nclosing \ndate \nfor \nentries \nto \nthe \n1912 \nTT \nand \nthose \nGATHERING MOMENTUM #13 \nfor  the  Senior totalled forty-nine, while for  the  Junior it \nwas  twenty-six. Comparative figures from 1911 were sixty- \nseven and  thirty-seven, showing the  effect of the  manufac- \nturers’ boycott. Sadly, racing had  taken its  toll  on  some of \nthe previous year’s top Indian riders, for Jake de Rosier was \nlying badly injured in a  Los  Angeles hospital, while Moor- \nhouse (third in  1911) had  been killed at  Brooklands. The \ndanger of practising on  open roads, as  all TT  sessions were, \nwas brought home to  riders after John Gibson, ‘travelling \ndown Bray Hill at  a  good speed’, collided with a  car  that \nbacked out  of a side road into his path. Gibson survived the \ncrash, but was injured. \nThere was nothing radically new in  design-wise for  the \nmachines entered for  1912, but  one important change to \nthe  regulations saw the  upper capacity limit for the  Senior \nrace set at 500cc and for the Junior 350cc. This meant that, \nfor the  first time, single- and  twin-cylinder engines would \ncompete on  level terms in each race. Entrants in the  Senior \nwere chasing a first prize of £40 and  for  the  Junior it was \n£30. In addition, gold medals were awarded to the winners \nand to  any  other rider finishing within 30  minutes of the \nwinner’s overall race time. \nCourse conditions in  1912 were much the same as  in pre- \nvious years, although the island had gained its first stretch of \ntar-sprayed macadam on  the  short straight between Quar- \nter  Bridge and  Braddan Bridge on  the outskirts of Douglas. \nQuarter Bridge itself had been widened considerably, as had \nthe  Hall Caine bends, which were now described as  ‘all \nout’. Hall Caine was a  renowned author who lived some 6 \nmiles from the  start at  Greeba Castle, which is how those \nbends are  known today. \nWET \nIt was difficult to  gain real pointers to  riders’ form during \npractice in  1912, for  several of the  sessions were affected \nby rain, making the roads muddy and riding conditions dif- \nficult. Come race day, riders in the Junior faced torrential \nrain at the start of their race, which eased and then stopped \non  the  second lap. \nVery wet conditions at  Quarter Bridge for  Harry Bashall \n(Douglas) in the  Junior TT  of  1912. \n\n14  M@  GATHERING MOMENTUM \nThis was the  first TT  to  be held under really wet condi- \ntions, and  as  well as  affecting the  course, it offered a chal- \nlenge to  the  waterproofing of magnetos and plug leads. \nUnfortunately, some machines were found wanting in \nthose areas, leading to  early retirements. To  add  to  rider \ndifficulties, the exposed belt drives used by most machines \nwere prone to slip when coated with road mud and this had \nthe  effect of reducing speed, particularly on  hills. \nFastest man proved to  be  Harry Bashall on  his  Doug- \nlas; as  an  indication of the  difficult conditions, he stopped \neight times during the race to give attention to his machine. \nBashall’s race average speed was 39.65mph, which was a \ncommendable figure when compared with the previous \nyear’s winning average speed of 41.45mph in the  dry. Fast- \nest  lap was by second-placed man Eric Kickham, also ona \nDouglas, at 41.76mph. There were just eleven finishers out \nof twenty-one starters. \nSINGLES OR TWINS \nAt  the  previous year’s TT, twin-cylinder machines had a \ncapacity advantage over the singles and were victorious in \nboth races. The question for  1912 was how would twins \nfare against singles now that they were on  equal capacity \nterms. By taking the first two places in the Junior race, the \nDouglas concern showed that twins were still front run- \nners, but how would the big bikes do? \nConditions for the Senior TT held on Monday, | July were \nbetter than for the  previous Friday’s Junior race, although \nthere was rain before the  start, the  wind was strong and \nthere was some mist over the  Mountain, where wander- \ning sheep were said to  be  troublesome.

Not everyone made the finish and \nthe  post-race reports tell  of falls, valve troubles, fuel dif- \nficulties, fires, punctures and failure of other components. \nDRIVE BELTS \nThese were mostly of leather, one  reason being that it had \nplenty of ‘give’ and was thus able to  cushion some of the \nshocks imposed by each firing stroke. Prone to  slip in  wet \nand  muddy conditions, belts also had  a  tendency to  stretch \nand to  snap their fastening links. Riders carried repair kits \nto  deal with such problems. \nWhile chain drives tended to stretch less than belts, most \nriders liked to subject new chains toa lap of the course before \nusing them in  a  race, thus taking out  some of the  stretch. \nOnce stretched, a  metal chain stayed stretched. Users of \nleather belts also liked to  stretch them before a  race and \nhaving done so  they would remove them from the machine \nand \nhang \nthem \nup \nwith \na \nsubstantial \nweight \nattached. \nThis \nwas \nto \npreserve \nthe \nstretch, \nfor \nleather \nwould \ngradually \nshrink \nback \ntowards \nits \noriginal \nlength \nwhen \nnot \nloaded. \nBRAKING \nEarlier \nmention \nwas \nmade \nof \ndrive \nbelts \nslipping \nunder \n| \nmuddy \nconditions. \nThis \nwas \nmostly \ndue  \nto  \nmud \ngetting \non \nthe \ndummy \nrim \nof \nthe \nrear \nwheel, \nwhich \nthe \nbelt \nwas \ntry- \ning \nto \ndrive, \nand \non \nthe \nengine \npulley. \nThat \ndummy \nrim, \nsometimes \ncalled \nthe \nbelt \nrim, \nwas \nalso \nused \nfor \nthe \nbasic \nslowing \nprocess, \na \nblock \nof \nfriction \nmaterial \nbeing \npressed \n\nTypical rear-wheel arrangement \nshowing the dummy rim and multi-link \nleather drive belt. The basic rear brake \nis also visible. \nagainst it  by operation of a  brake pedal. \nAgain, mud on  the  dummy rim reduced \nbraking effect, just adding to the difficulty \nof racing in the  wet. With the  same tyres \nused in all weathers, poor conditions also \nincreased the danger of  losing adhesion \nand  creating what riders of the  day called ‘sideslip’. \nMachines were fitted with two brakes, the  second usu- \nally being of the horseshoe or  stirrup shape that utilized two \nbrake blocks bearing against the wheel rim  —  like  the pedal \ncycles of the time —  and  could be on  either the front or  back \nwheel. It was a time when riders were cautious about using \nthe  front brake, but  even when used together, the  brakes \noffered limited stopping power to  reduce speed for  cor- \nners, or  to  control the  descent to  Creg ny  Baa, which was \ndescribed as  ‘the sharpest pull-up on  the  course’. Brakes of \nthe time were not progressive in action, having a  tendency \nto  ‘grab’ and induce skidding, but some must have been \nbetter than others, for  a  report from the  1912 Senior race \nobserved: ‘the Triumph riders approached the bends much \nfaster than the majority, relying absolutely on  the efficiency \nof their brakes in the last  50 yards to steady their breakneck \nspeed’. \nIn  addition to  using their brakes, riders sought to  aid \nthe slowing process by making use of the  valve-lifter on \nthe  approach to  corners. By pulling a  lever they lifted the \nexhaust valve off its  seat and  broke the  seal to  the  combus- \ntion chamber. This largely negated the  effect of the  firing \nstroke and thus reduced drive. As they rounded the corner, \nthe  lever would be  released and the  exhaust-valve would \nrevert to  normal operation. \n1913: ENDURANCE \nEarly TT  races were a  test of endurance and Frank Apple- \nbee had to ride for almost 4 hours to take victory in the five- \nlap Senior TT  of 1912, with lesser riders in  the  saddle for \nmuch longer; some had to be helped from their machines at \nthe  finish. In a continuing quest to  push motorcycle devel- \nopment and reliability, the TT organizers shocked everyone \nwhen \nthey \nannounced \nthat \nthe \nSenior \nTT \nof \n1913 \nwould \nbe \nover \nseven \nlaps \nand \nthe \nJunior \nover \nsix. \nFortunately, \nthey \nrecognized \nthe \nextreme \ndemands \nthis \nwould \nput \non \nriders \nand \nso \nsplit \neach \nrace \ninto \ntwo \nsessions. \nTwo \nlaps \nof \nthe \nJunior \nwere \nrun \non \nthe \nWednesday \nmorning, \nafter \nwhich \nSq 7 \n4 \nthe machines were locked away under ACU control and the \nSenior runners did  three laps. After a  day’s rest, the  riders \nthen rode their remaining four laps on  Friday. The event \nhad recovered its  popularity with manufacturers by 1913 \nand those that were left  from a combined original entry of \n148  rode together on  the  Friday, with Seniors identified by \nred  waistcoats and Juniors wearing blue. \nOverall victory in  the 1913 Junior TT went to  Hugh \nMason (NUT-JAP), who despite spending most of  the \nprevious week in  hospital after a  practice crash, lifted the \naverage race speed to  43.75mph and set  the  fastest lap of \n45.42mph. As in  1912, Senior victory went to  a two-stroke \nScott, this  time with “Tim’ (H.O.) Wood aboard. His  race \na ai ie ears) iN    ACS \nW.F. Newsome took second place in the 1913 Junior \nTT  on  his  Douglas, after racing for  5 hours, 9 minutes \nand 20 seconds. He  rode a  Rover in the Senior race and \nBicycling News and Motor Review wrote: ‘He sustained a \nbadly-gashed tyre two miles from the depot; he  walked \nand ran there, obtained a  new cover, and ran and walked \nback, fitted the tyre, and finished —  enabling the Rover \nteam to  win the team prize’. \n\n16  HM  GATHERING MOMENTUM \naverage was fractionally less  than Applebee’s in  1912, but \nhe  broke Godfrey’s lap record from 1911, increasing it \nfrom 50.11mph to  52.12mph, in  noticeably better riding \nweather. Spectators, and  most of those who read about the \nraces, were pleased to  see  the  lap record broken by a hand- \nsome 4 per  cent, but  it induced a  magazine of the  day to \npublish an  article titled ‘Slowing Down the  Senior Tourist \nTrophy’. Interestingly, a  read of the  article revealed that \nwhile the  title was a  recognition of some peoples’ views, \nthe  writer was of the  opinion that, ‘figures seem to  show \nthat the limits of speed fixed by the roads and by the engine \ndimensions have already been reached in the  Senior event’. \n1914: NEW FACES \nFor  the  1914 races, the  start was moved to  the  top of Bray \nHill, where temporary pits, grandstand and scoreboards \nwere erected. It  was a  year when crash helmets became \ncompulsory for the record entry of 159  and  one  where two \nnew marques joined the  list  of TT  winners, as  Eric Wil- \nliams took an  AJS to  race and  lap records in the Junior and \nCyril Pullin piloted a  Rudge to  record-breaking victory in \nthe  Senior. Tim Wood (Scott) was  credited with the  fast- \nest  lap in  the  Senior, breaking his  own record from 1913, \nwith a speed of 53.50mph and, in an  unusual occurrence, \npast winner Oliver Godfrey (Indian) tied  for second place \nwith newcomer Howard Davies (Sunbeam). TT  watchers \nnoted that both victories in  1914 went to  single-cylinder \nmachines. This was a  contrast to  previous years, when \ntwin-cylinder machines had prevailed, although the  fast- \nest  lap and  second places by Wood and Godfrey on  twins \nshowed they were still  a  force to be reckoned with. \nHANDLING \nA recurring theme at  the  TT  during the  years running up \nto  the  outbreak of the  First World War in  1914 was that \nalthough manufacturers were increasing engine outputs \nIn  1914 the  start was moved to  the  top of Bray Hill, where \nEric Williams (AJS) is shown finishing the Junior race. \nand \nthus, \nin \ntheory, \nspeeds, \nthe \npoor \nroad \nconditions \nmeant \nthat \nriders \nwere \nunable \nto \nuse \nthe \nfull \n10—12bhp \navailable \nto \nthem. \nThose \nwho \nstudied \nthe \nhandling \nof \nmachines \nover \nthe \npotholed \nand \nloose \nsurfaced \nroads \nmet \nwith \nin \nTT \nrac- \ning \ncould \nsee \nthat \nsome \nmakes \nhandled \nbetter \nthan \nothers. \nThis \nresulted \nin \ngreater \nattention \nbeing \ngiven \nto \nframe \nand \nfork \ndesign, \nto \nimprove \nhandling \nand \nallow \nriders \nto \ntravel \nmarginally \nfaster \nover \nthe \npoor \nroads. \nIt \nwas \nan \nearly \nles- \nson \nfor \nmanufacturers \n— \nwhich \nwould \nbe \nrepeated \nmany \ntimes \nover \nthe \nnext \ncentury \n— \nthat \nengine \npower \nover \nthe \nTT \nMountain \nCourse \ncounted \nfor \nlittle \nwithout \ncomparable \nroad-holding. \nSPEED SELLS \nWhether the  phrase ‘Speed Sells’ was in  use  in  the  early \ndays is not  clear, but  manufacturers were certainly aware \nthat speed was a plus factor and used it in  their advertis- \ning. Many of them added a  “TT Model’ to  their catalogues, \naimed at buyers who desired a machine resembling a racer, \nwith slightly downturned handlebars, sometimes a little \nengine tuning and usually a premium on  the purchase price. \nNot all such machines would have been from manufacturers \nwho had actually contested the TT, but a report told that by \n1914: ‘It is the  exception to  peruse a  catalogue which does \nnot  list a TT  model’. However, another report described \nmost manufacturers’ TT  models as:  ‘merely his  standard \nmount masquerading under false colours’. \nDespite the general wish to go faster, the poor road con- \nditions over the Mountain Course limited the growth in TT \nlap speed in the period 1911-1914 to just over 3mph, going \nfrom 50.11mph to  53.50mph. \nSoon after the 1914 TT the development of  racing \nmotorcycles was put  on  hold, as  major nations spent four \nyears fighting the  First World War. Indeed, it was to  be six \nyears before racing for a Tourist Trophy returned to the Isle \nof Man. \n—— —— = it \nNorton \npushed \nthe \nSpeed \ntheme \nin \nthis \nadvertisement \nfor \nits \n‘TT \nModel’. \n\nGEUMP | ERE TWO \nA  Sele BION IDS ODE \nWhen the First World War ended in  November 1918, \nmanufacturers gave priority to  the production of motorcy- \ncles for road use, so  racing had  to  wait its  turn. It was the \nsummer of  1920 before the  sound of racing motorcycles \nonce again reverberated around the  Mountain Course. \nDEVELOPMENT \nThe concentrated efforts put  into war usually accelerate \ndevelopment in  specific areas and 1914—18 saw consider- \nable advances in aero-engine design, often on  a no-expense- \nspared basis. With similarities in the performance needs of \naero and motorcycle engines, such as light weight combined \nwith low fuel consumption, high output, reliability, acces- \nsibility and so  on,  there was speculation on  how post-war \nmotorcycles might benefit from wartime advances in aero- \nengineering. Surprisingly, the  answer given by some well- \nregarded names was  along the  lines of  ‘not  a  lot’. James \nNorton, of Norton Motorcycles Ltd, explained that ‘aero \nproduction methods could not  be applied profitably to  the \nmotorcycle industry’, while George Stevens of A.J. Stevens \n&  Co. Ltd, makers of AJS, opined: ‘I cannot say  that the \nexperience gained during the  war has  helped manufactur- \ners  in  the  matter of improved general design, but  it will \nundoubtedly result in better and improved methods of con- \nstruction.’ \nA  strike of  moulders in  early 1920 threatened both \nnormal production and the racing plans of many firms. \nAs  early as  February, some realized that they would not \nbe  able to  compete at  the TT due to  the effects of  the \nstrike, while firms like Triumph and Zenith —  with full \norder-books —  continued to  concentrate on  production \nof roadsters, rather than divert efforts to  the  preparation \nof machines for racing. BSA, Ariel, Scott and  Rudge were \namong others not  making works entries, but  there were \nwhispers that some of those non-contenders lobbied for \nthe TT not to  be  run in  1920, perhaps because they \nrealized that their actions would lose them the chance \nof a  prestigious TT  win. Fortunately their efforts failed \nand  the  good news was that there were several new com- \npanies who intended to  enter. In  addition, there were \nprivate runners ready to  challenge the  Mountain Course, \neven though some would surely have been put off  by \nthe  £21 entry fee  —  a substantial sum, equivalent to  some \n£850 today. \nadvertisement \nfrom \n1919 \nreminded \npotential \nbuyers \nof \nAJS’s \nearlier \nTourist \nTrophy \nsuccess \nand \nracing \npedigree. \n\nAn  early shot of Ballig Bridge.

Reporting \non  an  inspection lap a  month later, The  Motor Cycle claimed \nthat, ‘with the  exception of a  few  short stretches, it is in a \nsafe and satisfactory condition for  the  forthcoming race’. \nHowever, when ACU Secretary, Tom Loughborough, vis- \nited the  Island in  late April, he was not  so  impressed with \ncourse conditions. He felt that while much of the going was \njust about acceptable for  racing, the  stretch from Ginger \nHall to  Ramsey was in  such a  deplorable state that, as  he \ninformed the  Manx authorities, if it was not  put into good \nrepair the  1920 races would have to  be abandoned. \nThere was a  change to  the  route of the  TT  course in \n1920: as  riders neared the  end of a  lap, they no  longer \nturned right at  Cronk ny Mona but  carried on  to  Signpost \nCorner, then went via  The Nook and Governor’s Bridge \nto  join the Glencrutchery Road, where a  new start, fin- \nish  and  pits  area had  been created just before St  Ninian’s \ncrossroads. In round figures, the  new lap distance became \nslightly longer at  37% miles. \nThere \nwas  \nalso \na \nsmall \ndiversion \nafter \nleaving \nParliament \nSquare \nin \nRamsey, \ndue \ntoa  \ndispute \nover \nthe \nuse  \nof \nwhat \nwas \na \nprivate \nstretch \nof \nroad \non \nthe \napproach \nto \nCruickshanks \nand \nMay \nHill. \nWELCOME THE LIGHTWEIGHTS \nAfter the  on/off scenario of the  previous few  months, the \nIsland welcomed the  first post-war TT  in  1920. It  came \nwith some sixty entries, almost evenly distributed between \nSenior and Junior races, which were scheduled for Tuesday \n15  and  Thursday 17  June. Early morning practising was \navailable for two weeks before, with riders warned: “‘Com- \npetitors should note that the  roads are  not  closed to  other \ntraffic during the times allotted to practising, and carts and \nother traffic may then be encountered’, \nIn  another slightly difficult-to-believe scenario, an \nappeal was made early in  practice for  anyone with a  spare \nACU-approved crash helmet to  offer it to  the  organizers, \nfor some competitors arrived on  the  island without one! \nIt was mentioned in  Chapter 1 how in  the  early days of \nthe  TT, 350cc machines were informally known as  Light- \nweights. For 1920, machines up  to  250cc were invited to \nrace in  a  class of their own within the  Junior (350cc) TT \nrace and  those 250s were given the  formal title of Light- \nweights. \nTo  qualify to  race, each competitor had to  complete a \nminimum of six  laps in  practice, with at  least one being \ncovered within 1 hour by Seniors, within one  hour and 10 \nminutes by Juniors and 1! hour 30 minutes by Lightweights. \nExtra safety \nstraps.

Post-war \nmotorcycle competition had recommenced with events like \nhill-climbs, long-distance trials, sand racing and  so  on,  but \nwith Brooklands not  having reopened until April 1920 and \na  dearth of other venues, real speed events were largely \nabsent, and speed and spectacle was what both riders and \nspectators sought. Many pre-1914 TT  riders had been to \nwar and some had  not  returned. Who would take a  win in \nthe  1920 TT was  difficult to forecast, for those pre-war rid- \ners  with course knowledge were now six  years older, while \nfor some of the  newcomers it would be  their first attempt \nat genuine road racing. \nPROGRESS? \nFor all the talk of war-time developments not being of much \naid to motorcycle design, everyone expected racing motor- \ncycles at the  1920 TT to be faster than those of 1914. Chain \ndrive and variable gears had become almost universal, while \nadvances in metallurgy allowed the use  of components that \ndid not suffer the same degree of  performance-robbing \nheat distortion as  in  previous years. Also, better produc- \ntion machinery permitted manufacture to  closer toleranc- \nes.  Aluminium alloy pistons were to  be  used by several \nmakes, overhead valves were being introduced, steel fly- \nwheels lightened and  bikes given a  lower overall build. All \nwere considered to  be  improvements that could enhance \nperformance. \nSo  \nwhile \nthose \nmanufacturers \nwith \nTT  \nentries \nin  \n1920 \nlike \nNorton, \nSunbeam, \nABC, \nDuzmo, \nIndian, \nAJS, \nBlack- \nburne, \nWooler, \nDouglas, \nDiamond, \nLevis, \nIvy, \namong \noth- \ners, \nhad  \ndone \ntheir \nbit \nfor \nprogress, \nwhat \nabout \nthat \nother \nvital \nconstituent \nof \nracing, \nthe  \nMountain \nCourse \nitself? \nAs \nA  SPEEDY DECADE @  19 \nCyril Pullin rounds the loose-surfaced Gooseneck on  the \nearly part of the Mountain climb. \nindicated above, it was  in no  better condition than in  1914, \nwith an  often loose and stony surface littered with multi- \nple potholes and ruts that could not  be  dodged, together \nwith particularly rutted and  rocky going along parts of the \nnarrow Mountain Road. That meant, once again, that in \nspite of manufacturers’ best efforts to  boost machine per- \nformance, course conditions would restrict speed in many \nlocations. \nThere had been pre-TT talk of  1920 race bikes with \n80mph performance, but hard information was difficult \nto  come by. In  the  secrecy of their own testing facilities, \nmanufacturers may have measured output in units of brake \nhorse power (bhp) as  we  do  today, perhaps seeing figures \naround the  15bhp mark, but the most commonly published \nratings were generic ones. All 500cc machines were classed \nas  34%2HP and 350 models as  274HP, with no  distinction \nbetween stages of engine tune or  any attempt to portray true \noutput. It was said that 500cc Sunbeam side-valve engines \nwere showing 5,000rpm on  the  bench, but  limitations in \nvalve gear performance would see  their peak power being \nproduced at  nearer 4,000rpm, or  less. Norton’s entries \nwere under the  care of Brooklands record-breaker D.R. \nO’Donovan, and while the  company maintained that its \nbikes were close to  standard, he calculated that they were \nachieving revs of 4,300 in  top down the  Mountain, which \nequated to  a  speed of 76mph. It was a time when any  bike \nwith a  compression ratio approaching 6:1  was regarded as \nhighly tuned. \nRACING RETURNS \nSix years after the last TT and following two  weeks of prac- \ntising to hone riding skills and prepare machinery, the com- \nbined field of Junior and  Lightweight competitors lined up \non  the  Glencrutchery road, ready to  be despatched on  five \nlaps and 18712 miles of racing over the  Mountain Course. \n\n20  M@  A  SPEEDY DECADE \nAJS brought what was the  nearest to  a  new engine to \nthe race. Of  350cc, it  had a  hemispherical combustion \nchamber, exposed pushrods and valve springs operating \noverhead valve gear, plus lightened piston and flywheels. \nTheir riders had four gears available to them and Roy Bacon \ntells how that was achieved with ‘a two-speed countershaft \ngearbox, the  choice of ratios being doubled up  by fitting \ntwo primary chains with a selector at the engine sprockets’. \nOverall machine weight was  claimed to be just 2171b (99kg) \nand output rated as  10bhp. The AJS offered a lively package, \nwhich allowed 1914 Junior winner, Eric Williams, to  leap \ninto the  lead of the  Junior race, with similarly mounted \nHoward Davies and ‘Harry’ Harris second and third. The \npace was hot  at  the  front, but  became too  hot  —  approach- \ning the  mid-point those first three dropped out, each with \nserious mechanical issues. Fortunately for  AJS, they had \nbeen able to  call up  second-place man in  the  1914 Junior, \nCyril Williams, as  a  late  replacement for a  rider injured in \npractice and  he took over and  built a substantial lead. \nAs he began his descent of the  Mountain on  the  last  lap, \nCyril Williams must have felt that victory was  his.  But noth- \ning is certain in TT  racing and  at  Keppel Gate he suddenly \nlost all drive. The remaining 4 miles to  the finish must have \nbeen a nightmare, as  he coasted downhill, struggled uphill \nand shoved manfully on  the  long stretch from Governor’s \nBridge to  the  finishing line. Aware that his  lead was being \neroded at  every step, he staggered over the  line exhausted \nand only just able to  take in that he had  held on  and taken \nvictory from Jack Watson-Bourne on  his  Blackburne. \nThe race and lap speeds told the  story of this dramatic \nrace, for  Cyril Williams’ average race speed of 40.74mph \nwas much slower than Eric Williams’ race speed of \nRonald Clark (Levis) leaves Sulby Bridge in a  cloud of \ndust. \n45.58mph \nback \nin  \n1914. \nIt \nwas \nEric \nwho \nset  \nthe  \nfastest \nlap \nin \n1920 \nbefore \nhis \nforced \nretirement, \nboosting \nhis \n1914 \nlap \nrecord \nfrom \n47.57mph \nto \n51.36mph. \nLevis two-strokes dominated the  new Lightweight class \nand took the  first three places. First of them was Ronald \nClark, who survived a spill near the Thirty-third milestone \nand whose fastest lap time was 43.00mph. This was an \nexcellent effort for  a  250, for  they were severely taxed by \nthe  Mountain climb, with some of their riders talking of \n‘foot-slogging’ around the  Gooseneck. \nTwo days later twenty-seven riders lined up for the six-lap \nSenior TT. It was pace-setter in practice, George Dance, on \nhis  Sunbeam who led  for the  first two laps, until forced to \nretire. Manxman Dougie Brown then led for the  next two \non  his Norton, before being reeled in by Sunbeam-mounted \nTommy de la Hay, who held the lead to the finish. This time \nrecords were set  in both race average speed and lap speed, \nthe former being lifted from 49.49mph to  51.48mph, while \nlap speed went up  from 53.50mph to  55.62mph, a figure \nset  by George Dance on  his  second lap. \nIt was a year when single-cylinder machines were victo- \nrious in all three races, despite the presence of V-twins and \nflat-twins in the  Senior and Junior classes. \nTOO FAST? \nEven with the less than fulsome support received from man- \nufacturers in  1920, the races were rated a success, although \none item that attracted post-race discussion was whether \nthe 500cc machines were too  fast for course conditions. The \nMotor Cycle was strident on  the issue, writing ‘engine capac- \nity must be reduced for future races. Machines of 500cc are \ntoo  fast for the  course’. It went on  to  advocate a maximum \ncapacity of 350cc for TT  race bikes. \nWhile people recognized that riders of 500cc machines \nwere not  always able to  use  full  power in  1920, what they \ncould not  know was that the  Isle  of Man would accelerate \nits road-surfacing programme through the early years of the \n1920s and  thus offer much improved conditions for racing. \n1921: THE ‘TRADE’ RETURNS \nManufacturers and their associated component suppli- \ners \nwere \noften \nreferred \nto \nin \nmotorcycling \ncircles \nas \n‘the \nTrade’. \nSome \nhad \nabstained \nfrom \nsupporting \nthe \n1920 \nTT, \nbut \nthey \nwere \nback \nin \nforce \nfor \nthe \n1921 \nevent. \nThis \nresulted \nin \nentries \nof \nsixty-five \nfor \nthe \nJunior \nrace \nand \nsixty-eight \nin \nthe \nSenior, \nwith \nten \nmanufacturer’s \nteams \nnominated \nfor \nthe \nJunior \nand \neight \nfor \nthe \nSenior \n— \na \nhealthy \nsituation. \nWith \nopportunities \nfor \ntrue \nroad \nracing \nlimited \nto \nthe \nIsle \nof \nMan, \nBritish \nmanufacturers \nknew \nthat \nthe \nTT, \nwith \nits \nlong \nlap \nof \nvaried \ngoing, \noffered \nthem \ntest \nand \ndevelop- \n\nment \nopportunities \nthat \ncould \nnot  \nbe  \nachieved \nelsewhere. \nAlso, \nin  \nits  \nown \nwords, \nthe  \norganizing \nACU \nconsidered \nit \nto  \nbe  \n‘the \nduty \nof \nthe \nCompetition \nCommittee \nof \nthe \nACU \nso \nto \nframe \ntheir \nconditions \nas \nto \nprovide \nsuch \na \nspur \nto progress \nthat \nthe \nmost \nlethargic \nof manufacturers \nmust \nrealize \nthat \na reputation \nmade \nneeds \nkeeping’. \nThe \nmotor- \ncycle \npress \nplugged \na \nsimilar \ntheme \nwith, \n‘the \ntechnical \nvalue \nof \nthe \nIsle \nof Man \nraces \nis \nenormous \nto \nany \nmanufac- \nturer \nwho \nis \ngenuinely \non \nthe \nlookout \nfor \nweak \nplaces \nin \nhis \nproduction \nand \ntheir \npossible \ncure’, \nThe aim of the  TT  was still to  aid  the  development of \n‘the ideal touring motorcycle’. Stripped-out racers were \nnot wanted and the  race regulations specified minimum \nweight limits for each class. In  1920 it was 132%lb (60kg) \nfor 500cc machines and  110'4Ib (50kg) for  350cc. \nWhile the  1920 TT had  come too  soon after the  war for \nsome manufacturers to  get organized to  race, a  year later \nmany of them had  their TT  machinery out  and  about early, \nwith reports of several teams visiting the  Isle of Man for \nunofficial testing in March and  April 1921. \nCOURSE CONDITIONS \nThe Manx Highway Board was tar-spraying more of the \nIsland’s roads, although most of its activities were confined \nto  the  towns and larger villages, with little done on  the \nroads that linked them. The 3774 miles of the  Mountain \nCourse were still largely of rolled macadam with its  cus- \ntomary potholes, ruts and loose material, meaning that in \ndry weather riders trailed dust clouds that rose to  hedge \nheight and lingered for minutes. Not only was  this unpleas- \nant  for all concerned, but it created a real danger for riders \nattempting to pass. In the wet the potholes filled with water \nAt \nan  \nearly \n1920s \nTT, \nBert \nLe \nVack \napplies \ntoo \nmuch \nthrottle \ntoo \nsoon, \non \nthe \nloose \nsurface \nof \nRamsey \nHairpin. \nA  SPEEDY DECADE @  21 \nthat could not  be avoided by anyone travelling at  speed, so \nmachine and rider got covered in  mud. \nIn  1921 the  Mountain Road was not  the  principal route \nbetween Ramsey and Douglas that it is today, as  most trav- \nellers took the  coast road. Little use  meant little mainte- \nnance and it showed —  so  much so,  that on  the  descent of \nthe Mountain there were places where the road surface \nwas the  natural bedrock, which was a  highly dangerous \nand  uneven surface to  race over. Fortunately the  Highways \nBoard offered to  blast the  rock away and create a  better \nsurface before racing commenced. As an  illustration of the \nrelatively poor wearing qualities of the  ordinary unbound \nmacadam road surfaces, a report from early May said, ‘the \nMountain Road is rather bad, but  will not  be repaired too \nearly in case of rain rendering further repair necessary’. \nTHE MACHINERY \nManufacturers approached the  1921 TT  with real enthusi- \nasm and there was a ‘buzz’ on  the approach to the event that \nenveloped everyone concerned, leading to  claims that they \nwere to  witness ‘the finest motorcycle races in history’. \nThe previous year’s Senior TT  winners, Sunbeam, were \nback with both side-valve (sv) and overhead-valve (ohy) \nmodels, but  decided to  use  their tried and tested sv  ver- \nsions in the race. Norton again claimed to  be running near- \nstandard models, which came with a  shortened wheelbase \nand lower build, aimed at  improving handling. They also \nhad  a  couple of experimental ohy  models, while advertis- \ning their 16H sv  model as  ‘undoubtedly the  fastest coun- \ntershaft-geared 3'2HP machine extant’. Triumph brought \n4-valve ohv engines and 2-valve side-by-side versions, but \ndecided to  stick to  their older sv  design for the  race. Scotts \nwere back with their two-stroke twins and were the  only \nmaker with water-cooled engines. \nIt was a  TT  debut in  works form for  the  sizeable BSA \nconcern, who entered six  riders on  new models in the  Sen- \nior.  These were fitted with an  inclined ohy engine incor- \nporating new design elements in the valve gear, mechanical \nlubrication and a  distinct low overall build. They received \nplenty of pre-race publicity and, after setting fast  times in \ntesting at  Brooklands, much was expected of them. \nAmongst the  entries for  the  Junior race, 1920 winners \nAJS returned with 350cc machines that were similar to  the \nones they used in  1920. They had  their cylinder heads and \nbarrels copper-plated to  aid heat dispersion, before receiv- \ning a customary coat of black. Pistons of the  day were full- \nskirted and often heavily perforated below the  rings. The \noverall trend was for  three-speed countershaft gearboxes, \nincreased use  of small internal-expanding brakes, plus a \nmixture of manual and  mechanical oil pumps. \n\n22° A  SPEEDY DECADE \nTHE RACING \nThere was  the  customary fortnight of practice to  sort rid- \ners  and machinery in  1921 and then the Junior race, where \nit was  no  surprise to  see  past winner Eric Williams ride to \nvictory on  his  AJS, 4 minutes ahead of similarly mount- \ned  Howard Davies and  Manxman Tom Sheard. The little \n‘Ajays’ were in a class of their own and  Williams set  a new \nrace record of 52.11mph, while Davies took the  fastest lap \nat  55.15mph, claiming his top speed was  just 73mph. \nWhile the AJS men were the heroes of the hour after the \nJunior, they were not  without challengers during the  race. \nJim  Whalley on  his  Massey Arran was  in  the  running for \nmost of the time, but on  the  last lap suffered a front-wheel \npuncture at Windy Corner and  took a heavy fall. Battered \nand bleeding, he  remounted and rode in  on  the  rim to  a \ngallant fifth place, with the  bike stuck in  second gear and \nthe  exhaust pipe scraping the ground. \nIn  the race for  Lightweights, run concurrently with \nthe  Junior, winner Doug Prentice (New Imperial) upped \nthe  average race speed to  44.61mph, while Bert Kershaw \nJUNE 30TR. 192f- \nThe fastest time \never made for \na   lap In any \nT.T. race \nhas just been accomplished by \nF.

Edmond on  a  “Triumph” \nfitted with a \n@, That engine fitments should be changed by competitors at  the  last  moment, \ncontrary to  the  makers’ own selection, is  opposed to  the  best interests of \nthe sport. \nThere wes  no  bonus distribution in  the  island of  Lodge plugs. \nLodge clearly felt  that speed sold sparking plugs. \n(New \nImperial) \nset  \na  \nnew \nlap \nrecord \nat  \n46.11mph. \nLevis \nand  \nVelocette \ntwo-strokes \nchased \nhome \nthe  \nwinning \nfour- \nstroke. \nWith speeds advancing in  the  smaller classes, two days \nlater it was down to  the  Seniors to  show what they could \ndo.  Again there was talk of 80mph potential from some \nSenior bikes, with Freddie Dixon claiming 85mph from \nhis  Indian, which was a  single-cylinder model with a rear- \ninclined cylinder. Destined to  ruffle a  few feathers, how- \never, was Howard Davies, who was down to  ride his  ‘73 \nmiles-an-hour’ 350cc AJS in the  Senior race against all the \nothers mounted on  500s. \nThe Senior got under way in good conditions and  spec- \ntators were treated to  the  usual variations in riding styles, \nparticularly when cornering. Most leant in,  while some, \nincluding Freddie Dixon, often leant out, although earlier \nfoot-down styles had now been dropped. But it was  the  sit- \nup and neat cornering style of Howard Davies and his little \n350cc AJS that won the day after six laps and  226” miles of \nracing, adding over 3mph to the average race speed to make \nit 54.50mph and leading home the Indians of Freddie Dixon \nand Bert le Vack. Fastest lap went to  Freddie Edmond (Tri- \numph) at  56.40mph. \nNot all of the new ideas and machinery that manufactur- \ners  bring to  the  TT  are  successful, but few  fail on  the  scale \nof BSA in  1921. The Birmingham concern’s TT  debut was \na disaster, for  none of its six machines finished the race. \nWith speeds advancing, there were ever more people \nwho maintained that the  500cc Senior machines were too \nfast for the Mountain Course, and with his lower-powered, \nneat-handling 350  taking a Senior victory in  1921, Howard \nDavies probably added fuel to  their argument. Perhaps \nreflecting the  discontent around the  topic, one magazine \npicked up on  post-race gossip and wrote, ‘there was  talk in \nthe  Island of arranging next year’s TT  on  French soil, and \nthere is much to be said  in support of the  suggestion’, Oth- \ners  talked of the races going to  Ireland. \nBOMBSHELL! \nWhat \nhad \nbeen \ngossip \nabout \nmoving \nthe \nTT \nfrom \nthe \nIsle \nof \nMan \ntook \non \na \nfar \nmore \nserious \ntone \nin \nAugust \n1921, \nwhen \nthe \nACU \nCompetitions \nCommittee \npublicized \nits \nrecom- \nmendation \nthat \nthe \n1922 \nTT \nraces \nbe \nheld \non \na \n30-mile \nroad \ncircuit \nat \nSpa \nin \nBelgium. \nMuch \ndiscussion \nfollowed \nin \nwhich \nmany \nclaims \nand \ncounter-claims \nwere \nmade. \nThe \nbalance \nof \nopinion \nseemed \nto \nfavour \nthe \nmove \nto \nBelgium, \nbut \nat \nits \nmeeting \nin \nOctober, \nthe \nACU \nGeneral \nCommit- \ntee \nmeeting \nrejected \nthe \nrecommendation \nof \nits \nCompeti- \ntions \nCommittee. \nThis \nwas \na \nsurprise, \nfor \nit \nreally \nlooked \nAS  \nthough \nthe  \nTT \nhad \nbeen \nlost \nto  \nthe  \nIsland. \n\nBelgium \nhad  \noffered \na \nfinancial \ninducement \nto  \nthe  \nACU \nto  \nmove \nthe  \nTT, \nwhich \nwas \nnot  \navailable \nfrom \nthe  \nIsle  \nof \nMan. \nIndeed, \nsome \nfelt \nthat \nthe \nIsland \nwas \nless \nthan \nwel- \ncoming \nto \nan \nevent \nthat \nboosted \nits \neconomy. \nBut \nthen, \nnot \nevery \nresident \nof \nthe \nIsle \nof \nMan \nwas \na \nfan \nof \nmotorcycle \nracing \nand \nits \nfollowers. \n1922: RETURN TOTHE ISLAND \nHarsh words had been spoken about the  Isle of Man by ele- \nments of the ACU during negotiations for moving the event \nto  Belgium and no  doubt bridges had to  be rebuilt with the \nManx authorities on  the run-up to  the  1922 TT. \nOver in  Manxland, tar-spraying of  roads was being \nextended out  of the  towns and the  place was described in \nlate April as,  ‘literally buzzing with steamrollers’. As far as \nthe  TT  course was concerned, it was  good news for riders \nto hear that the new surfacing now reached over 4 miles out \nfrom Douglas to  Crosby. \nIn a  small change of route, riders returned to  using the \noriginal private stretch of  road leading from Parliament \nSquare to  Cruickshanks Corner in Ramsey, which they had \nused up to  1914. It was  a change that must have saved time, \nfor  it was slightly shorter and eliminated a  couple of slow \ncorners. Also, what were described as  “big changes for the \nbetter’ had  been made on  sections of the  Mountain Road, \namongst them being substantial widening at Windy Corner \nand Keppel Gate. Everyone expected those improvements \nwould contribute to  faster lap speeds. \nEntries were slightly up in  1922, with thirty-two Light- \nweights, thirty-eight Juniors and sixty-seven Seniors, for \nwhich experienced top  riders like Davies, Dance, Dixon \nand Bennett were joined by three newcomers who were des- \ntined to go on  to  make TT history: Stanley Woods, Walter \nHandley and  Jimmy Simpson. The  last  admitted in  Racing \nThe \nsweeping \nleft-hand \nbend \nat  \nUnion \nMills, \nsome \n2/2 \nmiles from the start. \nJust eighteen years old  when this photograph was taken \nat the end of the 1922 Junior TT, Stanley Woods looks a \nlittle dazed. That is hardly surprising, for  with virtually \nno  racing experience and in his first TT, he  had just \ncompleted five mishap-strewn laps and 187  miles of the \nMountain Course, finishing in fifth place at an  average \nspeed of 50mph. \nReminiscences that his debut in  1922, ‘was the very first time \nI had ridden in a long-distance road race of any description’. \nThis was not  unusual, for apart from a few  races held over \nsomewhat shorter courses in  Ireland, there was nothing in \nBritain that offered riders the  type of road-racing experi- \nence that would be helpful in contesting the Isle of  Man  TT. \nDespite his lack of experience, Jimmy Simpson managed to \npersuade the  Scott concern to  provide him with a machine \nto race, while Stanley Woods talked the Cotton Motorcycle \nCompany into supplying him with a  machine. Woods had \ndone a lap when visiting the  TT  as  a spectator in  1921, but \nneither Simpson nor  Handley had been around the  course \nbefore setting out  on  their first lap of official practice. With \nSimpson it showed when he fell off near Governor's Bridge, \nthen ignored signals to  stop. Handley made TT  history by \nstarting off in  the  wrong direction on  his  first lap. Both \nfound themselves in trouble with the  race organizers. \nStanley Woods had a  most eventful ride on  his  350cc \nCotton, for  he  struck the  kerb at  Governor’s Bridge just \nbefore his refuelling stop, dislodging his exhaust pipe from \nthe engine and coming in for petrol with naked flames flick- \nering from the  exhaust port. There was no  requirement to \nstop the  engine while refuelling in those days and  with his \neager pit attendant a little careless, Woods and the  Cot- \nton  were suddenly engulfed in  flames. Swift action from \n\n24  M@  A  SPEEDY DECADE \nbystanders prevented a disaster, but Woods’ cord breeches \nwere badly scorched, as  were the  upper parts of his  legs. \nTying the  errant exhaust pipe to  the  frame with a  bit  of \ncloth, he rejoined the race, only to have a pushrod break at \nBraddan Bridge. Hastily fitting a  spare, he  continued, but \nlater lost the  use  of his  back brake. This meant he  had to \nrely on  the minuscule front brake visible in the photo. This \nwas not  enough to  slow him on  the  approach to  Ramsey \nHairpin, where he  took a  heavy fall. Picking himself up, \nhe  once more rejoined the  race and was glad to  see  the \nchequered flag, after an  exhausting 3 hours 50 minutes and \n33  seconds riding, in a creditable fifth place. No  one  could \nhave forecast that his  raw young racer would go on  to  win \nten  TT  races, finishing his  career with a  best race average \nspeed of 89mph. \nBy  1922 the Lightweight race was in  its  third year of \nrunning and was  awarded its own Tourist Trophy, while the \nprevious practice of awarding gold medals to  winners and \ntop finishers in each race was dropped and  silver replicas of \nthe  Tourist Trophy given instead. \nThere was  a good feeling running up to  the  1922 event, \nfor  factory competition departments had been busy and \nwere keen to  put their ideas to  the test of  TT racing. \nGrumbles could still be  heard about the  course not  being \nable to  handle 500s at  top speed, but most riders of 500cc \nmachines aimed to ride the TT course at less than full throt- \ntle,  because those who went flat  out  from the  start with \nwhat were still fairly fragile engines rarely made the finish. \nAlmost every winner’s post-race comments indicated how \nthey started carefully, nursed the  engine until mid-race, \nassessed their positions and then, only if necessary, finished \nat  full  throttle. \nRECORD SPEEDS \nRace week in  1922 was blessed with good weather \nthroughout, and riders responded to  a  year’s development \nof machines and improvements to  the  course with record \nspeeds in  all  classes. How much of that increased speed \ncould be  attributed to  the  hard work put into machine \ndevelopment and how much to course improvement, no  one \ncould say  for  certain. This combination of machine devel- \nopment, course improvements and, often, a  star rider’s \nefforts, was  to be the pattern of future TT speed increases. \nWhat was noticeable in  1922 was how the  top places \nwere distributed over a  wide number of manufacturers, \nwith five different makes among the  first seven finishers \nin  the  Senior (won by Alec Bennett on  a  Sunbeam), eight \ndifferent makes among the  first nine finishers in the Junior \n(won by Manxman Tom Sheard on  an  AJS), and  the  first \nsix  finishers all  riding different makes in  the  Lightweight \nGeoff Davison refuels his  Levis at the Pits. The job of the \nBoy Scouts was to  clean the rider’s side number plates. \n(won by Geoff Davison on  a  Levis). Those results would \nhave been pleasing to  manufacturers, for  it allowed more \nof them to  obtain publicity for their products. \nThe increase in  race speeds achieved in  1922 ranged \nfrom around 8 per  cent in  the  Senior to  over 10  per  cent \nin  the  Lightweight, but  what really grabbed public atten- \ntion was Alec Bennett’s new lap record in  the Senior at \n59.99mph. It meant that a 60mph lap was within touching \ndistance at  a  time when most ordinary people, including \nmany motorcyclists, still had no  idea what it  was like to \ntravel at  a  mile a  minute, let  alone to  average it  for  226 \nmiles while riding through towns, villages and over moun- \ntain and  moorland. \nMACHINE DEVELOPMENT \nRace machines were providing increased performance year \non  year at the TT and from the purely mechanical side, this \narose from both engine development and  improved general \nconstruction. However, Alec Bennett’s Senior race victory \nin  1922 came on a bike with an  established single-cylinder, \nside-valve, long-stroke engine measuring 77  X  105.5mm, \nat  a  time when there was a  trend to  use  a  shorter stroke. \nIt turned out  to  be  the  last  side-valve to  win a  TT. It had \nbeen \nrecognized \nfor \nsome \nyears \nthat \nthere \nwere \nperform- \nance \ngains \nfrom \nthe \nadoption \nof \noverhead \nvalves, \nbut \nit \nwas \nonly \nin \nthe \nearly \n1920s \nthat \nimproved \nvalve \nmaterial \ndid \naway \nwith \nthe \nsnapped \nvalves \nand \nsubsequent \nwrecked \nengines \nso \noften \nexperienced \nby \npioneers \nof \nthe \nohv \nlayout. \nMost \nvalves, \nsprings, \npushrods \nand \ntappets \nwere \nexposed, \nmaking \neffective \nlubrication \ndifficult, \nalthough \nthere \nwould \nbe \nsufficient \noil \nand \ngrease \naround \nto \nattract \ndirt \nand \ngrit. \nThis \nunpleasant \nmixture \ncould \neven \nbe \nenough \nto \naccelerate \n\ntappet \nwear \nduring \na \nlong \nrace, \nso  \naffecting \nvalve \nclearances \nand \nengine \ntune. \nThe \n1922 \nSenior \nTT-winning \nSunbeam \nstill \nutilized \nrim \nbrakes \nfront \nand \nrear \nat  \na  \ntime \nwhen \nthere \nwas \na \ndefi- \nnite \nmove \nto  \nsmall \ninternal \nexpanding \nbrakes. \nThe \nlatter \nallowed \nriders \nto make \ngreater \nuse \nof \nthe \nfront \nbrake \nand \nso \nreduce \ntheir \nlap \ntimes, \nwhereas \nthey \noften \ndid \nnot \nbother \nto \nuse \nthe \nstirrup \ntype \ndue \nto \nits \nineffectiveness. \nA \nfew \nmakes \ncontinued \nto \nuse \na contracting \nband \nbrake \non \nthe \nrear. \nAs  manufacturers moved to  planning their machinery \nfor the  1923 TT, more were using aluminium alloy pistons, \nwhile two-strokes were leading the  way with aluminium \ncylinder heads. Some perhaps considered following the \nexample of the  1922 Sun  Vitesse, which had  an  aluminium \nhead and an  aluminium barrel surrounding a cast iron liner. \nIt also had basic crankcase rotary-valve induction. \nThere was a  move to  mechanical lubrication of four- \nstrokes, although some retained a ‘manually’ pumped drip- \nfeed as  back-up. This was sometimes foot-operated. That \nsort of caution also extended to those running ohvy engines, \nwith riders known to  carry spare pushrods during a race. \nGearboxes were almost all  three-speed with hand- \nchange, but the two-speed Scotts utilized foot-change, \nwhile some Nortons were fitted with a form of foot-change \nthat lacked any positive-stop mechanism. Primary drive \nwas by exposed chain, and  most clutches were exposed to \ncounter the  build-up of heat in use. \nComponent suppliers continued to develop their products \nfor increased performance and reliability. This extended to \nchains, carburettors, tyres, sparking plugs and  magnetos. \nIn  respect of the  latter, ignition was universally by way of \nhigh-tension magneto. Suppliers were keen to get top riders \nusing their products so  that they could advertise successes, \nwhile riders were happy to  have their names associated \nwith components in return for retainers and  performance- \nrelated bonus payments from the  trade. \nElements such as  frames showed much variation between \nmakes, and  the  TT  course often revealed shortcomings in \ntheir designs, both in terms of handling characteristics and \nin  strength. Fractured frames were common.

If successful, then the  modification or  improve- \nment would usually be incorporated in the following year’s \nroad-going models. However, by 1923 there was a feel- \ning that the  machines produced to  challenge for  a  Tour- \nist  Trophy had lost their previous connection to  ‘the ideal \ntouring motorcycle’ for  which the event was originally \ncreated. They had, instead, become close to  out-and-out \nracing motorcycles. Writing some fifty years later in  his \nbook Racing Round the  Island, Bob Holliday attributed a \nchange of emphasis at the  event to  the  impact of Alec Ben- \nnett’s 59.99mph lap in  1922, saying, ‘Dramatically, from \nbeing a happy-go-lucky, free-for-all sporting adventure, the \nTT  had become serious, professional business. And there \nwas money in it!’ \nUse of specialized race machinery widened the perform- \nance gap between the  top  men and ordinary runners and \nalso took manufacturers down the  expensive road of hav- \ning to  establish race departments to  be in  with a  chance of \n\nHarry Harris and his  AJS speed towards Tower Bends above \nRamsey to  take second place in the 1923 Junior TT. \nsuccess. Of the  increased speeds that followed, Bob Hol- \nliday wrote, ‘it  was the  speed aspect which gave the  TT \na  new life, transforming it into a  spectacle irresistible to \nmillions who have fallen under the spell of its unique, magi- \ncal attraction’. \nADVENTURE \nThe TT  has  always been a  great adventure for  both riders \nand spectators. Even getting to  the  island was exciting for \nthose with everyday working lives. Racers would mostly \ntake their bikes by train to  Liverpool and  push them from \nthe  ferry terminal to  the  landing stage, for  support vans \nwere a rarity. Spectators would ride their bikes to  the ferry \nfrom all over Britain. One persuasive advertisement of the \ntime rather underestimated the  problems associated with \neffecting passage by telling them: \nThere is  no  difficulty whatsoever in  getting the  motorcy- \ncle aboard at  Liverpool, and plenty of porters are  available \nshould no  pals be present to  assist up the gangway at  high \ntide. It is less easy to get it ashore at  Douglas, but here again \nthere are  porters in plenty, though it is wise to fix a  fee with \nthem before giving the  order. \nThere was  no  mention of how steep those gangplanks could \nbe  at  certain states of the  tide, nor of how slippery they \ncould become. \nOnce aboard, passengers hoped for  a  smooth crossing. \nUnfortunately, a  lot of the  sailings were anything but, and \nwith many of the  bikes making the  trip \non  the open decks, most riders were \nglad when that part of their TT  adven- \nture was Over. \nTUNERS \nManufacturing concerns who supported \nthe TT varied greatly in  size and this \noften dictated how they went about their \nracing. Some would set  aside a  small \narea at  their works and divert a  few of \ntheir most skilled workers to  preparing \nbikes for the TT in the weeks leading up \nto  the event, while a  select few could \nafford a  permanent race department. \nThere were even some small businesses \nwho took production bikes to  the  island \nand used the  two weeks of practice to \nturn them into race-ready machines. \nWhen it comes to  speed, there have \nalways been individuals who have been \nable to take a motorcycle and make it go faster than identical \nmachines from the same maker. Sometimes those men were \nto  be  found working for  a  particular manufacturer, but \noften they worked on  a  freelance basis. In the  1920s, many \nbased themselves at Brooklands, which was a hive of racing, \ndevelopment, testing and record-breaking. Previous men- \ntion has been made of Norton’s ace  tuner, Dan O’ Donovan, \nand among others who achieved fame as  tuners in the  1920s \nwere Bert Le Vack, Bill Lacey, Dougal Marchant, “Woolly’ \nWorters and Nigel Spring. Men like Le  Vack, who worked \nfor  several companies during the decade, had been top \nracers. All  had their tuning secrets, which might relate to \ncarburation, ignition, valve gear, fly-wheels or  other com- \nponents. They would even have pistons, valves, springs and \nthe  like  specially made out  of the newest metals of the  day. \nIt was  all part of their never-ending search for the speed and \nreliability that would bring their machines home at the head \nof the  field and  thus earn the retainers and bonus payments \nfrom the  trade that gave them a living. \n1923: IMPROVEMENTS AND \nDEVELOPMENTS \nEvery TT brings new mechanical developments, and \nin  1923 Douglas had redesigned their flat-twin engine, \nwhile Matchless returned to  the  event with a  350cc over- \nhead camshaft (ohc) model. Long-time supporters of the \nevent, \nIndian, \nalso \nbrought \na \nnew \nmodel, \nwhich \nthe \nbook \nFranklin's \nIndians \ndescribed \nas \n‘a \npurpose \ndesigned \nTT \nmachine’. \nThe \nman \nbehind \nit \nwas \nformer \nTT \ncompetitor \n\nCharles \nFranklin, \nan  \nIrishman \nwho \nhad \nbeen \nchief \ndesigner \nat  \nIndian’s \nSpringfield \nfactory \nfor  \nseveral \nyears. \nIt \nsported \nan \nupright \nsingle-cylinder \nsy \nengine \nand, \nmaybe, \nthis \nwas \nthe \n500cc \nIndian \nthat \nwould \ndeliver \nthe \n85mph \ntop \nspeed \nthat \nrider \nFreddie \nDixon \nhad \nbeen \nclaiming \nfrom \nhis \nAmer- \nican \nmount \nfor \nseveral \nyears \npreviously. \nAs  well as  mechanical developments, most TTs feel  the \nbenefit of course improvements. For 1923, the  approach \nto  Braddan Bridge had  been widened, while the  notorious \nSulby Bridge had been widened, flattened and  tar-sprayed. \nSo, come the racing and everyone expected the 60mph bar- \nrier to  be  smashed, but  it was not  to  be.  Adverse weather \nfor the Senior race saw  local man Tom Sheard use  his course \nknowledge to  cope with thick mist on  the  Mountain and \nride his Douglas to  victory at  55.55mph from fellow Doug- \nlas  rider Jim  Whalley. Freddie Dixon managed third on \nhis  new Indian racer, in  what was the  Indian factory’s last \nappearance at the TT. In better weather, new records were \nset  in the Junior won by nineteen-year-old Stanley Woods \non  a  Cotton; and in  the Lightweight, where Jock Porter \nwas victorious on  his New Gerrard. Setting the  fastest laps \nin  those two races were two very quick riders of the  day \n—  Jimmy Simpson (AJS), who pushed the  Junior record \nup  to  59.59mph, but  fell  off  on  Bray Hill after tangling \nwith a  slower rider, and  Wal Handley (OK) who managed \n53.95mph in  the  Lightweight. Those three debutantes of \nthe  1922 races, Woods, Handley and  Simpson, put in qual- \nity performances to  finish the  1923 TT with a win and  two \nfastest laps between them. \nSIDECARS \nNew in  1923 was a  race for  sidecars of up  to  600cc, run \nover three laps. Victory went to the versatile Freddie Dixon \n(Douglas) at  a  race average speed of 53.15mph. Norton at \nlast adopted overhead valves and  Graham Walker rode one \nto  a close second place, while Harold Langman (Scott) set \nthe  fastest lap at  54.69mph. All  three were also accom- \nplished solo competitors. \nA \nsidecar \noutfit \nenters \nthe \ndip \nat  \nGovernor’s \nBridge. \nA  SPEEDY DECADE @  27 \nIn his role asa  solo rider, Graham Walker, while welcom- \ning the  increased use  of tar-surfacing on  the  island’s roads, \nexpressed reservations about racing over it in  the  wet, say- \ning of 1923, ‘the newly tarred sections of road, which we \nhad blessed in  the fair-weather practising, became death \ntraps’. Presumably this was because they became polished \nand slippery. Ironically, he  had previously told how the \nextreme demands of racing over the unmade Sulby Straight \nhad  made him physically sick. \nTHE ‘AMATEUR’ RACES \nThe Manx Motor Cycle Club had sought to  run a  one-lap \nrace for amateur riders at the TT  in the early 1920s, but the \nACU would not  agree to  it.  However, the  idea of a  locally \nThe sort of young rider keen to  contest an  early \n‘Amateur’ race. \n\n28  M  A  SPEEDY DECADE \norganized race did not  go away and  it gained support when \nthe  ACU threatened to  take the  TT  races to  Belgium for \n1922. That did  not  happen, but  the  Manx MCC pressed \nahead and organized the  first Manx Amateur Road Race \nChampionship over the Mountain Course in  September \n1923. It was an  event that was completely separate from \nthe TT and one  that sought to distance itself from the grow- \ning commercialization, professionalism and specialization \nof the  TT. With a  change of title to  the  Manx Grand Prix \nin  1930, it runs to  this  day. \nCOMMERCIALIZATION \nIn  contrast to  the  ideals of the  Amateur races run by the \nManx MCC —  which itself had difficulties with defining and \nenforcing the  term ‘amateur’ —  The Isle  of Man Times wrote \nin  1924, ‘Let us  rid  our minds, once and for  all,  that the \nTT  races are  sport. They are  not. That idea was exploded \nyears ago, when the  present regime of the  ACU came into \npower. The whole series of races is  purely and simply a \nbusiness or  commercial proposition.’ That local newspa- \nper was merely stating what was obvious to  the motorcycle \nmanufacturers, hoteliers, the  motorcycle press, the  Steam \nPacket Company, local charabanc owners, publicans, Isle of \nMan Government and  the  many other concerns who expe- \nrienced financial gain from the TT. And it was  nothing new, \nfor as  far back as  1913, when the races seemed in jeopardy \nfollowing the  manufacturers’ boycott of the 1912 event, \ncolumnist ‘Ixion’ of The  Motor Cycle wrote, “The future of \nthe TT  is primarily a financial question’. \nConcentration on  the  commercial aspects by some ele- \nments involved in the  TT  has  not  prevented generations of \nroad racing enthusiasts from looking upon the  event as  a \ngreat sporting occasion. They learned to  love the  course, \nthe  top racers became their heroes, the  winning makes of \nmachine went to  the  top  of their wish lists and they were \nhappy to  part with their hard-earned cash to  support the \nevent. The TT was  an  annual adventure in speed for them, \nas  it was for those who competed. That is the  way it was in \nthe  1920s and, fortunately, that is the  way it is today, \n1924: SMOOTHER TIMES \nThe relationship between the TT  organizers and the  Isle  of \nMan authorities was still a  precarious one, with the  ACU \nmaking it known that they would like to  move the  event \nto  England, where it would make them money —  although \nparliamentary approval would be necessary to  close public \nroads —  while the  Manx authorities showed their dislike of \nthe ACU by giving minimum support in  the many areas \nwhere their cooperation was required. Fortunately, there \nwere people on  the island prepared to  work for the benefit \nof \nthe  \nTT, \nincluding \nelements \nof \nthe  \npress. \nThey \nacted \nas \nintermediaries \nand \nin \nApril \ncame \na \nreport, \n‘Manx \nauthori- \nties \ndrop \ntheir \nhostile \npolicy \nand \nintend \nto \ngive \nevery \nassist- \nance \nto \nthe \nACU’. \nThis \nwas \nfollowed \nby \nan \narticle \nin \nThe \nIsle \nof \nMan \nTimes \nsaying, \n“The \nvalue \nof \nthese \nevents \nis \nnow \nrealized. \nThey \nare \nthe \nIsland’s \nbest \nadvertising \nmedium. \n. \nBe \nA race for  175cc machines was introduced in  1924 and \nthey were classed as  Ultra Lightweights. One novel feature \nwas that the  sixteen entries were despatched via  a  massed \nstart for  their three-lap race. The Lightweight race had \nnineteen entries, Junior fifty-six, Senior thirty-three and \nSidecar nine. The low figures for some of those races meant \nthere were hardly enough machines to  retain spectator \ninterest over a  37%4-mile lap, although the  acrobat antics \nof sidecar passengers while cornering certainly served to \nentertain. Due to  the  introduction of the  extra class, the \nfirst rider away in  practice left at  4.15am if it  was light \nenough, \nMuch money had been spent on  the  course and it  was \nalmost all  tar-sprayed. Riders were loud in  their praise for \nits  condition, but  still spoke of some ‘looseness’ in  places \non  the  Mountain, which was  also affected by long, shallow \nruts, which they called ‘tramlines’. \nOn the  run-up to  the TT there were the customary \nclaims of new and exotic racing engines under construc- \ntion, but  their manufacturers sometimes deemed it  pru- \ndent not  to  subject them to  this  most demanding of events. \nInstead, they brought modified versions of the  ones used \nin  1923. Press reports of the  day told of ‘engine efficiency \nhaving reached a high pitch’, although it was  a time when a \ncompression ratio of 7:1  was still considered too  high for a \n500 on  ordinary petrol. \nWhile larger firms built and developed their own \nengines, smaller concerns used proprietary power units \nfrom the likes of JAP, Blackburne and  Bradshaw, who pro- \nduced special versions for competition use. It was not  unu- \nsual for  seven or  eight different makes of motorcycle to  be \nusing JAP engines ina  TT race. \nHANDLING AND BRAKING \nIt was mentioned in  Chapter 1 how in  the  early years of \nMountain Course use, manufacturers recognized the  need \nto \ndevelop \nthe \nhandling \nqualities \nof \ntheir \nframes \nand \nforks \nto \ncope \nwith \nthe \npoor \ncondition \nof \nthe \ncourse \nand \nwith \nincreasing \npower \noutputs. \nThat \nneed \nwas \njust \nas \nimportant. \nin \nthe \npost-1920 \nperiod, \nwhen \nimproving \nroad \nconditions \nallowed \nthe \nuse \nof \ngreater \npower \nand \nso \nput \nmore \ndemands \non \nroad-holding. \nDevelopment \nin \nsuch \nareas \nthen \nrequired \nbrakes \nto \nbe \nuprated \nto \ncope \nwith \nthe \nhigher \nspeeds. \nStop- \nping \nwas \na \nhot \ntopic \nin \n1924, \nfor \nit \nwas \nrealized \nthat \nafter \n\npower \nand \nhandling, \nbetter \nbraking \ncould \nwin \na \nrace. \nInter- \nnal \nexpanding \nbrakes \nwere \nnow \nthe \nnorm, \nand \nnot \nonly \nwere \ndrums \ngetting \nlarger \n— \nalthough \nstill \nonly \naveraging \nabout \n6in \nin \ndiameter \n— \nbut \nfirms \nlike \nMatador \nand \nDOT \nwere \nfitting \ntwo \nto \nthe \nfront \nwheel \nand \none \nto \nthe \nrear. \nAgain \nit was \nan \narea \nfor \nexperimentation, \nparticularly \nin \nthe \nsearch \nfor \nsuitable \nbrake \nlining \nmaterial. \nMost \nattached \nthis \nto \nthe \nshoes, \nwhich \nthen \nbore \nonto \nthe \ninside \nof \nthe \nmetal \ndrums, \nbut \nWebb \nproduced \nfabric-lined \ndrums \nand \nplain \ncast \niron \nshoes, \nwhile \nDouglas \ncontinued \nwith \ntheir \nexperimental \ndisc \nbrake \nfrom \n1923, \nwhich \nhad \nthe \nfric- \ntion \nmaterial \nfixed \nto \nthe \ndisc, \nwith \na v-shaped \nmetal \n‘pad’ \nbearing \nupon \nit. \nRECORD-BREAKING \nRiders of the  day seemed to  agree that, with its  80mph \napproach speed, Hillberry was  the fastest corner on  the TT \ncourse. Taking this sweeping uphill right-hander as  fast  as \nthey dared, they would seek to  ride a classic line  from the \nleft  on  the  approach to  clip the  apex on  the  right and  then \nrun  out  to  the  left, avoiding running too  far because of the \nadverse camber, loose material and  substantial earth bank \non  the exit. With its long approach, it was  a bend that gave \nthem time to  build-up the  necessary ‘bottle’ to  take it on \ntheir personal limits. Apart from riding ability, speed was \nalso governed by the  solid bank on  the  apex, which jutted \nfurther into the road then than it does today. Some of the top \nriders were asked to estimate their speed through Hillberry \nand responded as  follows: Alec Bennett 60mph, Freddie \nDixon 55—60mph, Graham Walker 55mph, George Dance \n54—55mph, Tom Sheard 50—55mph. \nOnly the  previous year, when the  bend had still to  be \nproperly surfaced, a very impressed onlooker had described \nTommy \nde  \nla \nHay \ntackles \na \nloose-surfaced \nHillberry \non \nhis \nSunbeam. \nA  SPEEDY DECADE @  29 \nStanley Woods drifting through during his  winning ride \nin  the  Junior race and ‘throwing up  a  bow-wave of dirt \nand stone from his  wheels. All  through this giant slide at \nperhaps 60mph he was rock steady, master of his  machine \nand  himself.’ \nThat described the fastest corner, but what about the rac- \ning in 1924? Well, that too  was  the fastest, so  much so  that it \nis no  exaggeration to describe race and lap records as  having \nbeen ‘smashed’. Edwin Twemlow (New Imperial) lifted the \nLightweight lap record from 53.95mph to  58.28mph, while \nin the Junior race his brother Kenneth brought another New \nImperial into first place and  Jimmy Simpson lifted the  lap \nrecord from 59.59mph to  an  incredible 64.54mph. So  fast \nwas  Simpson’s best Junior lap that  it exceeded the  new lap \nrecord of 63.75mph set  by Freddie Dixon during his  ride \nto  third place in  the  Senior race. That was won by Alec \nBennett on  a  Norton, which, while still largely based on \ntheir standard Model 18, had been revitalized by the newly \nappointed Walter Moore. It was  the company’s first solo TT \nwin since 1907. The new Ultra Lightweights did  their best \nto join this festival of speed, with Jock Porter taking victory \non  his New Gerrard and setting the fastest lap at 52.61mph. \nOnly in  the  Sidecar race was the  previous record not  bro- \nken, Freddie Dixon’s fastest lap falling slightly short of the \n1923 figure and George Tucker taking another victory for \nNorton, using a  four-speed gearbox of their own design. \nIN  CONTROL \nIn what was  his  third year at  the  TT, Jimmy Simpson was \ndeveloping a reputation for being a fast rider capable of set- \nting lap records, but unable to bring his machine to  the fin- \nish.  It was  an  unwanted reputation that was  to grow through \nthe  rest of the 1920s and into the  1930s. By contrast, in \nwinning his  second Senior TT, Alec Bennett showed signs \nof why he would end the decade as  one  of the most success- \nful  and respected TT  riders. Of his  Senior ride in  1924, \nBennett told how he took absolutely no  chances during the \nrace and how he did not  use  more than three-quarter throt- \ntle  for  the  first four laps. Thereafter he  slightly increased \nhis pace in order to  keep second-placed man Harold Lang- \nman (Scott) at bay and finally triumphed by a margin of 11% \nminutes. \nTo  speedy Jimmy Simpson went the  glory of being the \nfastest over one  lap, but to  Alec Bennett went victory, the \nright to  hold aloft the  magnificent Senior Tourist Trophy \nin  front of cheering crowds and the  substantial winning \nbonuses from his  entrant and the  trade. Norton were jus- \ntifiably pleased with the  result and with the  subsequent \nincrease in  demand for  the  Model 18  roadsters, priced at \n£80. \n\neS ee Z 2 pred \na Hie : Petes Pee ee ae \nRacing through Laurel Bank in the  early 1920s, over narrow, loosely surfaced \nroads with overhanging hedges. \nA catalogue illustration of the  Norton Model 18 of the  mid-1920s. \nIt  was difficult for  a  rider to  control a  race from the \nfront in the  1920s, for he only received information on  his \nposition during pit stops. It was the  New Imperial team \nthat introduced a basic flag-signalling system for its  riders \nas  they passed the pits on  a non-stop lap. In essence, if a red \nflag was shown from the  ‘New Imp’ pit the rider was  being \ntold to  go  faster, while if a  yellow was displayed, things \nwere OK and he was to  maintain the  same pace. \nAmongst the newcomers to the  1924 TT races was Irish- \nman Joe Craig. He was aman who was to exercise consider- \nable control over the racing activities of the Norton marque \nin later years. \n1925: THE ROARING \nTWENTIES \nThis was the expression used to \ndescribe the increased dynamism \nof the  decade’s social, artistic and \ncultural activities and it  was also \napplicable to  the  racing of motor- \ncycles at the  TT, particularly in the \nmiddle years. \nThings were moving on  apace \nin  several directions at  the Island \nraces, with the  whole of the  Moun- \ntain Course finally tar-sprayed and \nqualifying times in the Lightweight, \nJunior and Senior classes reduced to \n55,  50  and  45  minutes. AJS came \nwith a  500cc engine, firms like \nBOS Velocette, Norton and New Hudson \nadopted dry sump lubrication, and \na \nmore responsive engines encour- \naged the occasional use  of twist-grip \nthrottles. Wired-on tyres fitted to \nwell-base rims were in  general use \nand ever more technical advances \nwere incorporated in  the twenty- \nseven makes of machine entered for \nthe  five  TT  races of 1925. \nThe man who came roaring back \nto  form in  1925 was Howard Day- \nies, abetted by record-breaking \nperformances from Wal Handley, \nJimmy Simpson, Edwin Twemlow \nand, on  three-wheels, Len Parker. \nDavies’ previous TT  performances \nincluded second place in his first TT \nof 1914, plus first and second places \nin  1921. However, the  six  races in \nwhich he  rode between 1922 and \n1924 brought six  retirements. Tired of this, he set  to  after \nthe  1924 event to  build his  own idea of what a motorcycle \nshould be,  giving the  finished product his  initials, HRD. \nAimed at the higher end  of the  roadster market and priced \naccordingly, \nit \nwas \nno \nsurprise \nwhen \nhe \nbrought \nracing \nver- \nsions \nto \nthe \nisland, \nfor \nhimself \nand \nemployee \n‘Harry’ \nHarris \nto tackle the Junior and  Senior races. \nRegarded \nby \nthe  \npress \nas  \n‘a \ndark \nhorse’ \nwith \nhis  \nbrand \nnew \nblack-and-gold \nracers, \nDavies \nhad \nthe \nadvantage \nof \nbeing \nchosen \nby \ntuner \nBert \nLe \nVack \nto \nuse \nhis \nspecially \nprepared \npushrod \nJAP \nracing \nengines, \nand \nhe \nproved \na \nshrewd \nchoice. \nTaking \na \nfine \nsecond \nplace \nto \nWal \nHandley \n\nHoward Davies is carried shoulder-high after his  victory \nin the 1925 TT. Howard’s left hand is resting on  the \nshoulder of tuner Bert Le Vack. \nin the Junior, where Handley lifted the  race average speed \nby almost 10mph to  65.02mph and raised the  lap record \nto  65.89mph, Davies shocked the established opposition in \nthe  Blue Riband Senior TT  by riding his  new machine to \nvictory at  a  race average speed of 66.13mph, leaving the \nspeedy Jimmy Simpson to  take the lap record at  68.97mph \nbut again fail  to  record a finish. \nHoward Davies raced in  some style, for  a  report of the \ntime told how at  his  pit stop he  ‘had a  hurried drink of \nchampagne and  went off again feeling quite refreshed’. \nThe 1925 TT  was run in  front of record crowds and \nproved a  triumph for  single-cylinder proprietary engines, \nwith only Len Parker’s sidecar-winning Douglas twin being \nfitted with the  maker’s own power unit. The HRD was \n‘typical of the  small concerns of the  time, having a  JAP \nengine, Burman gearbox, Binks carburettor, Webb forks \nand with hubs, rims, magneto, mudguards, chains, tyres, \nplugs and so  on  also supplied by others. In  the  case of the \nHRD, this  assembly of components was  backed by a  sound \nbasic design, resulting in a motorcycle that was  also attrac- \ntive to  the  eye, with its  early use  of the  saddle-type petrol \ntank rather than the  customary flat-tank mounted under \nthe top frame rail. \n1926: EVER FASTER \nCome \n1926, \nthe  \nSidecar \nTT  \nwas \ndropped \nfrom \nthe  \npro- \ngramme \nof \nraces \ndue, \nsome \nsay, \nto \nmanufacturers’ \nopposi- \ntion \nto  \nthe \ngymnastics \nperformed \nby \npassengers \nwhile \ncor- \nnering, \nwhich \nwas  \ntotally \nout  \nof \nstep \nwith \nhow \nthey \nwished \nsidecar \noutfits \nto  \nbe  \nportrayed \nto  \nthe  \nbuying \npublic. \nThe \nA  SPEEDY DECADE @  31 \nUltra Lightweights were also dropped, in  their case due to \nlack of entries and  thus lack of spectacle. This left  a  three- \nrace TT meeting, for  500cc Senior, 350cc Junior and  250cc \nLightweight machines. \nSince the  TT  restarted after the  First World War, it had \ntaken just five years for the  Senior lap record to  climb from \n55.62mph in  1920 to  68.97mph in  1925, an  increase of \nsome 25  per  cent. The Junior lap record had increased by \nnearly 30  per cent over the same period, and the Light- \nweights’ by 40  per cent. One effect of  those improved \nrace and lap times was to  narrow the  differential between \nclasses, with times set by the Juniors not  far behind the Sen- \niors. As people were no  longer protesting about 500s being \ntoo  fast for the course, it seemed clear that the speed of the \n350s had  been increasing at  a  greater rate than the  500s’, \nfor which estimated maximum speeds of 90mph were now \nbeing quoted. \nMany would conclude from these figures that motor- \ncycles were growing increasingly successful in  challeng- \ning the  TT  course, but  that would not  be the  view of half, \nand  sometimes two-thirds, of the  entry, who customarily \nfailed to  finish a race. The 1926 Senior TT  saw  twenty-two \nfinishers out of fifty-seven starters, which indicated that \nwhile there may have been progress in many directions, the \nMountain Course was  still a formidable adversary. So much \nso,  that there was opposition to  the decision to  increase the \nrace distance from six  to  seven laps for  all  classes in  1926 \n—  which amounted to  264'% racing miles. As well as  taxing \nthe  machines, the  extra lap meant another 30-plus minutes \nin the saddle for riders; on  the eve  of the  1926 TT the fastest \nlap time stood to Jimmy Simpson in  32 minutes 50 seconds, \nat  a  speed of 68.97mph. \nNO  ALCOHOL \nIn the  mid-1920s the world was  already beginning to  ques- \ntion where future supplies of petrol were to  come from, \nand alcohol was being spoken of as  a  potential substitute. \nIndeed, several countries of  the British Commonwealth \nwere identified as  able to  grow crops on  the  scale needed \nto  allow alcohol to  be  derived from them in  large quan- \ntities. Despite that, a  decision was taken to  ban the  use \nof alcohol-based fuels at  the 1926 TT, meaning that only \npetrol and  petrol/benzole mixtures were permitted. This \nmeant using lower compression ratios than with alcohol, \nand  works Nortons were running at  6.4:1. \nThe effect of the ban was  mixed. JAP engines were prob- \nably affected more than most, for  much of their develop- \nment was done at Brooklands, where the use  of alcohol was \ncommon, Certainly, the  JAP name was not  so  often seen \namong the  top  finishers in  subsequent TTs, although the \n\n32  M  A  SPEEDY DECADE \nclosing of their race department at the end of 1925 on  eco- \nnomic grounds and the consequent loss of Bert Le Vack may \nhave been contributory factors. They continued to  supply \nengines for racing. \nFOREIGN ENTRIES \nThere had  been a  few  foreign machines contesting the  TT \nin the early 1920s, such as  a team of Peugeots from France \nin  1924, but  in  1926 the  Italian concerns Garelli, Bianchi \nand Moto Guzzi were present with entries spread across \nthe  three classes. Bianchi ohc  models gained a  praisewor- \nthy  three finishes in  the  Junior race, but Garelli, with \nwhat was said to  be  a  350cc twin-piston, single-cylinder, \ntwo-stroke machine, did not  finish the  race. Moto Guzzi’s \nPietro Ghersi was entered in  the  Senior and Lightweight \nraces. He  failed to  complete the  Senior but  came home in \nsecond place in the  Lightweight, only to be controversially \n‘excluded from the results’. \nThe Bianchi team that contested the 1926 TT. \nBONUS PAYMENTS \nThe reason for  Ghersi’s exclusion was that he used an  Ital- \nian  Fert sparking plug rather than the  Lodge make that he \nhad specified at  the  weigh-in. Full details are  lost in  the \nmists of time, but one  assumes that, before he weighed in, \nLodge offered him a  bonus payment based on  results, but \nwere then disappointed to  find that he had not  raced with \ntheir plug. \nThe whole business of bonus payments to  riders from \nthe  trade was  fraught with difficulties and  accompanied by \na fair amount of underhand tactics.

The ‘Velo’ engine was in its  second year at  the  TT \nand was said by factory employee and rider Fred Povey to \nproduce 20bhp on  a compression ratio of 7:1.  It was  also an \nimportant moment in the history of Veloce Ltd, which built \nboth future sales and competition activity on  the reputation \ngained from that first TT win. \n‘Paddy’ Johnston led home a Cotton one, two and three in \nthe  Lightweight. Strangely, although having been ‘excluded \nfrom the  results’ of the  Lightweight race, which is not  the \nsame as  being disqualified, Pietro Ghersi received official \nrecognition of  his  new lap \nrecord of  63.12mph, a fine \nachievement for a newcomer \nto  the  course. \nSenior winner, Stanley \nWoods, later told Mick \nWoollett of his  Norton, ‘I’d \nsay  that the top speed was \nabout 90mph ...  the  output \nwas 30  horsepower or  so’. \nIndications of Norton power \nThis 1927 photo at the \nBungalow shows the extent \nof loose chippings at the \nroadsides. \nA rider passes through Crosby in  1926 in the upright \nriding position used by most at the time. \noutput in later years suggest that Stanley was over-optimis- \ntic  on  output in  1926 but  about right on  speed. \nCONDITIONS \nGiven the  high race speeds achieved in  1926, it is perhaps \nsurprising to  hear that riders were critical of the  state of \nthe  course when practice started. Specifically, they were \nconcerned that loose chippings were nullifying the benefits \nof earlier work to  surface roads and  ease bends. Such chip- \npings, which were substantially larger than the  ones used \nMUNGALIW \nMy. \n\n34  M  A  SPEEDY DECADE \nin today’s surface dressing, were spread after the roads had \nbeen tar-sprayed and  their incorporation into the  wearing \nsurface was a bit hit and  miss. It also sounds as  though the \nHighway Board may have been a bit  late with its  course \npreparation on  the run-up to the  1926 races, but  37% miles \nof road is a lot of road to  sweep —  and, of course, much of \nit did not  get swept. \nIn  most places, the  roads were still not  as  wide as  they \nare  today and what we  would see  as  lack of maintenance \nresulted in vegetation overhanging road edges. In addition, \nthe  outer margins of the  road would get  covered in  the \nloose chippings thrown there by the  passage of vehicles. \nThe result was  to  narrow the  effective riding line, making \nit particularly dangerous to  be  carried out  wide on  bends \nand also restricting opportunities for overtaking. Mechani- \ncal road-sweepers and verge trimmers were still something \nfor the future. \nTHE REWARDS OF VICTORY \nProving the benefit of a TT  win, the HRD concern experi- \nenced healthy sales of its road machines after taking victory \n| \n90 T.T.

The factory actually \nbrought eleven machines to  the  island and announced that \nafter the  racing they would all be offered for sale at full list \nprice. As an  indication of the way that speeds were increas- \ning on  road and  track, HRD’s HD  90 model was  marketed \nas  a 90mph roadster. \nDuring the mid-1920s, several manufacturers found that \nthe combination of increased speeds and use  of larger brakes \ncreated front fork and  brake problems. This was typical of \nthe  lessons learnt from going TT  racing with ever faster \nmotorcycles. \n1927: COMMUNICATION \nThe world of the  late 1920s was very different from today \nwhen it came to publicizing and reporting on  the TT. Radio \nwas in  its  infancy, telephones were for  the  privileged and \nmost relied on  the  printed word, principally those in  the \nweekly magazines The  Motor Cycle and Motor Cycling. New \nat  the  1927 event was the  newspaper The  TT Special. Con- \ntaining full race reports and edited by 1922 Lightweight \nTT  winner Geoff Davison, it \nappeared for  sale on  the  island \nimmediately after each race \nand could be posted anywhere \nin  the  world. Later to  include \neditions covering each practice \nsession, it went on  to  become a \nTT  institution. \nThe mainstream national \npress largely ignored the TT \nunless they wished to  criticize \nit, and in  1927 occurred a trag- \nedy that they seized on.  Prac- \ntice sessions were still early \nmorning and run over roads \nthat were not  closed to  normal \ntraffic. During one of  those \nsessions, 22-year-old Archie \nBirkin met a  fish van heading \ntowards him near Rhencullen \nand, swerving to  avoid it,  he \ncrashed and was killed. The \nBirkin family was well known \nPRICE = JINEAS F \nWe \nee \ntah \nae \nINEAS, \nand \nhis \ndeath \nwas \nwidely \nis \nModel \nis \na \nreplica \nof \nthe \nmachine \nand \nthe \nen \nis \ni \nti \nith \nthe \ni \ns \ni \nrst \ntes \nges \ncer \npan \ner \ney \nap \na \nis \nidentical \nwith \nthat \nwhich \nwon \nthe \n1925 \nSemor \nTourist \nreported. \nThe ACU had been asking \nClaiming \nto  \nbe  \na  \nreplica \nof \nthe \nmachine \nthat \nwon \nthe \n1925 \nSenior \nTT, \nthis \nis \nthe \nHoward Davies 90 TT  Replica of  1926. \nfor  roads to  be  closed during \npractice for  many years, but \nthe island had resisted it.

He  was entitled to  his  view, but \nit was not  shared by riders who had  to  race for  seven laps. \nTop runners on  500cc machines were in the  saddle for just \nunder four strenuous hours. Lesser 500 riders took much \nlonger and  riders of 250s took longer still. \nThe roads of the TT course may have been tar-sprayed in \ntheir entirety, but  in  many cases this was done over exist- \ning surfaces with very basic foundations. While they were \ncertainly an  improvement over the  earlier unmade roads, \nthe wear caused by growth in ordinary traffic and  increase \nin  race speeds accentuated bumps, of which there were \nplenty. Oliver Langton rode to  seventh place in  the 1927 \nSenior race and told how course conditions were such that \nhe had to summon all his courage on  the very bumpy Cronk \ny Voddy straight, before taking a hand off the  handlebar to \noperate the  hand gearchange of his  New Hudson. On  such \nrigid-framed machines with basic girder front forks, it was \nstill a physical challenge to  ride ever faster over roads that \nwere nowhere near today’s standard in  width, finish and \nsmoothness. \nEASING THE PACE \nThere was an  influx of ohc  motors to  the  1927 TT  to  join \nthe forerunners of previous years, including examples from \nBlackburne, AJS and Norton. The new Walter Moore- \ndesigned 500cc CSI engine from Norton was allocated \nto  previous Senior TT  winners Alec Bennett and Stanley \nWoods to  race, while two ohv engines were used by the \nother Norton works entries, Joe  Craig and  Jimmy Shaw. \nThe 1927 Nortons also came with a  new cradle frame, \n8in-diameter brake drums front and  rear and  a new saddle \ntank. The new ohc engine was said  to  be capable of 95mph \nand, \nwhen \ntimed \non \nSulby \nStraight, \nStanley \nWoods \nclocked \n93.7mph. \nThe \ncustomary \nsetting \nof \nnew \nrecord \nrace \nand \nlap \nspeeds \ncontinued \nacross \nall \nclasses \nin  \n1927, \nbut  \nin  \nthe  \nJunior \nand \nSenior \nraces \nthe \npace \nof \nincrease \neased \nto \nabout \nImph, \nA  SPEEDY DECADE @  35 \nAlec Bennett rode his  new CS|-engined Norton to \nvictory in the 1927 Senior TT.

The new ohe  Norton delivered a \nwin in the  Senior, where Stanley Woods looked as  though \nhe was going to  walk away with victory on  the  new model \nuntil, with a lead of several minutes, he struck clutch trou- \nble  and saw first place go to  team mate Alec Bennett. This \nmade Bennett the  only man to  win Senior TT  races with \nsv,  ohv  and  ohc  engines. To  Woods went the  fastest lap of \n70.90mph, while second place went to  rising star Jimmy \nGuthrie on  a  New Hudson. \nFreddie Dixon took victory in  the Junior on  a  JAP- \npowered HRD. Working for  JAP at  the  time, there was \nno  doubt that Dixon hand-picked and prepared his  engine \nto  ensure that it was the best available. Lightweight victory \nwent to Wal Handley (Rex-Acme), and here the increase in \nrace average speed was greater, rising by some 5 per  cent \nfrom 60.20 to  63.30mph, with Luigi Archangeli (Moto \nGuzzi) finishing second. \nRacing motorcycles of this era  were not  fitted with rev \ncounters and riders had  to  estimate when to  change gear, \nor  wait for  valve-float, something which the  increasingly \ncommon ohc design helped to reduce with its better control \nof opening and  closing of valves. \n1928: ROADS CLOSED \nCome the 1928 TT, riders welcomed the  new closing of \nroads to  other traffic during practice periods, which were \nspread over twelve days. Such an  extended period could \nbe  hard on  race machinery and some riders used ‘hack’ \nmachines in  the  early stages —  Stanley Woods told of using \na Model 18, on  which he said, ‘I got a  lot of laps in at  quite \n\n36  M  A  SPEEDY DECADE \nhigh speed ...  later in  practising I switched to  my  race \nmachine’ —  while factories would sometimes use  last year’s \nrace models. Unusually, the  island was blessed with good \nweather for  the entire practice period. Not everything \nwas perfect, however, with riders reporting the  roads to \nbe bumpy. \nExperienced onlookers detected improved road-hold- \ning  as  a  feature of practice, particularly on  corners. No \ndoubt further attention had  been given to frame design and \nby now there was a  general adoption of saddle-tanks and \nlow seat height. Velocette experimented with rear-spring- \ning, said to  be  ‘built under Draper patents’ and involv- \ning exposed, inclined springs under the  seat giving some \n3  inches of  movement. They increased rear tyre size \nfrom 2.75 to  3.00 and also introduced a  positive-stop \nfoot gearchange, for  their four-speed gearbox. Similar \npositive-stop change mechanisms were adopted by most \nmanufacturers in  following years. As  well as  doing away \nwith the  need for  a  rider to  take his  hand off the  handle- \nbars while changing gear, they allowed a  quicker change \nand thus saved the  rider more seconds a lap. It really was \ndifficult to  keep track of  the many gradual machine \nimprovements, each one  contributing to  the  chipping away \nof lap times. \nA WET SENIOR RACE \nIn the  late 1920s TT  races were always run  to  their sched- \nuled times, whatever the  weather. There was no  question \nof delaying the  start by an  hour to  allow mist to  clear from \nthe  Mountain or  to  let the roads dry. When the customary \nmaroon was discharged at  the  start, no. 1 pushed off for \nsome four hours of racing, followed by the remainder of the \nfield at specified intervals. \nThere had been relatively few wet TT races, but the  1928 \nSenior was a  shocker, with rain for most of the  time. Vic- \ntory went to  Charlie Dodson (Sunbeam), even though he \nhad a major fall at  Keppel Gate on  lap six and split his crash \nhelmet from top to  bottom. That spill lost him the  lead to \nGraham Walker (Rudge), but  the  Rudge failed with less \nthan half a lap to go.  Dodson came home the winner, trail- \ning the rear stand broken in his crash. Two other new names \namongst the placemen were George Rowley (AJS) in second \nand  Tommy Hatch (Scott) in third. Almost inevitably, the \nfastest lap went to  Jimmy Simpson (AJS), but  race and  lap \nspeeds were well down from those set  in  dry conditions, \nThe Junior was  won by Alec Bennett on  a Velocette and  he \nbroke both race average and  lap records by a small amount, \nhis new race record being faster than that set in the previous \nyear’s Senior and  the  lap record going over 70mph, for the \nfirst time for  a  350. It was his  fifth TT  victory —  another \nrecord \nfor \nthe  \ntime. \nFrank \nLongman \nwon \nthe  \nLightweight \non  \nan  \nOK-Supreme \nat  \nslightly \nless \nthan \nthe  \nprevious \nyear’s \nrecord-breaking \nspeeds. \nSTRIP-DOWN \nAfter \neach \nrace, \nit  \nwas \na  \nrequirement \nfor  \nthe  \nengines \nof \nthe \nfirst \nthree \nfinishers \nto \nbe \nstripped \nand \nmeasured \nin \nthe \npresence \nof race \nofficials. \nThe \npress \nwere \nalso \ngiven \nan \nopportunity \nto \nview \nthe \ndismantled \nengines \nand \nthey \npublished \nthe \nresults \nof \nwhat \nthey \nsaw, \nmaking \ncomment \non \nvalve \nsprings, \npiston \nrings, \ncarbon \ndeposits \nand \npiston \ncolour, \nplus \nfurther \nobservations \nabout \nthe \nstate \nof chains, \nbrakes, \ntyres, \noil \ntightness \nand \nso \non. \nAfter \nthe \n1928 \nSenior, \nboth \nthe \nfirst \nand \nsecond \nplace \nSunbeams \nwere \nseen \nto have \nbroken \npiston \nrings. \nThe experienced AJS concern did  not  have to  submit \ntheir engines after the  Junior race, for, having made a \nlate  decision to  change the  make of valve springs, five  AJS \nmachines retired from the  race with broken springs. \nSPEED OR  TIME? \nWhile year on  year changes and improvements to  the \nMountain Course continued to  help reduce the  time taken \nto  complete a  lap, after the major road-surfacing prog- \nramme of  1923—5 it  was the better engines, improved \nhandling, stronger braking and  general machine improve- \nments that contributed most to  the  speed increases of the \nlate 1920s. \nThere was no  doubt that the  primary TT  interest of the \npress, spectators and post-race advertising was  in the speeds \nachieved. During the  1920s this information was conveyed \nby the  published lap speeds and race average speeds and it \nwas from those that the  public deduced what happened in \na race, using the figures to  fuel  their imaginations as  to  the \nskill and daring shown on track. For all the concentration on \nspeed, there was little hard information as  to  actual speed \nachieved at  specific locations, and  when speeds were men- \ntioned, they were usually estimated. As  an  example, most \npeople recognized that the drop from the Fifth Milestone to \nThe Highlander was one  of the  fastest parts of the  course, \nalthough in  1929 it was neither as  straight nor  as  smooth as \nit \nis \ntoday. \nA \nreport \nin \nMotor \nCycling \nat \nthe \ntime \nconcluded, \n‘generally speaking, of the  faster machines —  and many \nwere \ndoing \nabout \n95 \nto \n100mph \n— \nthe \nNortons \nseemed \nto \nbe \nthe \nsteadiest’. \nIt \nwent \non \nto \ndescribe \nStanley \nWoods’ \nand \nJimmy \nSimpson’s \ntreatment \nof \nthe \nbumps \nthere, \ntelling \nhow \nthey \n‘executed \nprodigal \naerial \nfeats’. \nThere \nwere \nstill \nplenty \nof \nlocations \non \nthe \ncourse \nwhere \nmachines \nbecame \nairborne \nand, \nover \nseven \nlaps, \neach \nlanding \ngave \na \nsevere \ntest \nto \nthe \nrigid-frames of the  day. \n\nRace and lap  speeds were still \nclimbing, but the really impor- \ntant information for riders came \nnot  from quoted speeds, but  from \ntheir lap times. What they wanted \nto  know after every practice lap or \nrace was  whether machine improve- \nments and their riding skills had \nreduced the time taken to  cover the \n37°% miles of the  Mountain Course. \nFor  them, lap time was the  bench- \nmark, not lap speed. At the approach \nto the  1929 TT, the fastest lap times \nstood to  Stanley Woods in the  Sen- \nior  class at  31  minutes 54  seconds \n(70.90mph) and  to  Alec Bennett in \nthe Junior at  32 minutes 13 seconds \n(70.28mph). In  the Lightweight it \nwas shared by Frank Longman and \nAlec Bennett at  35  minutes and 8 \nseconds (64.45mph). \n1929: END OF A DECADE \nAs practice opened for the  1929 TT, road conditions were \nsaid to  be  very good. Among the  machine developments \nwas a  general stiffening of construction, which, as  well as \napplying to  frames and  cycle parts, extended to  things like \nwebbing to  crankcases and bulking-up of engine compo- \nnents. Such alterations were said to  be  required to  cope \nwith increased power and speed, although it was acknowl- \nedged that they increased overall machine weight. \nAs  practice progressed, the  road-holding of the  works \nNorton, Sunbeam and Velocettes received praise, recorded \nlap speeds were high and accidents were few. It  was not \njust increases in maximum speeds that were bringing faster \nlap speeds, for positive-stop foot-change mechanisms were \nspreading and were reckoned to  save many seconds a lap. \nAlso, Norton had at  last moved from lever to  twist-grip \nthrottles and also claimed to  have improved their engine \npick-up, which saved further seconds when pulling away \nfrom tricky spots like  Ramsey Hairpin and the  Gooseneck. \nOn race day Charlie Dodson (Sunbeam) took his second \nSenior TT  win in  far  better weather than his  first win in \n1928 and  at  a race average speed 10mph faster. While that \nprovided a very real indication of how the weather can  play \nhavoc with race speeds, there must have been other fac= \ntors involved; Dodson lopped 1 minute 7 seconds off the \nprevious \nbest \nlap \ntime, \nwhich \nhad \nalso \nbeen \nset \nin \nthe \ndry \nin \n1927, \nraising \nthe \nspeed \nto \n73.55mph. \nSunbeam \nalso \ntook \nthe  team prize, for the  third year in succession. \nA  SPEEDY DECADE @  37 \nS. Jackson races through the narrow main street of Kirk Michael in  1929. \nIn only his second year at the TT, Freddie Hicks brought \nhis Velocette home first in the Junior, reducing the lap time \nby 18  seconds and increasing the  lap speed to  70.95mph. \nThe 350s had  narrowed the  speed margin between them- \nselves and  the  500s in  the  second half of the  1920s, but  it \nnow looked as  though the  500s were holding them at  bay, \nwith machines like the  Norton CS1 reputed to  give 28bhp \nand  almost 100mph. \nAfter a  TT  apprenticeship that started back in  1922, \nSyd Crabtree provided the  Excelsior marque with its  first \nTT  victory in  the  1929 Lightweight race. Still fitted with \nhand gearchange, the  Excelsior did  have four speeds and \n8in-diameter brake drums, which were noticeably large for \na  250. Pietro Ghersi led  the  race for  five laps on  his  rapid \nMoto Guzzi before retiring, and he  knocked 1 minute 10 \nseconds off the previous fastest lap time, setting a  new fig- \nure  of 66.63mph. \nSPEEDS \nBefore leaving the 1920s, a  look at  the  growth in  speeds \nachieved between 1920 and 1929 shows that it really justi- \nfied the title ofa speedy decade, for lap times increased every \nyear in  all  classes except when affected by wet weather. \nFastest lap speeds in the  Senior class went from 55.62mph \nto 73.55mph, representing growth of 32 per cent. That was \nto  be  the  highest percentage rate of growth in  TT  history \nfor the class, much of it deriving from the vast  improvement \nto  road surfaces in the  first half of the  decade. \n\n38  AsSPEEDY DECADE \nplace. \nIn the  Junior and  Lightweight classes, growth in  speed \nover the  decade was even greater at  38  and 55  per  cent, \nrespectively. \nCRISIS? \nDespite the limited opportunities available to  publicize the \nTT inits early years, the Isle of  Man  was  gradually becoming \nknown as  an  island of speed and a TT  win was  held in high \nregard, even outside the  world of motorcycling. Through \nthe  1920s many of the manufacturers who achieved a Senior \nTT  victory received a civic welcome and  celebration when \nthey returned to their home towns. There the Tourist Tro- \nphy, together with the  race-winning machines and  riders, \nwere publicly feted in  recognition of the  glory brought to \nthe  area by the  win. However, despite its  prestige, some \nHenry Tyrell-Smith fell  from his  Rudge at  Glen Helen when leading the 1929 Senior \nTT. After a delay, he  remounted and carried on  with three cracked ribs to  take third \nclaimed that not  all was well \nwith the event and in  the \naftermath of the  1929 races, \nthe respected and influen- \ntial  magazine The  Motor Cycle \nquestioned the  future of the \nTT, using headlines like ‘A \nCrisis in  the  History of the \nSport’ and  even asking ‘Will \nthere be another TT?’ \nLooking back, it  seems \nthat The Motor Cycle could not \ncome to  terms with the  fact \nthat the nature of the TT had \nchanged. No  longer was the \nprimary aim of  competing \nmanufacturers to develop \ntheir ‘ideal touring motorcy- \ncles’ from the machines they \nraced —  which is what the TT \nwas originally created for. \nInstead, they knew that the \nTT was by now a sporting \nspectacle of speed, for which \nthey had to  develop special- \nized racing models. Through \nthe 1920s it  had been seen \nthat success in  TT racing \nenhanced a  manufacturer’s name and brought increased \nsales of his  road-going machines. Such a  spin-off extended \nto more than just the winning marque, for a top ten  placing \nwas held in high regard and even entering the  TT  brought \nbenefits to  a manufacturer’s image. \nThere was still knowledge to  be gained from racing that \ncould be used to  the benefit of roadsters, but that was  now \nseen as  a  bonus, rather than the  primary purpose of com- \npeting. However, racing was an  expensive business, and at \nthe  end  of the  1920s the  world was feeling the  effect of an \neconomic recession, which even a  TT  win could not  over- \ncome with increased sales. Some manufacturers could no \nlonger afford to  develop special race machines and  perhaps \nit was those that The Motor Cycle had  in mind when it advo- \ncated that the  event be remodelled. \n\nGP ERS TERE: \nEAS FOREIGNERS \n1930: BUSINESS AS  USUAL \nThe Isle  of Man regarded the  Tourist Trophy races mainly \nas  an  enhancement to  its  tourist industry, as  something \nto  publicize the  island’s name to  the  wider world. To  this \nend, in  1930 it belatedly offered financial support to  the \nevent, allocating a  sum of £5,000, of which £3,500 went \nto  attracting and  paying the  expenses of foreign riders and \n£1,500 to  supplement prize money. The latter was set  at \n£200 to the winning entrant and £50 to the winning rider, \nwith entry fees of £33. \nThere were eleven ‘foreign’ entries, plus thirteen ‘colo- \nnials’ in  1930. They were part of the  total entry of around \n135  across the  three races, to  be run  on  Monday, Wednes- \nday and Friday of race week. Almost all were riding British- \nbuilt machines, with many on  KTT Velocettes, which Bob \nHolliday described as  the  first ‘over-the-counter’ replicas \nof race-winning motorcycles to  be  marketed. The ‘Velo’ \nwas an  honest 350cc race bike of which Titch Allen wrote \n‘nothing was  added for effect or for sales appeal and nothing \nwas omitted for price cutting’. \nDespite the previous year’s suggestions by The Motor Cycle \nthat radical change was required for the  event, demand for \nrides in  1930 suggested that contestants were content with \nthe existing arrangements. There were a  few changes, \nhowever, the principal one  being that practice was  reduced \nfrom two weeks to  nine days, with the  first session being \non  a  Thursday. All  were early morning, even though the \norganizers had been asking to  run evening sessions for \nseveral years. \nThere had  been more road improvements, which would \nhelp to  reduce lap times. Particularly beneficial was the \nsubstantial widening on  the  approach to  Glen Helen, plus \nwidening at Kirk Michael and  through to  Ballaugh. As well \nas \nmaking \nthose \nstretches \nfaster, \nit \nalso \ncreated \nimproved \nopportunities \nfor \novertaking, \nan \nimportant \nfactor \nfor \ntop \nriders \nseeking \nto \nset \ngood \ntimes. \nHowever, \nsome \nof \nthe \ntime \ngain \nwas \nprobably \nlost \nby \nthe \nreported \npoor \nroad \nconditions \nat \nBray \nHill \nand \nWindy \nCorner. \nAlso, \nriders \ntold \nhow \nthere \nwas \na \ntendency \nfor \nthe \ntarred \nsurfaces \nto \nsoften \non \nthe \nrac- \ning \nline \nduring \nthe \nlatter \nstages \nof \na \nrace, \neven \nat \nnormal \nS oo \nWorks to  widen the approach to  Glen Helen before the \n1930 TT. \nThe 500cc JAP 500 twin-cylinder engine for 1930.

Road finishes were not  so  well developed as \ntoday and  in hot weather exposed tar  would melt, creating \nhazardous conditions to  race over. \nThe Wolverhampton-built Sunbeam marque finished the \n1920s with two consecutive Senior TT  wins for  Charlie \nDodson, and he  was back with his  George Dance-tuned \nmachine in  1930, looking for a hat  trick. Norton had  been \nabsent from the podium places since Alec Bennett’s Senior \nwin in  1927, but  with a  much-modified ohc engine from \nArthur Carroll and Joe Craig, they were hoping to get back \nto winning ways. Velocette had a longer-stroke engine, AJS \nreturned with its  chain-driven ohc models in  both Senior \nand  Junior classes, while, in addition to  its  single-cylinder \nengines, JAP had a 500cc twin available, which was  used by \nthe  Excelsior, Cotton and OK Supreme concerns. \nMagnesium alloy was starting to  be used to  save weight. \nThere was also a  trend for  brake-drums to  be  ribbed to \naid  cooling, while the  customary copper pipes that con- \nducted oil and petrol around the outside of the engine were \nbeing replaced by armoured rubber versions to  aid reliabil- \nity.  All  contributed to  the  step-by-step improvements to \nracing motorcycles of the  time; if they survived practice, \nsuch improvements would then be  given the  ultimate test \nof seven racing laps over the  Mountain Course. \nA RUDGE YEAR \nRudge had achieved an  encouraging third place finish in the \n1929 Senior race, their first time on  the podium since Cyril \nPullin’s Senior TT  win of 1914. For 1930 they came with \ntheir \ntried-and-tested \n4-valve \nheads \non  \nSenior \nmachines \nand \nan \nadvanced \nradial \n4-valve \nlayout \non \nJunior \nmachines, \nwhich \ntheir \ndesigner \nand \ncompetition \nchief \nGeorge \nHack \nconsidered \nto \nbe \nstill \nexperimental. \nPractice gave an  indication of  what was  to come and race \ntime proved highly successful for Rudge. With his forceful \nriding style, Wal Handley stormed to  victory in the  Senior \non  one of the  Coventry-built machines, setting new race \nand lap records, even though the weather deteriorated dur- \ning the  race. He  was  backed by Graham Walker, who took \nsecond place, with Jimmy Simpson (Norton) in  third. In \ntaking just 29  minutes 41  seconds to  set  the  new outright \nlap record at  76.28mph, Handley became the  first man to \nlap at  under 30 minutes. \nUsing its  experimental 350, Rudge went even better in \nthe  Junior race, taking the  first three places with Henry \nTyrell-Smith, Ernie Nott and Graham Walker, again with \nrecord race average and lap speeds, the  former going to \nTyrell-Smith and  the  latter to  Ernie Nott at  72.20mph. \nAs ever in TT racing, most interest was generated by the \nSenior race, followed by the  Junior, with the  Lightweight \nbringing up  the  rear. The 1930 Lightweight completed a \nrecord-breaking year on  the  Island, with Jimmy Guthrie \nriding an  AJS to  first place and reducing the  race time by \n34  minutes, while Wal Handley took the  fastest lap on  his \nRex-Acme, just beating Ghersi’s record of 1929 with a new \nfigure of 66.86mph. \nAfter the  success of Sunbeam racing motorcycles in the \n1920s, which included four Senior TT wins, the company’s \nbest showing in  1930 was fourth place \nin  the  Senior for  Charlie Dodson. In \nthe  words of Sunbeam expert Gordon \nChamp, ‘this was to  be the  end  of seri- \nous  racing’ by Sunbeam, who by then \nwere owned by the industrial conglom- \nerate Cl. \nThere is  an  old  saying that ‘racing \nimproves the breed’, and while the race \nmachines of  1930 were moving away \nfrom models produced for  the  road, \nthose manufacturers at  the  top  of the \nracing tree, like Sunbeam, Rudge, \nWal Handley taking victory in the \n1930 Senior TT  in the wet. That road \nsurface looks slippery! \nor \n\nNorton and  AJS, were also  producing \nvery competent road-going motorcy- \ncles, whose performance, handling \nand reliability must have benefited \nfrom their TT racing experiences. \n1931: MORE SPEED \nThe top manufacturers of 1930 \nreturned for  the  1931 TT, along with \nmakes like OK-Supreme, Raleigh, \nMontgomery, Douglas, New Imperial \nand  others, while among entries from \nabroad came FN, NSU, Moto Guzzi \nand Motosacoche. The fifty-eight \nentries for  the Senior race, fifty-one \nfor  the  Junior and  forty-four for  the \nLightweight gave a total entry of 153, \nalmost twenty more than in  1930. \nIncreased knowledge of combustion \nchamber shape and port design was \nyielding engines with more power, \nsome of which were fitted with downdraught carburettors. \nThe wider adoption of four-speed gearboxes helped make \nthe  best use  of this power. The business of stopping was \nalso  subject to  improvement, with larger-diameter ribbed \ndrums and experiments with linked brakes. JAP engine \ndevelopment had been spurred in  part by their participa- \ntion in  the  new sport of dirt-track/speedway racing and \ntheir highly tuned singles were running 8:1  compression \nratios and  offering peak power at 6,000rpm. \nTo  enable riders to  ‘get down to  it’, reduce wind resist- \nance and take advantage of the  increased power on  offer, \nmore machines were fitted with rear mudguard pads, and \nthe  occasional one with one-piece rearward saddle exten- \nsions. Pre-TT rumours of the  appearance of supercharged \nengines in 1931 proved mostly unfounded, although Harold \nWillis did  take a  supercharged Velocette out  for a  lap dur- \ning practice. \nThe general growth in speeds meant that mid-race mend- \ning of punctures and other roadside repairs were largely a \nthing of the  past, particularly for  potential winners. Race \nbikes no  longer carried tool boxes, although some riders \nstill thrust a couple of spare sparking plugs in a pocket and \na plug spanner down a riding boot. \nWHERE’S THAT? \nThe \nnaming \nof \nparts \nof \nthe  \ncourse \nwas \nnot  \nas  \nclear \nas  \nit \nis  \ntoday \nand \nreports \nof \nthe  \ntime \nsaying \nthat \n‘Glen \nHelen \nhad \nbeen \neased \noff \nat  \nthe  \ntop’ \nand \n‘Creg \nWilley’s \nCorner \nmuch \nwidened’, \nwere \nboth \nprobably \nreferring \nto  \nworks \nat \nON lS \neS i RP \nSY ee \nfo  Mee \nCharlie Dodson takes Hillberry at  speed in  1932. \nwhat today is known as  Sarah’s Cottage. One ACU official \nthought that particular ‘easing’ would save riders two or \nthree seconds a lap, for  it also included widening of Creg \nWyllies. The stretch between Ballaugh and Sulby was said \nto  have been relaid, while that from the  Black Hut to  Creg \nny Baa  had  been resurfaced. At  Brandish, the  ditch on  the \noutside had been filled and the  road widened, and  riders \nclaimed they could now take it 8—10mph faster than before. \nThe last improvement contributed to  riders achieving \nincreased speed on  the  approach to  Hillberry, which Gra- \nham Walker and Alec Bennett said was  now 100mph, while \nHillberry itself was taken at  7Omph. Their opinions of \nspeeds at other locations in  1931 were: Bray Hill 100mph, \nQuarter Bridge 35mph, Braddan Bridge 45—50mph, Bal- \nlacraine 40mph, Ballaugh Bridge 50mph, Sulby Bridge \n45mph, the Bungalow 40mph, Windy Corner 50mph, \nKate’s Cottage (they still  called it Keppel Gate) 80mph and \nCreg ny Baa  40mph. \nPRACTICE \nRiders used the  early morning practice periods to  work \nup  to  race speed, but  attitudes to  practice varied. Casual \ncompetitors would put in one  lap and  then retire to  one  of \nthe  refreshment tents in  the  Paddock, provided courtesy \nof Dunlop and Cadbury. There they would exchange gos- \nsip before returning to  their hotels for  breakfast. Stanley \nWoods tells a  story from 1934 that, after making an  invol- \nuntary stop at  the  Sulby Glen Hotel, he  wheeled his  bike \nround the back and found several others parked. Going into \n\n42  M  FAST FOREIGNERS \nthe  hotel he  saw that the  other competitors had stopped \nfrom choice and  were taking cups of tea  before setting off \nagain. Those with a more serious approach would put in as \nmany as  three laps each morning, perhaps four, often stop- \nping at the  pits between laps to  make adjustments. \nRaces were still run over seven laps and riders custom- \narily made two pit stops, meaning that one of their riding \nsessions during a race would be a non-stop three laps. Dur- \ning one practice session in  1931 Jimmy Simpson claimed \nto  have put in  four laps without stopping. This would have \nbeen of concern to  others, for Norton were already show- \ning good form in practice and  if they were able to  get away \nwith only one pit-stop during the  race, they would save \nanother 40—45 seconds. \nRACING \nJoe  Craig had  been working as  competitions manager of \nNorton for  almost two years, and his  efforts with much- \nmodified ohc  engines finally met with success at  the  1931 \nTT.  And what success! Rudge had  all but  swept the  board \nin  the  Senior and  Junior events of  1930 and  Norton cop- \nied their winning ways in  1931, leaving Rudge to  take one \nthird place in the Junior, although their 250s did  take first \nand second places in the Lightweight, with Graham Walker \nachieving his  first TT  win. But  it was young Percy ‘Tim’ \nHunt who rode his Model 30 (500cc) and Model 40 (350cc) \nNortons to record-breaking victories in the Senior and Jun- \nior  TTs, the  first time such a double had  been achieved. \nRiders had to  contend with the  vagaries of the  Manx \nweather during racing in  1931, for in the Junior race a gale \nblew \ndown \nthe \nMountain \nand \nin \nthe \nSenior \nit \nblew \nthem \nup. \nThis \nplayed \nhavoc \nwith \ntheir \nchoice \nof \ngearing, \nbut  \nthose \nwith \nfour-speed \ngearboxes \nwere \nlikely \nto  \nhave \nfared \nbetter \nthan \nthe  \nthree-speeders. \nNorton, \nhaving \npreviously \nrelied \non \nthree \nspeeds, \nnow \nreaped \nthe \nbenefit \nof \nhaving \na \nnew \nfour-speeder. \nIt was another year of substantial advancement in  both \nrace average and lap speeds, with machine development \nmaking the major contribution to the setting of new  records \nin  all  classes. Jimmy Simpson (Norton) became the  first \nto  break the  80mph barrier, when he  went round on  his \n500  at  80.82mph. ‘Tim’ Hunt lifted the  Junior record to \n75.27mph and Graham Walker put almost 5mph onto the \nLightweight lap record, lifting it from 66.86 to  71.73mph— \nan  astonishing achievement. It was also another year when \nthe  leader board was  monopolized by British machines and \nriders, with names like Guthrie, Woods, Nott, Mellors, \nTyrell-Smith and Handley taking the  podium places. The \nlast-named rider failed to  complete the  Senior, however, \nafter falling at  the  bend some half a mile past the  Eleventh \nMilestone, which now carries his  name. While foreign \nmachines and  riders were present, they made relatively lit- \ntle impression on  race results. \nThe BBC made time to  broadcast a  limited account of \nthe  Senior TT  in  1931, which provided good publicity for \nmanufacturers and  the  event. It was something the  corpo- \nration allocated more time to  in  the  years that followed, \neventually transmitting TT reports worldwide and helping \ndevelop what was becoming a global fan base. \n1932: TECHNICAL ADVANCES \nThe island welcomed the  TT  back in  1932 \nand works teams set  up  their temporary \nworkshops in  local premises belonging to \nhotels, garages, engineers and even under- \ntakers. Others with business at the TT, like \ntrade representatives, would base them- \nselves in hotels, where their contact details \nwould be  publicized in  local newspapers \nand the motorcycle magazines, The TT \nSpecial advised, for  example, that Reuben \nHarveyson was  at the Castle Mona Hotel on \nbehalf of Ferodo, while Sid  Burns, of the \nNorton riders like Stanley Woods \nbecame frequent visitors to the  winners \nenclosure during the 1930s. Joe Craig is \nstanding second from the left. \n\nVelocette proudly advertised their TT  victories with this \ntransfer on  the petrol tank of their machines. \ncompeting Fibrax brand of stopping material, was at  the \nCarlton Hotel. \nNorton had not  only impressed with their speed and reli- \nability when they swept the board in  1931, but also with the \nhandling of their Senior and Junior machines. This spurred \nother makers to work on  improving handling over the ensu- \ning winter but, as  ever in  the  racing game, Norton also \nworked to  stay ahead of the opposition on  the road-holding \nfront, coming to  the  1932 TT  with front forks fitted with \nextended links and new damper springs to  aid the previous \nsingle spring. They also made use  of new magnesium alloy \n(elektron) crankcases and other weight-saving measures, \nwhich resulted in  the  500 weighing in  at  312]b (142kg), \nwhile the 350 was said to  be  298lb (135kg). Both came \nwith larger-capacity petrol tanks and, like virtually eve- \nryone else, now used 14mm sparking plugs instead of the \nearlier 18mm type. \nBurman, Albion and  Sturmey-Archer could supply four- \nspeed gearboxes, while Velocette redesigned their own \nbox. Some firms were said to  be  experimenting with the \nuse  of plain bearing big-ends, others were modifying their \nlubrication systems, and  Rudge decided to  stick with its use \nof coupled brakes. Almost every rider now used a  twist- \ngrip-type throttle; returning Alec Bennett \nstill prefered the  old  lever type, but  set  to \nself-return. \nThere had  been a  considerable fall  in  sales \nof new motorcycles in  the early 1930s and \nmanufacturers who went to  the  expense of \nTT  racing were all  hoping for  good results. \nThese would bring favourable publicity and \nApproaching Sulby Crossroads, part-way \ndown the Sulby Straight, in the 1930s. \nFAST FOREIGNERS @  43 \nboost sales, for  motorcyclists of the  time were impressed \nby Isle  of Man performances and  enjoyed having the  name \nof a TT-winning bike on  the  tank. There were over twenty \nmakes competing, including a  first entry of Jawas in  the \nSenior, which were described as  workmanlike jobs in  red \nand  gold, but  on  the  heavy side. \nSULBY SPEED TRAP \nThe  TT Special newspaper made a point of timing riders dur- \ning practice. Sometimes it would be  from point to  point, \nsuch as  Ramsey to  the  Bungalow, or  even over the  short \nlength involved in  rounding and exiting the  dip at  Gover- \nnor’s Bridge, They also timed riders over a  1-mile stretch \nof the Sulby Straight and quoted the speeds attained. While \nthe  redone figures were keenly awaited by readers, they \ntended to ignore anumber of factors that affected the quoted \nspeeds. For example, due to  riders tackling the  preceding \nQuarry Bends with varying degrees of skill, not  everyone \nwas at  maximum speed when they entered the  mile. Also, \nsome 500s were applying their brakes for  Sulby Bridge \nbefore the  end of the  timed stretch. Clearly, it  was not  a \ntotally accurate affair, particularly as  there was no  guaran- \ntee  that timed riders were always at full throttle. Top riders \nwere also sometimes missing from the  published figures, \nperhaps because they had missed that particular practice \nsession. In addition, the  reports seldom mentioned if there \nwere favourable or  adverse wind conditions that could have \naffected the  speeds achieved. During one  timing session in \n1932, fastest 500 was Henry Tyrell-Smith on  a  Rudge at \nexactly 100mph, a similar speed being reached by the  fast- \nest  350, Harold Willis on  a  Velocette, while Wal Handley \nwas the  quickest Lightweight on  a  Rudge at  88.6mph. \nRiders acquainted themselves with the latest road \nimprovements during practice in  1932, the  most beneficial \nof which was widening at  Laurel Bank. Come the  racing, \nit  proved to  be  another successful year for  Norton, with \nStanley Woods riding to  victory in  both the Senior and \n\n44  M  FAST FOREIGNERS \nJunior events at record race average speeds. Stanley also set \na  new lap record in  the  Junior of 78.62mph, with Jimmy \nSimpson (Norton) recording a new fastest lap in the  Senior \nof 81.50mph. As  in  1931, Norton took first, second and \nthird in  the  Senior with Stanley Woods, Jimmy Guthrie \nand Jimmy Simpson; while in the Junior, it was  Rudge who \nfilled second and third places with Wal Handley and Henry \nTyrell-Smith. In the  Lightweight race, Leo  Davenport took \nfirst place at  record-breaking speed on  a  New Imperial, \nand Rudge were second and third with Graham Walker \nand Wal Handley, the  latter setting a  new record fastest \nlap of 74.08mph. To  put  the  rapidly increasing speeds in \nthe  Lightweight in  context, Handley’s lap record in  1932 \nwas faster than the  lap record of 73.55mph set  by Charlie \nDodson when winning the  1929 Senior TT. \nMotorcycle racing was  yet to have its own World Cham- \npionship, but  by now there was an  established circuit of \nContinental Grand Prix and other major races. Norton \ncarried their TT  form into such events, taking victory in \neleven of the  twelve major races they contested in  1932 \nand proudly advertising, “The machine that can success- \nfully stand up to the terrific strain of racing, is the machine \nthat will offer best service to  the  ordinary tourist’. \nEVER FASTER \nEveryone had become used to  TT lap  and race speeds \nincreasing year on  year, but  why was this? The topic was \nconsidered in  the  previous chapter and the  main reasons \nidentified. They were course improvements, increased \nengine power and improved braking and  handling, along \nwith input from star riders. Other contributory factors have \nbeen mentioned: the move from hand to foot change, four- \nspeed gearboxes, use  of lighter materials, more responsive \nengines, wider tyres, changes to race regulations and so  on, \nbut a growing contribution was  being made by the increase \nin mechanical reliability, which meant that machines could \nbe ridden harder for longer. Speaking of the  situation that \nexisted when he started TT  racing some ten  years before, \n1932 double winner Stanley Woods told how race machines \nof the  earlier time were relatively fragile, saying, in effect, \nthat anyone who went off fast  into the  lead at  a TT  would \nnot  be  expected to  win, or  even finish, for  despite being \nracing bikes, they had  to  be treated with care and  ‘nursed’ \nthrough such a long race. \nIn  1932 riders still started with cold engines, so  they may \nhave gone easy on  the  throttle for  the  first few  miles, but \nthereafter it was flat  out, if necessary, although they still \npreferred to ride with something in hand. Not that the reli- \nability problem had been completely solved, for Norton had \ntwo  works machines break down in  the  1932 Junior; they \nwere \nprobably \nbeing \nridden \nto  \ntheir \nlimits, \nfor \nwhen \nriders \nlike \nWoods, \nGuthrie, \nSimpson \nand  \nHunt \nwere \nstriving \nfor \nvictory, \nthe \ncompetition \nwas \nintense. \nNorton \ndid \nintroduce \na \nsystem \nof \nriding \nto  \nteam \norders, \naimed \nat \npreventing \nriders \nbreaking \ntheir \nmachines \nin \ncom- \npetition \nwith \neach \nother. \nAt \nthe \nTT \nthe \nagreement \nwas \nthat \nthey \nwould \nrace \nfor \nthe \nfirst \nthree \nlaps \nand \nthereafter \nmain- \ntain \ntheir \npositions \nto \nthe \nend. \nIt was \nnot \npopular \namongst \nsuch \na competitive \ngroup \nof riders \nand \nled \nto \nStanley \nWoods \nsetting \nup \nhis \nown \nsignalling \nsystem \nat Sulby \nto \nsupplement \nthe \ninformation \npassed \nto \nhim \nby \nNorton \nat the \npits. \nWhile increased reliability would have come mainly \nfrom the efforts of individual manufacturers, the long-term \nparticipation in  racing of suppliers of items like carburet- \ntors, tyres, chains, sparking plugs, petrol, oil  and so  on \nhad seen them improve the  quality of their products and \nmake a  material contribution to  overall reliability. Having \nsaid that, after a  post-race inspection of the  top-finishing \nmachines in  1932, The Motor Cycle told its readers that ‘many \nof the chains were in a disgraceful state ...  including broken \nrollers’. But  264 racing miles was  a long way for an  exposed \nchain to go without attention, for there was  no  lubrication, \nnor  was  there easy facility to  adjust them at pit stops. \nTHRILLS AND SPILLS \nMention has  been made of intense competition between \nriders, and Jimmy Simpson recalled the  times with the \nwords, ‘the race of the  moment was the one thing that \nmattered —  there was no  thought for  the  future, no  count \nof the  risk’. Most riders got  swept along by the  competi- \ntive atmosphere that prevailed, but  some were found out \nby the  demanding nature of the  Mountain Course. Spills \nwere frequent in the  early days, when riders would usually \npick themselves up,  kick the  bike into shape and carry on \nracing. But as  speeds increased, what were previously spills \nturned into what were more appropriately called crashes. \nThe consequences of such incidents on  such an  unforgiv- \ning course could be serious and  fatalities became more fre- \nquent. That was a high price to  pay  for what was primarily \na sporting event. \n1933: REDUCED ENTRY NUMBERS \nFrom a total entry of 153  across the three races in 1931, the \nfigure \nfell \nto \nninety-five \nin \n1932, \nthen \npicked \nup \nslightly \nto \nninety-eight \nin \n1933, \nwhich \nincluded \nforeign \nmachines \nsuch \nas \nJawa, \nMoto \nGuzzi \nand \nEysink. \nManufacturers \ncome \nand \ngo \nat \nthe \nTT \nfor \nvarious \nreasons, \nand \nin \n1933 \nRudge, \nwho \nhad \nhit \ntrading \ndifficulties, \ndid \nnot \nsubmit \nworks \nentries. \nFortunately, \nthey \ndid \nmake \ntheir \nrace \nbikes \navailable \nto \ntheir \nprevious \nteam \nriders, \nGraham \nWalker, \nHenry \nTyrell- \ni \n\nSmith \nand  \nErnie \nNott, \nbut \nperhaps \nlacking \nthe  \ncompetitive \nedge \nthat \ncomes \nfrom \na \ntrue \nworks \neffort, \nthe \nonly \npodium \nplace \nfor \na  \nRudge \nin  \n1933 \nwas \na \nthird \nfor \nprivateer \nCharlie \nManders \nin \nthe \nLightweight \nrace. \nThe \nposition \nof \nRudge \nwas \na  \nreflection \nof \nthe  \ndifficult \neconomic \nconditions \nin  \nBritain \nat  \nthe \ntime, \nwhere \nthe \nsales \nof \nnew \nmotorcycles \nplunged \nfrom \n146,700 \nin \n1929 \nto \n52,200 \nin \n1933. \nThe \nTT \norganizers \ncould \ndo \nnothing \nbut \nsoldier \non, \nalthough \nthe \nreduced \nentries \nin \neach \nrace \nmeant \nriders \nwere \nwell \nspaced \nout \naround \nthe \n37% \nmiles \nof \nthe \nMountain \nCourse, \nparticularly \nas \nninety-eight \nentries \ndid \nnot \nguarantee \nninety-eight \nstarters, \nfor \nmajor \nmechanical \nfaults \nand \ninjuries \nto \nriders \nusually \nresulted \nin \na \nproportion \nof \nnon-starters. \nTHE MOUNTAIN COURSE \nBy now well established in its fully tarmacadamed state, the \ncourse was subject to  regular wear and  tear from ordinary \ntraffic, meaning that periodic resurfacing was necessary — \nand, given its  length, this was carried out  in  stages. The \nresult was that conditions varied from year to  year and rid- \ners  were always keen to  know the  state of the  roads before \nsetting out  to  practise. After the  Highways Board had  fin- \nished its preparations for the  1933 TT, which included wid- \nening and easing at the Thirty-third Milestone, one  journal \nreported ‘there is now a surface on  the roads that will glad- \nden  the hearts of the  riders’. \nMention has already been made of the hazard created for \nriders by molten tar  and  it was  something they just had  to \nface up to.  Efforts were sometimes made to  lessen its effect \nby sprinkling the  worst areas with sand or  cement dust but \nthat really was a  mixed blessing for  racers to  cope with at \nspeed. \nThere has  been a  long-held view amongst some of those \nwho visit the  Isle of Man just for the  racing that any  altera- \nBraking \nhard \nbut \nwith \ncare \non  \nthe \napproach \nto  \nCreg \nny \nBaa. \nFAST FOREIGNERS Mf  45 \ntion carried out  to  the  Mountain Course is done primarily \nfor the  benefit of the  TT  races. That is not  so.  Outside the \nfour weeks of the  TT  and MGP periods they are  ordinary \nroads traversed by the  cars, lorries, buses and  motorcycles \nof the island’s residents. As traffic demands increase, safety \nmeasures like the  easing of blind bends, the  need for  road \nwidening and  other highway engineering requirements, all \nbring about change. This has  been going on  for over a  cen- \ntury, for  the  benefit of Manx road users. Those improve- \nments have undoubtedly played a major part in making the \ncourse faster for riders and thus have increased race speeds, \nbut  a  truer description of the  official attitude to  highway \nimprovements is  that the authorities have regard to  the \nimpact of their works on  the  racing and try  to  avoid any \nadverse effects. \nBy 1933 the  Highways Board was talking proudly of its \n‘non-skid’ road surfacing, but it was still a hand-spread tar- \nmacadam mix, finished by rolling and, after a  year or  so, \nsurface dressed with tar  and  chippings to  extend its  life. \nOne good thing about improved surfacing and course \nimprovements was  that it did allow riders to  make the most \nof  the extra power and speed that manufacturers were \nbuilding into their race machines. As ever, it was  top riders \nwho could extract the  greatest benefit and their services \nwere in  high demand. With the  natural tendency of such \ntop  riders to  be  offered the  fastest machines, it increased \nthe performance gap between them and  ordinary riders on \nlesser machinery. \nTop riders also sought to  maximize their earnings by \nmoving between manufacturers and sometimes riding for \nmore than one make. In  1933, fast  man Wal Handley was \nentered on  an  OK-Supreme in the  Senior, Velocette in the \nJunior and  Excelsior in the Lightweight. Messrs Burney and \nBlackburne provided a  new 250cc engine for  the Excel- \nsior, which became known as  the  Mechanical Marvel. It \nhad  a radial 4-valve head, two splayed inlet ports and  twin \nexhaust ports. \nWEIGHT SAVING \nAs  mentioned earlier, growth in  performance brought the \nrequirement for  racing motorcycles to  be  strengthened in \nall areas, with bulked-up components in engines, plus stur- \ndier frames and associated parts, wider tyres and larger fuel \ntanks. The result of this was to  increase machine weights \nthrough the late 1920s and  early 1930s. While the  need to \nretain overall strength remained, manufacturers attempted \nto  compensate for  increased weight by making more use \nof light alloys in  areas like  crankcases, gearbox shells, cyl- \ninder heads, cylinder finning, hubs, mudguards, engine \nplates, brake plates, handlebars and  anywhere else where \n\n46  M@  FAST FOREIGNERS \nthey could reduce the load to  be  carried for  264 racing \nmiles. There were also experimental light-alloy wheel rims \navailable. \nCHANGES \nAmong some obvious changes to  machinery in  1933 was \nheel and  toe  form of gearchange lever, commonly seen on \nContinental machines and now adopted by a  few British \nriders. Sunbeam had used hairpin valve springs for  some \ntime, and  they could now also be  seen on  Velocettes and \nJawas, for most valve gear was  still  partially exposed. Nor- \nton  used aluminium-bronze cylinder heads, and  the  use  of \nbronze to  aid  thermal conductivity was adopted by other \nmanufacturers over the  next few years, sometimes just as \na  ‘skull’ for the  combustion chamber. The only two-stroke \nentry was  that of a  Scott going under the name of the  Rey- \nnolds Special, entered by Liverpool motorcycle dealer A.E. \nReynolds. \nRace regulations had previously required exhaust pipes \nto extend back as  far as  the centre of the rear wheel spindle, \nbut  growing knowledge of the  important effect of exhaust \npipe length on  performance saw  that requirement dropped. \nForeign machines were still trying to make an  impression \nand Jawa brought a  350cc single to join its  500, which had \ngained a little speed to  go with its  reliability. The 500 had \na sheet metal frame, unit construction of engine and  gear- \nbox, and  coupled brakes. Husqvarna also made an  appear- \nance, with a motorcycle that was  rated as  fast but heavy and \nwith poor handling. In  1933 foreign machines and riders \nhad yet to  make an  impact on  Island racing, while all  the \nwinning was being done by single-cylinder machines. \nNORTON DOMINATE \nThe history books show that Norton swept the board at the \n1933 TT. In  the  Senior, Stanley Woods led  home Jimmy \nSimpson and Tim Hunt at record-breaking race average and \nlap speeds and he did the same in the Junior from Hunt and \nJimmy Guthrie. It was a  comprehensive demolition of the \nopposition, on  a  scale not  previously seen, with reports of \nthe  time claiming that Norton’s 500 gave just over 30bhp \nat  5,500rpm, on  a compression ratio of 7.1:1. \nWith his  double victory in  1933 following his  similar \ndouble in  1932, Stanley Woods now had six TT wins and, at \njust over thirty years of age, stood at the pinnacle of motor- \ncycle racing. Importantly, he had  reached the  top with the \nreputation of invariably bringing his  machine to  the  fin- \nish.  Woods gave a few  insights into his riding style, telling \nthat achieving the  greatest possible speeds on  the  fastest \nbends was  of prime importance, rather than trying too hard \non  the  slower ones; and that taking a  line that missed the \nworst \nbumps \nwas \noften \nbetter \nthan \nusing \nwhat \nlooked \nlike \nthe \nobvious \nbut \nbumpy \none. \nIt \nwas \nstill \na \nlittle \nbefore \nthe \nuse \nof \nrev \ncounters, \nso \nhe \ndrove \nthe \nengine \nby \near, \nalways \nclosing \nthe \nthrottle \non \nupward \nchanges \nand \neasing \nit over \njumps, \nin \nboth \ninstances \naiming \nto \navoid \nover-revving. \nHe \nindulged \nin \nminimal \nslipping \nof \nthe \nclutch \nand \nused \nboth \nbrakes \ntogether, \nthe \nfront \nharder \nthan \nthe \nrear. \nHe \nstopped \nonly \nonce \nfor \nfuel \nin \nthe \nseven-lap \nSenior \nrace, \nwhen \nhe \ntook \non \nthe \npetrol/benzole \nmix \nused \nby \nmost \nteams. \nWith such a  commanding performance in  the Senior \nand Junior races, Norton rather took the  attention away \nfrom Syd Gleave’s record-breaking ride to  victory on  his \nnew Excelsior ‘Mechanical Marvel’ in the Lightweight. But \nwhile Norton received much praise for their performance, \nthey also came in  for  criticism, with some suggesting that \nsuch total dominance was bad for  the  future of the  TT. \nThe chance to  complain about the event also brought to the \nfore the  old  chestnut about it not  aiding the  development \nof road machines. This seemed to  be  the  excuse to  start \ntalking about its  future, with ideas ranging from having a \nmassed start to  having a  standard touring lira running it \non a short circuit. It was understandable that manufactur- \ners  putting money into the  event looked to  get something \npositive out  of it, but most people saw  the  TT  as  a sporting \nspectacle of speed, and  that is all they wanted of the  event. \n1934: MOUNTAIN ROAD \nThe long-standing problem of sheep wandering onto the \nMountain Road and into the  path of racing motorcyclists, \nwas largely cured for  the 1934 TT  after the  whole length \nwas fenced. The new fencing also allowed for the  removal \nRiders \nwere \nstill \nwearing \nbody-belts \nin \npost-war \nyears, \nas \nseen \nin \nthis \nphoto \nof \nDenis \nParkinson \nfrom \n1948. \n\nof \nthe \ngates \nacross \nthe  \nroad, \nwhich \npreviously \nhad \nto  \nbe \nopened \nby \nmarshals \nprior \nto \neach \npractice \nand \nrace \nsession. \nHowever, \nthe \nfencing \nrequired \nconcrete \nsupport \nposts, \nwhich \ncreated \nan \nunyielding \nbarrier \nto \nanyone \nwho \nrode \nwide \non \na \nbend. \nIt \nwas \na \ntime \nwhen \nthe \noutside \nof \nthose \nbends \nwould \nalso \nbe \ncrowded \nwith \nspectators \nleaning \non \nthe \nfence, \nin \na manner \nthat \nis not \nacceptable \ntoday. \nWhile the  course was reasonably well surfaced, it was \nvery bumpy at racing speeds and many riders wore a body- \nbelt of the  type more associated with off-road scrambling. \nThis would be worn over their two-piece horsehide leathers, \nalong with a tie-on waistcoat carrying their race number. \nENTRIES \nIn  1934 the  world was gradually coming out  of economic \nrecession and motorcycle sales were increasing, although \nthe benefits of that had  yet to  be felt at the TT, where over- \nall entries were only slightly up,  at  101. New to  the  event \nwas  the Vincent HRD Company with three entries on  JAP- \npowered 500s. It was a  brave venture by a  small concern, \nwhose total production in  1933 had been just under one \nhundred road-going motorcycles. Unusually for race bikes \nof the  time, they came fitted with rear suspension, some- \nthing which Philip Vincent had  utilized on  all his  motorcy- \ncles after taking over the  double TT-winning HRD name in \n19273. \nFOREIGN CHALLENGE \nThe early 1930s had seen British machines taking all  the \npodium places in  the  Senior, Junior and  Lightweight TTs \nand having little trouble in  repelling the  challenge of the \nfew foreign makes entered. However, top  man in  Island \nracing, Stanley Woods, a professional motorcycle racer out \nto  make the  best possible living, decided that he  had  had \nenough of Norton’s financially constricting team orders and \nlooked elsewhere for a  source of racing bikes for the  1934 \nseason. Bankrolled by a substantial retainer of £1,500 from \nthe  parent company of Mobiloil, he  came to  the  1934 TT \nwith entries on  a Husqvarna for the Senior, AJS for the Jun- \nior and  Moto Guzzi for the  Lightweight. \nWoods was an  astute man who left  nothing to  chance. \nMaking early visits to  the  three supplying factories, he \nworked with them to  improve the  bikes he  was planning \nto  race. Pre-TT testing left  him optimistic of putting up \na  good showing with the twin-cylinder Husqvarna and \nsingle-cylinder Moto Guzzi, but he rejected the  AJS as  not \ngood \nenough. \nOn \nthe \nrun-up \nto \nthe \nTT, \nhis \nplans \ngenerated \npremature \nheadlines \nlike \n‘British \nroad \nracing \nsupremacy \nin \njeopardy’. \nHusqvarna \nalso \nbrought \n500s \nfor \nErnie \nNott \nand \nGunar \nKalen, \nplus \na \n350 \nfor \nNott \nto \nride \nin \nthe \nJunior \nrace. \nJimmy Simpson copes with the bumps of the railway \nbridge at  Union Mills in  1934. \nNORTON AGAIN \nAfter all the  pre-event talk of the  foreign challenge, when \nit came to  the 1934 TT, Norton continued their winning \nways. With much modified, lightened and faster bikes, \nthey showed good form in  practice, with Jimmy Simpson \nrecorded on  the Sulby Straight at  106.5mph. They took \nthe  first two places in the  Senior race with Jimmy Guthrie \nand Jimmy Simpson, while Walter Rusk came third on \na  Velocette. It was  a  similar situation in  the  Junior, with \nGuthrie again winning from Simpson after a  neck-and- \nneck duel, and Ernie Nott bringing his  Husqvarna home \nin third. \nFollowing a  troublesome practice period, the  relatively \nnew to  the TT  ‘Husky’ of Stanley Woods held second place \nin the  wet Senior race until running out  of fuel on  the  last \nlap, just 10  miles from the  finish. It was a  good showing, \nand consolation for  Woods came in  the  form of the  fastest \nlap at  80.49mph, somewhat down on  the  lap record due  to \nthe poor conditions. \nThe Husqvarna performance was  considered a promising \none, for  having shed much weight and improved the  han- \ndling from 1933, the  bikes carried the  requisite speed and \nlooked a threat for the future. In addition they showed that \ntwin-cylinder machines could once again mount a serious \nchallenge to  the  singles, something that had  not  happened \nat the TT  for many years. \nIn  the  Lightweight class it was another convincing vic- \ntory for  the  speedy little Rudge singles, which were said \nto  develop 24bhp and were fast  enough to  claim the  first \nthree places with Jimmy Simpson, Ernie Nott and  Graham \nWalker. It gave a long-awaited TT win  to Jimmy at record- \nbreaking speed. \nRudge had fully expected to  be  challenged by Moto \nGuzzi in  the  Lightweight race, for  Stanley Woods unof- \nficially broke the  lap record by a big margin on  his first lap \n\n48  M@  FAST FOREIGNERS \nof practice. However, a  mistake during preparation in the \nGuzzi camp saw  Woods’ bike seize its engine on  the first lap \nof the  race, and  although he was  able to  continue, the  edge \nhad  gone off its  performance and  he finished fourth. As  in \nthe  Senior race, he  had done enough, however, to  show \nthat the  250  Italian Moto Guzzi could be a threat to  British \nmanufacturers in future years. \nThat 1934 Lightweight race was  blighted by the death of \nprevious winner, the  experienced Syd Crabtree, who fell \nfrom his Excelsior on  the Mountain. No one  saw  Crabtree’s \naccident in  the  misty conditions that prevailed and it was \nsometime before the organizers realized he was  missing and \norganized a  search party. It drew attention to  the  paucity \nof marshals on  the  Mountain section of the  course and  led \nto  the  creation of the  travelling marshals service the  fol- \nlowing year. \n1935: DEVELOPMENTS \nThe TT  was a year-long topic of discussion for the sporting \nmotorcyclist and  the motorcycle press. Early in  1935 came \na  rumour that the  4-cylinder, water-cooled and super- \ncharged Italian Rondine would come to  the  Island in June, \nbut that did not happen. Mention of such multi-cylinder for- \neign exotica had commentators on  the racing scene writing \nthat “British manufacturers are  literally clinging to  the  sin- \ngle although by rights its  day has  passed’. The Norton sin- \ngles had been further developed, with compression ratios \nlifted, power output of the  500 up to  34bhp, larger petrol \nand oil tanks, a  ‘new’ gearbox, a degree of enclosure to the \nrocker box and  a claimed maximum speed of 110mph. \nAn  early alloy rim, plated and riveted at the  join. \nMoto \nGuzzi, \nOEC \nand \nVincent \nHRD \nwere \nthe \nonly \nentries \nwith \nrear \nsuspension \nin \n1935, \na \nfeature \nmany \nconsid- \nered \nwas \nlong \noverdue \nfor \ngeneral \nuse \nin \nracing. \nMeanwhile, \never \nmore \nfirms \nwere \nusing \nlight \nalloys, \nwith \nincreasing \nuse \nin \nwheel \nrims, \neven \nthough \nsome \nfelt \nit necessary \nto \nrivet \na \nplate \nat the \njoin \nin \nconstruction. \nFirms were beginning to  experiment with megaphone \nexhausts to  boost top-end performance, Velocette and \nNorton among them, and  JAP offered a  twin-carburettor \narrangement on  their single-cylinder engines, via  two \ninduction pipes to  a  single inlet port. Cross rotary-valve \nengines were tried by Cotton and Rudge, while Excelsior \nappeared with a  new 250 ohc engine. Rev counters also \nmade an  appearance. They were a help in gaining optimum \nperformance and an  aid  to  reliability, and would come to \nbe universally adopted in the next few years. \nJoining the  foreign entries from NSU, Jawa and  Terrot \nwas the  German firm of DKW, with its  technically inter- \nesting 250cc split-single two-strokes, which were said to \ngive some 25bhp at  approaching 5,000rpm. They were \nwater-cooled, with a  piston-pump form of supercharging, \nand used rubber to  control movement of the  front forks \nrather than springs. Particularly noisy, with a  high fuel \nconsumption, they needed large petrol tanks. With the \nprestige of  a  TT  victory well recognized abroad, foreign \nmachines amounted to  some 20  per  cent of the  total 107 \nentries. \nStanley Woods returned in  1935 with Moto Guzzi \nrides in the  Lightweight and  Senior races, accompanied by \nOmobono Tenni. The 250  was  a development of the model \nhe had  used in  1934 and  the  500 was a  120  degree V-twin \nthat had been campaigned on  the Continent, but which \ncame to  the  island with a  new sprung frame, the  action of \nwhich was controlled by friction adjusters. Top speed was \nsaid  to  be  112mph. \nOn the organizational side, the requirement that \nmachines start a  race with cold engines was dropped and \na  warming-up period was given, in  which machines were \nridden up and down the  Glencrutchery Road, witha line of \nmetal dustbins keeping them apart. It was a  characteristic \nof the  Velocette racers that they did  not  deliver their full \nperformance \nuntil \nthoroughly \nwarm. \nSeemingly \nthat \ncould \ntake \na \nfull \nlap, \nperhaps \ndue \nto \nthem \ncarrying \na \ngallon \nof \nengine oil. \nJimmy \nSimpson \nhad  \nretired \nfrom \nracing \nat  \nthe  \nend \nof \n1934 \nand \nwas \nemployed \nin \nthe \ncompetition \ndepartment \nof \nShell \nOils. \nHe \nwas \npresent \nat \nthe \n1935 \nraces \nand, \nhav- \ning \nassessed \nthe \nlatest \nroad \nimprovements \nand \nresurfacing, \nexpressed \nthe \nview \nthat \nthey \nwere \nworth \n10 \nseconds \na \nlap \nto \ntop \nriders. \n\nFAST FOREIGNERS Mf  49 \nCie \nBattling it out in  1935. Number II  looks a little more determined than number 10. \nESCAPISM \nEnthusiasm for  TT  racing could offer a  way of escaping \nthe  burden of wordly affairs. The  Motor Cycle put  it nicely \nin  1935, writing “Who cares what Hitler says, or  whether \nthere has  been another coup in the  Balkans? This week we \ndon’t read the  national papers —  we  live, dream and read \nmotorcycles.’ \nPROGRAMME \nThe  programme of racing for  1935 opened with the Junior \non  Monday of race week. In  less  than perfect conditions, \nthe stylish Jimmy Guthrie led team mates Walter Rusk and \nJohn ‘Crasher’ White to  victory at a new record race aver- \nage  speed of 79.14mph, with the  fastest lap going to  Rusk, \nwho was  just 3 seconds short of the lap record. It was Nor- \nton’s fifth consecutive Junior victory. \nWeather conditions were poor for  Wednesday’s Light- \nweight race, where, nevertheless, Stanley Woods (Moto \nGuzzi) rode to  an  emphatic 3-minute victory over the \nRudges of Henry Tyrell-Smith and  Ernie Nott, setting new \nrace average and lap records for the  264'%-mile race. That \nwas a long way for a  250  that was  revved to  over 7,500rpm \nand the  little Moto Guzzi’s engine suffered valve gear fail- \nure  just as  Stanley shut off at the  finishing line. \nCelebrations of victory in  the  Lightweight were over- \nshadowed by the  death in the  race of Doug Pirie in a crash \nat  the Thirty-third Milestone. The inquest into Pirie’s \ndeath was held the  following day and the  coroner recom- \nmended to  the  ACU’s representative that the  organizers \nshould stop any  race in  which bad  weather prevailed. The \nnext day was scheduled for the  Senior race, but with travel- \nling marshals reporting that visibility on  the  Mountain was \ndown to  20 yards and  with the  Coroner’s recommendation \nringing in  their ears, the  organizers postponed the  race \nuntil Saturday. A degree of chaos ensued for riders, organ- \nizers, marshals and those spectators who were booked to \nleave the island on  the Saturday —  and for the  12,000 specta- \ntors who had been shipped in overnight just to  see  Friday’s \nSenior. \nA RACETO REMEMBER \nThere had been many close-fought duels in  the almost \ntwenty-five years’ use  of the  Mountain Course, but  with \nthis book’s concentration on  detailing the  ever-increasing \nspeed aspect of the  TT, it has not  been possible to  give full \naccounts of  earlier races. However, the  record-breaking \n1935 Senior TT  merits a proper description. \nA  TT  race is  a  form of time trial where riders set  off \nat  intervals. In  the 1930s the previous year’s winner was \nalways offered number 1 in  the  following year’s race, but \nthe  remaining start numbers were determined by ballot. \nThis meant that principal rivals might not  see  each other \nduring a  race, so  they rode against the  clock. Each rider \nhad his own strategy, some going fast from the outset, while \nothers held something in  reserve. Their riding could well \nbe affected by the  in-race information they received about \nhow their rivals were doing, and the  need to  stop for  fuel \ncould often change the  shape of a race. \n\n50  M  FAST FOREIGNERS \nPractice for the  1935 Senior had  shown that it would be \na  contest between the  combined strength of the  Norton \nteam of Guthrie, Rusk and  White and  the  lone effort of \nStanley Woods on  his  Moto Guzzi, though nothing could \nbe  taken for  granted over a  race distance of 264% miles \nand  there were certainly others capable of challenging for \na win. Come the  race, it soon turned into a two-man duel \nbetween Jimmy Guthrie, who started at  number 1, and \nStanley Woods, who started 14’ minutes later at number \n30.  Almost half a minute behind Guthrie on  corrected time \nat the end of the first lap, Woods was  a concerned man, for \nhis  500cc bike shared the  same valve gear components as \nthose that had  failed as  he crossed the  finishing line on  his \n250 a  few days before. Falling further behind, it was not \nuntil his  stop for  fuel at  the  end of the  third lap that the \nGuzzi rider began to  claw back some of Jimmy’s lead. \nNorton were convinced that the  thirsty twin-cylinder \nMoto Guzzi would have to  make two stops for  fuel and \nplanned their race accordingly. However, they had failed to \nnotice in the final practice session that, in a classic act  of  TT \nsubterfuge, Woods had  used a slightly bigger petrol tank, \nwhich he retained for the  race. Activity in the  Moto Guzzi \npit as  Woods neared the  end of his  sixth lap led  Norton \nto  believe their assumption about refuelling to  be correct, \nfor the  Guzzi mechanics gave every indication of preparing \nfor  another stop. But  Woods went straight through, albeit \na  substantial 26  seconds behind Guthrie, who had already \nbeen given signals telling him he  was comfortably in  the \nlead. \nPutting aside concerns about the  durability of his  valve \ngear, Woods brought all his racing skills to that last lap. He \nused the  Moto Guzzi’s sprung-frame handling to  its  full, \nand in the final stages his new-for-1935 rev  counter showed \nthat he was  taking the engine to well over 8,000rpm on  the \ndrop from the  Mountain. But  would it last and  would it be \nenough to  snatch victory? \nIt was clear at  the  finish that the  race organizers, the \npublic address announcers and the  Norton camp did  not \nthink so,  for Jimmy Guthrie sat  on  his Norton and received \ncelebratory handshakes, pictures were taken and he  was \ngenerally féted as  the  winner. Then, some quarter of an \nhour after Guthrie had  taken the chequered flag, came the \nunexpected announcement that Stanley Woods had clawed \nback the  time deficit on  the  last  lap and  stolen victory by 4 \nseconds. In doing so  he set  a new lap record of 86. 53mph, \ntaking 1 minute and 12 seconds off his own previous fastest \nlap from 1933 in  the  process and  thus lifting it by almost \n4mph. It was  a truly outstanding performance, which made \nhim an  eight-times TT  winner. \nMoto Guzzi had  been contesting the  TT  since 1926 and \nby \ntaking \nthe  \ncoveted \nBlue \nRiband \nSenior \nand \nthe  \nLight- \nweight \nrace \nin \n1935, \nthe \nItalian \nfirm \nshowed \nthat \nthe \nfor- \neign \nchallenge \nwas \nnow \ntruly \na force \nto \nbe \nreckoned \nwith \nin \nIsland \nracing. \nRusk \nand \nDuncan \nhad \nfollowed \nGuthrie \nhome \non \nNortons, \nbut \nin \nfifth \nand \nsixth \nplaces \nthere \nwas \nmore \nforeign \nmachinery, \nwith \nOskar \nSteinbach \nand \nTed \nMellors \non \nGerman \nNSUs. \n1936: RUMBLINGS \nThe interruptions to  racing caused by the  poor weather in \n1935 led  some to  question the  suitability of the  Mountain \nCourse for such an  important race as  the TT, particularly as \nmachines were getting ever faster. Suggestions were made \nabout finding an  alternative course on  the  Island that kept \nto  the  low ground and  would thus be less  affected by mist. \nThere was  no  immediate action, but the topic continued to \nrumble in the background for the  next few years. \nIncreased speeds put  ever more demands on  riders. At \n100mph plus, racing bikes were an  uncomfortable ride, \nwith their vibration, noise and lack of suspension. Add to \nthis  the need to  fight the wind in bulky two-piece leathers, \ntopped by a  draughty pudding-basin helmet and goggles, \nand  it meant that spending well over 3 hours in the  saddle \nfor the  264 miles of  a TT  race was a wearing business. \nA  total entry of only eighty-six across the  three races \nin  1936 was cause for  concern, but  firms like Norton and \nVelocette, who openly stated that they went racing for \nthe  worldwide publicity it  could earn them, were there. \nIndeed, the  small Velocette company attributed its  sur- \nvival in the  difficult trading days of the  early 1930s to  the \nfact that 50 per  cent of its production went for export, the \norders for which had  largely been gained through the  pub- \nlicity achieved from racing. \nThe Moto Guzzi marque was absent, as  Italy was at war \nin Abyssinia. \nCOURSE IMPROVEMENTS \nBray Hill had  been resurfaced and  was now rated as  faster, \nalthough the  humps where side roads joined the  hill  still \ncaused the  fastest riders to  leap considerable distances. \nFive miles further on,  at an  improved Greeba Castle, the \neasing of bends helped increase speeds, because, as  Graham \nWalker explained, riders now took it in third gear and  ‘you \ndidn’t \ndrop \nbelow \nninety’. \nJust \nafter \nthe \nEighth \nMilestone \nat \nBallig \nBridge, \nthe \nnotorious \nhump \nhad \nbeen \nlevelled \nand \nthe \nreconstructed \nbridge \nwas \nwidened \nand \nrealigned \nto \ngive \na \nstraighter \nrun. \nIn \nthe \nopinion \nof \nleading \nriders, \nthe \nworks \nthere \nsaved \nthem \n3—5 \nseconds \na \nlap, \nwhile \nother \nchanges \nfor \n1936 \nwere \nestimated \nto \ncontribute \nto \nan \noverall \nreduction \nin lap time of 10-15 seconds. \n\nJock Leyden’s sketch shows Ginger Wood coping with \nthe humps on  Bray Hill. \nSpeeds were recorded on  Sulby Straight in just one  prac- \ntice session and the highest were: Senior —  Oskar Steinbach \n(NSU), 107.1mph; Junior —  Noel Christmas (Velocette), \n96.8mph, Lightweight —  Henry Tyrell-Smith (Excelsior), \n84.9mph. All  figures were slightly down on  the  previous \nyear’s fastest, under similar damp conditions. \nRiders were also timed over a half-mile stretch from the \ntop of Bray Hill and through the  bottom. The best class \ntimes were set  by Stanley Woods (Velocette), Noel Pope \n(Velocette) and  Arthur Geiss (DKW). \nFUEL \nTopic of the moment at the  1936 TT was  the fuel used, with \nconcerns about perceived anomalies in  what was permit- \nCastrol oils \nwere big \nsupporters \nof the TT \nraces. \nThis photograph shows ordinary traffic using Ballig \nBridge in the days before it was realigned, flattened and \nwidened. \nted. Most ran  a  50/50 petrol/benzole mix, but  there was \nmuch technical discussion about the  place of  tetra-ethyl \nlead —  included in  pump fuel, but  not  allowed in  race fuel \n—and the  incorporation of alcohol, which Cleveland Dis- \ncol  pump fuel was claimed to  contain. It  was clearly an \nimportant issue, for  it  could affect engine tune and race \nperformance. \nMORE ‘SPRINGERS’ \nWith Moto Guzzi taking two TT victories in  1935 on \nmachines fitted with rear suspension, and the similarly \nequipped Vincent HRD concern receiving favourable com- \nment on  their bikes’ handling, it  was no  surprise to  see \nother makes come to  the  1936 TT  fitted with rear spring- \ning, among them being Norton and  Velocette. Moto Guzzi \nhad used a  system with scissor-action struts controlled by \nadjustable friction discs, whilst Vincent HRD used inclined \nunder-saddle springs that were enclosed and fitted with \nfriction band adjusters. Norton’s effort was of simple verti- \ncal  plunger style, incorporating springs but  no  damping, \nwhile Velocette’s was  of vertically mounted hydraulic units, \nwith no  springs, but  assisted by compressed air.  These var- \nied approaches to the  same problem offered a classic exam- \nple of “eens SE pursuing the  same development from \ndifferent directions, or,  as  Kevin Cameron put  it,  “When \nideas are  new, many competing expressions flourish’. \nOn  the  new machine front, AJS had  introduced a V-four \nroadster at the  end of 1935, and two supercharged versions \nwere entered for the  1936 Senior TT. The engines were of \ndouble-V formation and riders were George Rowley and \n\n52  M  FAST FOREIGNERS \nHarold Daniell. Vincent HRD also brought a supercharged \nsingle for the  Senior, but  it proved temperamental in prac- \ntice  so  was  not  raced. \nSince their TT victories of the late 1920s, Velocette had \nbeen ever-present at the Island races. Sometimes only frac- \ntionally off race-winning pace and with their 350s usually \nmore competitive than their 500s, they were always ready \nto  snap up  a  podium position when the  mighty Nortons \nfailed. In  1936 they returned with modified frames, altera- \ntions to  gearing and minor engine developments that kept \ntheir KTT models competitive. They also realized that to \nwin they had to pay for a top rider, so  they went right to the \nvery top and  hired Stanley Woods, who would also ride a \nDKW in the  Lightweight race. \nNORTON STILL DOMINATE \nAs well as  benefiting from plunger rear suspension in  1936, \nback at  the  Bracebridge Street factory the  Norton racers \nunderwent their customary engine development over the \nwinter and came with slightly revised bore and stroke, plus \nextra finning areas to  heads and  barrels. Every manufac- \nturer who had ideas of TT  glory would have gone down \na  similar road, for  those who stood still were swiftly left \nbehind. \nJimmy Guthrie went on  to  race his Norton to  victory in \nthe  1936 Senior at record-breaking speed, although second- \nplaced Stanley Woods (Velocette) set the fastest and record \nlap at  86.98mph. Confirming the  constant year-on-year \nprogress made at  the  TT  races, Stanley’s 1936 record lap \nwas  even faster than his victory-grabbing last lap of 1935 on \nthe Moto Guzzi. Walter Rusk (Norton) wasa close third. In \nthe Junior it was  newcomer to the TT, former MGP winner \nFreddie Frith, who took first place on  his Norton, breaking \nrace and lap records and finishing ahead of ‘Crasher’ White \n(Norton) and  Ted  Mellors (Velocette). \nThose who had  ridden with rear suspension expressed \nthemselves as  generally satisfied with the new fitting, \nclaiming it  allowed higher corner speeds, reduced tyre \nwear, permitted harder rear-wheel braking and gave overall \nbetter control. In addition, increased comfort meant their \nbikes were less fatiguing to ride, a factor that could well be \na time-saver towards the  end  of a long race. \nIn  \nthe \nLightweight \nrace, \nBob \nFoster \nfended \noff  \nthe \nDKW \nchallenge \nand \nrode \nhis \nunit \nconstruction, \npushrod- \nengined \nNew \nImperial \nto  \nfirst \nplace \nat  \na  \nnew \nrace \naverage \nrecord \nspeed, \nwith \nHenry \nTyrell-Smith \nsecond \non \na 4-valve \nExcelsior \nand \nArthur \nGeiss \nthird \non \nhis \ntwo-stroke \nDKW. \nStanley \nWoods \n(DKW) \nlost \ntime \nto \nan \nearly \nplug \nchange. \nThereafter \nhe \nwas \nchallenging \nFoster \nfor \nthe \nlead \nand \nset \na \nnew \nrecord \nlap \nof \n76.20mph, \nbefore \nretiring \non \nlap \nsix. \nIn  \ntuning \nmachines \nfor \nTT  \nracing, \nthere \nis \na  \ntricky \nline \nto \nbe \nmaintained \nbetween \nperformance \nand \nreliability. \nThe \ntemptation \nhas  \nalways \nbeen \nto  \ngo  \nfor  \nperformance \nand \nso \nretirement \nrates \nranged \nfrom \n22 \nto \n60 \nper \ncent \nin \n1936. \nSuch \nfigures \nwere \nnot \nout \nof \nthe \nordinary, \nbut \nthere \nwas \nlittle \nconsistency \nand \nthe \npercentage \nfigures \nfor \neach \nrace \nvaried year on  year. \n1937: MEGAPHONES \nThe benefit to  top-end performance gained by the  use  of \nmegaphone exhausts was increasingly recognized and they \nwere being widely adopted. Norton competitions manager, \nJoe Craig, explained that his  500cc engine gained its great- \nest  benefit from a  ‘megga’ at  6,000rpm. Below 4,000rpm \nit was  actually a  disadvantage, for it upset the  carburation, \nmaking the  rounding of slow corners like Ramsey Hair- \npin and Governor’s Bridge a  stuttering affair. In  fitting a \nmegaphone, exhaust pipe length was critical and  there was \nan  impact on  valve-timing and jetting of the  carburettor. \nAnother development for Norton was that the  factory race \nengines were now fitted with double overhead camshafts \n(dohc), driven by a  train of gears. They also had  increased \ncompression ratios and  carried rev  counters. \nIn  1937 almost every rider still rode his  racing motor- \ncycle from his garage/lodgings to  the  start area, prior to  a \npractice or  race. This was an  extremely noisy and antisocial \nA \nmute \nfitted \nin \nthe \nend \nof \nNorton’s \nmegaphone \nexhaust. \n\nbusiness \nat  \n4.15am, \nand  \nalthough \nriders \nwere \nrequested \nto \ntravel \nas  \nquietly \nas  \npossible, \nmost \nhad  \nto  \nride \nuphill \nto  \nthe \nstart \non \nopen \npipes, \nso \nit \nwas \nan \nalmost \nimpossible \ntask. \nIn \n1937 \nseveral \nriders \nwere \nsummonsed \nand \nfined \nfor \nnoise \noffences, \nand \nthereafter \nmost \nrode \nwith \nsome \nform \nof \nmute \nin \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \nmegaphone \nwhen \nnot \nin \nrace \nmode. \nDKWSs were so  noisy that they took no  chances with the \nlaw  and towed their racers to  the  start. Once there, they \nneeded to be warmed up for some 10 minutes prior to going \nout  for practice. \nThe press published some speedy claims on  the run-up to \nthe  1937 event, writing that the  500cc Moto Guzzis would \nreach 126mph and the  new entry 500cc BMW was good \nfor  132mph. However, as  will be  seen, that did  not  hap- \npen at  the  TT. It  was a  year when there had been little \nchange to  the course, apart from some improvements over \nthe  Mountain. \nMORE FOREIGN ENTRIES \nDown to  ride the  sole BMW factory entry in  1937 was \nthe experienced Jock West. His German mount was a \n180-degree flat-twin, with supercharging, dohc, four- \nspeed gearbox and single-plate clutch matched to  shaft \ndrive. Suspension was by plunger at the  rear and hydrauli- \ncally damped telescopic forks at  the  front. Much use  was \nmade of magnesium and the  bike’s overall lightness, com- \nbined with speed, suggested that it would be a  formidable \nthreat, particularly as  it had  already been raced with suc- \ncess on  the  Continent. The BMW represented an  advance \nin  motorcycle engineering and offered a  distinct increase \nin  performance, but  could it  deliver and use  that higher \nperformance over the  roads of the  Mountain Course at the \nlevel it  did  on  race circuits abroad? Some pointed to  the \nhorizontal cylinders and shaft drive as  being two factors \nthat might make that difficult. \nThe talented Omobono Tenni was entered on  Moto \nGuzzis in  the Senior and Lightweight races, along with \nStanley Woods in the  Lightweight. Then there were NSUs \npresent in the  Senior and Junior races, DK W in the  Light- \nweight and names like  Terrot, Sarolea and  Husqvarna add- \ning spice to  the  entry of foreign machines and  riders. \nOne new feature for  the  1937 TT  was the  introduction \nof a single evening practice session. It was  well received, for \neveryone knew that race engines were sensitive to  atmos- \npheric \nconditions \nand \nperformed \nslightly \ndifferently \nduring \nThe all-action style of Omobono Tenni \n(Moto Guzzi) at Windy Corner during \npractice for the 1937 Lightweight TT. \nFAST FOREIGNERS #53 \nearly-morning practice sessions from how they would dur- \ning a race held later in the  day. \nA SPEEDY YEAR \nPractice lap times and speed measurements on  the  Sulby \nStraight suggested that spectators were in  for  fast  racing \nin  1937, and  that is how it turned out. The Sulby figures \ntaken in  practice showed that speeds had increased from \nprevious years, with Freddie Frith fastest Senior runner \non  his  Norton at  120.60mph, followed by the  Nortons of \nWhite and Guthrie at  116mph. It was a  year in  which The \nTT Special actually timed riders during the  Senior race; the \nfigures obtained showed Nortons out  front, with Guthrie \nhitting 117.66mph, White 114.67mph, Frith 114.67mph, \nTenni (Moto Guzzi) 113.94mph and Mellors (Velocette) \n113.21mph. Given that the  race turned into a titanic battle \nbetween Freddie Frith and  Stanley Woods (Velocette), one \nwonders why no  speed was  quoted for Woods, for at the end \nof a  race in which Frith lifted the  lap record by over 3mph \nto  record the  first over-90mph lap at  90.27mph, Woods \nwas  just 15 seconds behind him at the finish. Both had been \nriding to  their limit, with Woods experiencing a  massive \nslide just after Ballig Bridge. White was  third, while Jock \nWest brought his BMW home in sixth place with a  leaking \nfuel tank and  Tenni retired his Moto Guzzi. \nIn  the Junior race, Nortons swept the board with \nGuthrie, Frith and White taking the first three places. \nAgain, records were smashed, with Frith and Guthrie set- \nting an  equal fastest lap of  85.18mph. As  in  the  Senior, \nthis was over 3mph faster than the  previous year. Such an \nadvancement, which in  1937 was largely down to  machine \ndevelopment, was a huge compliment to  the  British manu- \nfacturers who had earlier been described as  ‘clinging on’ \nwith their single-cylinder racers. Speed trap figures showed \nthe  350 Nortons reached just over 105mph. \n\n54  M@  FAST FOREIGNERS \nContinental \nmachinery \ndid  \nmake \nits  \nmark \nin  \nthe  \nLight- \nweight \nrace, \nwhere \nOmobono \nTenni \ncame \nhome \nfirst \non \nhis \nMoto \nGuzzi, \nwith \n‘Ginger’ \nWood \nsecond \non \nan \nExcelsior \nand \nErnie \nThomas \nthird \non \na \nDKW. \nTenni \nlifted \nthe \nlap \nrecord \nfrom \n76.20 \nto \n77.72mph \nand \nbecame \nthe \nfirst \nfor- \neign \nrider \nto \ntake \nTT \nvictory \nona \nforeign \nmachine. \nThomas \nrecorded \nthe \nfastest \nstraight-line \nspeed \nof \n98.09mph, \nfrom \nTenni \nat 95.34mph. \n1938: STILL DEVELOPING \nThe search for improvements to increase speed and improve \nreliability was never ending. With the  easing and widen- \ning of many bends and improvements in  road-holding, TT \nmachines now ran  at wider throttle openings for longer and \nput ever more demands on  their many components. \nRenowned Australian engineer Phil Irving summarized \nthe  task of valves as  ‘admitting and  liberating gas from the \ncylinder at  appropriate moments’. It  was a  tough job at \n7,000rpm and manufacturers experimented with various \nmetals, usually using different ones for  inlet and exhaust \nvalves. The associated valve guides and springs were subject \nto  similar experimentation. Aiding their efficient opera- \ntion were developments in lubrication, with 1938 being the \nyear of new, thinner oils. Advertisements from Castrol and \nMobiloil claimed they would ‘lubricate without oil-drag’ \nand ‘are  necessary for high speed and  maximum power’. \nClutches had a hard life  and were usually of multi-plate \ndesign, using cork or  woven asbestos lining material, with \nmost still exposed to  air  to  aid  cooling. Carburettors were \nan  important feature in maximizing performance and there \nwas a  move towards remote float chambers with flexible \nmountings to  ensure a  constant flow of fuel. More manu- \nfacturers were trying rear suspension, with some private \nrunners grafting on  their own systems. \nWhile tyres were important, they were largely taken \nfor  granted. Troubles were few and durability was not  a \nproblem, most riders using one set  for  practising and a \nnew, lightly scrubbed set,  for  the  race. There were fewer \ntyre suppliers supporting the TT  than in its early days, the \nprincipal ones of the  1930s being Dunlop, Avon and  John \nBull. Riders used ribbed front tyres and  treaded rear, with \nsizes varying from 2.75 front and  3.00 rear on  some Light- \nweights to  3.00/3.25 front and  3.25/3.50 rear on  Junior \nand  Senior models. \nTT frontrunners, Norton, followed the example of \nBMW and came to  the 1938 event with telescopic front \nforks, but  they were merely spring-controlled with no \nhydraulic element and gave just 2in  of travel. However, \nthey did  improve stability by reducing front wheel judder \nunder braking. Meanwhile, manufacturers of  traditional \ngirder \nfront \nforks, \nlike \nWebbs, \nwere \nstill \nexperimenting \nto  \nimprove \ntheir \nproducts. \nThe \nNorton \nfactory’s \natten- \ntion \nwas \nbeing \ndiverted \nfrom \nracing \nby \nthe \nneed \nto \nfulfill \ncontracts \nfor \nthe \narmy, \nbut \nJoe \nCraig \nknew \nthey \ncould \nnot \nstand \nstill \nand \nworked \nto \nachieve \na little \nmore \npower \nfrom \nchanged \nengine \nbore \nand \nstroke \ndimensions, \nan \nincrease \nin \ncompression \nratios \nto \n8.3:1 \n(500cc) \nand \n8.6:1 \n(350cc), \nplus \nincreased \nfinning \nto \nhead \nand \nbarrel. \nThe \ncompany \ncustom- \narily \nused \nearly-season \nIrish \nroad \nraces, \nlike \nthe \nLeinster \n200 \nand \nNorth \nWest \n200, \nto \ntry \nnew \nideas \nbefore \nthe \nTT. \nVelocette was another company running models with a \nlong ancestry that received year-on-year development. By \n1938 they had reached the KTT Mk VII versions, with their \nover-the-counter 350 giving 27bhp at  6,500rpm and the \n500  yielding 34bhp at 7,000rpm. More was available from \ntheir works development models. \nBMW returned in  1938 with a  three-man team of Jock \nWest, Georg Meier and Karl Gall, with ‘Kompressor’ \nmachines that were said to have had engine heights raised to \nreduce the risk of grounding their projecting cylinder heads \nwhile cornering. As  an  indication of its  serious approach, \nthe BMW team spent two weeks on  the Isle of Man in early \nApril, learning the course on  roadster machines. Team \nmembers were accompanied by a physical trainer, who also \noversaw their diets with what was described as  ‘typical \nTeutonic thoroughness’. Much has  been written about the \npolitical aspect of BMW’s racing effort on  Nazi Germany’s \nbehalf in  the  late 1930s, and  at  the  1938 TT  the  threat of \nwar was in the  air. \nThe course was described prior to  the 1938 races as \n‘better than ever’, with the biggest improvement being the \nreconstruction of about 1%  miles of the  Mountain Road \nfrom just above The Cutting —  now known as  Guthrie’s \nMemorial. Experts reckoned that improvement would be \nworth 5 seconds a lap. There was  also road widening on  the \nLezayre stretch approaching Ramsey and further improve- \nments at  Greeba Castle. \nGLAMOUR \nDuring the 1930s the TT organizers worked to  incor- \nporate some glamour into the  event, with the  start area \nbedecked with flags and  bunting, warming-up procedures \nheld in  sight of the  crowded Grandstand, freshly painted \nscoreboards, \npublic \naddress \nsystem \ngiving \nout \ninformation, \nadvertising \nbanners, \nand \nuniformed \nscouts \nbearing \nthe \nflags \nof \ncompeting \nnations \nto \nthe \nstart \nline. \nThe \nIsland’s \nLieutenant \nGovernor \nwas \ndriven \nalong \nthe \nGlencrutchery \nRoad \nand \ntook \nhis \nseat \nin \nthe \nGrandstand \njust \nbefore \nthe \nstart \nof \neach \nrace \nand \nthe \nstarts \nwere \nsignalled \nby \nthe \nfir- \ning \nof \na \nmaroon \nand \nthe \ndropping \nof \nthe \ntimekeeper’s \nflag. \n\nEwald Kluge and his  DKW in \n1938. \nBut  there was a serious side to  this \nsporting event, for one magazine \nwrote: ‘Behind the  glamour of TT \nweek lies a  battle for  world busi- \nness, watched by every potential \npurchasing country with the  keen- \nest  interest’, with another saying, \n‘Successes scored on  the lengthy \nand demanding TT  course have a \nvalue all  of their own’. For  all  the \npotential monetary gains from, 11, \nsuccess, some were still in it purely \nfor the  prestige of a win. In Stanley \nWoods —  The World’s First Motorcycle \nSuperstar, David Crawford tells how \nMoto Guzzi had been contesting the  TT  since 1926, but \n‘As  they were a  small company with no  business interests \nin  Britain it was more a  personal ambition of its  directors \nthan a sales effort.’ \nAnother aspect of ‘glamour’ at the TT came from the high \nspeeds recorded, and 1938 saw  another lift.  Fastest 500  on \nthe Sulby Straight was Jock West at animpressive 130.4mph, \nfollowed by team mate Georg Meier at  121.6mph, a figure \nmatched by the fastest single of ‘Crasher’ White (Norton), \nwith his  team mates Frith and Daniell very close behind. \nOf the  350s, Stanley Woods hit  112.5mph on  his Velocette, \nwell clear of his  team mate Mellors at  107.1mph. Fastest \n250s were the DK Ws, with Ewald Kluge at  107.8mph and \nSiegfried Wunsche at  104mph. Those figures were set  in \npractice, during which BMW teamster Karl Gall crashed \nand  put himself out  of the  race. \nNORTON’S RUN ENDS \nAny thoughts that BMW’s ‘Teutonic thoroughness’ in \npreparation would be carried over to  the  Senior race were \ndashed by mechanical problems, which brought about Mei- \ner’s  retirement at  Quarter Bridge on  the  first lap, although \nJock West did  bring his  BMW home in  fifth place. It was \nthe less powerful but better-handling Norton and Velocette \nmachinery \nthat \ncontested \nthe \npodium \nplaces, \nwith \nvictory \ngoing \nto \nHarold \nDaniell \n(Norton), \nwho \nset \nnew \nrace \naverage \nand \nlap \nrecords, \nwith \nhis \nfastest \nbeing \nin \na \ntime \nof \n24 \nmin- \nutes \n52.6 \nseconds, \na \nspeed \nof \n91.00mph. \nIt \nwas \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nFAST FOREIGNERS Mf  55 \nthat the  25-minute barrier had  been broken. As  in  1937, \nStanley Woods (Velocette) was  just 15  seconds behind the \nwinner, with Freddie Frith (Norton) a  close third. \nAsked after the  race to  describe his  record lap, Daniell \ngave a  few  insights into the  bravery required to  lap at  over \n90mph. Speaking of the  sweeping downhill curves at  the \nEleventh Milestone, he told how he took them flat  in  top, \nusing every inch of the  road, adding ‘the procedure is not \nrecommended for beginners’. Of the  series of bends at Bir- \nkins he said ‘I have done it flat, but don’t like  to’, while the \nThirty-third Milestone was ‘nearly flat out’. \nIn  the  Junior race, Stanley Woods and his  Velocette \nended Norton’s seven years’ winning run in  the  class. He \nwas not  unduly pressed and rode a  controlled race at  just \nunder record speed, although he did  set  a new lap record of \n85.30mph. Firms like  Mobiloil, Dunlop, Ferodo and  Amal \nwere amongst those sponsoring Stanley and all were pleased \nto advertise his success. Mellors (Velocette) was  second and \nFrith (Norton) third. One possible reason that Norton did \nnot  really challenge for the win  was  that Joe Craig is said to \nhave geared all his  bikes for totally calm conditions, while \nthe  race was run  in blustery winds. \nDKW at  last  matched speed to  reliability with victory \nin  the  Lightweight, Ewald Kluge romping home some 11 \nminutes ahead of ‘Ginger’ Wood and  his  Excelsior. Kluge \nneeded two pit stops on  his  thirsty two-stroke but  lifted \nboth race average and lap  speeds, leaving the latter at \n80.35mph. Although Kluge found reliability, his  was the \n\n56  M@  FAST FOREIGNERS \nBill  Beevers holds his  Norton flat  out  through St Ninian’s \nCrossroads, at the  top of Bray Hill. \nonly one  of the  three works DK  Ws to  finish the  race, and \nthe next six  finishers were on  Excelsiors. \nIn  a  sign of the  times, the  first three machines in  each \nrace were fitted with rear suspension. \n1939: BUSINESS AS  USUAL \nWith a total of  153  entries across three classes, the  1939 \nTT  promised plenty of racing although, as  usual, most of \nthe  interest and focus was on  the  works machinery. After \nmany years of domination, Norton were not there with new \nworks bikes, because pressure to meet military contracts at \nthe factory meant that their riders had to make do with 1938 \nmachinery. They had also lost their Competitions Manager, \nJoe Craig, who moved to  BSA. By contrast, BMW were \npresent with a three-man team on  their latest supercharged \nmodels. Germany was also represented by works entries \nfrom NSU and  DKW. \nThe ever-present Velocette factory had announced its \nKTT Mk VIII model at  the 1938 Motorcycle Show and \nhad  works versions of the  single-cylinder racer for  Stanley \nWoods and Ted Mellors. It  also brought its  new super- \ncharged twin-cylinder ‘Roarer’ to the  Island, although it \nhad  only one  exploratory run  before being put to  one  side. \nAJS were present, having added water-cooling and  weight \nto  their supercharged fours to  be  ridden by Walter Rusk \nand  Bob Foster, but  Excelsior were absent. They issued an \nadvertisement that explained that the  fulfilment of mili- \ntary contracts took precedence over racing. They had no \nchoice in  the  matter, having received government direc- \ntives to switch production, although the former works bikes \ndid  appear at  the  1939 TT  as  private entries, including an \nexperimental 500. \nWar was  looming and  everyone knew it, but racing was \ndue  to  go ahead, albeit in a strained atmosphere. \nRACE WEEK \nPractice \nnow \nincluded \nthree \nevening \nsessions \nand \nracing \nfollowed \nthe \ncustomary \nTT \nprogramme: \nMonday \nwas \nJun- \nior \nrace \nday, \nWednesday \nwas \nfor \nthe \nLightweights \nand \nFri- \nday for the  Senior race. The weather for the opening 350cc \nJunior race was blighted by strong winds and showers, \nwhich slowed speeds. Nevertheless, the  early laps turned \ninto a  close battle between Stanley Woods (Velocette), \nFreddie Frith (Norton) and  Heiner Fleischmann (DKW), \nwith Harold Daniell (Norton) and  Les  Archer (Velocette) \nnot  far behind. The lead chopped and changed, before Frith \nretired at  Ballaugh and Daniell recovered from sliding off \nin  Parliament Square to  challenge Woods at  the  head of \nthe  field. At the  finish it was Stanley Woods who took his \ntenth TT  victory, followed closely by Harold Daniell, with \nHeiner Fleischmann third. In a not  overly impressive show- \ning by the  German marques, Wunsche did  bring another \nDKW home in sixth, but the  entire NSU team retired. \nWeather conditions were again poor for the  Lightweight \nrace, with heavy cloud and some rain. DKW had been \nspeedy in practice, but  on  race day it was the  Moto Guzzi \nof Omobono Tenni that led  in  the  early stages, swapping \nThis \nplaque \ncommemorates \nKarl \nGall \nand \nis \nlocated \nona \ncourse-side \nwall \njust \nafter \nBallaugh \nBridge. \n\nGeorg Meier takes his  BMW \nover St Ninian’s Crossroads \nbefore plunging down Bray Hill. \nthe  lead with Ted Mellors on  a \nBenelli and with Stanley Woods \n(Moto Guzzi) third. Both Guzzis \ndropped out mid-race and the \nDKW of  Ewald Kluge moved \ninto second place, with Henry \nTyrell-Smith (Excelsior) third. \nIn  deteriorating weather, those \npositions remained unchanged to \nthe finish of what was  the  slowest \nLightweight TT  since 1935. \nCome Seniorrace day on Friday, \nthe  weather was good for  racing. \nSadly, BMW teamster Karl Gall \nhad lost  his  life  in  a  crash during \npractice and it was left  to  Georg \nMeier and  Jock West to  challenge the  semi-works Norton \nentries of Harold Daniell, Freddie Frithand ‘Crasher’ White, \nalong with the  works Velocettes of  Stanley Woods and \nTed Mellors. \nThe BMWs had been fastest in  practice. Even though \nthey looked bulky, they were 30lb (14kg) lighter than the \nworks Nortons and Velocettes, and if their published power \noutputs were to  be  believed —  it  is  possible to  see  later \nclaims of 55,  60,  68  and  70bhp in print —  not  only would \nthey ‘walk’ the  race but  records would be  demolished. In \nthe  event, the  day was made for  Germany by Meier taking \nvictory from West by just over 2 minutes, with Frith third, \na further half a minute behind West. Had the Nortons been \nable even to  match their speeds of 1938 things could have \nbeen closer, but  they had lost the  all-important edge that \ncomes with full  works support, as  well as  a  year of devel- \nopment. Meier increased the  race record marginally, from \n89.11 to  89.38mph, while the  lap record stayed intact. \nThe last observation is not intended to take anything away \nfrom ‘Schorsch’ Meier’s victory, for  it was a  worthy per- \nformance in only his  second year at the  TT, but  with their \nclaimed \npower \nadvantage \nthe \nBMWs \ncould \nhave \nexpected \nto \nbe \nmuch \nfurther \nahead. \nMaybe \nthey \nrode \na \ncanny \nrace, \nor \nperhaps the old adage that power on  the TT course requires \ncommensurate \nhandling \nagain \nheld \ntrue \nduring \nthe \n1939 \nSenior. \nWhatever, \nGermany \nsnatched \nthe \nBlue \nRiband \nof \nFAST FOREIGNERS @  57 \nmotorcycle racing, the  first time the  Senior had gone to \nboth a  foreign rider and machine. \n‘Titch” Allen wrote some years later: \nThe 1939 Isle  of Man TT  marked the  end  of an  era. Our \none-time supremacy in  all  classes had been challenged by \nmore advanced designs from Germany and Italy and toppled \nin  the Senior and Lightweight races. Even in  our  tradition- \nal stronghold, the Junior, there was a  German two-stroke \nknocking on  the door and needing but a little more develop- \nment and an  Isle  of Man star  (rider) to  win. \nSPEEDS \nThe growth in  speeds during the 1930s was impressive. \nWhile improved road surfaces made a  major contribution \nto their increasing speed in the  1920s, it was improvements \nto  race machinery that had  the biggest influence on  speeds \nin  the 1930s. The decade started with the  fastest lap in \nthe  Senior class standing at  73.55mph and  finished with it \nhaving climbed to  91.00mph. That.represented a  healthy \n24 per cent growth, with increases in the Junior and  Light- \nweight classes only slightly less. \nAllracing plans were put to one  side in late 1939 upon the \noutbreak of the  Second World War, bringing to a halt the \nyear-on-year advances made in  the  1930s in both machine \ndevelopment and  speeds. \n\nCHAP PERSFOUR \nPOST-WAR \nPROGRESS \nIn the years immediately following the  Second World War, \nBritain was  a  land of austerity, but  even such major obsta- \ncles to  motorcycle racing as  petrol rationing and an  absence \nof new machines could not  hold back over six years of pent- \nup  enthusiasm for  the  sport. Meetings started to  be  run \non  former airfields in  1946 and the  MGP brought racing \nback to  the  Isle  of Man later the  same year. In  1947 the TT \nreturned, bringing a mix of experienced pre-war riders and \nmany who were new to  the Mountain Course. It also came \nwith an  additional event called the  Clubmans TT, which \nwas  open to those without international racing experience, \nriding standard production motorcycles. \n1947: MACHINERY \nThe 1947 TT  attracted 109 entries in  the  International \nraces and sixty-four in  the  Clubmans. It was an  excellent \nturn-out of riders, but  where were all  the  bikes to  come \nfrom? Most dug out  pre-war models, including the  Norton \nfactory, which brought a  four-man team to  ride its  1938 \nrace bikes. Former competitions manager Joe  Craig had \nreturned to  Norton and  he uprated the pre-war bikes with \nnew hydraulically damped front forks and modified plung- \nA \nfactory-fresh \nVelocette \n350cc \nKTT \nMk  \nVIII \nin  \n1947. \ners  at the rear of its  ‘garden-gate’ frame. The company also \nstarted production of a racer for sale to  the  general public. \nCalled the  Manx and  priced at  £298, it was based on  the \npre-war single ohc engine of c1936. Made in 350 and  500cc \nform, it was  in short supply. \nVelocette returned with a  mixture of old  and new for \ntheir riders, and  of the  works bikes it was said ‘the major- \nity of the bottom-end parts were pre-war stuff’. They were \nmaking new racers, but  with only three men in  their race \nshop, each taking several weeks to  produce a KTT model \nfrom scratch, they had few  bikes for sale. \nMeanwhile, the  enthusiastic Moto Guzzi concern sup- \nplied a retired-from-racing Stanley Woods with a new 250 \nand  a  500, on  which he entered Manliffe Barrington in the \nLightweight and Freddie Frith in the  Senior. \nAJS had been busy and brought a  brand-new model for \nexperienced riders Les Graham and Jock West to ride. Built \npurely as  a  factory racer, it gained the  nickname ‘Porcu- \npine’ due to  its  spiked cooling fins. It  was an  air-cooled \n500cc laid-down twin of unit construction, with geared \nprimary drive and  gear driven twin ohc. Housed in an  all- \nwelded frame and with telescopic front forks and swinging- \narm rear suspension, its  claimed dry \nweight was  310Ib (141kg). \nThe Triumph name was repre- \nsented by several private owners on \ntwins. Perhaps they had been encour- \naged by Ernie Lyons’ victory in  the \n1946 MGP, on  a  Triumph whose \nengine used components from a  war- \ntime generator. \nRiders in the  new Clubmans event \nfaced similar difficulties in  obtaining \nmachines to  race. Dealers had to  be \ncajoled into supplying bikes from their \nlimited allocations of new models and \nsome were provided on  condition that \nthey went straight back to  the supply- \ning \ndealer \nafter \nthe \nrace, \nfor \nresale \nto \na hungry retail market. \n\n‘POOL’ PETROL \nHopes \nthat \nthe \n1947 \nraces \nwould \nsee \nrace \nand \nlap \nspeeds \ncontinue their upward climb were put  on  hold when the \norganizers found the only fuel available was 72  octane \n‘Pool’. This was an  unbranded petrol derived from the \npooled products of various suppliers. It was unreliable in \nquality and  thus lacked the  consistency that was so  impor- \ntant to  tuners setting up racing engines. It also necessitated \nlowering compression ratios from pre-war figures of close \nto  10:1 to  something like 7.5:1, plus changes to  carbura- \ntion. The overall effect was said to  reduce the  output of a \n500cc engine by some 8bhp. \nAt the end of 1946 the sport’s ruling body banned super- \ncharging, thus creating a level playing field on  the induction \nfront. \nSPEEDS \nThe speed-starved spectators who thronged the  roadside \nbanks at  the 1947 TT hardly noticed the difference in \nriders’ performance from pre-war years, but the speed \ntrap figures from Sulby Straight revealed the expected \nreduction in  maximum figures. The very best pre-war \nspeeds from 500 singles ridden by top riders were just \nover 120mph. Fastest in  1947 was Bob Foster on  his works \nVelocette at  114.68mph, with the  next fastest grouped at \n109mph. \nIt wasa similar story for the 350s, where the pre-war best \nwas 112.5mph and post-war 107.81mph. There was a  big- \nger  differential among the  Lightweights, with the  pre-war \nfastest being 107.80mph and post-war 92.31mph. How- \never, that was not  a like-with-like comparison, for the fast- \nest  bikes pre-war were the  particularly speedy two-stroke \nDKWs, while in  1947 it was  the four-stroke Moto Guzzi of \nManliffe Barrington. A better comparison was  with Stanley \nWoods 1939 speed of just on  100mph, achieved on  a similar \nMoto Guzzi. \nIn the new Clubmans classes, the highest speeds achieved \nat  Sulby were: \nSenior: Eric Briggs (Norton) —  98.92mph \nJunior: Dennis Parkinson (Norton) —  93.28mph \nLightweight: Bill Jenness (Excelsior) —  74.09mph \nBoth \nBriggs \nand \nParkinson \nrode \n1939 \nInternational \nmod- \nels \nwith \ngirder \nforks, \nand \nthe \nExcelsior \nwas \nalso \na \npre-war \nmachine. \nThere \nwere \nno  \nmajor \nchanges \nto \nthe \ncourse \nfor  \n1947, \nbut \nsome \neasing \nof \nthe  \nThirty-third \nMilestone \ndid  \nhelp \nrider \nprogress, \neven \nif, \nas \nErnie \nLyons \nsaid, \nthis \nhad \n‘taken \nall \nthe \nfun \nout \nof \nit’. \nPOST-WAR PROGRESS #59 \nCome the  racing in  1947, while it was keen and closely \ncontested, both race average and fastest lap speeds were \ndown in  all  classes. In  the  Senior it was by almost 7mph, \nin  the  Junior by about 4mph and in  the  Lightweight by \n5mph. The three winners were Harold Daniell (Norton) \nin  the  Senior; Bob Foster (Velocette) in  the  Junior; and \nManliffe Barrington (Moto Guzzi) in  the  Lightweight. All \nwere experienced pre-war TT  riders, so  newcomer Artie \nBell’s second place in the  Senior on  a Norton was  seen as  a \nparticularly good effort. \n1948: STEADY PROGRESS \nThere were several course improvements over the  winter \nthat helped rider speed, including cutting back the bank on \nthe apex at Hillberry —  which was  now taken at 90—100mph \n—  widening at  Cronk ny Mona and the  eradication of sev- \neral adverse cambers in  Ramsey. However, the  restraining \neffect of ‘Pool’ petrol continued to  be felt, and while race \nspeeds were slightly up on  1947, they were still well under \nrecord pace. \nManufacturers continued to make progress with machine \ndevelopment. Moto Guzzi fitted telescopic front forks to its \n500 and the  brave Omobono Tenni found these to  his  lik- \ning, being much the fastest man down Bray Hill in practice \nat  120mph, with other fast  men around 112mph. Norton \nwere still racing their modified 1938 TT  models, while \nearly in the  year Triumph launched a  500cc twin-cylinder \n‘Grand Prix’ model for  racing. It came with components \nfrom the generator-based engine and  with sprung-hub rear \nsuspension, Seven were entered for  the  Senior race, but \nnone finished. Velocette still used girder front forks, and \nalthough Freddie Frith did  try  a  pair of Dowty telescopic \nones during practice, his opinion was that just bolting on  a \npair of ‘teles’ was not  enough and  that the frame needed to \nbe redesigned to  suit. \nIt  fell to  AJS to  introduce the only really new race \nmachine in  1948. Designed as  an  over-the-counter racer \nfor sale to the general public, the new model was  called the \n7R  and  was to  remain in production for many years. It was \na  350cc single with chain-driven ohc engine, 74mm bore 1 \nand  81mm stroke, said  to give 29bhp at  6,800rpm. Engine ~ \ncastings were in magnesium, finished in a distinctive corro- \nsion-inhibiting gold paint. It had  a cradle-type frame, front \nand rear suspension, the  usual four-speed gearbox with \nexposed primary drive and, in  a  move being tried by oth- \ners, a twin leading-shoe front brake. \nThe 7R  came with narrow section tyres of 3.00 X  21 \nfront and 3.25 X  20 rear. During practice the  factory even \ntried a  3.00 rear in the  quest for speed, for it was  not  quite \nas  quick as  the  Velocette KTTs and Manx Nortons. \n\n60  M  POST-WAR PROGRESS \nAs  an  example of the supporting trade assisting with \ndevelopments, Ferodo produced experimental brake lin- \ning materials for the  several firms using twin leading-shoe \nset-ups. \nWET AT SULBY \nRiders were only timed once at  Sulby during practice in \n1948, under very wet conditions that offered no  real basis \nfor comparison, In better weather, they were clocked over \nan  up-and-down 2-mile stretch from the  top  of the  hill \noutside Union Mills to  The Highlander pub; Ernie Lyons \n(Moto Guzzi) was  fastest, averaging 116.1mph, followed by \nFreddie Frith (Triumph) at  110.7mph, a  speed matched by \nAn  early AJS 7R  racer. \nErnie \nLyons \non  \nthe  \n500cc \nMoto \nGuzzi \nat  \nQuarter \nBridge \nin  \n1948. \nTed \nFrend \non  \na  \nworks \nPorcupine. \nThe \nlatter \ncame \nwith \na \nstrengthened \nframe, \noil-cooler \nand \nother \ndetailed \nmodifi- \ncations. \nOver \nthe \nsame \nstretch, \nArtie \nBell \n(Norton) \nwas \nthe \nfastest \n350 \nat \n104.4mph. \nThere were twelve practice sessions, eight being for the \nInternational TT  races and four for  the  Clubmans, with \nMoto Guzzi fastest overall. \nNORTON AGAIN \nAfter promising much in practice, the best Senior race fin- \nish on  a Moto Guzzi was  that of Omobono Tenni in seventh \nplace, although he held third until the  sixth lap. The first \nthree places went to Norton men Artie Bell, Bill Doran and \nJock Weddell, with Bell’s race aver- \nage speed being 84.97mph and Tenni \nsetting the  fastest lap at  88.06mph, \nalmost 3mph below Harold Daniell’s \n1938 record of  91.00mph. Guzzi \ndid  get a  victory in  the massed-start \nLightweight race, with Maurice Cann \non  his home-tuned machine. He  also \nachieved the  fastest lap at 76.72mph, \nfinishing well clear of the string of \npre-war British bikes that followed \nhim home. \nIn  the  Junior, it  was Velocette \nwho showed their class with a  win \nand fastest lap for  Freddie Frith at \n82.45mph, with similarly mounted \nBob Foster some 4 minutes behind. \nThe new  AJS 7Rs put up a good show- \ning, although no  one  could match the \ncheeky fourth place that Geoff Mur- \ndoch achieved when he  rode one in \nthe  Senior race later in  the  week. It \nwas a  time when riders who had to \nwatch the  cost of racing often chose \nto  buy a  350, as  they could usually \nenter 500cc races on  the  same bike, \nso  getting twice the number of rides. \nThe Senior Clubmans TT was \nfor  machines up  to  1,000cc. John \nDaniels rode a  Vincent HRD twin \nto  first place at  a  race average speed \nof 80.5lmph, while the Junior went \nto  Ronnie Hazelhurst (Velocette) \nat  70.33mph and the Lightweight \nto  Monty Lockwood (Excelsior) at \n64.93mph, their speeds being slightly \nup on  1947, \n\nSPECTATORS \nPost-war \nraces \ndrew \nbig \ncrowds \nto  \nthe  \nTT, \neven \nthough \npetrol \nwas \nstill \non \nration. \nThis \nmeant \nmany \ncame \nwithout \ntheir \nown \ntrans- \nport, \nbut \nfleets \nof \ncoaches \nserving \nthe \nIsland’s \nholiday \ntrade \nwere \non \nhand \nto \ntake \nrace \nfans \nout \nto \npopular \nspots \nlike \nCreg \nny \nBaa \nor \nGinger \nHall. \nSuch \nlocations \nwere \nserved \nby \na \npublic \naddress \nsystem, \nwhich \nprovided \ncommentaries \nfrom \ndifferent \npoints \naround \nthe \ncourse. \nThis \nhelped \nspectators \nunder- \nstand \nthe \nprogress \nof \na \nrace, \nfor \nthe \nleading \nriders \nwould \nbe \nscattered \nthrough \nthe \nfield \nand \nwithout \nhelp \nfrom \nthe \nPA \nsystem, \nonly \nthose \nwith \nstopwatches \nreally \nknew \nwhat \nwas \ngoing \non. \n1949: GETTING CLOSER \nIn  1949 the fuel supplied was still of  72 \noctane but  was more consistent in  quality. \nThis allowed a  slight upping of  compres- \nsion ratios and an  advancement in  recorded \nspeeds and  lap times, with the  Junior race \ngetting close to  the  best pre-war figures and \n~ ‘Whe moat excluatye- \nMotorcycle “ te \nPOST-WAR PROGRESS @  61 \nthe Lightweights slightly exceeding them. \nThat Junior race had  100 entries, but on  only \nthree different makes: Norton, Velocette \nand  AJS. \nWith regard to  the  Senior, Norton man \nHarold Daniell still held the  race average \n— World YA Z — g % \nss ARIEL M@TORS LIMITED - SELLY OAK -   BIRMINGHAM -  29 \nThis is how Ariel advertising saw spectators on  their way to  the  TT  in \nthe late 1940s. \nspeed record from 1938 at  89.11mph.

Freddie \nFrith finished the  year as  350cc champion on  his Velocette \nand  Les  Graham as  500cc champion on  his AJS Porcupine. \nSpeaking in  later years, Frith said, “The TT  was the  Blue \nRiband of racing then, worth more than a World Champi- \nonship to  people in the  sport’. \nIn the Clubmans TT, the Junior, Senior and new 1,000cc \nraces of  1949 were reduced from four laps to  three and \nrefuelling was banned. This turned the  race for the  thirst- \nier  1,000cc machines into an  economy run won by Dennis \nLashmar \n(Vincent) \nat \n76.30mph. \nThe \nfastest \n1,000cc \nlap \n— \n85.57mph by Chris Horn —  gave a much better indication of \nVincent performance, but he, and other quick Vincent run- \nners like George Brown, ran  out  of fuel. In just his second \nrace over the TT course, Geoff Duke (Norton) recorded his \nfirst win by taking the  Senior Clubmans. The Junior went \nto  Harold Clark (BSA) and  the  Lightweight to  Cyril Taft \n(Excelsior). Ignoring the fuel shortage fiasco of the  1,000cc \nrace, the  other three Clubmans races delivered increased \nrace and  lap speeds. \nDOWNTO EARTH \nDuring a TT  meeting, riders spend much of their time liv- \ning on  a higher plane than lesser mortals. However, it can \nbe a precarious existence and  the  high can  easily change to \na  low. A good private runner of the  late 1940s and  early \n1950s was Phil Heath. He  told how when going well in  a \nrace, he hit oil at Quarry Bends and  slid to  earth. Standing \nup,  his  leather trousers slid  down, as  he had  wiped off the \n\n62  M  POST-WAR PROGRESS \nbuttons that connected them to  his  jacket —  many riders \nstill wore two-piece leathers. Having availed himself of a \npiece of string for  a  belt, Phil trudged to  the  nearest rail \nhalt and took the  local narrow-gauge steam train to  Peel, \nsitting in a compartment with several ladies and their shop- \nping baskets, off to  do nothing more exciting than a  bit of \nshopping. The railway line runs parallel to  the  TT  course \nfor some way here and to  reinforce his  ‘return to  earth’, he \nsat watching fellow racers flashing by in the opposite direc- \ntion, as  the train chugged slowly along. \nMany tales can  be told by riders who have broken down \nout  on  the  course. In  the  old  days some returned to  the \nstart by horse and cart. Others were taken in  and served \ntea  and cakes by local homeowners, whilst many made it to \nthe local pub and  were generally plied with free drinks, so \nhelping them overcome the  disappointment of their break- \ndowns. \nINTO A NEW DECADE \nAs  the  TT  moved into the  1950s, the  early years of the \ndecade would later be seen as  a period of transition. It was \na  time when the  Norton marque extended its  competitive \nracing life  with a  new frame, Velocette began to  fade and \nAJS maintained a strong challenge, as  did  the  enthusiastic \nMoto Guzzi concern. Other Italian manufacturers were \nalso interested in the  TT. Benelli already had provenance \nat  the  event, Mondial would mount a successful challenge \nwith Lightweights, MV Agusta were on  their way with \nLightweights and  4-cylinder 500s, and  they would be  fol- \nlowed by the  similarly equipped Gilera concern. Most of \nthe  Italian firms were already contesting and winning at \nContinental GP  level and  there was the  likelihood of Ger- \nman marques such as  BMW and NSU being \nreadmitted to  racing. \n1950: THE  ‘FEATHERBED’ \nHarold Daniell had raced Norton motorcycles \naround the  Mountain Course since 1930, using \nrigid, plunger and  plunger/tele frames. He  was \nin  a  good position to  judge the  new frame that \nNorton introduced in  1950 and was sufficiently \nimpressed to  call it  the ‘Featherbed’. As  lap \nrecord holder on  the  Mountain Course, Dan- \niell  knew in those early post-war years that his \nbasic plunger rear suspension was a  limiting \nfactor in  determining how fast he  could go. \nIt  was the old story of  matching power to \nhandling, for by now Norton had  some 40-plus \nbhp on  tap  but without the road-holding to \nmatch. \nDesigned \nby \nRex \nMcCandless, \nNorton’s \nnew \ndouble- \nloop \ncradle \nframe \nwas \na \nbrazed \nstructure \nof \nthin-walled \ntube, \nwhich \nproved \nsuperior \nto \nthe \nold \ngarden-gate \nstyle \nin \npre-season \ntesting. \nComing \nwith \na \ncontoured \npetrol \ntank, \nrear-set \nfootrests \nand \nlowered \nbars, \nit encouraged \nriders \nto \nadopt \na more \ncrouched \nstyle \nin \nthe \nsearch \nfor \nmaximum \nspeed. \nThe adoption of the featherbed frame extended the com- \npetitive life  of Norton’s ageing single when, although con- \ntemplating a  new multi-cylinder engine, the  Bracebridge \nStreet concern did  not  proceed with it.  However, they did \ncontinue to  improve their single-cylinder engines. These \ncame with new heads that dropped the  bronze inner skull \nand were all  aluminium. They also had the  bevel hous- \ning for  the  ohc drive cast integrally, changes to  finning, \nsteel valve seats and so  on.  It was typical of the  step-by- \nstep modifications that had  been a  trademark of Joe Craig \nand  Norton for  so  many years and  which kept other firms \nbusy trying to  match them. There was a  trend to  smaller \nwheels, and  a  new Amal carburettor, later to  become the \nGP, was  in selective use  by the Norton and AJS camps. Also \non  the  topic of carburation, Motor Cycling wrote: ‘methods \nof mounting remote float chambers with a view to  stabiliz- \ning levels and insulation from heat, were, incidentally, as \nvaried as  the  stars in the heavens’. \nPre-war sit-up riding styles were changing, aided by \nrear-set footrests, longer seats and  fuel tanks styled to  give \nsome support to  a rider adopting a leaning forward style. \nEXPECTATIONS \nPetrol rationing ended in  Britain and this boosted TT \ncrowds in  1950, when the  well-subscribed International \nAt  \na \ntime \nwhen \nthe \ntrend \nwas \nto  \nreduce \nwheel \nsize, \nthe \nolder \nstyle \n2lin \nfront \nand \n20in \nrear \nof \nthe \nVincent \nGrey \nFlash \nare \nvery \napparent \nas \nKen \nBills \ntackles \nCronk \nny \nMona. \n\nraces \nwere \npermitted \nto  \nrun \non  \n80  \noctane, \nalthough \nthe \nClubmans \nraces \nwere \nstill \nlimited \nto \n‘Pool’. \nBritish \nmachines \ndominated \nthe \nentry \nlists \nand  \nincluded \na \nsurprise \nreturn \nof \nVincent \nfactory \nentries \non \nnew \nGrey \nFlash \n500cc \nmachines. \nExpectations of  home wins in  the big classes were \nboosted by the  first-time International TT  appearance of \nGeoff Duke, who brought his  special talents to  the  Nor- \nton  team, along with Artie Bell, Johnny Locket and  Harold \nDaniell. Duke also wore new, one-piece, close-fitting \nleathers, enabling him better to  ‘get down to  it’  and  pare \nseconds off his lap times. \nSpeeds on  Sulby Straight showed a noticeable increase \nover previous years, with Ted  Frend on  the  AJS Porcupine \nhitting 126.80mph and Bob Foster (Moto Guzzi) close \nbehind with 124.14mph. The latter was equalled by on- \nform AJS works runner Bill  Doran, who later fell  and  put \nhimself out  of the races at the bend after Ballig Bridge that \nnow carries his name. Juniors were also  quicker, with Bob \nFoster (Velocette) recorded at  120.00mph, while Light- \nweights remained on  a  par  with 1949 at  93.28mph. Sub- \nsequent performances in  practice showed that, come race \ntime, existing records would be under threat. \nRECORDS BROKEN \nRace week in  1950 started with the Junior 350cc machines. \nIt was a  race in  which Artie Bell led  a  trio of Nortons to \nrecord-breaking victory, leaving the lap record at 86.33mph \nand beating Stanley Woods record of 85.30mph, set  back in \n1938. Norton had a repeat result in  Friday’s Senior, when \nGeoff Duke led home Artie Bell  and Johnny Lockett, lifting \nHarold Daniell’s 1938 lap record of 91.00mph to 93.33mph. \nNot only did the stopwatch show that  Geoff Duke was  faster \nthan before, but  he  also looked the  fastest, his  neat riding \nstyle making him appear at  one with the  bike. Columnist \nGeoff \nDuke \ncrouched \nlow \nover \nhis  \n‘Featherbed’ \nNorton \non  Bray Hill. \nTotal commitment from Alex Phillip, as  he  speeds to \nvictory on  his  Vincent HRD in the 1000cc class of the \n1950 Clubmans TT. \n‘Ixion’ of The Motor Cycle was  moved to  eloquence, describ- \ning him as  ‘a small, lithe, black figure nestling down along \nits backbone, with the  engine disgorging thunder astern’. \nIt was  a show of total dominance by Norton in  1950, Les \nGraham (AJS) being the  best of the  rest  with fourth place \nin each race. \nAs  had  been the  custom since 1948, the  Lightweights \nwere given a  massed start, 2 minutes after the  last  Senior \nrunner. A close tussle followed between Benelli-mounted \nDario Ambrosini and Maurice Cann on  a home-engineered \nMoto Guzzi. Cann led for most of the race, but Ambrosini \nsnatched victory by one-fifth of a second, setting a new lap \nrecord of 80.91mph, some 12  seconds faster than Ewald \nKluge’s record from 1938 on  a DKW. \nWednesday of race week was Clubmans day and races \nwere back to  four laps, with refuelling allowed. In another \njuggle with the regulations, riders had  to  perform the  nor- \nmal kick start but  with cold engines. It was a  change that \nwas to  cause problems, as  did  the  slightly damp and misty \nconditions that kept speeds slightly below those set in 1949. \nTHE  OBJECT? \nWatching crowds had  been thrilled by the  high-speed rac- \ning of 1950, in both International and Clubmans events. But \nwhatever they got from watching their chosen sport, Motor \nCycling magazine was of the  opinion that for  British manu- \nfacturers ‘the true object of the  TT  was to  develop and \nin  the \nhope that they will demonstrate the  supremacy of British \ndemonstrate the  high-performance motorcycle ... \nmachines’. They did  acknowledge, however, as  thousands \nof spectators already knew, that the  races were ‘a great \nsporting event’ and ‘a magnificent spectacle’. \n\n64  M  POST-WAR PROGRESS \n1951: A NEW CLASS \nWith the TT being part of  the World Championships, \nthe  organizing ACU added a race for  125cc machines in \n1951, later to  be  termed Ultra Lightweights. It  ran  over \ntwo laps, while the  250cc Lightweights had  their race dis- \ntance reduced from seven to  four laps. Junior and Senior \nraces continued to  be  run over seven laps, a  distance of \n2641 miles. That was a long way to  maintain 100  per cent \nconcentration and apply consistent riding skill. Indeed, one \nmissed gearchange could ruin an  engine and all the  weeks \nof effort invested in a TT  appearance. \nEntry numbers continued to  increase, with ninety-eight \nSeniors comprising nine makes, 100 Juniors and five makes, \nforty Lightweights with sixteen makes and thirty-one Ultra \nLightweights with seventeen makes. In  addition, although \nthe Lightweight and 1000cc Clubmans classes had been \ndropped due to  lack of entries, there were 169  Clubman \nentries across the  remaining 350 and 500cc races. \nThe average British race fan  was most interested in  the \nJunior and Senior International classes, but was still keen to \nsee  what the  four-stroke Italian Mondials and  MV Agustas \nwould do  in  the Ultra Lightweight class, along with the \nSpanish Montesa two-strokes. The latter ran  on  a  10:1 pet- \nrol/oil ratio and carried a  reserve oil  tank controlled by a \ntap, which the rider operated to  provide an  extra drip-feed \nof oil  on  the  Mountain climb. Outputs of some 13bhp at \n10,000rpm were spoken of for the  Mondials, with 11/2bhp \nat  9,500rpm for  the  Montesas. That was well above the \npower produced by the  remainder of the  field, made up by \nBritish DOTs, DMW, BSA, Sun and several home-brewed \nmachines. \nThat the  Mountain Course was going to  be a stern chal- \nlenge for  contestants in  the  new 125cc TT  was revealed \nearly in  practice, after only nine machines lapped within \nthe 40-minute qualifying time. Following a meeting of the \nrace stewards, the qualifying time was  lifted to 45 minutes, \nbut still only eighteen starters came to  the  line. \nAs  ever, there was plenty to  catch the  interest in  the \nlarger classes. AJS had shorn the  Porcupine of its  spiked \nfins, worked on  its carburation, shortened the wheelbase by \nan  inch and  reduced wheel sizes to  19in. Their 7R also had \nreduced wheelbase and wheel size, revised front forks and a \ncompression ratio lifted to  9.4:1. Race teams were in their \nsecond year of working with 80  octane fuel, which was \nnow to  Air Ministry specification and consistent in quality. \nAfter \nearlier \nexperimentation \nby  \nVelocette, \nNorton \njoined \nthem \nin  \nadding \na \nreverse \ncone \non  \nthe  \nend \nof \ntheir \nmegaphones. \nThis \nwas \nbeneficial \nin  \naiding \nclean \nengine \npick-up \nand \nacceleration \nin \nthe \nlower \nrev \nrange, \nmore \nso \non \nthe \n350 \nthan \nthe \n500. \nIn \naddition, \nNorton \nwere \nnow \nsell- \nThis is the 500cc MV  Agusta with Les Graham (right), \nready to  weigh in at the 1953 TT. At  its first Island \nappearance in  195], it was fitted with telescopic front \nforks. The Earles forks fitted for  1953 did  nothing to \nimprove its appearance. \ning featherbed-framed Manx models to the public, although \nstill with the  single ohc engine. After experiencing tyre \ntroubles during several of the  Continental GP  meetings in \n1950, Norton changed supplier from Dunlop to  Avon and \nalso reduced rim size to  18in. Several makes showed slight \nenclosure of the  rear of the  seat and  tail  of the  mudguard. \nVelocette reduced their efforts in the  larger classes, but \ndid  produce several works 250s, although gearbox prob- \nlems put them out  of contention. \nOne big attraction in  the  Senior entry list was Les  Gra- \nham ona 4-cylinder MV Agusta. It proved fast and noisy in \npractice, but had  questionable handling. It was not  fancied \nfor  a  win and was described by journalist Charlie Rous as \n‘an ugly brute which certainly did not  look inviting to ride’. \nNORTON YET AGAIN \nThe Norton effort at the  1951 TT  was almost as  good as  in \n1950, with Geoff Duke being a double winner of Junior and \nSenior classes, during which he set new race average and lap \nrecords. He left the Senior figure at 95.22mph and the Jun- \nior  91.38mph. Only AJS got a  podium place amongst the \nNortons, with Bill  Doran finishing second on  a  Porcupine \nin \nthe \nSenior. \nThe \nMV \nAgusta \nretired \nwithout \nthreatening \nthe frontrunners. \nLightweights \nwere \nalso \nfaster \nthan \nbefore, \nas  \nwinner \nTommy \nWood \n(Moto \nGuzzi) \nput \nover \n3mph \non \nthe \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nand \nFergus \nAnderson \n(Moto \nGuzzi) \nset \nthe \nfastest \nlap \nat \n83.70mph. \nThe \nlittle \nGuzzis \npeaked \nat \nabout \n\n8,500rpm, ran  on  narrow 2.75 X  19 \ntyres and had a  top speed of  about \n105mph. \nIt  was the 10,000rpm Mondials \nthat took the  first four places in  the \nnew Ultra Lightweight race, with \nwinner ‘Cromie’ McCandless set- \nting a  benchmark for  future years at \na race average speed of 74.85mph and \nfastest lap at 75.34mph. Top speed of \nhis  Mondial was about 90mph. The \nMondials were followed by two Mon- \ntesas, before Eric Hardy’s DOT led \nhome the  rest of the field. \nIn  the  two Clubmans races, there \nwere speed gains on  the previous year \nbut the overall lap record remained \nintact. Best times on the Sulby Straight \nfor  them were 109.77mph (Senior) \nand  104.07mph (Junior). \n1952: FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS \nRiders and manufacturers left  the  Island in  1951 to  spend \nthe  rest of the  summer contesting the  World Champion- \nships and  the  winter on  machine development, the  results \nof the latter being brought to the  1952 TT. Stories of winter \nactivities always leaked out  ahead of the  races, one  telling, \n‘From Monza ...  comes a report that ramps have been built \nthere to  enable an  Anglo-Italian race team to  test  the reac- \ntion of their latest frame to  high-speed hump-jumping’. It \ncould only have been Les  Graham and MV Agusta. Maybe \nit was  an  attempt to recreate Ballaugh Bridge. Handling had \nbeen a problem for the big MV in  1951 and would continue \nto  be the  subject of experimentation. The factory entered \nthree 500s in  1952, but only Graham turned up to ride. He \nwas also entered on  one  of the  company’s 125s, along with \nCecil Sandford. \nNorton had been busy and brought ‘square’ engines of \n85.93 X  86.00mm for  its  500s, which were said to  per- \nmit higher revs and give a 5—7mph increase in speed. Their \ncylinder finning now enclosed the cam drive, they had new \nmagnetos, rear suspension units had been given a slight \nforward lean, tyres were 3.50 X  18  rear for  the  350  Jun- \nior  machine and ‘outsize’ 4.00 X  16  versions for  the  500 \nSenior. \nAJS \nwere \nstill \nstriving \nfor \na \npost-war \nTT \nvictory \nand \nhad \nmuch \nmodified \nthe \nPorcupine, \nnow \ncalled \nthe \nE95 \nmodel, \nwith \n45 -degree \ncylinders \nand \nanew \nframe, \nwhile \nthe \nworks \n7R \nwas \nnow \nthe  \n3-valve \n7R3, \nwith \ntwo \nexhaust \nvalves \nand \nports. \nThey \nhad \nalso \nbuilt \na  \ntwin-cylinder \nracer \nbased \non \nA Matchless G45 twin-cylinder racer in action. \nthe  500cc Matchless Super Clubmans roadster engine in \na  7R  frame, which would go  on  sale to  the  public as  the \nMatchless G45. \nVelocette limited their works entries to  350 and 250 \ndohe models for  Les  Graham, which came with hydrauli- \ncally damped girder front forks, five-speed gearboxes and \ntwin leading-shoe front brake. \nMoto Guzzi concentrated their efforts on  the Light- \nweight class and, although they brought 4-valve head ver- \nsions, they stuck to  two valves for their three-man team at \nthe TT. Meanwhile, there were private entries on  Mondials \nin the  Ultra Lightweight class. \nCOURSE CONDITIONS \nThe Mountain Course was reported to  be in excellent con- \ndition, but  it was still a very rough-textured surface com- \npared to  that ridden over today. Road maintenance was in \nthe  era  of spread a layer of tar,  apply granite chippings, \nusually by hand, run  a  steam roller over them and  leave it \nto  everyday traffic to  do the rest. There was some attempt \nto mechanize the spreading of chippings, but it usually cre- \nated a lined surface, which was  not welcome when cranking \nover for a bend. Bare patches of tar  soon appeared and  the \nexposed tar  would melt under hot conditions. \nJournalist and racer Vic  Willoughby was  not  happy with \nroad conditions and  wrote of ‘ghastly undulations between \nKeppel Gate and Kate’s Cottage’, which upset the handling. \nThe organizers took a positive step to improve safety by set- \nting back the  concrete fence posts on  several of the  Moun- \ntain bends. \n\n66  M  POST-WAR PROGRESS \nNAMES \nWith its focus on  speed, this book has to  concentrate on  the \nfrontrunners, so  it is not  possible to  plot the TT career pro- \ngression of up-and-coming riders. Some do  actually burst \nonto the  scene with a  podium finish, but most serve an \napprenticeship over several years. In  addition to  the  estab- \nlished stars, the early 1950s brought developing TT careers \nfor men like  Bill  Lomas, Rod Coleman, Ken Kavanagh, Ray \nAmm, Cecil Sandford, Reg Armstrong, Bob McIntyre, \nJohn Surtees and several foreign riders. \nTHE RACING \nWinter machine developments often received early-season \ntry-outs on  short circuits, but the real test came in  June \nwhen ridden over the  Mountain Course. AJS had  cause for \noptimism in  1952 when they finished practice for the Junior \nrace with the three fastest times. However, come race day, \nGeoff Duke (Norton) took an  early lead, rode to signals that \ncontrolled his pace, broke the  Junior race average (but not \nthe  lap record), and  won by 1’  minutes from team mate \nReg Armstrong. AJS had  to  settle for third place with Kiwi \nRod Coleman. \nThe Senior looked as  though it might go the  same way, \nwith Duke in the lead on  the  fifth lap, when clutch trouble \nforced his  retirement. This left Reg Armstrong to  catch \nand  then hold off the  strong challenge of Les  Graham (MV \nAgusta), to win  at a race average speed of 92.97mph— about \nImph slower than the  previous year. Ray Amm (Norton) \nwas third and Rod Coleman brought the  new Porcupine \ninto fourth. Perhaps it was ‘the luck of the  Irish’, but  just \nas  Reg Armstrong crossed the  line to  win the  Senior, his \nprimary chain snapped and  he lost  all drive \nThe \nLightweight \nrace \nturned \ninto \nthe \nexpected \nfight \namongst \nMoto \nGuzzi \nriders \nand \nwent \nto \nveteran \nFergus \nAnderson \nfrom \nEnrico \nLorenzetti, \nat a \nrecord \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nof \n8 3.82mph, \nwith \nBruno \nRuffo \nsetting \nthe \nfastest \nlap \nat \na \nnew \nrecord \nspeed \nof \n84.82mph. \nPerhaps \nindicative \nof \nthe \npassion \nthat \nMoto \nGuzzi \nput \ninto \ntheir \nracing, \nFergus \nreceived \na \ncongratulatory \ntelegram \nfrom \nthe \npresteene \nof \nMoto \nGuzzi, \nGiorgio \nParodi, \nworded \n‘Bravo, \nBravissimo. \nI \nkiss \nyou’, \nThe Ultra Lightweight race distance was increased from \ntwo to  three laps and  Cecil Sandford gave MV Agusta their \nfirst TT  victory at  record race and  lap speeds, ahead of the \nMondials of Carlo Ubbiali and Len Parry. \nIn winning the Senior Clubmans race ona Triumph twin \nat  over 80mph, Bernard Hargreaves still fell  slightly short \nof the  race and lap times set  by Geoff Duke back in  1949. \nThe Junior Clubmans did see  a  new race average speed \nrecord for winner Eric Housely (BSA) and  a  record fastest \nlap for  Bob McIntyre (BSA). It was the  fourth consecutive \nJunior victory for BSA. \nA magazine of the  day summed up  the 1952 TT  by say- \ning, ‘it was richly rewarding, whether viewed through the \neyes of the  spectator in  search of thrills or  those of the \ntechnician in search of data’. \n1953: A RECORD YEAR \nWherever one looked at  the 1953 TT  there were record- \nbreaking statistics. Entries for the  International races were \nthe  highest ever, foreign machines and riders were there \nin the  greatest mune yet seen and records were broken \nin  most of the  racing. It was only in  the  Clubmans classes \nwhere numbers were down. \nBy March the returning BMW \nmarque had its  sole representative, \nWalter Zeller, spending three weeks \non  the Island learning the course on \nan  R68 road bike. He  was followed by \nNSU teamsters Bill  Lomas and Werner \nHaas. Norton tried to fit ina quiet visit, \nbut  as  they brought their experimental \n350cc ‘kneeler’ streamlined model, \nthey became the  centre of attention. \nThere were fifty-one finishers in \nthe 1952 Junior TT -  twenty-three \nrode AJS 7R  models like this one, \nseventeen were on  Nortons and \neleven on  Velocettes. \nSN \nSSS SS \n\nEvery manufacturer seemed to \nhave new developments, most in  the \npursuit of  power, but same aimed \nat  increased reliability and stability. \nFor the latter, there Was evidence \nof steering head angles being steep \nened slig shtly to  suit  telescopic forks, \nwhile several were us sing Earles-type \nleading link  forks, with scope to  vary \nthe  pivot spindle locations. Suspen. \nsion travel in  genera] was approach \ning 4in  at the front and  slightly less at \nthe rear. In  a  hint of thing $ to come, \nNSU and Moto Guzzi had a  hint of \nstreamlining around the forks and \ntank. The scale of  manufacturer \ninvolvement varied. NSU showed \nits  intent by bringing two  lorries, a Ray Amm pilots the Norton Kneeler during practice for  the 1953 TT. \nservice van, two cars, twelve factory \npe rsonnel and ten  race machines for its  two  riders to  con- \ntest the 125 and 250 races. \nMV Agusta now had a  350cc four to  join the 500cc \nentries of  Les Graham and Carlo Bandirola, while in  the \nUltra Lightweight class there were fifteen entries on a  mix \nof MV works and over-the-counter racers. \nProbably the  biggest story in  1953 was that Geoff Duke \nleft Norton and signed to  ride a  Gilera four in  the  Senior \nrace. Geoff give s  the full story in  his autobiog graphy In  Pur- \nsuit  of Perfection, but  the fact that he  instantly doubled his \nearnings had  something to  do w ith  it. The need to  extricate \nhimself from a  contract to  race cars before he  could ride \nthe Gilera meant that he  came to  the  TT with very little \npractice. Quite happy with the  60bhp on  tap, he  did not \ncriticize the  Gilera’s handling at the  time, but in  later years \ntold that its  ‘road-holding on  the  bumpy Mountain circuit \nwas something else entirely’ Also entered in  the Senior \non  Gileras were Reg Reneioud, Dickie Dale and  Alberto \nMilani. \nThere had  been little change to  the  course, although the \nadjustment of cambers at  Union Mills and Signpost Corner \nwas  of benefit to  the  racers, as  was  major widening on  the \ninside of Bedstead. This gave a quicker run  from Signpost to \nthe  \nNook, \nso  \nallowing \nmore \nseconds \nto  \nbe  \nsaved. \nThe \nspectators \nwho \nsat  \non  \nthe \nbanks \nat  \nGovernor’s \nBridge \non \nrace \ndays \nin \n1953 \nwere \nunlikely \nto \nbe \nquite \nso \nelegantly \nattired \nas \nthose \nshown \non  the cover of the race programme. \nDUNLOP 111: \nJain \nTYRE \nwy \nIN THE WORLD \n\n68  M  POST-WAR PROGRESS \nSPEEDS \nThe TT  Special newspaper had timed riders on  the  Sulby \nStraight on  the  same evening for  several years, but  that \nbecame known to riders, so it changed the evening, saying ‘it \nhad become anticipated —  and  perhaps there has been some \nfoxing!’ In the  1953 timing session there was a  strong side \nwind, which was felt  to  be of benefit to  riders. It certainly \nseemed to  assist those riding bikes of more than one  cylin- \nder, for fastest was  Les Graham (MV Agusta) at  137.43mph, \nfollowed by Dickie Dale (Gilera) 135.38mph, Bill  Doran \n(AJS) 135.38mph, Geoff Duke (Gilera) 135.30mph, then \nReg Armstrong (Gilera) and Rod Coleman (AjS) before, \nin seventh place came the fastest single, that of Ken Kavan- \nagh (Norton) at  131.43mph. However, Sulby Straight was \nnot  regarded by many as  the  fastest place on  the  course \nand  speeds quoted in  the  1950s were average ones over a \ndistance of a  mile, rather than a  flash reading taken at  the \nfastest point. This meant that talk of  140mph maximum \nspeed from the  fours was clearly credible, and rumour \nsaid the  Gilera was  capable of nearer 150mph. This was all \nheady stuff on  unstreamlined motorcycles, but while speed \nalone may have been enough to  bring victory on  some con- \ntinental circuits, everyone knew that the Mountain Course \nrequired handling and  stamina to  match. \nJack Brett (Norton) was  the fastest Junior at  124.14mph, \nBill Lomas (NSU) fastest Lightweight at  an  incredible \n118.45mph, and  Cecil Sandford (MV Agusta) fastest Ultra \nLightweight at  100.57mph. \nWith such high speed-trap figures allied to  fast  practice \nlap times, it came as  little surprise when race average and \nlap records were broken in  the  Ultra Lightweight race by \nwinner Les  Graham (MV Agusta), in  the  Lightweight by \nFergus Anderson (Moto Guzzi), in the Junior by Ray Amm \n(Norton) and  in both Junior and  Senior Clubmans races. \nCome the  Friday of race week, everyone was  ready for a \nrecord-breaking battle of the  500s —  fours, twins and sin- \ngles. Geoff Duke (Gilera) obliged by setting anew lap record \nfrom a  standing start to  lead at the  end  of the first lap, fol- \nlowed by Les  Graham (MV Agusta) and  Ray Amm (Nor- \nton). But  Graham crashed early in the second lap, meaning \nAmm \ninherited \nsecond \nplace \nand \nReg \nArmstrong \n(Gilera) \nmoved \ninto \nthird. \nThose \npositions \nwere \nheld \nuntil \nearly \nin \nthe \nfourth \nlap, \nwhen \nDuke \nslid \noff \nat \nQuarter \nBridge \nand \nput \nhimself \nout \nof \nthe \nrace. \nThat \nleft \nRod \nColeman \n(AJS) \nand \nJack \nBrett \n(Norton) \nto \ndispute \nthird \nplace, \nuntil \nBrett \nreally \ngot \ninto \nhis \nstride, \ntaking \nthird \non \nthe \nnext \nlap \nand \novertaking \nArmstrong \nto \ntake \nsecond \nplace \nbehind \nwinner \nAmm \non \nthe \nfinal \nlap. \nSo, \nyet \nagain, \nworks \nNortons \ntook \nthe \nfirst \ntwo \nplaces \nin \nthe \nSenior \nTT. \nNot \nonly \nthat, \nbut \nin \nthe \nface \nof \nstrong \nmulti-cylinder \nopposition, \nRhodesian \nReg Armstrong takes Ballaugh Bridge on  his  4-cylinder \nGilera. \nFEDERATION INTERNATIONALE \nMOTOCYCLISTE \nMOTO-GU2ZZI \nPREMIERE MARQUE DU MONDE \nCLASSE 350 ce. \n1953 \nLE  PRESIDENT \nsth, ta RRM \nA, * ast \nfer on™ \nLE PRESIDENT Li  SECRETAIRE \na  CEE GENERAL \nThe \nFIM’s \nconfirmation \nthat \nMoto \nGuzzi \nwere \nWorld \nChampions \nin \nthe \n350cc \nclass \nin \n1953. \n\nRay \nAmm \nbroke \nthe  \nrace \naverage \nand \nlap \nrecord \nspeeds, \nleaving \nthem \nat \n93.85mph \nand \n97.41mph. \nTOO FAST? \nSplendid \nthough \nthe \nracing \nmay \nhave \nbeen \nat \nthe \n1953 \nTT, \nit saw four fatalities, which included veteran Les  Graham, \nwho crashed his  500 MV Agusta near the  bottom of Bray \nHill. Interviewed in Motor Cycling the  week before the  TT, \nGraham told how he  thought ‘present day 500s are  both \ntoo  big and too fast for  anybody’s good’. Under pressure \nfrom Italy, possible power or  capacity restrictions were the \nsubject of an  agenda item at  the  FIM Autumn Congress, \nalong with thoughts of Formula racing. The latter would \nprobably fall  somewhere between the Clubmans TT  and \nthe  racing of sports motorcycles, which was \npopular in Italy. \nThe proposals to  the FIM were aimed \ndirectly at  improving the  safety of riders. In \nthe  event, no  changes were made, but  the \nissue remained on  the  agenda. \nAMC \nAssociated Motor Cycles (AMC), owned \nAJS, Matchless, James and Francis Barnett. \nIn  1953, to  quote Mick Woollett, ‘they \nswallowed up  Norton Motors Ltd’. Norton \ndirector, Gilbert Smith, expressed the  hope \nthat things would continue as  they were at \nNorton, on  all fronts. And for  a  short while \nthey did. \n1954: SIDECARS RETURN \nEarly news for  1954 was of the  reintroduc- \ntion of a  Sidecar TT race for  machines of \n500cc. As  the available practice time over \nthe Mountain Course was limited, a  new \ncourse was found for  the  ‘chairs’, called the \nClypse Circuit. Approximately 11  miles in \nlength, it travelled the  reverse direction of \nthe  Mountain Course from Cronk ny Mona \nto  Creg ny Baa and then went eastwards over \ncountry roads, to  return via  Onchan to  the \nGrandstand. The Ultra Lightweights also \nfound their race transferred to  the  Clypse, \nwith \nboth \nclasses \ndue \nto \ncover \nten \nlaps \nand \n114 miles. \nThe Clubmans races remained on  the \nMountain \nCourse, \nbut \nunder \nthe \nname \nof \nClubmans \nTrophy \nand \nrun \non \nthe \nThursday \nof \npractice \nweek. \nWith \nfalling \nentries, \nthe \nS \n= \n2 \n2 \na) \n© \nOo \nfe) \n= \nCourse \nPOST-WAR PROGRESS #  69 \nClubmans events, deliberately or  otherwise, were in  the \nprocess of being elbowed out  of Island racing. \n‘PLUG CHOP’ \nFor  those running British singles, one  of the surest ways to \ncheck that they were running the correct mixture strength \nat full throttle was  to carry outa ‘plug chop’. One of the best \nplaces to  do  this was on  the  Sulby Straight. At  full  throt- \ntle  the  rider would pull in  the  clutch, cut  the  engine and \nbrake to  a standstill at the end  of the  straight. At appointed \ntimes, representatives of sparking plug companies would \nbe  waiting there, the  plug would be  removed and under a \nknowledgeable gaze the  colour would be assessed and pro- \nnounced acceptable, or  not. \nBallacog, O \nKeppel Gate Soy \niy \nCronk-ny- / \nGarroo [| \n@VIC BATES Cartographer Ltd 2016 \nThe route of the Clypse Course, introduced in  1954. \n\n70  M@  POST-WAR PROGRESS \n8 ices ae \nKLG used this full-page advertisement to  underline their \nTT successes. \nA  100MPH LAP? \nInterviewed \nby  \nGraham \nWalker \nback \nin  \n1952, \nGeoff \nDuke \nhad \nbeen \nasked \nabout \nthe \npossibility \nand \ntimescale \nof \nsome- \none \nlapping \nthe \nMountain \nCourse \nat \nan \naverage \nof \n100mph. \nStill \nriding \nfor \nNorton \nat \nthe \ntime, \nhe \nfelt \nthat \nthe \nfirst \n‘ton’ \nlap \nwould \ngo \nto \nsomeone \non \na \n4-cylinder \nbike \nwith \ngood \nhandling \nthat \nwas \ncapable \nof \n150mph. \nHe \nwent \non \nto \nsay \nthat \nhe \nbelieved \nit \ncould \nhappen \nin \n1954, \na \nprophecy \nhe \nrepeated \nduring \na \npublic \ndiscussion \nin \nearly \n1954. \nGeoff \nwas \nmounted \non \na \n4-cylinder \nGilera \nby \n1954 \nand \nclaimed \nof \nhis \nmachine \nthat \n‘road- \nholding \n(was) \nmuch \nimprove \ned \nby \nbuilding \nit \nlower \nand \nnarrower, \nand \nthe \nweight \nh \nad \nbeen \ncut \nconsiderably \nby \nthe \nextensive \nuse \nof \nlight \nalloys’. \nThe \nfactory \nalso \nmade \nimprovements \nto \nthe \nengine \nand \nclaimed \nan \noutput \nof \n64bhp \nat \n10,500rpm. \nGilera were not  the  only manufacturer seeking to  give \ntheir riders better bikes, for  works Nortons now had over- \nsquare engines, an  outside flywheel to  allow stiffening of \nthe crankshaftanda fives -speed g gearbox. Unfortunately, the \nlatter proved troublesome and the  team reverted to  four- \nspeeds for  the TT. AJS models were similar to  1953, but \ncame with a  lowered steering head and pannier-style pet- \nrol  tanks to  improve aerodynamics, while Moto Guzzi had \ndohe 350 and 500 engines. The speedy Lightweight NSUs \nwere said to  give 16.8bhp in  125cc form with six-speed \ngearboxes, and a  redesigned 250cc engine offered 32.7bhp \nwith a  four-speed ‘box’. \nTHE RECORD \nJust 37  seconds separated Ray Amm’s lap record of \n97.41mph from the  magic ‘ton’. Better machinery would \ngo  some way towards reducing that deficit and so  would \nthe  effect of course improvements. For 1954 there were \nplenty of those and, in  the  order a  rider would come upon \nthem, they were \n1.  Six  miles out, at  Appledene, a  cottage that projected \ninto the road had been demolished, allowing a straight- \nening of the  kerb line. \n2.   Some half a  mile before Ballacraine, the substan- \ntial  change in  road level at  Ballagarraghan had been \nreduced, so  keeping wheels on  the ground for longer. \n3.

Similar works at  Signpost Corner, where the  Clypse \nrejoined the  Mountain Course, resulted in  consider- \nable widening. \n9.  The twisty bends from the  Nook to  Governor’s Bridge \nwere eased. \n10. The bend leaving Governor’s Bridge to  join the  Glen- \ncrutchery Road was widened and was said to  give a \nbetter exit line. \nNo one  seemed sure of  how much time would be saved from \nall of the  above, but  it certainly would have been measur- \nable in seconds and heightened expectation that 1954 would \nbe the year of the  first 100mph lap. \nDISAPPOINTMENT \nWith big increases in lap speeds in the Junior race of 1954, \nwhere Ray Amm (Norton) added 3mph to his own record, \nand a similar situation in the Lightweight with Werner Haas \n(NSU) putting almost 6mph on  the previous best for a 250, \nrace followers fully expected to  see  high speeds in the  final \nrace of the  week, the  Senior TT. But  it was  not \nto be.  Wet and misty weather worsened during \nthe  race and  brought its  curtailment after four \nlaps, with victory going to  Ray Amm (Norton) \nwith a  fastest lap  of  89.82mph. Geoff Duke \nrode his  Gilera into second, feeling that he had \nsuffered unfairly from the  timing of the  stew- \nards’ decision to  stop the  race. \nOver on  the  Clypse, Rupert Hollaus (NSU) \ntook victory in  the Ultra Lightweight race \nat  an  average speed of 69.67mph, while Eric \nOliver (Norton) led  the  three-wheelers home \nat 68.87mph. \nPip Harris (Norton) makes a spirited turn at \nWillaston on  the Clypse Course, pursued by \nFritz Hillebrand (BMW). Notice the  sidecars \nmounted on  different sides. \nPOST-WAR PROGRESS #  71 \nWhile some might have left  the  1954 TT  feeling disap- \npointed, it certainly was  not  members of the NSU team, for \ntheir performance in  winning the  Lightweight and Ultra \nLightweight was most impressive. Amongst those admir- \ning  the 1954 NSUs, and taking many photographs, was \nSoichiro Honda. The head of the  Japanese firm was on  a \nfact-finding mission, with a view to building race machines \nto  contest the  World Championships. \n1955: BIG-NAME DEPARTURES \nEarly in  1955, ashock announcement from Norton revealed \nthat they were withdrawing from the World Champion- \nships and, in their words, ‘reverting to  a  policy of racing a \ntype of machine which can  be sold to  private owners’. That \nmeant over-the-counter racers. However, they did  intend \nto  send works machines to  contest the  TT, ridden by two \n21-year-old riders, John Surtees and  John Hartle, adding \nthat their machines ‘would probably incorporate features \nthat would be  included in  next season’s production mod- \nels’. Norton partly explained their action by decrying the \nspecialist nature of 4-cylinder race machines, the  move \nfrom road circuits to  purpose-built tracks and the  use  of \nstreamlining. \nA week later, AJS and  Matchless announced they were \nto  follow the  same route as  Norton. Their decision marked \nthe  end for the  factory Porcupine and  left  the  AJS 7R  and \nMatchless G45 being manufactured for sale to  the  public. \nNorton, Matchless and  AJS were three marques whose \nnames went back to the early days of the TT and their works \nentries would be  missed in  the bigger classes of champi- \n\n72  M@  POST-WAR PROGRESS \nonship racing. Amongst the  Lightweights, the  highly suc- \ncessful NSU concern also decided to  withdraw its  125 \nand 250cc works bikes, although it did  go  on  to  produce \nthe  250cc Sportmax production racer. With an  output of \n30bhp, it proved a competitive machine. \nOn  more general issues, the  fuel to  be  used at  the  TT \nwas still 80 octane, there was a straightening of the  road at \nthe pits, resurfacing elsewhere and  several minor improve- \nments. The Clubmans was  moved to  the  Clypse, where all \nraces were reduced to  nine laps. \nTyres gave little trouble at the TT, but Dunlop brought a \nnew directional rear, which included knife cuts across the \nblocks and  on  the  sides to  improve grip under wet condi- \ntions. This was  not  a special wet  weather tyre, for it would \nalso be  used in  the  dry. While hoping to  supply plenty of \ntyres for  racing, Dunlop also supported riders by fitting \ntheir tyres and by providing tubes, rim tapes, security \nbolts, balance weights, stout rubber bands, French chalk \nfor  handlebar grips, and by checking pressures and tem- \nperatures before and  after a race. \nStreamlining was now in  common use in  continental \nraces, but  some riders were concerned about the  effect of \ncross-winds on  the  Mountain Course. Accordingly, a  mix- \nture of streamlined and  unstreamlined bikes were out  dur- \ning practice sessions. It was still early days for this form of \nwind-cheating, but  it was said to  give a  gain equivalent to \n4bhp, usually allowed a raising of gearing and  reduced fuel \nconsumption, but put more demands upon the  brakes. \nGeoff \nDuke \nrides \nhis  \nGilera \nto  \nvictory \nin \nthe \n1955 \nSenior \nTT, \ntaking \nthe  \nbridge \nat \nUnion \nMills \nwith \nboth \nwheels \noff \nthe \nground \nwhile \ncranked \nover. \nThe \nfirst \nthree \nfinishers \nin \nthe \nJunior \nrace \nwere \non  \nfully \nfaired \nmodels \n—  \nBill  \nLomas \n(Moto \nGuzzi), \nBob \nMcIntyre \n(Norton) \nand  \nCecil \nSandford \n(Moto \nGuzzi). \nLomas \nlifted \nthe \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nrecord \nby \nalmost \nImph \nin \nhis \nnon- \nstop \nrun, \nbut \nthe \nlap \nrecord \nstayed \nintact, \nwhile \nsecond- \nplace \nMcIntyre \nreported \nstreamline-induced \nhandling \ndif- \nficulties \nin \nsome \nof the \nwindy \nlocations. \nIt \nwas \na \nrace \nin \nwhich \nflies \ngave \ntrouble, \nas \nthey \nplastered \nfairings, \nscreens \nand \ngoggles, \ninterfering \nwith \nriders’ \nvision. \nThirty \nyears \nearlier, \nGraham \nWalker \nhad \ngiven \nhis \npersonal \nremedy \nfor \nthat \nproblem: \n‘a sucked \nglove \nfinger \nquickly \napplied \n[to \nthe \ngoggles] \non \na \nfine \nday \nwill \nremove \nsquashed \nflies \nbefore \nthey \ncongeal’, \nMORE DISAPPOINTMENT \nCome Friday’s Senior race of  1955, the 100mph lap was \nagain on  peoples’ minds. Geoff Duke (Gilera) broke the \nexisting lap record from a  standing start and thereafter \npulled away from his  team mate Reg Armstrong, further \nupping the  lap record as  he went. Upon completion of his \nthird circuit it  was announced that he  had achieved the \n100mph lap and there was  cheering in the crowded Grand- \nstand. Shortly after, it  was announced that he  had actu- \nally just missed the  100mph lap, recording 99.97mph, less \nthan a second short of the elusive ‘ton’. Grandstand crowds \nbooed in  disappointment, but  Duke rode on  unaware and \nintent only on  taking victory. In this he was successful, and \nafter his seven laps he finished 2 minutes ahead of Reg Arm- \nstrong, setting new race average \nand lap records. Both Gileras had \nmodest handlebar fairings, although \nit was said that fully faired versions \nwere some 20 seconds a lap faster in \ncalm weather. \nWith works teams from only \nGilera, Moto Guzzi, Norton and \nMatchless contesting the Senior \nrace it was left  to  British over-the- \ncounter racers to  make up  most of \nthe  field of seventy-seven starters. \nAmong them were some forty- \nfive Manx Nortons and nineteen \nMatchless G45s. The latter model \nhad  become popular, and one gave \nDerek Ennett a  sixth-place finish. \nA report of the  time told that G45 \nengines had to  show a  minimum \nof 48bhp on  the  factory test bench \nbefore being installed in  a  new \nmachine. \n\nSome \nprivate \nowners \nlooked \nafter \ntheir \nown \nrace \nbikes, \nwhile \nothers, \nin \nsearch \nof \nthat \nelusive \nedge \nover \nthe \nopposi- \ntion, \nemployed \ntuners \nto \nprepare \neither \njust \nthe \nengine \nor \nthe \nwhole \nmachine. \nBoth \nNorton \nand  \nAMC \nprovided \na \nrace \nservice \nto \nprivate \nriders \nat \nthe \nTT, \nwitha \ngarage, \nmechanics \nand \nspares \nto \nkeep \nthem \nmobile. \nThere was  to  be further disappointment for Geoff Duke \nlate in  1955, when a  vengeful FIM banned him from rac- \ning for six  months for  supporting private riders protesting \nabout poor levels of start money at  the  Dutch TT. Sixteen \nothers, including Reg Armstrong, were also suspended for \nperiods of four to  six  months. As  their suspension periods \nran  from 1 January 1956, it put some of them out  of the TT. \n1956: FEWER VISITORS \nThe 1956 TT  saw a fall  in visitor numbers, and  most com- \nmentators felt  that this was due to  the  absence of Geoff \nDuke. Of  course, the  remaining riders were capable of \nputting on  excellent racing, but the glamour associated \nwith the  top  man was missing and  people stayed away. It \nwas another lesson for  the  organizing ACU, who some \nfelt  could have done more to  support Geoff at  FIM level, \nalthough they had worries at the time about the  attitude of \nsome factions within the FIM towards the TT and its World \nChampionship status. \nMORE RIDERS \nDespite the decrease in spectator interest, the TT  still held \nits  magic attraction for  riders, with increased entries in \n1956. There had been the usual off-season turnover as riders \nswapped race teams, and one  was  John Surtees, who moved \nto MV Agusta. John was  no  doubt attracted by the news that \nthe 500-4 was  said to be yielding 70bhp at  10,500rpm, giv- \ning a top speed of 150mph. In contrast, Moto Guzzi works \nrunner, Bill Lomas, told how their 500cc single-cylinder \ngave only 45bhp. However, being light, streamlined, of low \nbuild and  with good handling, the  single could still harass \nthe fours, except on  pure power circuits. For  1956, the fac= \ntory dropped its tubular space frame and reverted to  using \na large-diameter top-tube version. \nDuring practice in 1956, a limited number of riders were \ntimed on  Sulby Straight and John Surtees was  the fastest 500 \nat  135.38mph, with Ken Kavanagh’s Moto Guzzi coming in \nat  133.33mph. On that very limited evidence it seemed that \nMoto \nGuzzi \nwere \nstill \non \nthe \npace, \nbut \nthey \nfelt \nthey \nwere \nbeginning to  be outrun and  were working on  both 4-  and \n8-cylinder racers. \nGilera \ntried \nto  \nrecruit \nBob \nMcIntyre \nto  \nride \ntheir \n500 \nat \nthe \n1956 \nTT \nin \nplace \nof \nthe \nsuspended \nGeoff \nDuke, \nbut \nMcIntyre \ndecided \nto \nstay \nwith \nhis \nsponsor, \nJoe \nPotts. \nNor- \nPOST-WAR PROGRESS Hb  73 \nTravelling marshal Colin Broughton takes his  radio- \nequipped Triumph through the approach to  Whitegates \nat  the 1956 TT. \nton  brought a  three-man team of John Hartle, Jack Brett \nand Alan Trow, but former manager Joe Craig was no \nlonger with them. AMC were represented by Frank Perris, \nDerek Ennett and Gavin Dunlop. \nHelping to  look after rider interests out  on  the  course \nwas a team of Triumph-mounted travelling marshals. Their \nbikes were equipped with experimental radios as  an  aid  to \ncommunications, but  with technology that still used glass \nvalves and the like, the radios did not take well to  the \npounding received over the  Mountain Course. \nMOUNTAIN COURSE \nApart from a little cutting back of the  bank at  Rhencul- \nlen  to  improve sightlines and easing of the  testing right- \nhander at  Ballagarey, the  course was relatively unchanged \nfor  1956. The latter bend was situated at  the  top of the  hill \nafter Union Mills. Some called it Glen Vine. Its importance \nwas recognized by John Surtees, who said: ‘If you  did  it all \nright, and went through absolutely on  the  limit, not  only \nwas it one of the  most satisfying things on  earth, but  you \nalso got a good run  at the hill  up into Crosby and down past \nThe Highlander.’ Surtees was a  thinking rider and knew \nthat maximum effort at  Ballagarey would pay  dividends in \nterms of increased mph over the  reasonably straight and \nundulating stretch that followed to  Greeba Castle. Those \nnot  prepared to  put in the commitment at Ballagarey would \nbe  slower over those following miles. It was a  classic TT \nsituation that was repeated at  other points on  the  course. \n\n74  M@  POST-WAR PROGRESS \nThe Junior and  Senior TT  were the  only International \nraces held over the Mountain Course in  1956 and it was  the \nMoto Guzzi of Ken Kavanagh that hounded John Surtees’ \nMV Agusta throughout the  Junior until Surtees ran  out  of \nfuel on  the Mountain on  his last lap. This allowed Kavanagh \nto  win, although no  records were broken. \nOn a bright and  dry Senior race day, when gusty winds \ntook the  edge off top  speeds, John Surtees took his  nose- \ncone faired MV  Agusta to  his  first TT  victory, with a  fast- \nest  lap of 97.79mph. Bill  Lomas (Moto Guzzi) held second \nuntil the last lap, when he slowed and finished fifth. Second \nand third finishers were John Hartle and Jack Brett on  their \nNortons. It was a  race in  which the  first six  places were \noccupied by five different makes: MV Agusta, Norton, \nMoto Guzzi, BMW and  Matchless. \nIn  a  strange move, the  National-status Clubmans races \ntook place over the Mountain Course, but on  the Thursday \nand Saturday of the  week after TT. They yielded a  dou- \nble  win for  Bernard Codd on  BSA Gold Stars, but  turned \nout  to  be  the  final fling for  the  event, which was then \ndropped. Codd left the  fastest lap speeds for the  Clubmans \nat 82.33mph in the Junior and  86.52mph in the  Senior. \nCLYPSE CIRCUIT \nThe two Lightweight classes and the  Sidecars continued \nto  have their massed-start races over the  Clypse, where \nwinning race average speeds had hovered around 70mph \nsince their first running. Sidecars speeds matched those of \nthe  125cc solos and  the  variation in  lap times between the \nLightweight and Ultra Lightweights was only about about \n2—3mph. MV Agusta won both solo classes on  the  Clypse \nin  1956 with their top  rider, Carlo Ubbiali.

British sidecar racers usually had the  sidecar on  the \nleft, while continentals favoured the  right. This sometimes \nresulted in  them taking differing lines through bends on \nthe  narrow Clypse circuit. The three-wheelers were also \nexperimenting with streamlining. \n1957: FURTHER WITHDRAWAL \nNorton, Matchless and  AJS  ceased to  compete at  World \nChampionship level with works machinery in   1955, \nalthough they did  contest a  few other events. In  Novem- \nber  1956 they announced a further withdrawal, saying that \nthey would ‘not enter an  official works team in  [any of] \nnext season’s racing events’. A  statement from AMC said \nthat it was due  to  ‘current circumstances’, which required \n‘that all available technical skill and facilities are  devoted to \nto  the  development of standard products’. It was not  good \nnews, for without development their over-the-counter rac- \ners  would swiftly become obsolete. It also began a period of \nunofficial works support that left  race followers confused, \ngenerally muddied the  waters and did  nothing to  enhance \nAMC’s reputation. \nBy February 1957 it was  known that an  unofficial Norton \nteam would contest the  TT  on  what, it was said, were to \nbe  1957 Manx models. Riders were John Hartle, Jack Brett \nand Alan Trow and they were free to  use streamlining. \nThen, come April, race fans were reading of a  three-man \nteam who would be  using 1956 AJS  and  Matchless works \nmounts at the  TT. \nAccording to  output curves supplied to  the  press, in \nstandard form the 1957 Manx 500cc 30M gave about \n47bhp \nand \nthe \n350cc \n40M \nshowed \n35bhp, \nat \na \nlittle \nover \n7,000rpm. \nFor \nthe \nstandard \n7R, \noutput \nwas \ngiven \nas \n37.5bhp \nat \n7,500rpm \nand \nfor \nthe \nG45 \nit \nwas \n50.5bhp \nat \n7,200. \nWhether \nthe \nbhp \nfigures \nquoted \nby \nthe \nmanufac- \nturers \nof \nracing \nmotorcycles \nwere \ndirectly \ncomparable \ndepended \non \ntechnical \naspects \nlike \nthe \nform \nof \nbrake \nused, \nwhether \nthe \nmeasurement \nwas \ntaken \nat \nthe \ncrank \nor \nthe \nrear-wheel, \nplus \nthe \nless \neasy \nto \npin \ndown \nissue \nof \nwhat \nmessage \nthey \nwere \ntrying \nto \nput \nacross. \nThe \nfigures \nwere \nbest \ntreated \nas \na \nguide, \nfor \njust \na \nfew \nmonths \nlater, \nGeoff \n\nDuke, \nwhen \ncomparing \nthe  \nperformance \nof  \nJohn \nHartle’s \n500  \nNorton \nwith \nthat \nof \na \n350  \nworks \nMoto \nGuzzi, \nwrote \nof \nHartle’s mount giving 54bhp. \nIt \nwas \na  \ntime \nwhen \nthere \nwere \ncontrasting \nviews \nwithin \nthe \nsport \nabout \nthe \nmerits \nof \nstreamlining, \nand \nthe \nFIM \nset \nup \na \ncommittee \nto consider \nits \nfuture \nin \nboth \nsolo \nand \nsidecar \nclasses. \nGOLDEN JUBILEE \nWhen the  organizers sat  down to  plan the  1957 event, half \na  century had passed since a  band of pioneers gathered on \nTynwald Green for the  start of the first race for the Tourist \nTrophy. There was  plenty of general publicity on  the run-up \nto  the  Golden Jubilee event, plus specific news that Gilera \nhad  a  50bhp 350-4 to  go with its  500 and  that Moto Guzzi \nwould trump them all by bringing its V8  to  the  Island. Ital- \nian manufacturers were also busy with new and  developing \nmodels in the  Lightweight classes. \nEntry numbers increased and many of  the entries \nwere made by dealers. Without their support, supplying \nmachines, paying entry fees and often contributing towards \ncompetitors’ travel and living expenses, many talented rid- \ners  would not  have been able to  contest the TT. Most deal- \ners  were in  it for  the  sport, while also hoping for a little \nincreased business. \nThere were worries that a  period of petrol rationing \non  the  run-up to  the  TT  might affect attendances, but  the \nrestrictions were lifted just before the event. Good news for \nthe  racers was that fuel would be  of 100  octane. This was \nsupplied free of charge by firms like Shell and  Esso to riders \nwho were contracted to them. Top riders received generous \nretainers from the  petrol and oil  companies, with manu- \nfacturers, tuners and dealers also contracting themselves \nto particular suppliers. Such arrangements certainly helped \noil  the  wheels of motorcycle racing, but  could sometimes \nprove restrictive and  prevent riders from moving teams. \nPerhaps trying to  introduce some novelty to  proceed- \nings, the organizers considered sending riders off in batches \nof six, but  decided against it.  One change they did  make \nwas to  extend the 1957 Golden Jubilee Senior race to \neight laps, making it 302  miles. They also  reduced qualify- \ning times for Senior and Junior runners to  32 and  34 min- \nutes. Over on  the  Clypse Circuit, Lightweight and  Sidecar \nclasses reverted to  ten  laps, giving them each 107% miles \nof racing. \nVARIATIONS ON A THEME \nStreamlining \nwas  \nstill \na \nfree \nfor \nall \nand  \nvarious \nforms \ncould \nbe \nseen. \nIn \nthe  \nbigger \nclasses, \nMV \nAgusta \nused \njust \na \nnose \ncone, \nGilera \ninitially \nused \na \nnose \ncone \nbut \nmoved \nto \na \nfull \nPOST-WAR PROGRESS HE  75 \nfront-wheel-enclosing ‘dustbin’, while the  V8  Moto Guzzi \nused a  dolphin shape that left  the  front wheel exposed, \nalthough their singles used ‘dustbins’. In  the  Lightweight \nclasses Morinis wore full front and rear enclosure, while \nothers tended to  enclose just the  front. It was still a  time \nof experimentation with shapes and materials. On  the  Isle \not Man, the  Peel Engineering Company was working with \nfibreglass to  produce streamlining for several competitors. \nIt  would later manufacture the “Mountain Mile’ dolphin \nfairing, which became standard wear for  British machines. \nGeoff Duke with an  experimental version of the Peel \nMountain Mile fairing. \nrace weigh-in by his  mechanic. \n\n76  M@  POST-WAR PROGRESS \nIn  another instance of companies showing a  different \napproach to  racing, the  350cc 4-cylinder MVs and  Gileras \nwere scaled down 500s and  thus weighed almost the  same \nas  the big bikes —  some 320Ib (145kg) for the  new 350  Gil- \nera. In  contrast, the  350 and 500cc single-cylinder Moto \nGuzzis were scaled-up 250s. Geoff Duke told that after the \nMoto Guzzi factory had spent a winter ‘adding lightness’ to \nits  350, it came to  the  1957 TT  witha dry weight of 210Ib \n(95kg). He  felt that they had gone too  far with weight-sav- \ning and  that it could be too  ‘gazelle-like’ for the  Mountain \nCourse. Duke was a  non-starter at  the 1957 TT, due to  a \nshoulder injury sustained in  a  spill at  Imola. His  place was \ntaken by Australian Bob Brown, who joined Bob McIntyre \nin the  Gilera team. \nTHE MAGIC ‘TON’ LAP \nThe high quality of machines and riders entered for the  1957 \nraces made it difficult for  armchair pundits to  predict the \nwinners. On  the  Mountain Course, Bob McIntyre’s Senior \n(Gilera) was now giving 7Obhp and  he  set  the  pace dur- \ning practice for the Junior and  Senior classes, while on  the \nClypse Circuit, all-Italian Lightweight machinery scrapped \nfor the fastest solo times, piloted by riders of several nation- \nalities. Among the  three-wheelers, drivers of BMWs were \nexerting what was to  become a long-term stranglehold on \nthe  Sidecar class, where hydraulically assisted brakes were \nused by several competitors. \nBob \nMcintyre \nfights \nhis  \n500cc \nGilera \nthrough \nthe \nbottom \nof \nBray \nHill \nin  \n1957. \nRace \nweek \nturned \ninto \nan  \noccasion \nbefitting \na  \nGolden \nJubilee \nmeeting, \nwith \nnew \nrace \naverage \nand \nlap  \nrecord \nspeeds \nset  \nin \nevery \nevent. \nAs  \nexpected, \nBMWs \ndominated \nthe \nSidecar \nrace \nwith \nFritz \nHillebrand, \nWalter \nSchneider \nand \nFlorian \nCamathias \ntaking \nthe \ntop \nthree \nplaces, \nwhile \nTarquinio \nProvini \nrode \nhis \nMondial \nto \nUltra \nLightweight \nvictory \nfrom \nchasing \nMV \nAgustas. \nHis \nteam \nmate \nCecil \nSandford \ndid \nthe \nsame \nin \nthe \nLightweight \nafter \nSammy \nMiller \n(Mondial) \ngrabbed \nthe \nlead \non \nthe \nlast \nlap \nbut \nfell \nat \nGovernor’s \nBridge \n— \nthe \nlast \ncorner. \nThe \nmeteoric \nTar- \nquinio \nProvini \n(Mondial) \nadded \nalmost \n5mph \nto \nthe \nLight- \nweight \nlap \nrecord, \nleaving \nit \nat \n78.00mph. \nVictory in  the  Junior race went to  Bob McIntyre (Gil- \nera), who eventually won by a  comfortable 3’  minutes, \nalthough he had  to  lift the  race average and lap records by \nalmost 3mph to  shake off nearest pursuers Ken Kavanagh \n(Moto Guzzi) and  Bob  Brown (Gilera). \nThe last  race of the  1957 Golden Jubilee meeting was \nthe  Blue Riband Senior TT, which ran  under ideal condi- \ntions. Challenged in  the  early stages, McIntyre rode away \nfrom the  MV Agusta, BMW and Moto Guzzi opposition \non  his  big Gilera, breaking the  long-standing 100mph lap \nbarrier four times and leaving it at  101.12mph on  his way to \nthe  chequered flag and a popular victory. It was a  convince- \ning win, for  second-place John Surtees (MV Agusta) was \nsome 2 minutes behind, with Bob Brown (Gilera) third and \nDickie Dale, on  the  Guzzi V8, fourth. Overall race time \nto  cover the  eight laps was just over 3 \nhours for  the  winner and after those \n300 racing miles it was reported that \nthe ‘tyres of the  first three finishers \nappeared relatively unworn’. They still \nran  with a  slim 3.50in on  the rear. \nMembers of the  trade whose com- \nponents had been involved in  setting \nthe 100mph lap indulged in  much \npost-race advertising. For most it \nwas  enough just to  be  associated with \nthe  glory, but Ferodo sought to  fur- \nther impress by adding statistics that \nBob McIntyre would have applied his \nbrakes seventy-three times per lap and \nthat they would disperse 250,000 ft/lb \nof energy in slowing for Sulby Bridge. \nHALF A CENTURY \nDuring fifty years of TT  racing, man- \nufacturers and riders had striven to \nachieve ever greater speeds. In  doing \nso,  they lifted the average race win- \n\nning \nfigure \nof  \n38.22mph, \nset  \nby \nCharlie \nCollier \nin  \n1907 \non  \nhis \nfairly \nprimitive \nMatchless, \nup \nto  \nthe  \n98.99mph \nrace \naverage \nachieved \nby \nBob \nMcIntyre \nin \nthe \nSenior \nTT \nof \n1957 \non \nhis \nstate-of-the-art \nGilera. \nThat \nwas \nfar \nmore \nthan \nany- \none \ncould \nhave \nimagined \nin \nthe \nearly \ndays: \nin \nChapter \n1 \nwe \nsaw \nhow, \nwhen \nFrank \nPhilipp \nset \na \nrecord \nlap \nspeed \nof \n50.11mph \nin \nthe \nfirst \nTT \nto \nrun \nover \nthe \nMountain \nCourse \nin \n1911, \none \npublication \nspeculated \nwhether \n‘a \n60mph \nor \neven \na 70mph \nTT” \nwas \npossible \nin \nthe \nfuture. \nThere was less  speculation about future speeds in  1957, \nfor the breaking of the  100mph lap barrier left many feeling \nthat a plateau had been reached. \nSo much had changed during halfa century of TT racing, \nbut  one constant remained: despite the  advances in  tech- \nnology and many course improvements, racing still took a \nheavy toll upon machinery, thus highlighting weaknesses \nand  fulfilling much of its original purpose. \n1958: ITALIANS QUIT \nPerhaps the reluctance to  speculate about a speedier future \nafter the  Golden Jubilee TT  was influenced by the  shock \ndecision of Italian makes Gilera, Moto Guzzi and  Mondial \nto  withdraw from racing at  the  end of the 1957 season. \nThis was  principally on  financial grounds, although Gilera’s \ninput into racing had  slowed, due  to  the death of Giuseppe \nGilera’s son  from illness. Their twin passions for engineer- \ning and  racing would be badly missed. \nOne Italian firm who did not  withdraw was MV  ‘Agusta. \nThe race activities of the  Gallarate concern were a  per- \nsonal hobby of Count Agusta, his  principal business being \nthe manufacture of helicopters. The next few years were to \nprovide the  Count with an  enjoyable and  successful hobby, \nacross all  solo classes, even though his  number one rider, \nJohn Surtees, told that he had to pester the  Count to main- \ntain development of the big MVs. \nBACKGROUND \nTT  racing in  1958 felt  the  effect of several changes. First, \nof course, was the  absence of some of the  foremost Italian \nmanufacturers, although one ‘new’ Italian firm to  take up \nthe \nchallenge \nin \nthe \nUltra \nLightweight \nclass \nwas \nDucati, \nwith its  little four-stroke engines sporting desmodromic \nvalve \ngear \nand \nputting \nout \n18bhp \nat \n12,500rpm. \nThe \nclass \nalso \nsaw \nthe \nappearance \nof \nthe \nEast \nGerman \nMZs, \nwho \nwere \nsaid \nto \nalmost \nmatch \nthat \noutput \nwith \ntheir \npioncer- \ning developments in two-stroke technology. \nAfter \nconsidering \nthe  \nissue \nof \nmachine \nenclosure, \nthe \nFIM \nintroduced \na \nruling \nrestricting \nstreamlining \nto \nthe \ndol- \nphin \ntype, \nwhich \nleft \nthe \nfront \nwheel \nexposed. \nThus \n‘dust- \nbins’ \nand \nrear \nenclosure \nwere \nno  \nmore. \nThe \nsame \nbody \nwas \nPOST-WAR PROGRESS #  77 \nstill talking of dropping the  500cc class, perhaps in  1960, \nand there continued to  be  mutterings about the  introduc- \ntion of Formula classes. \nTyre manufacturers were using racing to  develop their \nproducts, with nylon carcasses replacing rayon and  cotton. \nNylon was reckoned to  be lighter, while still being robust, \nflexible and offering cooler running. It  was a  significant \nchange in construction by both the  Avon and  Dunlop con- \ncerns, which would soon spread to  roadster tyres and, like \nother features that first appear in racing, would be adopted \nby other firms, even those who did  not  race. \nAmong some of the  top riders who lost  their seats after \nItalian manufacturers dropped out, Geoff Duke was  now on \na works BMW for the  Senior and  Dickie Dale was  similarly \nmounted. Duke was also the  recipient of a  special 350cc \nengine from Norton at  the  TT, plus a  five-speed gearbox. \nOthers to  receive special engines that were claimed to  be \n‘squarer’ were Keith Campbell, Alan Holmes and sidecar \nman ‘Pip’ Harris, while Bob Brown was given a  complete \n500cc machine. Meanwhile, Matchless had  been develop- \ning a  500cc version of the  7R, and a  prototype was to  be \nridden at  the  1958 TT  by Jack Ahearn. It would be  called \nthe  G50 and  soon go on  general sale. \nWEIGHT \nHidden among the  race regulations was one that had been \nlargely ignored in  previous years. It prescribed that riders \nmust weigh a minimum of 9 stone 6 pounds in leathers. The \nsurprise production of a pair of scales in  1958 saw some of \nthe  lighter-looking riders asked to  step on  them. Among \nthose not reaching the appointed weight were Romolo \nFerri, Carlo Ubbiali and Luigi Taveri. The last  was 21lb \n(10kg) underweight, while the  diminutive Gary Dickinson \nwas even lighter. They were all  required to  add ballast to \ntheir machines to  reach the  required weight. \nSPEEDS \nJohn Surtees and  John Hartle were the  MV Agusta works \nriders and  they set  the  pace in practice in  1958, on  models \nnow fitted with dolphin fairings. On one  chilly early-morn- \ning session, as  it was struggling to  get light, Surtees put in \nhis  fastest ever lap, averaging 99.06mph from a  standing \nstart. While he was  not  openly critical of the  MVs, he felt \nthat they were still too  tall  and heavy. But with the  350 \nrevving to  10,800 and  the  500 to  10,400, perhaps he  was \nconsoled by the power output, which gave him considerable \nadvantage over the  British machines in  the  field of eighty- \ntwo, most of them being Nortons. \nTimed on  Sulby Straight under perfect conditions, John’s \nwas the fastest 500 at  139.56mph, with the Norton of Alan \n\n78  HM  POST-WAR PROGRESS \nTrow next at  136.40mph, followed by Bob Anderson (Nor- \nton) at  133.33mph. It was Geoff Tanner (Norton) who was \nthe  fastest 350  at  126.80mph, followed closely by the  Nor- \ntons of Bob McIntyre and  Terry Shepherd. \nMY AGUSTA’S YEAR \nRace week started with the Junior TT,  where John Surtees \ngave MV Agusta the  first of the  four wins it would achieve \nin  the  solo classes at  the  1958 TT. Pursued home by Dave \nChadwick and Geoff Tanner on  Nortons, Surtees had no \nneed to  try  for records. \nWednesday saw action on  the Clypse, and Tarquinio \nProvini had to break race average and lap records on  his MV \nAgusta to  fight off team mate Carlo Ubbiali, who finished \na  few  seconds behind. Finishing in a highly creditable third \nplace in his first year at  the TT  wasa y oung Mike Hailwood \n(NSU). Ultra Lightw eight victory went to  Carlo Ubbiali \n(MV Agusta) and he  was followed home by  the Ducatis of \nRomolo Ferri and Dave Chadwick. \nSidecars had their own race over the Clypse on  the \nWednesday \nand \nthis \nsaw \nvictory \ngo \nto \nWalter \nSchneider \n(BMW) at  record-breaking speeds. \nJohn Surtees and his \n4-cylinder MV Agusta at \nSignpost Corner in  1958. \nSmoke from the exhausts \nwas customary when the \nthrottle was shut on  the \nMV, John saying that it was \nrelated to  the substantial \namount of oil  carried. \nWith three solo races \nrun and three victories, \ncome Friday’s Senior race, \nMV Agusta were looking \nto  make it  a  clean sweep. \nThat was the  way it worked \nout, with John Surtees tak- \ning victory at  a  race average \nspeed of  98.63mph and a \nfastest lap of  100.58mph. \nSurtees’ team mate, John \n=< Hartle, was forced to \nse retire, as  he had in  the  Jun- \nior,  but  this time it was due \nto  a  major mechanical fire, \nwhich saw  his Italian mount burn itself out  at the side of the \nroad. This left  Bob Anderson and Bob Brown to  take the \nother two podium places on  their Nortons. \nSPEED \nThe post-war era  started with speeds that did  not match \nthose of the late 1930s, due to the poor fuel available. Once \nthat returned to  pre-war standards, fastest laps in the  Sen- \nior class soon overtook the best pre-war figure of 91.00mph \nand aided by faster 4-cylinder Italian machines, fastest lap \nspeed had  climbed to  101. 12mph. \nEND OF AN ERA \nRiders came from all over the world to contest the TT races, \nbut apart from the successful participation of the Indian \nmarque in  the ev ent’s early day S;  the manufac turers repre- \nsented and  w inning in  1958 were almost w holly European \nand  had  been for dec ades. This remained the position even \nafter the ‘World’ C hampionships were created in  1949, \nbut \nchange \nwas \nin \nthe \nair, \nfor \nthe \nHonda \nMotor \nC \nompany \nof \nJapan \nwas \nabout \nto \nfulfil \nSoichiro \nHonda’s \nambition \nand \nchallenge for a Tourist Trophy. \n\nCHAPTER FLV E \nee ley Sav Ess lt \nThe creator of Honda Motors, Soichiro Honda, visited the \nTT  in  1954, armed with camera and notebook to  gather \nas  much information as  possible about the  event and the \ncompeting machinery. It was the year that NSU dominated \nthe Lightweight and Ultra Lightweight classes at  the  TT \nand  in the  wider world of racing, so  when Honda made its \nfirst TT entries in  1959, it was  probably no  coincidence that \nthe bikes from Japan had  more than a passing resemblance \nto  the  earlier NSU 125cc Rennmax models. However, no \none should underestimate the  enterprise shown by Honda \nNaomi \nTaniguchi \nand \nhis  \n125cc \nHonda \non  \nthe \nClypse \nCourse \nin \n1959. \nalmost sixty years ago and no  one  can  be in any doubt today \nof the  impact they have had  on  the  world of racing. \nBased at  the  Nursery Hotel in  Onchan, the  company \nhad  five  entries in the  125cc Ultra Lightweight TT  in  1959. \nFour machines were to  be  ridden by Japanese riders and \nthe fifth by American Bill  Hunt. During their stay they had \nmany visits from the curious and also from the more knowl- \nedgeable, including several riders. All  were keen to  get  a \nclose-up view of machines that one journalist described as \n‘neatly made and technically brilliant’. \n1959: FORMULA I \nAnother new arrival on  the  TT  scene in  1959 was Formula \nI racing. This was for  production racing motorcycles of \nwhich at  least twenty-five must have been sold. Two races, \nfor  350cc and  500cc machines, were run  concurrently over \nthree laps on  the  Saturday evening prior to  race week, but \nwith a  combined entry of just twenty-nine riders on  Nor- \nton, Matchless, AJS aad BMW, they were thinly spread \naround the Mountain Course. It was Bob McIntyre (Nor- \nton) who took the  500cc win  at an  impressive race average \nof 97.77mph, while his  close friend, Alastair King (AJS), \nwas first 350  home at  94.66mph. Mclntyre’s fastest lap on \nhis  ‘standard production’ Manx Norton in  that Formula I \nrace was 98.35mph, which compared well with his  best- \never Norton lap on  his  specially prepared Joe Potts race \nbike of 99.98mph, set  in  1958. King was also fast  and  his \npace matched the Junior TT winning speeds of the previous \ntwo years, set  by Gilera and MV Agusta. \nApart from knowing that works exotica were excluded, \nfew understood the  purpose of Formula I and, according \nto  The  Motor Cycle, the  1959 event ‘was not  true Formula I \nracing, for such machines as  the  Manx Norton and  7R  AJS \nhave yet to be entered on  the FIM register’. This was  despite \nthe  fact that the  event had been virtually forced upon the \nTT  by the  FIM. \nDEVELOPMENTS \nWith patient development, most recently by Doug Hele at \nNorton and  Jack Williams at  AMC, the  traditional British \n\n80  M  EAST vs  WEST \nsingles were putting out  ever more power. When launched \nin  1948, the  AJS 7R  produced 29bhp at  6,800rpm, but  in \n1959 it gave 40.5bhp at  7,800rpm and  was reckoned to  be \nfaster than a  standard 350 Manx Norton. A desmodromic \nversion of Norton’s Manx engine was  brought to  the  Island \nfor  evaluation purposes in  1959 and Terry Shepherd used \nit in practice, \nThe Lightweight and Ultra Lightweight classes saw \ntechnically interesting machines entered by MV Agusta, \nDucati, MZ, EMC, Honda and  others. A range of singles, \ntwins, four-strokes and two-strokes filled what was  a buoy- \nant  class. Whether it was due to  the  talk of dropping the \nbigger classes from GP  racing is unclear, but  in contrast to \nmodest development of their fours, MV Agusta put much \neffort into improving their Lightweights, the  250 coming \nwith a new frame and  said to be capable of topping 130mph \n—almost matching their 350 four. \nStreamlining was now widely used in  its  regulation \ndolphin form, but  despite obvious benefits, it also created \nproblems. Some users met with general engine-cooling dif- \nficulties, others found a need to  provide ducting to  take air \nto  carburettor inlet areas, while those prone to  sparking- \nplug problems fitted air  deflectors to  help cool them. Each \npractice session provided examples of ‘panic engineering’ \napplied to  deal with such issues, for they were mostly ones \nthat had  not  revealed themselves on  short circuits. \nGary \nHocking \nin \nthe  \nmiddle \nof \nthe  \ntraditional \nrun  \nand \nbump \nstart \nused \nin \nracing \nin \nthe \n1950s. \nPRACTICE \nRunning to form in the big classes, the MV  Agustas of John \nSurtees and John Hartle were fastest in practice in 1959, but \namong the  Lightweights prospective winners were harder \nto pick. Riders of MV  Agusta, Ducati and MZ  machines all \nvied for the  fastest times. \nOver the  2-mile run  to The Highlander on  the Mountain \nCourse, John Hartle clocked the  fastest Senior time at  an \naverage speed of 131 .42mph and John Surtees 128.57mph. \nBest single was Alan Shepherd on  his  G50 Matchless at \n123.31mph. In later years a speed trap was  located near The \nHighlander that gave ‘flash’ readings at  close to  maximum \nspeeds, but in  1959 the  average speeds quoted over 2 miles \nwere usually about 10mph down on  maximum. \nA newcomer enlivening the  racing scene before the  TT \nwas Gary Hocking, and  he  showed well on  Reg Dearden \nNortons during practice. Reg was often the conduit by \nwhich Norton released their special engines at  TT  time, \nwith Tom Arter being used by AMC. \nMike Hailwood had a stable of eight machines in  the \ngarage of Geoff Duke’s Arragon Hotel at  Santon, with vet- \neran tuner Bill  Lacey coaxed out  of retirement to help tune \nthem. \nMV AGUSTA AGAIN \nMV faced serious opposition in  all  four solo International \nTT  classes in  1959 but, as  in  1958, they \nfinished the  week with four victories, \nincreasing their speeds in  all  classes. \nTarquinio Provini rode the 125 and \n250 MVs to  new race average winning \nspeeds and  also set  the  fastest 250cc lap. \nIn doing so  he became the first to  lap the \nClypse Circuit at  80mph, while a  new \nlap record for a  125  went to  Luigi Taveri \n(MZ) at  74.99mph. \nEveryone was interested in  how the \nnew Hondas would perform in  the 125 \nUltra Lightweight class and  they did  not \ndisappoint. With four finishers from five \nstarters, they took sixth, seventh, eighth \nand  eleventh positions in a field that had \neighteen finishers. They did not  have the \nspeed of the  winning MV Agustas, but \nit was  a  performance that earned them \nthe  Manufacturers team prize and their \nsixth-place finisher, Naomi Taniguchi, \nrode fast enough to  win a Silver Replica. \nRaces \non  \nthe \nClypse \ncontinued \nto \nhave \nmass \nstarts, \nwhereas \non \nthe \nMountain \n\nCourse \nthe \nsystem \nwas  \nstill  \nfor  \ninterval \nstarting. \nNew \nfor \n1959 \nwas \nthe \nseeding \nof \nthe \ntop \nfive \nrunners \nin \nthe \nJunior \nand \nSenior \nraces, \nbased \non \ntheir \nprevious \nyear’s \ntimes, \nfol- \nlowed \nby \nballoting \nthem \nfor \nthe \nfirst \nfive \nstart \nnumbers. \nThis \nwas \na \nmajor \nchange \nfor \nriders \nand \nspectators, \nwith \nobvious \nbenefits \nfor \nboth. \nJohn Surtees won the  Junior race, setting a  new race \nrecord but  falling just  short of the  lap record, while John \nHartle came second after inheriting the  place from Bob \nMcIntyre (AJS), who had held the  MV  rider at bay until he \nretired on  lap five. While competitors in  that Junior race \nwere troubled by molten tar,  the  Senior TT had  to  be post- \nponed from Friday to  Saturday due  to  inclement weather. \nWhen Surtees got away from the start of the Senior just after \n10.30am, he rocketed into the  lead over dry roads, setting \na new lap record of 101.18mph from a standing start. Then \nthe  heavens opened with heavy rain, hail, mountain mist \nand strong winds. Those combined to  reduce Surtees’ lap \nspeed to  some 85mph as  he fought the  elements and  coped \nwith areas of both standing and running water, together \nwith the many slides that ensued as he rode to victory. From \nsixty-six starters, twenty-two sodden heroes finished the \nrace, the winner being in a state of physical exhaustion after \naveraging 87.94mph over the  full  2641 miles and  being in \nthe  saddle for over three hours. \n1960: CHANGE OF  COURSE \nIn  1960 the Lightweight, Ultra Lightweight and ‘Sidecar \nraces were moved from the  Clypse back to  the  Mountain \nCourse. Other changes saw Junior and Senior race dis- \ntances reduced from seven to  six  laps, giving each a  race \ndistance of 226’ miles, while the  Lightweight class cov- \nered five laps and 188% miles. The Ultra Lightweight and \nSidecars ran  over three laps and 113% miles. All races now \nused interval starts. There was no  Formula! race. \nFINE DISPLAY \nThe TT races attract visitors for many varied reasons, and in \n1960 renowned Australian engineer Phil Irving was there \nto  view the  technical developments on  show. In his words, \nthe  TT  was  responsible for  ‘assembling, at  the  same time, \nthe finest and most varied collection of racing machinery it \nis possible to  see  anywhere in the world’. \nFollowing Honda’s lead, and with huge support from \nShell in Japan and  Britain, Suzuki came from Japan to  con- \ntest  the  Ultra Lightweight race with twin-cylinder Colleda \nRT60 \nmodels. \nThey \nhad \nbasic \npiston-controlled \ninduction, \nseparate \nalloy \nbarrels \nand \nran \non \na \npetroil \nmix. \nWith \nsix- \nspeed \ngearboxes, \nthey \nwere \nsaid \nto \nbe \ngood \nfor \n94mph. \nArriving \nwell \nbefore \nthe \nstart \nof \nofficial \npractice, \nthe \nthree \nEAST vs  WEST @  81 \nJohn Surtees holds a tight line through Hillberry in the \nwet Senior TT  of  1959. \nSuzuki riders put  in  many learning laps of the  course on \nroad bikes. \nIn  the Lightweight class Honda brought new 4-cylin- \nder RC161 models with over-square engines revving to \n13,500rpm and  giving 36bhp (some say  more), while MZ \nwere claiming 42bhp at  11,000rpm from their twins. As \nusual, this class had  a smattering of cut-down singles from \nNorton, BSA and  Velocette. \nThe Junior class saw entries of enlarged Lightweights \nfrom Morini, Bianchi, Ducati and  MV Agusta, while Eddie \nCrooks was out  on  an  experimental ‘Lowboy’ 350  Norton. \nNot all the  experimental models entered made it to  racing \nor  even practice, however. \nWith the  big MV Agustas now generally reliable, it was \nthe  overtuned singles that were more likely to  fail  in  the \nJunior and Senior races. Thus the latter probably welcomed \nthe  reduction of race distance to  six  laps, particularly as \nthose who went for pannier fuel tanks might be able to runa \nnon-stop race, an  option not  open to  the  22mpg MVs with- \nout making them unmanageable in  the  handling depart- \nment. \nMost sidecars were still ridden in sit-up style, but  some \nwere positioning fuel tanks in  the  sidecar and their rid- \n\n82  M  EAST vs  WEST \ners  were moying to  kneeler mode, something which Eric \nOliver \nhad \nexperimented \nwith \nback \nin \n1953. \nTheir \nwheels \nhad become smaller and many utilized short leading-link \nfront forks. Dunlop provided a  special new rear racing \ntvre for  the ‘chairs’, but Avons were the preferred wear \nfor solos. There was nothing like the  specialization in tyres \nthat there is  in  today’s racing, although Avon were mak- \ning something of their use  of high- hysteresis rubber, said to \nabsorb and then slow ly release ‘shoc ks,  rather than bounc- \ning back. They were also claimed to  offer better grip in the \nwet. However, when asked what tyres he was using, Mike \nHailwood replied ‘ound and black ones’. \nSPEEDS \nWhile John Surtees claimed that the 500cc MV Agustas \nwere ‘topping 150mph in  places’, figures from the Sulby \nspeed trap —  not  the fastest spot on  the course —  showed that \nspeeds in recent years seemed to  have peaked there at  just \nunder 140mph. Indeed, it  was Mike Hailwood (Norton), \non  the  best single-cylinder machinery that money could \nbuy, who equalled the fastest MV speed in  1960, match- \ning John Hartle’s figure of 138.46mph. \nexceptional figure, for next best single was Dickie Dale on \nHailwood’s was an \na  Norton at  128.57mph, although previous years had seen \nother singles over 130mph. \nJohn Surtees’ MV was fastest Junior at  125.91mph, with \nBob  McIntyre (AJS) next at  120mph. In a sign of the  times, \nTarquinio Provini (Morini) equalled Surtees’ Junior speed \nwith the fastest Lightweight at  125.91mph, as  did Bob \nAnderson on  his MZ. Moto Kitano was  the fastest Honda at \n117.68mph, indicating that the  Japanese company’s 250cc \nfours were still down on  speed. \nIn  the Ultra Lightweight, Carlo Ubbiali hit  109.77mph \non  his  little MV Agusta, followed by team mates Gary \nHocking (107.81lmph) and  Luigi Taveri (105.88mph). Side- \ncars were not  timed at  Sulby, but  on  the  2-mile stretch to \nThe Highlander the  fastest average speed was set  by Flo- \nrian Camathias (BMW) at  111.8 82mph, followed by Fritz \nScheidegger (BMW) with 111.14mph and Bill Beevers \n(BMW) with 105.88mph. Speeds over that stretch would \nprobably be about 10mph down on  absolute maximum side- \ncar  speeds. \nROAD SURFACING \nDespite \nthe \nslightly \nmixed \npicture \non  \nmaximum \nspeeds \nin  \n1960, \npractice \nweek \nshowed \na  \ngeneral \nreduction \nin  \nlap \ntimes, \nindicating \nan \noverall \nincrease \nin \nlap \nspeeds. \nMany \nfelt  \nthat \nthis \nwas \ndue  \nto  \nthe  \nnew \nlengths \nof \nsmooth \ntarmac \nbeing \nlaid \nby \nthe \nBlaw \n-Knox-type \nbead \npaving \nmachine \nnow \nbeing \nused \non  \nthe  \nIsland’s \nroads. \nNot \nonly \ndid \nthis \nmodern \nThe Ballacraine Hotel provides a  backdrop to  John \nSurtees and his  MV  Agusta during the 1960 Junior TT. \nmachine provide a smooth running surface, but it also filled \ndepressions, thus eliminating bumps. With race machines \nhitting maximum revs in  all  gears, riders were forced to \nease the  throttle over bumpy sections, to  avoid over-rey- \nving as  the  back wheel left  the  ground. They liked the  new \nsmoother surface for  allowing them to  keep the  throttle \nwide open for longer. They also liked its grip quality in the \ndry, although some had reservations about the  feel in  the \nWet, W here: they felt  it could suddenly ‘let go’. \nAmong stretches to  benefit from the new surfacing was \nBray Hill. which, now being smoother, allowed John Sur- \ntees to  take it flat  in  top  on  his  big MV, even though the \nextra speed did  induce some tail-weaving after the  dip at \nthe bottom. The high-speed run from Creg ny Baa  to  Bran- \ndish also benefited from new sur facing, yielding yet  a  few \nmore mph and  the  paring of lap times. \nMORE RECORDS \nIn  a  change to  the  race programme for  1960, the  Light- \nweight, Ultra Lightweight and Sidecar classes ran  on  Mon- \nday, Junior on  Wednesday and Senior in  its  customary Fri- \nday position. No  one was surprised when, in  winning the \nSidecar race, Helmut Fath’s fastest BMW lap of 85.79mph \nraised the  lap record by 28 .61mph, for the last  Sidecar race \nover \nthe \nMountain \nCourse \nwas \nin \n1925. \nEqually, \neveryone \nknew \nthat \nspeeds \nin \nthe \nsmall \nclasses \nwould \nbe \nfaster \nthan \ntheir \nlast \nride \nover \nthe \n3734-mile \nlap, \nwhich \nwas \n1953 \nfor \nUltra Lightweights and 1954 for Lightweights. \nIn  \n1960 \nthe  \nUltra \nLightweight \n195 \nwan \nwent \nto \nCarlo \nUbbiali \n(MV \nAgusta) \nw \n‘ith \na \nfastest \nlap \nof \n86.10mph, \nup \nfrom \nthe  \n1953 \nfastest \nspeed \nof \n78.21mph. \nThe \nLightweight \n\nA  \nPaddock \nshot \nof \nNaomi \nTaniguchi \nand \nhis  \nnew \n4-cylinder \nHonda \n250cc \nin \n1960. \nIpp. \nrecord \nJ & \n1: QUALIFYING \n\n84  Mf  EAST vs  WEST \nStandard 1960 Manx Nortons were now delivered with \n11:1 compression ratios for  350 and 500cc versions and \npriced at £497. However, no  one was going to  wina TT  on \na production Manx and that is where tuners came into play. \nExactly how much it cost to give a machine sufficient extra \nperformance to  enable it to  challenge for a podium place at \nthe TT  was  never revealed by those paying the bills. \nMany racers could not  afford to  buy extra performance, \nbut guidance on  preparing engines for  racing could be \nfound in books like Phil Irving’s Tuning for Speed. \nFashionable in  1961 were lightweight telescopic steering \ndampers pioneered by Honda, and the Amal GP2 carburet- \ntor  was now in use  on  British singles. \nADVANCE OFTHE LIGHTWEIGHTS \nIn British eyes, the Junior and  Senior races were the princi- \npal events at every TT  meeting, but for many others it was \nin the  Lightweight classes where the  real interest lay. That \nwas  particularly so  in  1961 when the works teams of Honda \nand  Suzuki were joined by a  third Japanese manufacturer, \nYamaha, who brought 125cc single-cylinder and 250cc \ntwin-cylinder air-cooled two-strokes, together with a team \nof eight engineers. They were up  against entries of Euro- \npean machinery like MV Agusta, Bianchi, Ducati, Moto \nGuzzi and Aermacchi, although some of those were private \nentries, and not  everyone turned up  to  race or  survived \npractice. Other marques like EMC and  MZ were present, \ntogether with a few  specials. \nThere was much variety in  the Lightweights in  eve- \nrything from engine configuration of one, two and four \ncylinders, to  frame construction using cradle, spine and \nlattice forms. All  except EMC were air-cooled. MZ were \nhappy with their Ultra Lightweights, which were said to \ngive 25bhp, and in  the  long Thursday afternoon practice \nErnst Degner completed four laps. That was actually one \nThe Yamaha entries in  1961 had noticeably bulbous \nfairings. \nlap \nmore \nthan \nthe  \n125s \nwere \nrequired \nto  \ncomplete \nin \ntheir \nrace. \nThings \nwere \nnot  \nso  \ngood \nwith \nthe  \nLightweight \nMZs, \nand \nafter \ntroublesome \nsessions \ntrying \nto \nget \nthem \nto \ncarbu- \nrate \nproperly, \nthe \n250s \nwere \nwithdrawn, \nas \nthey \nwould \nnot \nrun \ncleanly \nover \nthe \nMountain. \nCome \nthe \nracing, \nthe \nimproved \nHondas \nshowed \nthat \nthey \nhad \ntruly \nmade \nthe \ngrade. \nIn \nonly \ntheir \nthird \nyear \nat \nthe \nTT \nand \nin \nwhat \nwas \ndescribed \nat \nthe \ntime \nas \n‘a \nscintillat- \ning \ndemonstration \nof high-speed \nreliability’, \nthey \ntook \nthe \nfirst \nfive \nplaces \nin the \nUltra \nLightweight \nrace \nand \nthen \ndid \nexactly \nthe \nsame \nin the \nLightweight. \nWinner \nof \nboth \nraces \nwas \nMike \nHailwood \nat \nrecord-breaking \nrace \naverage \nspeeds. \nNew \nlap \nrecords \nwere \nalso \nestablished \nin \nboth \nclasses, \nwith \nLuigi \nTaveri \n(Honda) \nfastest \n125 \nand \nBob \nMcIntyre \n(Honda) \nsetting \nthe \nTT \ncourse \nalight \nwith \nan \nincredible \nlap \nof \n99,58mph \non \nhis \n250cc \nRC162 \nmodel. \nIt \nwas \na prelude \nto \nthe \ncompany \ntaking \nfurther \nvictories \nin \nthe \n1961 \nGP \nseason \nto \nfinish \nas \nworld \nchampions \nin \nthe \n125 \nand \n250cc \nclasses. \nYamaha did  well to  take sixth place in  the  Lightweight \nrace with Fumio Ito  on  the 35bhp RD48 model with its \nbulbous fairing, but Suzuki were finding the  event very \ndemanding, having no  125cc finishers and managing just \ntenth and  twelfth places with their 250s. \nA new name to enter the TT record books after winning \nthe  Sidecar race was Max Deubel (BMW). He  put  2mph \non  the  race average and lap record speeds to  win by half a \nminute from Fritz Scheidegger (BMW). \nMV AGUSTA ‘PRIVAT’ \nWith their established ‘heavyweight’ and ‘lightweight’ team \nleaders, John Surtees and Carlo Ubbiali, having retired at \nthe  end  of the  1960 season, MV Agusta entered just Gary \nHocking in all four classes at the  1961 TT.  For  some reason \nthey tried to  indicate that these were not  works entries, \nso  Gary’s bikes came with ‘Privat’ stickers on  the  fairings. \nFew believed the  message they were trying to  convey. He \ndid  not  ride the  125  and  retired in  the  250 race. Hoping \nfor better results with the fours, he led the Junior for three \nlaps, pursued by Mike Hailwood (AJS), but then was  forced \nto  slow, allowing Hailwood to  lead for  most of the  next \nthree until, on  the  last lap, the  gudgeon pin failed on  Hail- \nwood’s AJS just outside Ramsey. By then it was  rising star \nPhil Read (Norton) who was  in  position to  take over the \nlead and he held it to  the  chequered flag. \nAfter \ndominating \nthe  \nTT  \nfor \nso  \nmany \nyears, \nthose \nearly \nraces \nof \nthe \n1961 \nevent \nsaw \nthe \n‘Privat’ \nMV \nAgustas \nbeing \nembarrassed \non  \na  \nvery \npublic \nstage. \nIt  \nlooked \nas  \nthough \nHocking \nwas \ngoing \nto \nredeem \nthe \nsituation \nin \nthe \nSenior, \nfor \nhe \nled \nuntil \nthe \nfifth \nlap, \nbut \nwas \nthen \nforced \nto \nretire, \nleaving \nMike \nHailwood \n(Norton) \nto \ntake \nvictory, \nfollowed \n\nby  Bob McIntyre (Norton) and Tom \nPhillis (Norton). Hailwood’s Norton \nhad been bench-tested at  53.5bhp just \nbefore the TT, but he had kept Hocking’s \n70bhp MV Agusta in  sight and finished \nwith a race average speed of 100.60mph \nand a fastest lap  of  101.31mph. Fast- \nest  lap of the  race went to  Hocking at \n102.62mph. Both Bob McIntyre and \nTom Phillis achieved 100mph laps, with \nthe  latter’s being on  the  ‘Domiracer’, an \nexperimental twin-cylinder, pushrod \nmodel based on  the Norton ‘Domina- \ntor’ roadster. \nIn  becoming the first rider to  take \nthree TT wins in  a  week, Mike Hail- \nwood justifiably earned the unofficial \naccolade of ‘Man of the  Meeting’ at  the \n1961 TT. Norton must also have been \nproud to  achieve another double victory \nae \nin Junior and Senior races. \n1962: WORKS RIDES \nJapanese factory representation at the  1962 TT meant there \nwas fierce competition for  a  coveted and lucrative works \nride with Honda and  Suzuki, plus the limited seats available \nwith European manufacturers. Yamaha did  not  contest the \nevent, staying at home to  catch their financial breath and to \ndesign more competitive machines. \nAs  yet, Japanese riders had not  been able to  ride at  the \nsame winning level as  the  top  racers from European and \nCommonwealth countries, who, because of  their riding \nskills, were given some of the  Honda and Suzuki factory \nrides. However, there were more potential stars than sad- \ndles available, so  the  next few years would see  top  riders \ngiving their all to  capture a  select works contract. Among \nmen who came to the fore  in the early 1960s were Jim Red- \nman, Tommy Robb, Hugh Anderson, Mike Duff, Bill  Ivy \nand Ralph Bryans. They joined established stars like  Mike \nHailwood, Bob McIntyre, Phil Read, Tom Phillis, Ernst \nDegner and Luigi Taveri, with the  diminutive Kunimitsu \nTakahashi probably the  fastest Japanese rider of the  time. \nThere were future world champions amongst those names, \nmen who would show their worth across the most demand- \ning  tracks in  Europe. By their efforts they would prove \nthemselves to  be  the  best —  and  all  would have the  Isle  of \nMan on  their racing agendas. \nLooking \nback, \nit  \nis  \nreally \nno  \nsurprise \nthat \nfactors \nlike \nimproved \nroad \nsurfaces, \nadvances \nin  \ntyre \nand \nsuspension \nperformance, \ntogether \nwith \nhungry \nriders \nand \nfactories \nEAST vs  WEST @  85 \niige i> \n/   a — v \nPost-race congratulations are exchanged between Tom Phillis (left), Mike \nHailwood (centre) and Bob McIntyre after the 1961 Senior TT. \ndemanding success from their ever more advanced motor- \ncycles, all  combined to  bring increased speeds to  the  TT \nthrough the 1960s. \nTIDDLERS \nAfter the  reintroduction of the  Ultra Lightweight class to \nthe  Mountain Course in  1960, riders had shown that 125s \ncould cope with its  demands and  the  lap record stood to \nLuigi Taveri (Honda) at  a healthy 88.45mph. For  1962 the \norganizers included a race for  50cc machines over two laps, \na  class recently introduced to  the  World Championships. \nThe 50s  would run  on  the  Friday of race-week, just before \nthe  Senior TT. \nIn  every TT  race of the  day, the  field was made up  of \nan  elite group on  works machines, fast  runners on  dealer- \nsponsored bikes, good privateers giving their all and  a  few \nat the rear of the field who were simply realizing their ambi- \ntion to  ride over the TT course. This brought a wide varia- \ntion in machine speed and  rider performance in the  estab- \nlished classes, something that was to  be  very noticeable in \nthe  case of the  50s, where the  sophisticated works bikes \nof Honda, Suzuki and Kreidler, with top speeds of over \n90mph, were in the  same field as  Itoms, ten  of which were \nclocked at  less  than 60mph on  Sulby Straight. The latter \nwere very much private efforts, for the Itom factory showed \nlittle interest in  the  racers derived from their roadsters. \nAmong the  50cc runners was  the  first woman to  contest a \nsolo TT, Itom-mounted Beryl Swain. \n\n86  M  EAST vs  WEST \nSingles, twins, two-strokes, four-strokes and multiple \ngears were to  be  features of the  50cc race, with Kreidler \nhaving twelve ‘cogs’ available to  their riders to  help keep \ntheir bikes in a limited powerband of 11,000—12,000rpm. \nonda helped boost entry numbers in  small-capacity rac- \ning by selling their superb 50cc CRI10 and 125ce CR93 \nproduction race bikes to  the public. They were models that \nwent on  to  dominate race places behind works machinery. \nPRE-RACE \nMore of the  new, smoother surfacing was laid  from Crosby \npast The Highlander, and  the  downhill section after Crosby \nHill was straightened. Also, most of the  notorious bumps \nThe winning combination of Honda’s 1962 4-cylinder \n250cc and Dunlop’s new triangular racing tyre. \non  \nthat \nstretch, \nwhich \npreviously \nsaw  \nriders \nairborne, \nwere \nremoved, \nsaving \nyet \nmore \ntime \nand \nalso \nmeaning \nracers \narrived \nat \nGreeba \nCastle \ngoing \nmeasurably \nfaster \nthan \nbefore. \nTrade support was  no  longer as  fulsome as  in earlier years \nand Shell was the  only fuel supplier supporting the  TT. \nCompetitors also had to  pay  for the  7,000 gallons of petrol \nprovided. Tyre suppliers Dunlop and Avon were present, \nwith Dunlop talking of using its  latest rubber compounds \nand introducing a  new triangular-section rear tyre, which \nthey called the  RMT1. Designed with a radical new profile \nthat offered more tread to  the  road when a  machine was \nleaned over, the  TT  meeting would offer the  new tyre a \ndemanding test under race conditions. \nGirling were present with experimental upside-down, \ngas-assisted rear suspension units, which were said to \nimprove damping, reduce oil  aeration and maintain con- \nstant temperature, so  giving more consistent performance \nthroughout a long race. They also offered a saving in weight. \nA  few privately made five-speed gearbox conversions \nwere fitted to  British singles, but  while Norton and AMC \nhad  experimental examples of their own, they did not  offer \nthem to customers. It was something riders could have used \nto  advantage over the  Mountain Course. \nThe organizers increased the  Lightweight 250 race dis- \ntance from from five to  six  laps and shuffled the  order of \nthe  races. \nGary Hocking was joined by Mike Hailwood in  riding \n350 and 500cc MV Agustas in  1962, operating under the \nsame ‘Privat’ label. However, things went wrong for  Hock- \ning early in  practice, when he  tangled with Graham Smith \nat Ballacrye. Both riders were thrown down the road at high \nspeed and the MV  burnt out. Despite the  severity of his fall, \nHocking was soon out again, swapping 100mph practice laps \nwith Mike Hailwood. The latter was also to  ride a Benelli in \nthe  Lightweight class and  an  Ultra Lightweight EMC. \nBob McIntyre and Tom Phillis had entries on  285cc \nHonda fours in  the  Junior race and  practice times showed \nthey could be  a  threat to  the  350cc MVs. There was even \ntalk of ‘Bob Mac’ riding one of the 285s in the  Senior race. \nAn  8-gallon tank had  been made to  allow a  non-stop race, \nalthough \nMcIntyre \nwas \nknown \nto \nprefer \nthe \nidea \nofa \nslick \npit stop rather than carry that extra weight of fuel. \nOne \nman \nwho \nfeatured \nas  \na  \nfast  \nprivateer \nat  \nthe  \nTT  \nfor \nmany \nyears \nwas \nArthur \nWheeler. \nHe \nfavoured \nMoto \nGuzzis \nand \nhad \nprivately \nentered \nexamples \nin \nthe \n250, \n350 \nand \n500cc races. \nRACING \nThe \nSidecar \nrace \nopened \nthe  \nrevised \nrace \nprogramme, \nand \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nin \neight \nyears \nthe \nwin \ndid \nnot \ngo \ntoa \n\nBMW. Instead it went to  a  BSA twin- \ncylinder kneeler outfit piloted by Chris \nVincent, giving a  first International \nTT  victory to  the  BSA concern. More \ngood news for  British race fans was \nthat third place went to  Colin Seeley \nona Matchless G50. Of course, BM Ws \nwere there in the mix, Otto Kolle tak- \ning second place and  Max Deubel rais- \ning the  lap record to  90.70mph. \nLightweight and Ultra Lightweight \nraces provided another clean sweep of \npodium places for  Honda, with new \nrace and lap  records going to  Luigi \nTaveri on  his  125, while Bob McIntyre \nlooked like setting new records on  his \n250. However, after a  fast 99.06mph \nlap, McIntyre retired and left  Derek \nMinter and Jim Redman scrapping at a \nslightly slower pace, with Minter tak- \ning the  win. Suzuki scrubbed their 250cc entries as  their \nbikes were too  prone to  seizure. \nHonda had to  give best to  Suzuki in  the  new 50cc race, \nbut took second and  third places. After the  50cc race, even \nthe  doubters had to  acknowledge that winner Ernst Deg- \nner’s lap record of 75mph was swift going on  the  Mountain \nCourse. Degner had  defected from MZ to  Suzuki, and  the \nknowledge of two-strokes that he  took with him suddenly \nsaw  the  Japanese company with competitive race machin- \nery  and a first TT  win. A different link with MZ by Dr  Joe \nErlich —  some say it involved a trade of Norton forks, which \nwere not  obtainable behind the  Iron Curtain —  saw  his new \ntwo-stroke EMC put up a spirited performance in the  Ultra \nLightweight race, with Mike Hailwood holding second until \nforced to  retire and Rex Avery coming home sixth. \nJunior and Senior victories were shared by MV-mounted \nMike Hailwood and Gary Hocking. Hailwood took the Jun- \nior with new race average and lap record speeds, lifting the \nlatter to  101.58mph, while Hocking broke John Surtees’ \nrecords to  win the  Senior, his fastest lap being 105.75mph. \nRace fans expected to  witness record speeds and  Honda \ncertainly brought new levels of engineering excellence to \nthe  TT. However, the  Japanese company seemed to  feel \nthat power was  all, even though TT history told that power \nwithout \naccompanying \nstandards \nof \nhandling \nwas \na \ndanger- \nous  mix on  the  Mountain Course. \n1963: MIXED NEWS \nBad \nnews \nfor \nrace \nfans \ncame \nwhen \nthe \nmanufacture \nof \nNor- \nton \nmotorcycles \nwas \nmoved \nto \nAMC’s \nWoolwich \nfactory \nChris Vincent and Eric Bliss hold a tight line at  Sign Post Corner as  they \nspeed to  victory on  their BSA outfit in  1962. \nat  the end of  1962, accompanied by the  announcement \nthat production of Manx Nortons was to  cease. Within a \ncouple of months, AJS  and  Matchless took the  same step \nwith the 7R and  G50. A few new machines were assembled \nfrom spares, but the outdated British singles would now fall \nfurther behind the  already faster opposition, particularly \nover the TT  Mountain Course, with its miles of high-speed \ngoing. \nGood news was that Geoff Duke persuaded Gilera to \nreturn to racing under the Scuderia Duke banner. Wheeled \nout from a  storeroom at  the  Arcore factory, where they \nhad  lain since 1957, the  machines would be raced without \nmechanical updating. Derek Minter and John Hartle were \nJohn Hartle prepares for a  lap of practice on  his  Gilera \nin  1963. \n\n88  M  EAST vs  WEST \nsigned to  ride them and  they had  some encouraging early- \nseason results, but  a  pre-TT spill on  a Norton put  Minter \nout  and  Phil Read joined Hartle for  Gilera’s Island return. \nYamaha were also back with improved 125cc and  250cc \nmodels. Still air-cooled, the 125 was a  single with disc \nvalve, six  speeds and said to  give 25bhp. The 250 was a \nparallel twin, had  seven speeds and  was said to  give over \n40bhp at  11,000rpm, albeit with a  narrow power band. \nThe company had limited track testing facilities, but  felt \nthat it had  eliminated some of its  earlier problems of plug- \noiling, vibration and  carburation, as  well as  lack of power \nand durability. Riders were to be Fumio Ito, Hiroshi Haseg- \nawa, Yoshikaza Sunako and Tony Godfrey. In  contrast to \nYamaha, Honda’s only Japanese rider was Kunimitsu Taka- \nhashi and  the  company did  not  enter the  50cc race. \nSuzuki concentrated on  the  50cc and 125cc classes. In \nthe former they entered an  uprated version with nine gears \nand a  top  speed of 93mph. There was more change with \ntheir air-cooled, twin-cylinder 125  machine, said to  give \n26bhp and 114mph. \nJoining battle with the  Japanese two-strokes were six \nprivate entries on  Greeves ‘Silverstone’ machines. Designed \nfor, and successful at,  short circuits, their entry into the far \nmore demanding Lightweight TT  was a  worry to  factory \nboss Bert Greeves and he took the  unusual step of writing \nto  \neach \nrider, \nasking \nthem \nto  \nride \n‘with \nskilled \njudgement \nand \nrestraint’. \nTT prize money had remained unchanged for over thirty \nyears, but  in  1963 the  ACU finally agreed to  pay riders \na  contribution towards their expenses. However, £10 for \nSOcc runners, £15 for  other solos and £25 for  sidecars \nwould not  go far towards paying for two weeks of racing. \nMarshalling the  37%4-mile Mountain Course had  always \nproved a headache for the organizers and, due to  accessibil- \nity problems, there were often long delays in getting injured \nriders to  hospital. In  a  major contribution to  rider well- \nbeing, a  helicopter rescue service was introduced for  race \ndays at  the  1963 TT. \nDunlop and  Avon’s development of tyres to  provide rid- \ners  with better road-holding did not pursue the same direc- \ntion. Of Avon’s latest rear tyre it was  said it ‘looks more like \na  trials tyre. There are  no  ribs at  all  on  the  sidewalls, the \nstuds extending right across and they look quite knobbly \nones too’. By contrast, Dunlop’s triangular racing tyres for \nsolos were gaining ribs and zig-zag tread on  the  sidewalls. \nHOT PACE \nStill riding ‘Privat’ machines for MV Agusta, during prac- \ntice for  the  1963 TT, Mike Hailwood gave the  returning \nGileras a  clear idea of the  challenge they faced. In  Mike’s \nwords: ‘I deliberately set out  to demoral- \nize  them by covering every lap of prac- \ntice at  over 100mph’. Come the  Senior \nrace and Hailwood continued his  hot \npace, riding to  victory at  a  new race \naverage speed of 104.64mph and  setting \na  new lap  record of  106.41mph. John \nHartle and Phil Read were second and \nthird on  their Gileras, with Hartle set- \nting a  race average of  103.67mph. That \nwas good going for  a  machine that had \nreceived no  development since 1957, \nwhen Bob McIntyre took one  to  victory \nat  98.99mph. While it is  always a  mis- \ntake to  make direct year-on-year com- \nparisons of TT  races without fully assess- \ning  riders, race conditions, machinery \nand so  on,  there had to be a reason for an \nMitsuo Itoh rounds Governor’s Bridge \nto  take victory on  his  50cc Suzuki in \n1963 and become the first Japanese \nrider to  wina TT  race. \n\nincrease \nof \nover \nSmph \nin  \nGilera’s \nwinning \nspeeds \nbetween \n1957 \nand \n1963, \nparticularly \nas \nit \nwas \nachieved \nwith \ndolphin- \ntype, \nrather \nthan \nfull \nstreamlining. \nWas \nit \ndue \nto \nimproved \nroad \nsurfaces, \nbetter \ntyres, \ndifferent \nrider? \nNobody \nseemed \nto \naddress \nthe \ntopic \nat \nthe \ntime, \nbut \nwith \nno \nobvious \nsingle \nreason \nfor \nthe \n5 per \ncent \nincrease \nin race \nspeed, \nit must \nhave \ncome \nfrom \na combination \nof \nthose \nfactors. \nMike Hailwood’s MV  Agusta faced a stronger challenger \nin the Junior race from Jim Redman on  his Honda. Starting \non  damp roads, the two battled closely, with Redman later \nforced to set the fastest lap at  101. 30mph as the roads dried, \nalthough Hailwood had to retire. This left John Hartle (Gil- \nera) to  take second and  Frantna Stastny (Jawa) third. \nUnder better conditions, apart from melting tar in places, \nJim Redman rode his  Honda to  victory in the  Lightweight \nrace, with a  speedy Fumio Ito  (Yamaha) some 30  seconds \nbehind. The early stages had been enlivened by Yamaha’s Ito \nand Tony Godfrey leading Honda men Redman and Taveri. \nThe Yamaha two-strokes were clocked at  141mph past The \nHighlander but, after a stop for adjustments, Godfrey later \nfell  at Milntown and  became the  first casualty to  be recov- \nered by the new helicopter service. Bill Smith (Honda) was \nthird and Hiroshi Hasegawa brought his  Yamaha home in \nfourth place. \nAfter a  delayed start caused by mist on  the  Mountain, \nthe  Ultra Lightweight 125  race turned into a fierce battle \nbetween Suzuki team members, with victory and a  new \nlap record going to  Hugh Anderson, from Frank Perris and \nErnst Degner. It was a  victory that Suzuki repeated in the \n50cc race, but  this time it was Mitsuo Itoh who took the \nwin on  his nine-speed ‘tiddler’ at  a new race average speed. \nIt was  a first win for a Japanese rider at the TT, ina  race  that \nhad  been increased to  three laps and  where Ernst Degner \nset  a new lap record of 79.10mph. \nSidecars ran  their three-lap race in excellent conditions, \nwith a  comfortable win going to  Florian Camathias on  his \nBMW-based FCS, followed by Fritz Scheidegger (BMW). \nCamathias increased the  race average speed to  88.38mph \nbut fell just short of the  lap record. \n1964: THE PACE STEADIES \nThere was  a temporary lull in the upward growth in speeds \nin  some of the  classes at  the  1964 TT, although there was \nno  shortage of class machinery and  riders. Mike Hailwood \nwas \non \nMV \nAgustas \nand \nJim \nRedman \non \nHonda’s \nfull \n350 \nfour. \nHonda \nalso \nhad \na \n125 \nfour \nand \na \n50cc \ntwin, \nwhich \nwas \nsaid \nto \nrev \nto \n20,000rpm, \nwith \nsome \nreports \nsaying \n22,000rpm. \nTarquinio \nProvini \nreturned \non \na \nBenelli \n250, \nAlan \nShepherd \nwas \non \nfurther-developed \nMZs, \nSuzuki \nhad \nunreliable \nwater-cooled \n250 \nfours \nand \nEMC \ncame \nwith \nEAST vs  WEST @  89 \nredesigned frames and an  experimental form of  transis- \ntorized ignition, when most were still relying on  magneto \nor  coil for  their sparks. Yamaha sought to  build upon the \nproven speed of their machinery by employing Mike Duff \nand TT winner Phil Read, who would ride improved 250cc \ntwin-cylinder RD56 models. They also made a late appoint- \nment of Tommy Robb to  their team. Not unusual for  the \nday was that works riders Duff and Read would both ride a \nMatchless G50 in  the  Senior and an  AJS 7R  in  the  Junior. \nDevelopment of the  7R  had not  ceased, being pushed by \nenthusiastic entrants like Tom Kirby, who claimed to  be \ngetting 45bhp at  8,600rpm from his  special short-stroke \nengine. \nAdding interest to  the  event, British companies Royal \nEnfield and Cotton fielded entries in  the Lightweight \nrace, while Florian Camathias was present with his sidecar \nhitched to  a  Gilera 4. \nThe 1964 Lightweight 250 race promised much, but  in \nwords of the  time ‘turned out  to  be  a  wholesale exercise \nin  machine mortality’. An  impressive entry of ninety-five \nwas  reduced by some failing to  appear, others having major \nproblems in practice and a few not  qualifying, meaning that \nsixty-four riders came to  the  line. A close tussle between \nJim Redman (Honda) and  Phil Read (Yamaha) ended with \nRead’s retirement on  the fifth lap after a spate of plug trou- \nbles, leaving Redman to  win from Alan Shepherd (MZ) \nwithout setting any  records. Just nineteen riders finished \nthe  race. \nAn  unwell Mike Hailwood was forced to  listen to  the \nradio commentary on  Wednesday’s Junior race from his \nsickbed. It was  one  where Jim Redman was  in total control, \nwinning by 7 minutes from Phil Read and  Mike Duff, both \nAJS-mounted. All  but  two of the  remaining thirty-eight \nfinishers were on  Norton and  AJS machines, leaving many \nEllis Boyce takes his Yamaha TDI around Ramsey \nHairpin in  1964. \n\n90  M@  EAST vs  WEST \nto  wonder about the  future of the  350cc class. However, \nYamaha had  recently started selling their 250cc TD1 pro- \nduction racer in Britain and would later turn their attention \nto the  350s. Initially in short supply, they were models that \nwould change the  face of racing in years to  come. \nA  third win in  the  week went to  Honda in  the Ultra \nLightweight 125 race. With competition fierce between \nteam mates Jim Redman, Luigi Taveri and Ralph Bryans, \nspeeds were lifted by over 2mph as  Taveri took victory by \njust 3 seconds from Redman and Bryans. There was also a \nhard-fought battle amongst the  50cc machines, resulting in \nboth race average and lap record speeds being left  at  over \n80mph by Hugh Anderson (Suzuki), as  he led home Ralph \nBryans (Honda) and  Isao Morishita (Suzuki). \nOn  the  entry list  of ninety riders for  the 1964 Senior \nrace, Mike Hailwood’s name was the  only one to  have an \nasterisk beside it to  indicate that he was a previous winner. \nThat was  very different from the  1930s, when the same list, \nwith about half the number of entries, would show three.or \nfour past winners, all  of whom would be contesting the race \non  similar machinery. While not fully recovered, Hailwood \nwas fit enough to  race his  ‘Privat’ MV Agusta in  Friday’s \nSenior and, provided he kept going, was  assured of victory. \nThat is how it worked out, comfortably, at some 4mph less \nthan record pace. \nLiving rather on  past glories, Norton Motors advertised \nat  TT  time, ‘Norton have won more admiration and TT races \nthan any other machine’. Derek Minter was  the only podium \nfinisher on  a Norton, with second place in the  Senior. \n1965:TWO vs  FOUR \nBy  1965 the  TT  was well into an  era  of two-stroke ver- \nsus  four-stroke in  the  three smaller solo classes, 250, 125 \nPlugs \nby \nthe  \nhundred \n—a   \nscene \nin \nthe  \nYamaha \ncamp. \nand  \n50cc, \nwith \nthe \nproducts \nof \nHonda, \nSuzuki \nand \nYamaha \nthe \nmain \nprotagonists \nand \nquite \nevenly \nmatched, \nalthough \nthe \ntwo-strokes \ndid \nlose \nout \non \nreliability. \nMuch \nof \nthat \nstemmed \nfrom \n‘plug \ntrouble’. \nSo \nnotorious \ndid \nthe \ntwo- \nstrokes \nbecome \nfor \nthe \nproblem \nthat, \neven \nif \nthere \nwas \na \nmore \nserious \nissue, \nit \nwas \noften \nblamed \non \nthe \nsparking \nplugs, \na \nreason \nthat \nno \none \nquestioned. \nFor  many years, riders of big four-strokes would carry \na  couple of spare plugs in  a  pocket in  their leathers and a \nplug spanner stuck down a riding boot. That era  had largely \ngone, but two-strokes had never rid themselves of tempera- \nment towards sparking plugs and their riders usually car- \nried spare ones and  a  spanner, sometimes in a  small pouch \nfitted inside the streamlining. Tommy Robb joined Yamaha \nin  1964 and  after using all his spare plugs during one  early \nmorning practice, he actually resorted to  ‘borrowing’ one \nfrom a tractor in  a  field by the  course. It got him back to \nthe  start. \nAnother unpleasant trait of two-strokes was their ten- \ndency to  seize if carburation was not  spot on.  Suzuki had \nredesigned their 250-4 for  1965, but works rider Jack \nAhearn nicknamed his bike ‘Whispering Death’ and riders \nof two-strokes usually rode with at  least one finger of the \nleft hand resting on  the  clutch lever. This was while trying \nto  watch the  road, the  rev  counter, the  temperature gauge \nand fight its  poor handling. Ahearn’s Suzuki was timed at \n139mph, but a spill in the  last practice session put him out \nof the race. With team mate Hugh Anderson not  willing to \nride the  250, it was  left to  Frank Perris to ride the  seizure- \nprone four. Frank described how he rode with four fingers \non  the  clutch lever to  enable him to  catch piston seizures, \nbut  even that was not  enough if the  disc valve seized, for \nthat would lock the engine solid. Just as  they seemed to be \nmaking progress, Suzuki pulled the four from competition \nlater in  1965. In  the  words of Mike Nicks, it  was a  bike \nthat ‘stretched design talents and  rider courage to  the  very \nlimit’. \nThe top Japanese manufacturers were seeing huge \ngrowth in their motorcycle sales as  they took over existing \nmarkets and established new ones. Racing their products \nwas a  valuable means of gaining worldwide publicity and \nthey poured money into it.  Phil Read was one  to  benefit, \nwriting \nof \nthe \ntime, \n‘We \nswept \nthrough \na \nshow-piece \nof \nclassic \nracing \ncompetition \nthat \nwas \nboosted \nby \nan \nopen \nchequebook, \nthe \nlike \nof \nwhich \nwe \nmay \nnever \nsee \nagain’. \nHe \nalso \nexplained \nwhy \nhe \nwas \nracing \nonly \nYamahas \nin \n1965: \n‘aiming \nto \nreach \nthe \ntop, \nwhat \ndo \nyou \nneed \n— \nno \nmatter \nhow \ngood \na \nrider \nyou \nare, \nthe \nanswer \nis \nspeed’. \nRead \neven \ntitled \nhis \nfirst \nautobiography \nPrince \nof \nSpeed. \nBill \nIvy \njoined \nthe \nYamaha \nteam \nand \n1965 \nwas \nhis \nfirst \nTT \nas \na \nworks \nrider. \n\nJoe Dunphy tackles Brandish Corner on  his  250 Greeves \nin the 1964 Lightweight TT. \nWhile Yamaha works machinery was  reserved for a select \nfew riders, their TD  production racers were by now avail- \nable to private individuals who wanted to go racing with fast \nmachinery, which came at reasonable cost and  was  backed \nby factory resources. The 250 TD1A had various problems, \nnot  least of which was an  appetite for  crankshafts caused, \nmany said, by having the  clutch mounted on  the  end  of the \ncrankshaft. It had now reached the  c35bhp TD1B stage, \nafter several years’ upgrading of cylinders, pistons, heads \nand exhausts, plus improved suspension, weight-saving and \nsome increase in reliability. Costing £520 in Britain, it was \nraced worldwide and attracted a  host of tuners offering \ntheir own improvements to the standard product. This was \nnot  just to  the  engine, but  to  exhausts, gear ratios, clutch, \nframe and suspension. Despite shortcomings, the TD1B \nwas a  successful production racer. Many over-bored them \nby a  few  cc  and  used them in  350cc races, but  a  few  years \nlater Yamaha marketed the  successful 350cc TR2 model, \nwhile private owners converted 125cc roadsters into rac- \ners. Such popularity meant that the  sight, sound and  smell \nof two-strokes was everywhere in racing. \nSeveral British manufacturers attempted to benefit from \nthe burgeoning 250cc race scene, and the products of \nGreeves, Cotton and  Royal Enfield enjoyed success on  the \nshort circuits. However, finding TT  racing more demand- \ning of speed and reliability, they did not really feature in the \nresults, although Greeves did achieve success at the MGP. \nSPEEDS \nThe  \nTT \nSpecial \ndid  \nnot  \ntime \nriders \nat  \nthe  \nsame \nplace \nevery \nyear. \nIn  \n1965 \nit \ntook \nspeeds \nover \nthe  \n2-mile \nstretch \nto  \nThe \nHighlander, \nshowing \nMike \nHailwood \nto \nbe \nthe \nfastest \n500 \nEAST vs  WEST @  91 \nat  an  average of 150mph, with the  best single being Derek \nMinter on  a Norton at  136.4mph. The MV’s average speed \nwas  up on  previous years, for all the course smoothing with \nmodern tarmac-laying techniques meant that the fours \ncould use  maximum power for more of the  time. Unfortu- \nnately for the  singles, this  served to  take away some of the \nhandling advantage they had previously enjoyed and, allied \nto their deficiency of 20bhp compared to the fours, it meant \never less  of a contest. \nIn  the  Junior class MV Agusta had a  much harder bat- \ntle  on  their hands and brought a  new 3-cylinder model in \n1965. Phil Read was timed as  fastest Junior on  an  over- \nbored Yamaha RD56 at an  average of 134.35mph, followed \nby Gustav Havel ona Jawa at  131.42mph. Jim Redman was \nfastest Lightweight on  his  Honda, averaging 133.33mph, a \nspeed equalled by Bill  Ivy’s Yamaha. Ernst Degner’s Suzuki \nwas fastest Ultra Lightweight at  122.48mph, clear of his \nteam mate Hugh Anderson at  118.45mph. Both Suzuki rid- \ners  were on  the  company’s new RT65 water-cooled twins. \nAs riders were only timed over one practice session, there \nwere always frustrating gaps in  the  published figures; for \nexample, how the  new MV three compared to  the  latest \nJunior Honda was  not  revealed, because Hailwood was  out \non  the  500 and Redman on  a  250. \nAs  well as  The  TT  Special occasionally recording riders’ \naverage speed over a  2-mile stretch to  The Highlander, \nanother magazine had  taken to  recording flash readings on \nthe  descent to  The Highlander, which gave higher figures. \nOne man with top-quality machines in four solo classes in \n1965 was Mike Duff. It is interesting to  compare his High- \nlander speeds across the classes: 125cc Yamaha— 125.1mph, \n250cc Yamaha —  143.4mph, 350cc AJS 7R  —  122.9mph, \n500cc Matchless G50 —  137.1mph. \nNEWCOMERS \nEvery TT had its  share of  newcomers to  the Mountain \nCourse and for some years there had been an  unofficial pre- \npractice coach tour of the  course for  any  who wished to \navail themselves. In  1965 this was  made obligatory for new- \ncomers, since when many experienced riders and travelling \nmarshals have conducted riders on  such a lap, often stopping \nat particularly tricky spots and generally imparting wisdom. \nOne man on  the  coach in  1965 who was to  go on  and write \nhis name into TT  history was Italian Giacomo Agostini. He \nwas  MV Agusta-mounted, as  team mate to  Mike Hailwood. \nSTILL FASTER \nMore records were broken in  1965, with the  most closely \ncontested races showing the greatest increases.

Hugh*Anderson (Suzuki) mixed it \nwith them for most of the  race, and  the  pressure saw Read \nlift the race average speed to 94.28mph, which was  appreci- \nably faster than the  old  lap record of 92.14mph. Anderson \nset  the  fastest lap at  96.02mph. \nRead took his still  air-cooled 250cc Yamaha to  the front \nof the  Lightweight race on  the  first lap, when he  became \nthe first man to  lap at  10Omph on  a  250, but he retired and \nJim Redman (Honda) then went fractionally quicker, to set \nthe  fastest lap of the  race at  100.09mph. In  deteriorating \nweather, the  race pace slowed and Redman took victory \nfrom Mike Duff (Yamaha) and  Frank Perris (Suzuki). Read \nwas  in  the  mix again in  the  Junior race, but  it was  Mike \nHailwood (MV Agusta) who hit the front with a new record \nlap speed of 102.85mph before retiring, leaving Redman to \ntake victory for the  third consecutive year in this  class. He \nlifted the  race average speed to  a  record 100.72mph, with \nPhil Read in second place on  a  254cc Yamaha and  Giacomo \nAgostini (MV Agusta) in third, \nAfter Mitsuo Itoh’s new water-cooled, twin-cylin- \nder  50cc Suzuki declined to  rev  to  its  narrow 16,500— \n17,000rpm power band during the race, it was  left to  Luigi \nTaveri (Honda) to  take the  win in  wet  and  windy condi- \ntions at  slightly slower speeds than in  1964. Meanwhile, \nSidecars were advancing their pace around the  Mountain \nCourse and  Max Deubel (BMW) was  the  winner in  1965, \nat new race and lap record speeds —  the latter at 91. 8Omph. \nConditions \nfor  \nSenior \nrace \nday \nwere \nmixed, \nwith \nwet \nroads \nin \nplaces, \nparticularly \nunder \ntree-lined \nsections. \nMV \nAgusta \nwere \npresent \nwith \nMike \nHailwood \nand \nGiacomo \nAgostini \nand \nthey \nwere \nexpected \nto \nbe \nat \nthe \nfront, \nwhile \nthe \nrest \nof \nthe \nfield \nraced \namongst \nthemselves. \nPeople \nwere \nnot \ntoo \nsurprised \nwhen \nfirst-timer \nAgostini \nslipped \noff \nf i :   i - 3 :   1% \nMike Hailwood with his  battered MV Agusta at the finish \nof the 1965 Senior TT. \nat  the  tricky uphill bend just after Sarah’s Cottage, bent \nthe  MV and put  himself out  of the  race. However, they \nwere surprised when the  experienced Mike Hailwood did \nexactly the same, at the  same spot, a little later in the race. \nWith broken screen, flattened megaphones and an  oil leak \nbeing just some of the  damage to  his  MV, Mike managed \nto  restart it and  get back into the  race, to  find that he was \nbeing caught by several of the  fastest British singles. An \nunscheduled pit stop on  the  fifth lap meant they got closer, \nbut he held them off to  the  finish, taking victory from Joe \nDunphy (Norton) and  Mike Duff (Matchless). Hailwood’s \nrace average speed was a  lowly 91.69mph, in what turned \nout  to  be his last TT  race for MV Agusta. \nNAMES \nNewcomer Giacomo Agostini had  a respectable debut year \non  the  Mountain Course and was to  go  on  to  star during \nthe  next few years. Among others who would make their \nmark in  Island racing during the  second half of the 1960s \nwere Bill  Ivy, Peter Williams, Ray Pickrell, Alan Barnett, \nStuart Graham, Malcolm Uphill and  Renzo Pasolini. Some \nof those would shine in production racing.

On  his  first lap he  crashed \nheavily at May Hill, Ramsey, and although he did not  appear \nto  be  seriously hurt, he  died later that evening.’ Bridge- \nstone was another Japanese manufacturer due to  make its \ndebut at  the  TT, but  after poor early-season performances \nin Europe, they did  not  appear on  the Island. \nBenelli were present with veteran Italian star Tarquinio \nProvini, but he crashed on  the approach to Ballaugh in prac- \ntice and was seriously injured. Initial thoughts were that \nhe  was blinded by the  low sun, but  a  respected magazine \nlater related that his bike had  been subject to  a mechanical \n‘bodge’ that caused the  engine to  lock. Gilera also made \nanother return with Derek Minter, but he fell at Brandish, \nsuffering an  arm injury that prevented him from racing. \nFierce competition in  the  Lightweight class in  the  early \n1960s had seen Yamaha and Suzuki air-cooled twins become \nwater-cooled fours and Honda upping its  four cylinders to \nsix,  accompanied by claims of an  output of 53bhp. Those \nwho heard the six at close quarters had little reason to doubt \nthe  claim, while talk was of Yamaha’s water-cooled and \neight-speed 250  giving between 50 and  60bhp, depending \nwho you  listened to.  However, Suzuki still could not  get \ntheir 250-4 to  run reliably and did  not  bring it to  the  TT. \nHandling was not  the  strongest feature of any  of the  ‘big \nthree’ Japanese 250s, but riders were paid to get results, so \nthey rode them to  their limits —  there was always someone \nwaiting to  take over a  coveted works seat from any rider \nwho underperformed. \nPractice times did not  always tell the full  story of a rider \nand  machine’s performance potential at  the  TT, but  it was \nas  good a  pointer to  race week as  race fans were going to \nget. Having moved from MV Agusta to  Honda for  1966, \nMike Hailwood’s practice performances showed that he \nwould again be the man that the others would have to beat. \nSIDECARS \nBMW was  the dominant marque in sidecar racing, with the \nlimited production RS54 model the  one to  have. In  very \nshort supply, owners used the  ‘Renn Sport’ as  the basis for \ntheir \ndevelopment \nefforts \nto \nproduce \nthe \nbest \nthree-wheel- \ner \nand \nit \nruled \nsidecar \nracing \nfor \nmany \nyears. \nThere \nwere \nthirteen \nBMWs \nin \nthe \nlist \nof \nfifty-seven \nstarters \nin \n1966, \nbut \nthe \nmost \npopular \nengine \nwas \nTriumph, \nwhich \npowered \ntwenty-one \noutfits. \nIn \na \nclosely \nfought \ncontest \nover \nthree \nlaps, \nFritz \nScheidegger \ntook \nvictory \nfrom \nMax \nDeubel \nby \njust \n0.8 \nseconds, \nwith \nGeorg \nAuerbacher \nthird. \nAll \nrode \n500cc \nBMWs. \nScheidegger \ntook \n10 \nseconds \noff \nthe \nprevi- \nous \nbest \nrace \ntime \nat \nan \naverage \nspeed \nof \n90.76mph. \nCom- \nmercial \ninterests \nthen \ncreated \na  \nrow \nover \nthe  \nmake \nof \nfuel \nused \nby \nthe  \nwinner, \nfollowed \nby \nhis  \ndisqualification \nand \nlater reinstatement. \nSOLOS \nHonda paid Mike Hailwood well to  race their motorcy- \ncles, but  they sought their money’s worth in  return: he \nwas entered in  four of the  five solo classes in  1966, even \nthough he  was really too  big for  a  125. The company did \nnot  produce racing motorcycles with good handling and \nin  1966 the  worst handler was to  be  their most powerful \nmachine, the new 500-4, which was  said to  develop 85bhp \nat  12,500rpm. Any doubts as  to  who was to  be  the  main \nman in the  Honda team at  the  TT  —  Jim Redman or  Mike \nHailwood —  were resolved when Redman suffered an  arm \ninjury that kept him out  of the  event. Honda brought in \nStuart Graham, son  of TT  legend Les, in his place. \nIn the  first solo race at the  1966 TT, the  combination of \nHailwood and Honda’s 6-cylinder 250 proved unbeatable in \nthe  Lightweight class. Hailwood blasted off from the  start \nto  set  a new lap record of 104.29mph on  his first lap. That \nwas more than 4mph faster than the  existing record and \nhighlighted the  fantastic combination of bike and  rider. He \neased off after the  first lap but  still finished several min- \nutes clear of Stuart Graham on a similar six. In fairness to \nGraham, he was  new to the bike and had a lengthy pit stop. \nWorks Yamahas and  MZs retired from the  race. \nThe middle of  race week was reserved for  the Ultra \nLightweight 125  and  Junior 350cc races. In  the  125  race, \nthe  exotic 5-cylinder works Honda four-strokes were no \nmatch for the speed of the two-stroke Yamahas and Suzukis. \nBill  Ivy and Phil Read were on  their twin-cylinder Yama- \nhas  and Ivy rode to  victory at  a  new race average speed of \n97.66mph, setting a new lap record of 98.55mph. Both fig- \nures were substantially up on  the previous record times and \nthe  little Yamahas showed reliability that had been missing \nwith the company’s 250s. Mike Duff came in fourth to help \nYamaha clinch the  Manufacturers’ Team Prize, an  award \nthat makers held in high regard. \nGiacomo Agostini was riding the only MV Agusta entry \nin the Junior race. It was  his  63bhp, 3-cylinder model and \nit was expected that he  would battle with Mike Hailwood \non \nhis \n4-cylinder \nHonda. \nHowever, \nspectators \nwere \ndisap- \npointed \nwhen \nthe \nlatter \ndropped \nout \non \nthe \nfirst \nlap. \nPerhaps \nAgostini \nwas \nalso \nsorry \nnot \nto \nbe \nable \nto \npit \nhis \ndeveloping \nTT \nriding \nskills \nagainst \nHailwood, \nfor \nalthough \nrelatively \nunchallenged, \nhe \nbroke \nboth \nrace \naverage \nand \nlap \nrecords, \nfinishing \n10 \nminutes \nahead \nof \nsecond-placed \nPeter \nWilliams \n(AJS). \nOf \nthe \nseventy-one \nstarters, \nfifty-eight \nwere \nstill \nrid- \ning \nBritish \nsingles \nfrom \nNorton \nand \nAJS. \n\nWorks Hondas and  Suzukis dominated the  massed start \n50ce race, with victory going to  Ralph Bryans (Honda), \nwho, in  round figures, lifted the  race average speed from \n80 to  85mph and  set  what was  to be the  fastest ever official \nlap speed by a  50cc machine of 86.49mph, clocking well \na ee \nasi ¥ Se ict, \nhai bess \ncee il rw \nGiacomo \nAgostini \nleaps \nBallaugh \nBridge \non  \nhis  \nMV \nAgusta. \nii \nEAST vs  WEST 95 \nover \n100mph \nin \nthe \nprocess. \nAs  \nin \nother \nclasses, \nthe  \nworks \nbikes \nwere \nfar  \nfaster \nthan \nthe \nproduction \nrace \nmachines. \nMany \nof \nthe \nlatter \ncarried \nthe \nname \nHonda \non \nthe \ntank \nand \ndominated \nthe  \nlower \nplacings, \nbeing \nfar  \ntoo  \ngood \nfor \nSuzuki’s \nproduction \nTRSO \n‘tiddler’. \n\n96  M  EAST vs  WEST \nOf the  eighty starters who came to  the  line for  Friday’s \nSenior race, forty-one were on  Nortons and thirty-one \non  Matchless, with the  balance made up  of single entries \nfrom other marques, chief of which were the  MV Agusta of \nGiacomo Agostini and  the  Honda of Mike Hailwood. \nMV’s relatively new 3-cylinder 350cc had been able to \nchallenge the  350 Honda in  world racing and so  the  Ital- \nian  company produced enlarged versions to  compete in the \n500cc class. In  1966 Agostini’s ‘500’ was only of 420cc \ncapacity but  in  the  Senior race he harried Mike Hailwood \ninitially, forcing Hailwood to  set  a  new lap  record of \n107.07mph and, even with rain falling at  Ramsey on  the \nlast  lap, to  increase the  race average speed to  103.11mph. \nHailwood won by nearly 3 minutes, Agostini having slowed \ntowards the  end. \nBritish \nmachines \nfinished \nwell \nbehind, \nwith \ntheir \nrace \nspeeds \nbeing \nbelow \nthose \nset \nby \nthe \nlikes \nof Hailwood \nand \nLuigi Taveri and his  50cc Honda in  Parliament Square, Ramsey. \nMinter on  Nortons in  the \nearly 1960s. Bad news for \ntheir owners in  1966 was \nthat the principal spares \nmanufacturer for Manx \nNorton, AJS 7R  and  Match- \nless G50 models —  AMC — \nwas in  financial difficulty. \nSpares for  the singles were \nalready in  short supply and \nvery expensive, with some \ntuners having items specially \nmade in  order to  keep their \nmachines running. In a  pro- \nphetic forecast, the maga- \nzine Motorcycle Sport wrote \nof  a  future where private \ncontractors produced more \nsuch spares, finishing with: \n‘The only major items which \ncannot be  easily, or  eco- \nnomically, dreamed up  are \ncastings —  cylinder heads, \ncamboxes and _ crankcases \nare  the  bugbear.

Among catalogued machines \nof the  1960s, there were some classed as  sports machines, \nwhich reflected the  continued wish of buyers to  project \nthe  racer-on-the-road image. They came with items like \nclip-ons, rear-set footrests, twin carburettors, single seats \nand so  on.  Anyone with a  standard machine could equip it \nin  similar fashion from the  many suppliers of aftermarket \nextras, many of whom had  sprung up to  meet the  demand \nfor the popular café-racer style machines of the  day. \nRacing of catalogued production sports machines was \na  familiar sight on  British short circuits in the  mid-1960s, \nand for  1967 the  ACU introduced such a  Production race \nto  what was  the  Diamond Jubilee TT  meeting. Run on  the \nSaturday before the  main race week, it catered for  three \nclasses, 250cc, 500ce and 750cc. It had a  Le  Mans-type \nstart, setting riders off  in  three capacity waves and was \nscheduled for  three laps. While welcoming its  introduc- \ntion, those who had seen the handling problems created for \nproduction sports machines by comparatively smooth-sur- \nfaced mainland circuits expressed serious concerns about \nhow they would fare when ridden to  their limits over the \nordinary public roads of the  Mountain Course. \nROADS \nThe modern equipment used for surfacing the Island’s roads \nhad  improved them for racing through the  1960s and  con- \ntributed to  faster lap times. However, the  TT  course was \nnot  up to race-track standards and it was  subject to the wear \nand tear of daily traffic outside race periods. This meant \nthat \nwithin \na \nyear \nor \nso \nof \na \nnew \nsmooth \nsurface \nbeing \nlaid, \nit \nwould \nreceive \na \ncoat \nof \ntar \nand \nchippings \nto \nprolong \nits \nlife. \nFortunately, \nthe \nmethods \nused \nin \nthat \ntreatment \nhad \nalso \nimproved, \nwith \nchippings \nbeing \nsmaller \nand \nmore \nevenly \nspread, \nso \ngenerally \navoiding \nthe \nnasty \n‘tramline’ \neffects \nof \nearlier \ndays. \nBut \nsurface \nwear \nwas \nnot \neven \nand \nalthough \nthe \ntar \nretained \nthe \nchippings \nbetter \nthan \nbefore, \nin \nheavily \ntrafficked \nareas \nthey \ncould \nbe \nscuffed \noff, \nleaving \nthe  tar  exposed. On  hot  days that could melt, creating a \nserious hazard for  racers. Regrettably, there was little the \norganizers could do about it, given the nature of this public \nroads course. \nBeing ordinary roads, the course also incorporated cam- \nbers not  designed to  suit  the  racing line. It was edged with \nconcrete kerbs, had sundry steel manhole covers embedded \nin the surface and was  regularly dug up to repair burst water \nmains and the  like. All  along it were solid roadside banks, \nThe logo of the Diamond Jubilee TT  meeting in  1967. \n\n98  M  TROUBLED TIMES \nwalls, telegraph poles and  other hazards, with unguarded \nditches replacing kerbs at the road edge on upland stretches. \nThe TT  Mountain Course was not  to  be  compared with \nSilverstone. For most riders that was the  attraction, but \nfor  a  few  it was a  cause for  complaint and, unfortunately, \ntheir voices would become increasingly strident in years to \ncome. \n1967: THE MACHINES \nHonda dropped their support of the  50  and 125cc racing \nclasses for  1967, but continued to  develop their bigger \nrace bikes. The 250-6 came with increased power to  try \nto  counter the  speed of Yamaha’s fours, plus a  new frame \nto  improve handling. The 350  was redesigned with six  cyl- \ninders giving 70bhp and also had a  new frame. In  typical \nHonda fashion, the  500 also received more power, when \nwhat it really needed was  improved handling. The man due \nto  ride all  the  above, a  frustrated Mike Hailwood, com- \nmissioned his  own frame for  the  500, but  Honda would \nnot  risk ‘losing face’ by letting him use  it.  They contented \nthemselves with a little additional strutting of the rear sub- \nframe. \nMV Agusta and Giacomo Agostini continued with devel- \nopment of their 3-cylinder models but  early-season events \nshowed that the  350  was now down on  speed compared to \nHonda’s new 350-6. \nPhil Read and Bill Ivy  were Yamaha’s works riders, \ntogether with newcomer Akiyasu Motohashi. They would \nuse  the 4-cylinder 125  in  1967. It was said to  give 41bhp at \n17,000rpm, had  ten  gears and could reach 130mph, with \nthe  company’s 250-4 being some 20mph faster. The devel- \nopment of Yamaha’s earliest models into these potent racers \nhad  been a step-by-step process through the  1960s for the \nengineers making up its race department in Japan. \nSuzuki were present with 50  and 125cc machines and  a \nnew batch of riders, although their new V4  125  was  not  yet \nready to race, while Dave Simmonds rode the nearest thing \nto  a works bike from Kawasaki. \nRenzo Pasolini was flying the  flag for  Benelli on  their \n350 and  500cc 4-cylinder models, and while his all-action, \nlean-out riding style endeared him to  the  crowds, there \nwere questions about Benelli reliability. \nApart \nfrom \nthe  \nabove \nand  \nentries \nfrom \nMZ \nwith \nHeinz \nRosner \nand \nDerek \nWoodman, \nthe  \nfield \nin  \nall  \nclasses \nwas \nmade \nup \nof \nproduction \nrace \nmachines \n—  \nnot  \nto \nbe \nconfused \nwith \nproduction \nsports \nbikes \n—  \nfrom \nthe  \nlikes \nof \nHonda, \nYamaha, \nSuzuki, \nBultaco, \nAermacchi \nand, \nstill, \na \nmulti- \ntude \nof \nBritish \nsingles. \nIf \nany \nrecords \nwere \nto \nbe \nbroken \nin \nthe \nsolo \nclasses, \nhowever, \neveryone \nknew \nthey \nwould \ncome \nfrom \nthe \nworks \nentries. \nMotor \nCycling’s \nspeed \ntrap \nshowed \nBill \nIvy \nhitting \n153.8mph \non \nhis \n250 \nYamaha, \nwith \nheavier \nteam \nmate \nPhil \nRead \nat \n148.8mph, \nwhile \nin the \n500cc \nclass, \nMike \nHail- \nwood \n(Honda) \nmanaged \n154.5mph, \nwith \nGiacomo \nAgos- \ntini \n(MV \nAgusta) \nclocked \nat \n152.5mph. \nThe \n500s \nwere \nstill \nrunning \non \nnarrow \n3.50 \nrear \ntyres \nand \nthe \n80bhp \nbeing \nput \nthrough \nthem \nwas \nbeginning \nto \ncreate \nconcern \nabout \nwear \nrates \nover \na \nsix-lap \nrace. \nDISC BRAKES \nA few  competitors experimented with disc brakes, but  all \nthe top runners still relied on  drum brakes. They were usu- \nally twin-leading shoe on  the  front and  single rear, having \ngrown in size  down the years, to  cope with the extra work \nneeded to  stop faster race bikes in shorter distances. Some \ndrum brakes almost filled the wheel, and others came with \nsubstantial cooling fins and air-scoops, to  help shed heat. \nFerodo contributed to  the  growth in  stopping power, by \ndeveloping special racing linings. \nRather like the introduction of  streamlining in  the \n1950s, the  fitting of disc brakes did  not  guarantee instant \nreward, for  it could create problems just as  easily as  solve \nthem. The potential for extra bulk and  their fiercer action \nincreased weight transfer to  the  front wheel, resulting in \nheavier loading of forks and tyres that were not  designed for \nthem. There could also be a  problem with the  rear wheel \ngoing light under heavy braking, thus upsetting the balance \nof the  bike. Nevertheless, people could see  the  potential \nof disc brakes and  there was a feeling that their day would \ncome. \nBATTLES CONTINUE \nThe TT  was a  round of the  World Championship and  rid- \ners  came to  the  Island for the  1967 Diamond Jubilee event \nhaving already been in  competition with each other on \nEuropean circuits. After the  customary practice sessions, \nthey were ready to  renew battle over the  unique Moun- \ntain Course, where a win still  meant so  much to  riders and \nmanufacturers. \nMike Hailwood had been a major force at the TT almost \nsince his debut in  1958, and 1967 was  to bea year in which \nhe  dominated the  major classes riding Hondas. In  the \nLightweight race he  set  new record race average and lap \nspeeds ahead of Phil  Read (Yamaha). In the Junior he added \n3’amph \nto \nhis \nown \nlap \nrecord \nfrom \na \nsearing \nstanding \nstart \nand \nraised \nthe \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nby \na \nsimilar \namount, \nlead- \ning \nhome \nGiacomo \nAgostini \n(MV \nAgusta) \nby \n3 \nminutes. \nThe \nSenior \nrace \nof \n1967 \nhas \ngone \ndown \nas \none  \nof \nthe \ngreat \nones \nin \nTT \nhistory, \nwith, \nin \nwords \nof \nthe \ntime, \n‘Agostini \non \nthe \nsleek \nand \nmanageable \nMV. \nHailwood \non \nthe \nbrutish \n\nAE \nABOVE: Mike Hailwood exits Governor’s Bridge on  his  6-cylinder Honda at  the 1967 TT. \nBELOW: Giacomo Agostini leaves Parliament Square and heads for  the Mountain climb on  his  3-cylinder MV Agusta in  1967. \n\n100 M@  TROUBLED TIMES \nProduction race winners in  1967, John Hartle, Neil Kelly \nand Bill  Smith.

Hailwood knew he  had a fight \non  his  hands but  he was up  for  it, swapping the  lead with \n‘Ago’, as  he was increasingly being known, over the  open- \ning laps at record-breaking speeds. At his refuelling stop at \nthe  end  of the third lap, Hailwood lost  valuable time ham- \nmering a  loose twist-grip back in place, then rejoined the \nfray. With only seconds between them, the outcome was  in \ndoubt until nearing the  end  of the  fifth lap, when the  Ital- \nian’s chain snapped at Windy Corner and he was out  of the \nrace. Still troubled by his loose twist-grip, Hailwood rode \non  to  win  from Peter Williams (Arter Matchless), leaving \nthe race average speed at a new record figure of 105.62mph \nand  also setting a record fastest lap at  108.77mph. \nAfter the race, Mike Hailwood generously expressed the \nview that Ago might well have won for  he  also lapped at \n108mph, but  those who knew the  Honda man felt  that he \nwould not  really have let that happen. A true master of the \nMountain Course, he now had  twelve TT  victories to  his \nname, more than any other rider at that time. \nSpeeds in the  Ultra Lightweight 125  race matched those \nof the  previous year and  Phil  Read (Yamaha) took victory \nby a  little over 3 seconds from Stuart Graham (Suzuki). \nIn  the  50cc race, speeds were slightly down on  the  previ- \nous  year, and  Suzuki achieved a  one-two-three finish with \nStuart Graham, Hans-Georg Anscheidt and Tommy Robb. \nBMW riders continued to  battle for  supremacy in  the \nSidecar class, where Siegfried Schauzu led home Klaus End- \ners  and Colin Secley, taking 10  seconds off  the  previous \nfastest race time. \nIn  the  new Production race, the  winners were: 750cc \nClass, John Hartle (Triumph Bonneville) at  a  race average \nspeed of  97.10mph; 500cc Class, Neil Kelly (Velocette \nVenom Thruxton), 89.89mph; 250cc Class, Bill Smith \n(Bultaco \nMetralla), \n88.63mph. \nIt \nwas \nconsidered \nto  \nbe  \na \nsatisfactory \ndebut \nfor \nthe \nnew \nclass, \nwhich \nset \ntarget \nspeeds \nfor \nfuture \nyears. \nAs \nwas \nthe \nnorm \nin \nProduction \nracing, \nthere \nwas \ndissent \nbetween \nriders \nand \norganizers \nover \ncom- \npliance \nwith \nthe \nregulations \nfor \nthe \nevent. \n1968: MORE RACES \nShort-circuit racing in  Britain was suffering from falling \nattendances but spectator and competitor interest in  the \nTT remained high. Among road-riding motorcyclists there \nwere still kudos to  be  gained from being able to  tell  your \nmates, ‘I’m going to the TT’. The Diamond Jubilee of 1967 \nhad seen record entries, boosted by the  new Production \nrace. That level was  maintained for 1968, where the Sidecar \nrace was split into two classes, run  concurrently, for up to \n500cc machines and 501—750cc ones. The latter gave an \nopportunity to use  big BSA and Triumph engines, although \namong the  entries of fifty 500s and forty 750s, the  500cc \n‘Renn Sport’? BMWs remained the  fastest. It was a  year in \nwhich riders from over twenty countries came to  ride the \nMountain Course. \nColin Seeley had purchased the manufacturing rights for \nNorton, AJS  and  Matchless race machines and  operated a \nservice depot on  the Island, providing support for the many \nriders still using them. As  well as  uprated engine compo- \nnents and such, he produced the Seeley frame and complete \nSeeley race machines. \nReally bad news was that Honda and Suzuki would not \nbe on  the Island, having pulled out  of World Championship \nracing. Yamaha were present with works bikes, but  were \nexpected to  reduce their commitment to  top-level racing \nafter the TT.  MV Agusta fielded Giacomo Agostini and, for \nthe first time in eight years, John Hartle. \nA  rejig of  the race programme saw the Sidecars run \non  Saturday evening, 50cc and Lightweights on  Monday, \nProduction and  Junior on  Wednesday, with Ultra Light- \nweight and Senior on  Friday. Spectators were by now used \nto hearing full race commentaries from Manx Radio, which \nhelped their understanding of what was going on  around \nthe course. \nDunlop had  new KR83 tyres available for solos, which, \nin cross-section, gave a more rounded profile. This allowed \na  smoother transition between vertical and lean, with the \nnew tyres also being able to  handle more power. By the \nend  of the  1968 TT, Dunlop were advertising that the first \nthree finishers in every race used their products. \nFor \nthose \nwho \nthought \nall \nroad \nsurfaces \non  \nthe \nTT \ncourse \nwere \nbetter \nthan \nthey \nused \nto  \nbe,  \nnumerous \ncomplaints \nearly \nin \npractice \nabout \nthe \nbumpy \nnature \nof \nthe \nstretch \nafter \nBallacraine \nthrough \nGlen \nHelen \nshowed \nthat \nimprovements \n\nwere still needed. There were also unkind words uttered \nabout loose chippings at  Creg ny Baa, particularly by those \nriders who were first to  come across them. The reality was \nthat course conditions varied from year to  year, with main- \ntenance and even reconstruction carried out  to  cope with \never increasing amounts of traffic, \nPractice sessions did  not  throw up any  major surprises, \nalthough one  early session at sluggish speeds was explained \naway with the  headline, “Slow Speeds as  Riders are  Hit  by \nFlies’. In a later session, John Hartle showed he was  a wor- \nthy team mate to  Giacomo Agostini by matching his  104- \nplus mph laps on  the  Junior MV. When Hartle last  raced \na  Junior MV at  the  TT  in  1960, he  had won the  event at \na  race average speed of 96.70mph with a  best lap of about \n98mph, so  there must have been big changes in  the  inter- \nvening years to put over 6mph on  his lap speed.

As  ever, it was probably a  combi- \nnation. Also impressing with his  speed was 1960 Sidecar \nTT  winner Helmut Fath. Indeed, the  speed of his  home- \nengineered 4-cylinder URS outfit proved a  worry to  the \ntop  BMW boys. \nTHE RACING \nWith the  ever-increasing number of races at  the  TT, this \nbook cannot hope to  chronicle all the  results, so  given that \nits  theme is  ‘speed’, it  will concentrate mostly on  those \nthat set  new records. For the previous few years the  Sidecar \nlap record had  hovered around the  91.80mph mark, but  in \n1968 Klaus Enders (BMW) produced an  extra-special lap \nto  lift it to  94.32mph. That pace proved too  hot  for him to \nfinish the race and  Siegfried Schauzu (BMW) took the  win \nat  a  record race average speed of 91.09mph. Fath (URS) \n\n102 M@  TROUBLED TIMES \nfinished fourth, unable to  use  full  power, as  the  handling \nof his  outfit did  not  match the  demands of the  Mountain \nCourse. In the new 750cc class, Terry Vinnicombe (Kirby- \nBSA) was  first at  a race  average of 85.85mph, from the BSAs \nof Norman Hanks and Peter Brown, while Chris Vincent, \non  yet another BSA, set  the  fastest lap of 89.11mph. \nBill  Ivy started the  Lightweight 250cc race as  he  hoped \nto  continue, smashing the  lap record from a  standing start \non  his complex RDOSA model and leaving it at  105.51mph. \nHis Yamaha team mate Phil Read was intent on  matching \nIvy’s pace and moved into the  lead on  lap three before \nbeing forced out  with a  puncture. Meanwhile, Ivy hadia \nmoment’, when he caught his foot under the footrest out  on \nthe course. Slightly detuned, he slowed the pace but was  still \nfast  enough to  take victory from Renzo Pasolini (Benelli) \nand  Heinz Rosner (MZ). What may have seemed an  easy \nvictory came at a price, for as  well as  damaging his foot, Bill \nIvy finished most TT  races with blistered hands, from fight- \ning his machine and the course in his ‘never say die’  manner. \nIvy and Read were on  the true works Yamaha racers, but \nexcluding winner Ivy, five of the  first ten  finishers were \nYamaha-mounted on twin-cylinder production racers. Each \nof those would have been much enhanced by the  entrants \nwith the best tuning aids of the  day. The standard Yamaha \nproduction racer had now reached the TD1C model and  its \nuse  of a  new five-port cylinder provided more speed and \nreliability, transforming it into a truly competitive racer. \nCome Wednesday and  speeds rose slightly in the bigger \nProduction classes, Ray Pickrell bringing a Dunstall Domi- \nnator home as  first 750. It was one  fitted with double-disc \nfront brakes, from Dunstall’s catalogue of components for \nracing. Ray Knight was first 500 home on  a  Triumph and \nTrevor Burgess (Ossa) finished as top 250, at a speed slightly \nslower than in  1967. There were the  customary protests \nafter completion of the  Production race, including seven- \nteen with regard to  the  250  result. \nJohn Hartle put himself out of the afternoon’s Junior race \non  the MV  Agusta after crashing his Triumph in the morn- \ning’s Production race. This left  the  two Italians Giacomo \nAgostini (MV Agusta) and Renzo Pasolini (Benelli) to fight \nthings out  on  their 4-cylinder 350cc four-strokes, with \ntwo-stroke-mounted Heinz Rosner (MZ) looking for third \nplace. That was  the way it went initially, with their respec- \ntive  straight-line speeds given as  152.5, 152  and  140mph, \nwith Bill  Smith on  an  ageing Honda at  130.4mph. When \nRosner dropped out, Smith inherited third place. At  the \nfinish Agostini was  nearly 3 minutes ahead of Pasolini at  a \nslightly improved race average speed of 104.78mph, but the \nlap record stayed intact. Smith finished third, a further 10 \nminutes in arrears. While the race at the front may not  have \nbeen \nparticularly \nclose, \nthere \nwere \nalmost \nninety \nother \nrunners \nand \nthere \nwere \nmany \nclose \nbattles \nfor \nthe \nlower \norder \nplaces. \nSome \nof \nthose \ntook \nplace \nwheel \nto \nwheel \nout \non \nthe \ntrack, \nwhilst \nothers \nwere \nfought \nagainst \nthe \nclock, \nwithout \nthe \nriders \nseeing \neach \nother. \nThat \nwas \nthe \nnature \nof \nTT \nracing, \nwhere \neveryone \nhad \ntheir \nprivate \nrace(s), \nthough \nfew \nhad \na \nchance \nof \ngaining \na \nwin. \nFor \nthe \nmajority \nthe \nTT \nwas \nall \nabout \nthe \nopportunity \nto \nride \nthe \nMountain \nCourse \nat \nracing \nspeeds, \nsomething \nthat \nthey \nmade \nhuge \nfinancial \nand \npersonal \nsacrifices \nto \nachieve. \nYamaha-mounted Read and Ivy were in  a  race of their \nown in the  Ultra Lightweight, with Read taking victory at \na  record race average speed of 99.12mph and Ivy setting a \nnew lap record of 100.32mph. It was the  first time a  125 \nhad lapped the  course at  the  ‘ton’ and it was a  figure that \nwas to  stand for  many years. An  indication of what Bill \nIvy had  to  do to  achieve that lap comes from the  words of \na  spectator who watched his  progress down the  hill  after \nBarregarrow crossroads: \nIvy streaked down the  hill  standing on  the footrests, wres- \ntling with the bike in  an  effort to  control a  terrifying tank \nslapper. The front wheel was  flopping about all  over the \nplace and the bike was  doing its best to  tie itself into  a  knot. \nBut  Ivy didn’t shut down a  scrap —  he just stood up  and \nfought it with the  throttle wide open at  130mph. \nThat record-breaking 125  TT of 1968 is part of TT history, \nnot  least because Bill  Ivy actually stopped at  Creg ny  Baa \ntowards the  end of the  race, ostensibly to  enquire of his \nrace position, although the  real reason was  to  comply with \nYamaha team orders that Phil Read should win. \nLast race of the  week was the  Senior TT, and  this pro- \nvided Agostini with his  first double win in  a  week. Run \nat  a  slower pace than the Junior, Ago still  finished some 9 \nminutes ahead of second-place Brian Ball (Seeley), who was \na mere 0.4  seconds ahead of Brian Randle (Petty-Norton). \nJohn Hartle’s MV comeback ended when, with gearbox \nproblems, he tried to ride through Cronk ny Mona without \nchanging down, but clipped the kerb and was  thrown down \nthe road. \nSo ended a record-breaking TT  meeting, but it was one \nthat missed the  presence of works machines from Honda \nand  Suzuki, together with their star  riders. \n1969: MORE CHANGE \nThe \nFIM \nintroduced \nmajor \nchanges \nto  \nracing \nmotorcycles \nfor  \n1969, \ndesigned \nto  \ncurb \nthe  \nrunaway \ntechnical \ndevelop- \nment \nof \nJapanese \nmanufacturers, \nwho \nhad \nleft \nothers \nfloun- \ndering \nin \ntheir \nslipstreams. \nNew \nregulations \nrestricted \n50cc \n\nmachines to one  cylinder, 125  and  250 to two  cylinders, and \n350 and 500 to  four cylinders, with all  classes limited to  a \nmaximum of six  gears. This  had  a major impact, halting the \ndesign of ever more advanced race machines, turning exist- \ning works exotica into museum pieces and Opening up  the \nfield for over-the-counter production racers, particularly in \nthe  smaller classes. The TT  complied with the  new restric- \ntion and a look at the numbers entered of the most common \nmakes in the  racing classes at  the  1969 event showed: \n125cc: Bultaco 19, Honda 16 \n250cc: Yamaha 45,  Bultaco 11 \n350cc: Aermacchi 28, Norton 27, Yamaha 20 \n500cc: Norton 44,  Matchless 25 \n500cc Sidecar: Triumph 27 \n750cc Sidecar: Triumph 35 \nMany other makes were represented, but in lesser numbers. \nTROUBLED TIMES 103 \nWhile part of  the thinking behind the imposition of \nrestrictions might have been to reduce costs, the fastest race \nbikes would still be found in  the  hands of the  manufactur- \ners,  sponsors and riders who spent the most on  them, Just as \nwith British singles of the  1950s and 1960s, there were tun- \ners  who could make a  standard product go faster than the \nnext man’s. Sometimes this was based upon putting a  bike \ntogether properly, ‘blueprinting’ in  current jargon, but \nusually it meant spending much money on  special pistons, \nbarrels, exhausts, ignition systems and so  on,  to gain a race- \nwinning edge over the  opposition. The influence of those \ntuners and suppliers on  race results was always apparent, \nand  such was their importance that they began to  add  their \nnames to  the  machines they supplied to  top  riders, often \nputting it in  front of the  makers: Kirby-Matchless, Petty- \nNorton, Padgetts-Yamaha. The FIM’s restrictions opened \nup  a  new era  in  which sponsored riders would dominate \nmotorcycle racing. \nJack \nFindlay \nrode \nFrancis \nBeart’s \nspecial \nAermacchi \nto  \nthird \nplace \nin \nthe \n1969 \nJunior \nTT. \n\n104 M  TROUBLED TIMES \nLooking \nat \nsome \nof \nthe \nmakes \nmentioned \nabove, \nAerma- \ncchi \n— an \nabbreviation \nof \nItalian \nplane \nmakers \nAeronautica \nMacchi \n— \nhad \nbeen \naround \nthe \nBritish \nracing \nscene \nsince \nthe \nearly \n1960s, \ninitially \nwith \na \nlong-stroke, \nfour-speed \nmodel, \nwith \nspine \nframe \nsupporting \na near \nhorizontal, \npushrod- \noperated \nengine \nthat \nlacked \nreliability. \nA new \nshort-stroke, \nfive-speed \nunit \narrived \nin \n1963 \nand \nearned \na following \nin \n250 \nand \n350cc \nforms, \nthe \nlatter \nbeing \npreferred \nby \nmany \nto \nthe \nageing \nAJS \n7R. \nBultacos were mostly 125s and  250s and did not  have the \nbest of reputations in Britain. Noted two-stroke man Brian \nWooley described them as  ‘of variable build quality’ with \n‘a name for  fragility’. Initially air-cooled, the  later water- \ncooled TSS versions were better. \nHonda 125s were mostly the  reliable CR93 four-stroke, \ntwin-cylinder bikes, which met with much success. Yamaha \nTDI1B two-stroke, 250cc twin-cylinder models arrived \nin  Britain in  small numbers in  the mid-1960s and also \nachieved success. A few were used at the TT, but most rid- \ners  felt they were not  sufficiently reliable for the event. The \nTDIC arrived in  limited numbers in  1967 and proved a \nmuch faster and  more reliable racer, with improved han- \ndling. Seemingly, Yamaha had  at  last  matched ports, tim- \ning and  exhausts, all features that could make or  break the \nperformance of a two-stroke engine. \nIn  1969 Yamaha brought out  improved production race \nbikes with the  250cc TD2 and the  new 350cc TR2. Still \nair-cooled, output of the 250 went up from 39bhp to 44bhp \nat  10,000rpm and a  factory quoted maximum speed of \n133mph via  a  five-speed gearbox. Closely resembling the \n250, the  350  TR2 gave 54bhp at  9,500rpm and a speed of \n139mph. Initially in short supply, those production Yamaha \nrace bikes quickly became the  machine of choice for  the \nmajority. They were also the ones whose results were most \nnoticeably influenced by who had  prepared them and  how \nmuch had been spent upon them, for out  on  track substan- \ntial  differences in  performance could be  seen from what \nwere nominally the  same machines. \nRace bikes came with manufacturers’ recommendations \nto  replace major components like  pistons and  crankshafts \nafter a prescribed number of racing miles. That could be an \nexpensive business and not  every owner complied. Given \nthe  mixed quality of preparation that was carried out  with \nmachines in  the  hands of so  many different owners, pro- \nduction race bikes did not  have the strongest reputation for \nreliability over the  TT  Mountain Course, while those rid- \ning super-tuned versions were even less certain of reach- \ning the  finish of a 226-mile TT  race. Phil Read’s machines \nwould have been among the  best prepared, but after some \nmechanical issues during practice one  year, he commented \nthat \nthe  \n‘Mountain \nCourse \nwas \ndesigned \nto  \nproduce \ngreat \nbikes \nas \nwell \nas \ngreat \nriders’. \nYamaha \nprovided \nan \nelement \nof \nsemi-works \nsupport \nthrough \nits \nEuropean \narm \nto \na \nselect \nfew \nriders, \nincluding \nTT \nrunner \nRod \nGould, \nwho \nalso \nhad \naccess \nto \na 125cc \ntwin. \nWhile Yamaha supplied the  majority of over-the-coun- \nter  250 and 350cc racers, others were available at  differ- \nent  times from Suzuki, Kawasaki, Greeves, Cotton and  so \non.  Some, like  the  Kawasaki 250cc A1-R and 350cc A7-R, \nwere ‘proper’ racers, while others converted models like \nthe  250cc Suzuki Super 6 roadster into machines for  the \ntrack. \nNAMES \nWith some top  riders no  longer paid to  race and  retiring \nfrom the  TT  scene, the  way was open for  new names to \ncome to  the  fore in  Island racing. Names like Kel  Carru- \nthers, Rod Gould, Dave Simmonds, Paul Smart, Charles \nMortimer, John Williams, Charlie Williams, Tony Jef- \nferies, Brian Randle, Mick Grant and Tony Rutter were \nincreasingly seen on  the  leader board although, as  will be \nseen, not  all stuck with the  event. \nTRADE SUPPORT \nLess prominent than in  earlier years, when the  majority \nof needs to  be  met were the  fairly standard ones of Brit- \nish  singles, major component suppliers were still present \nto  support TT  runners. The greater variety of machinery \nbeing raced meant a wider range of items had to be carried \nby those supplying sparking plugs, carburettor spares and \nso  on,  while in the world of tyres, Dunlop were increasing \ntheir specialization and now developed different tyres to \nsuit different machines. In 1969 they had three types of tyre \nand five different tread styles for solo and sidecar use. As yet \nthey did not produce special wet-weather versions, but they \ndid introduce ‘grip cells’, comprising 2,000 small-diameter \nholes moulded into the  tread pattern, which were said to \noffer benefits in the  wet. \nTHE RACING \nThe 500 and 750cc Sidecars were given separate races, \nwhich tempted some of the  BMW runners to  fit enlarged \nbarrels to  their 500s and tackle the  opening 750 race in \nthe  hope of earning extra prize money. It was a tactic that \nproved successful for Siegfried Schauzu, who took his 550cc \nBMW \nto \nvictory \nat \nrecord-breaking \nspeeds. \nWith \n500cc \nbarrels refitted for the  smaller-capacity World Champion- \nship \nevent, \nSchauzu \nfinished \nsecond \nto \nKlaus \nEnders, \nwho \nrode \na \ncontrolled \nrace \nto \nset \nanew \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nwith- \nout \nbreaking \nhis \nown \nlap \nrecord \nfrom \n1968. \nHelmut \nFath’s \nw \n\n4-cylinder URS was timed at \n134.8mph, which was 10mph \nfaster than Ender’s winning \nBMW, but  Fath’s power/han- \ndling balance was still not  right \nfor  the Mountain Course and \nhe  was forced to  back it off in \nplaces, finishing third. \nIn  the  Junior and Senior \nraces, Giacomo Agostini and \nhis so-superior MV Agustas \nwere untouchable. In  fairness \nto  Ago, his  race-winning aver- \nage  speeds were respectable at \n101.81mph and 104.75mph. \nThose figures were some 4mph \nslower than the pace he  was \ncapable of  and yet were. still \nalmost 7mph a lap faster than \nJunior runner-up Brian Steen- \nson (Aermacchi) and second- \nplace man in  the  Senior, Alan \nBarnett (Kirby-Metisse). To \nsome extent those results \nshowed the folly of  believ- \ning that speed is all in motorcycle racing. Whilst Agostini \n‘cruised’ around in  smooth, unhurried style, riding well \nwithin his own and his machine’s limits, Steenson and  Bar- \nnett were all-action and spectators knew they were using \nevery bit  of power and racing right up  to  their limits. In \nfact, Steenson looked as  though he was  likely to go over his \nin  places, while the  stylish Barnett showed how a British \nsingle could be ridden on  the edge for 226 miles. Both were \nin only their second year at the TT. \nThe absence of former works machinery in  1969 was \nfelt most in the races for  125  and  250cc machines, although \nFIM restrictions would not  be  enforced against the  250s \nuntil the  following year. MZ and  Benelli had  a works pres- \nence in  the Lightweight race, with the  Benellis ridden \nby Kel Carruthers and Phil Read. It was Carruthers who \ntook victory, his  Benelli being 6mph faster than Read’s, \nbut slightly slower than Derek Woodman’s MZ and Rod \nGould’s Yamaha. His  race average speed was 4mph down \non  the previous year. In the Ultra Lightweight race for  125s, \nDave \nSimmonds \nrode \na \nwater-cooled \nKawasaki \ntwin \nto \na \nfirst TT  victory, although here the  average race speed was \n8mph down on  1968. \nThe \nProduction \nrace \noffered \nspirited \ncompetition \nacross \nits \nthree \nclasses. \nAmong \nthe \n750s \nit \nwas \nTriumph \nBon- \nnevilles, \nNorton \nCommandos \nand \nBSA \nSpitfires \nthat \nwere \nTROUBLED TIMES MP  105 \nPhil Read on  the Benelli at  Quarter Bridge in  1969. \nexpected to  take the  honours, with Rod Gould’s Bonney- \nille  fastest through the  speed trap at  140.lmph. Malcolm \nUphill’s Bonneville was 6mph slower, but  Uphill rode it \nto  victory over Paul Smart (Norton Commando) at  a  new \nrecord race average speed of 99.99mph and a lap record \nspeed of  100.37mph. So  pleased were Dunlop with this \nwin that they renamed the  road tyres that Uphill used the \n‘TT100’ to  celebrate his  100mph lap. \nIn the 500cc class Graham Penny took victory ona Honda \nCB450 after being chased by fastest lap setter, Tony Dun- \nnell, ona Kawasaki Mach III.  Among the 250s, Alan Rogers \nbrought a Ducati home first, a desmo version of which Chas \nMortimer hustled past The Highlander at  110mph to  fin- \nish third, after being slowed by electrical problems. Frank \nWhiteway slotted a  Suzuki T20 into second. In neither the \n500 nor  250cc Production classes were records threatened. \n1970: THE PRICE OF  SPEED \nThe main business of the  TT  revolved around speed. The \nsights and sounds created by racing motorcycles, the tension \nand excitement generated —  they were all  shared by those \nin attendance and by the worldwide fan base. But there was \na  price to  pay  for  an  event that afforded such stimulation, \nand  in  1970 six  riders were killed during practice and  rac- \ning. This left  many questioning whether that was not  too \n\n106 TROUBLED TIMES \n= = \nhigh a  cost. There were calls for  the  course to  be  made \nsafer, a  very difficult task given its  nature, but  the  racers \nthemselves accepted the  loss and went on  with the  racing. \nMore than anyone, they knew the potentially high price to \nbe paid for racing over the  Mountain Course. \nFormer Medical Officer for  the  races, Dr  Pat  Cullen, \nwhen asked what he  thought of riders risking their lives \nracing, said, ‘I don’t think they are  fools, some are  brave, \nsome are  lacking in  imagination —  | think one can  say  that \nthey do not  regard life  as  something which should be  held \nonto terribly dearly’, \nRegrettably, the  threat of death was, and  still is, insepa- \nrable from TT  racing. Riders adopted different attitudes to \nriding the course, with some claiming they did not  actually \n‘race’, or  that they only rode at  ‘nine-tenths’. But  it was \njournalist Ted Macauley who encapsulated the  attitude of \nthe  professional racer of the  time, who was  there to  win, \nwhen he described Bill Ivy’s riding to set the first 100mph lap \nby a  125cc machine back in  1968. Writing later, Macauley \ntold how Ivy ‘threw himself into heart-stopping moments \nof defiance of the course’s terrible promise to  anybody who \ntook liberties with it’. \nMajor works at the Verandah saw  its four bends widened \nand resurfaced prior to  the  1970 TT, resulting in  a  faster \npassage for riders and  a further saving of time. \nRoadworks at the Verandah show the sort of activity that occurs on  the TT  course when the racers are not around. \nee \nPRODUCTION RACING \nHaving proved themselves in  three-lap races since being \nintroduced to  the  Mountain Course in  1967, the  seventy- \nplus riders in what had become the International Production \nRace were required to  race over five  laps and 189  miles in \n1970. The ‘Proddie’ race seemed to have caught the imagi- \nnation of racegoers, boosting visitor numbers for its  Satur- \nday race slot, although some argued that it should be part of \nthe main race week. The Saturday running might well have \nbeen one  of those commercially based TT  decisions, aimed \nat bringing an  influx of visitors for a long weekend by offer- \ning them the  easy-to-follow massed start Production race. \nInitially known for  their small-capacity road bikes, \nJapanese manufacturers had been gradually building \nlarger-capacity ones through the  1960s, and  Honda CB750 \n4-cylinder machines were now entered in the  big Produc- \ntion class, alongside Triumph Trident 3-cylinder 750s, \ntwin-cylinder Nortons, Triumphs and  BMWs. Ina slightly \nstrange scenario, while the  BSA Triumph Group was able \nto provide works machines for American racing, it claimed \nthat differences in  specifications between American and \nEuropean racing meant it  could not  give works support \nto  events at  home. A magazine of the  day explained how \nTriumph entries, and  those of Honda, were actually made \n‘through a  (pretty transparent) veil  of dealer entries’. \n\nTROUBLED TIMES 107 \nThis is what a  massed start looked like at  a Production TT. \nOne thing that irked private runners in  the  Production \nrace was that works-supported entries would come fitted \nwith go-faster components, which, although listed as  for \nsale to the public— to comply with race regulations — would \nactually be impossible to  lay hands on. \nConditions for the Production race were good, and those \nwith electric start jumped into the lead at the Le Mans-type \nmassed getaway. Many machines were now fitted with fair- \nings, yet the  500 and 750cc classes seemed not  to  match \neither the  straight-line or  race speeds of previous years. \nHowever, the  750 race did  see  a  titanic struggle between \nMalcolm Uphill (Triumph) and  Peter Williams (Norton), \nwith victory going to  Uphill by less  than 2 seconds, after \nWilliams’ Norton spluttered with fuel starvation over the \nlast  couple of miles. Only in  the  250cc class were records \nbroken, and they went to  winner Chas Mortimer on  his \nDucati MkIII, who finished 6 seconds ahead of John Wil- \nliams (Honda CB250). \nFor 1970 the 750cc Sidecar race ran on  Monday and \nthe  500cc race on  Wednesday. Klaus Enders set  new lap \nrecords in both races and  took victory in  the  500cc event. \nThe \n750cc \nrace \nwent \nto \nSiegfried \nSchauzu \nand \nnew \nrace \naverage speeds were set. \nThe \nLightweight \n250cc \nrace \nalso \nran \non  \nMonday, \nand \nhere \nKel  \nCarruthers \n(Yamaha) \nrode \nto  \nvictory \nover \nRod \nGould \n(Yamaha) \nat \na \nfaster \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nthan \nin  \n1969. \nBoth Carruthers and Gould wore jet-style helmets, while \nthe  majority still wore pudding-basin style. Within a  cou- \nple of years almost everyone would be  wearing full-face \nversions. \nThat 250cc race was hit by tragedy when Santiago Her- \nrero crashed his  Ossa at the  Thirteenth Milestone and  was \nkilled while holding fourth place. The Spanish single-cyl- \ninder, disc-valve two-stroke, had been timed at  137mph at \nThe Highlander and  Herrero was contesting the lead of the \n250cc World Championship at the time. Popular with other \nriders, his death gave weight to  a growing undercurrent of \nopposition among GP  competitors about having to  race to \nwin over a  course that was so  very different and difficult \nto  learn, compared to  the  average GP  circuit. Ironically, \nthe  Ultra Lightweight 125cc race was won by another rider \nappearing at  the  TT  primarily to  gain points for his  World \nChampionship challenge. This was  newcomer Dieter Braun \non  an  ex-works Suzuki, who took an  emphatic victory after \nearly leader and fastest lapper, Dave Simmonds (Kawasaki), \nwas forced to  retire at  the  Mountain Box. Unusually, sec- \nond and third places were also taken by newcomers —  Borje \nJansson (Maico) and  Gunter Bartusch (MZ). \nGiacomo Agostini achieved runaway victories in  both \nthe  Junior and  Senior races on  his  MV Agusta in  1970. \nIn the  Junior he  took just  3 seconds longer than in  1969, \nwith both his  lap and race speeds almost identical to  the \n\n108 M   TROUBLED TIMES \nsS Sos SESS EN SS \nprevious year’s. In  the  Senior, where his  race average was \nlower than in the Junior, he took over 4 minutes longer to \ncomplete the race than in  1969. There were battles aplenty \nfor  podium places in  both races, with Alan Barnett (Aer- \nmacchi) just failing to  set  the  first 1OOmph lap by a  350cc \nsingle while riding to  second place in  the  Junior. He  did \ntop  the 100mph lap in  the  Senior on  a  Seeley before he \ndropped it at  Doran’s, while in  close company with Peter \nWilliams (Arter Matchless). The latter, who was one of \nthose who claimed not  to  ‘race’ on  the  Island, also lapped \nat  over 100mph on  his  ride to  second place, saying of the \nMountain Course, ‘there is  no  doubt that it provides the \nPeter Williams (3) with Alan Barnett (5) in pursuit on  the Quarter Bridge Road. \ngreatest experience of fast motor- \ncycle riding in the  world’. \nTHE COURSE \nThe 1970 event finished with \ncriticism of the  TT  course by sev- \neral voluble riders, who called for \n‘1970 roads on  which to race 1970 \nmachines’. They had a point. The \nroads of the course were described \nat the  time by the  magazine Motor- \ncycle Sport as  ‘made up of good-class \nmain roads yet  they are not \ncomparable with good-class main \nroads on  the  mainland’. Particu- \nlarly vocal was Lightweight winner \nKel Carruthers, whose race aver- \nage was 96.13mph. Twenty years \nearlier, the Lightweight TT was \nwon by Dario Ambrosini (Moto \nGuzzi) at  a  race average speed of \n78.08mph. Ignoring the faster \nspeeds of the works Yamahas from \nseveral years before, that showed a \ngrowth of 18mph in twenty years, \nduring which time the roads of \nthe course had been improved. \nCarruthers clearly thought those \nimprovements had lagged behind \nmachine performance, but the \nIsland aimed for  normal highway \nstandards, not race-track ones. \nThere were always going to  be \ncambers that did  not  suit the  rac- \ners, street furniture that could \nbe  a  danger to  anyone falling off, \nlittle in  the  way of run-off areas \nand the  prospect of molten tar  in \nhot weather. \nThe dissatisfaction being expressed by a few was a prel- \nude  to  more of those who did not  like the  TT  deciding not \nto  race there; although, at  the  time, the  prospect of losing \npotential World Championship points was  usually sufficient \nto  bring them to  the  Island. As  will be  seen, this was an \nissue that was to  be linked to  wider financial ones. \nSeveral \nstretches \nof \nthe  \ncourse \nwere \nresurfaced \nprior \nto \nthe  \n1971 \nTT. \nWhile \nthe  \nwork \nwas  \ngenerally \nwell \nreceived, \nthe \nnew \nsmooth \nsurface \nand \nthe \neradication \nof \nbumps \non \nthe \nBrandish \nto \nHillberry \nstretch \nfound \nriders \narriving \nat \nand \nriding \nHillberry’s \nright-hand \nsweep \nmeasurably \nfaster \n\nthan before. Showing that you \ncannot please everyone, some \nconcerns were expressed about \nthis, but there were no  real \nincidents and things seemed \nto  settle down after a  couple \nof  practice sessions. Earlier \nmention was made of the  long \napproach to  Hillberry giving \nriders time to  build up  their \ncourage to  take it  at  speed, \nand Peter Williams summed \nthings up  nicely by describing \nthis right-hand sweep as  ‘a bit \nof a dare’. \nThe Cronk y Voddy straight \nwas still a  bumpy stretch and \nvery testing for Production \nbikes at  speed. It  was a  loca- \ntion that revealed to  experi- \nenced watchers how poor their \nhandling was compared with \ngenuine race bikes. \n1971: A NEW RACE \nNot content with Production races for  Triumph Tridents, \nNorton Commandos, Honda CB750s, BMW R75/5s and \nthe  like, run  to  a fairly restrictive specification, some con- \ntestants wanted to  race more highly tuned and modified \nversions of  those big  roadsters. Accordingly, what was \ncalled the  Formula 750 race was added to  the  programme \nin  1971. This allowed for  more tuning of both engine and \nchassis. It  was run over three laps with the  novelty of a \nclutch start in  pairs at  10-second intervals and attracted \nthirty-nine entries, which included a degree of works sup- \nport. It  also yielded a  splendid race, with the  first three \nriders all averaging over 100mph and winner Tony Jefferies \n(Triumph) finishing at a race average speed of 102.85mph, \nwhile setting the fastest lap at  103.21mph. Second was  Ray \nPickrell (BSA) and  third Peter Williams (Norton). Such a \nresult for  British racing machinery, which turned out  to \nbe \nfaster \nthan \nGiacomo \nAgostini’s \nMV \nAgusta \nSenior \nrace- \nwinning \nspeed \nlater \nin \nthe \nweek, \nwas \nvery \nwell \nreceived \nand \ncaught \nracegoers’ \nattention. \nWhat \nwas \nseen \nas \nan \nexperi- \nmental \nrace \nquickly \nbecame \na \npermanent \none \nin \nthe \nTT \nprogramme. \nMIXED RESULTS \nThe \n1971 \nrace \nschedule \nsuffered \nfrom \nmixed \nweather, \nwith \nthe \nJunior \nand \nUltra \nLightweight \nraces \nbeing \nworst \naffect- \nTROUBLED TIMES @  109 \nMolten tar on  bends was smothered with cement dust. \ned. They were won at relatively low speeds by Tony Jefferies \n(Yamaha) and  Chas Mortimer (Yamaha). In  a  rare occur- \nrence, Agostini struck problems with the  MV  in the Junior \nrace and  retired on  the  first lap. The announcement of his \nretirement brought some unsporting cheers. Another rarity \nwas  the sight of Barry Sheene competing in the Ultra Light- \nweight race. Sheene was riding a  speedy ex-works Suzuki \nbut slid off at Quarter Bridge on  the second lap and decided \nthat was the  end of his TT  career. \nSpeeds crept ahead of the previous fastest in the  500 and \n750cc Production races, with wins going to  John Williams \n(Honda CB450) and Tony Jefferies (Triumph Trident), \nbut  250cc winner Bill  Smith (Honda CB250) was  slightly \nslower than before. \nIn  what was generally portrayed as  a  belt-tightening \nworld for former works riders now forced to  campaign pri- \nvate production racers, Phil Read treated himself to  a Rolls \nRoyce Silver Cloud at the  start of the  season. It was a move \nthat sent out mixed messages, but Read was  still star  rider, \nhaving his  own bikes prepared by a  top  tuner, employing \ngood mechanics and continuing to  receive trade support. \nIn  the  Lightweight race he  brought 250cc lap times back \nup  over the  100mph mark for  the  first time since 1968, \ntaking a  comfortable win from Barry Randle. Strangely, \nit was Read’s first Lightweight TT  victory. Not so  strange \nwas that Yamaha filled the  first twenty-four places in  that \n\na \n110 M  TROUBLED TIMES \nTony Jefferies rides his  Triumph Trident to  victory in  1971. \nrace, for their 250cc TD2 and 350cc TR2 production rac- \ners,  plus their over-bored versions, were well on  the way to \ntaking over the racing world, a process strengthened when \nYamaha brought out  their uprated versions, the  TD2B and \nthe TR2B. \nThe only other improvement in previous race speeds in \n1971 was  by Siegfried Schauzu (BMW), who set a new fast- \nest  lap in  the  750cc Sidecar race of 93.44mph, with the \nwin going to  Georg Auerbacher on  his  BMW. It was  Auer- \nbacher’s first win after ten  years of TT  racing. \nIn  a  delayed-by-a-day Senior TT, Giacomo Agostini \ntook his customary win in less  than perfect conditions at a \nrace average speed of 102.59mph, finishing ahead of Peter \nWilliams (Arter-Matchless) and  Frank Perris on a Seeley- \nframed Suzuki TR500 twin. \n1972: NO MORNING PRACTICE \nHaving been the  mainstay of TT  practice until the  late \n1930s, when evening sessions were gradually added, early- \nmorning sessions were abandoned for  1972 and practice \ncompressed into just four evening sessions and a long one  on \nThursday afternoon. Two of those sessions were curtailed \nby mist and the  general opinion was that newcomers had \nnot  been provided with sufficient time to  learn the  course. \nMorning practice was  later reinstated. \nPhil Read was hugely experienced in  Island racing, but \neven he  could have done with more practice time, for  as \nwell as  his  customary 250 Yamaha, he  had accepted the \ninvitation of Count Agusta to  ride one of his  350s in  the \nJunior race. In  addition, he  was also due  to  ride a  John \nPlayer Norton in the  Formula 750 event. \nGiacomo Agostini was riding both 350 and 500cc MVs \nand  was  joined by a  Senior entry for  seasoned TT  runner \nAlberto Pagani. Ago lapped in practice at  104-plus mph on \nhis  new 350-4 and 106-plus mph on  the  500-3, but  Read \nand  Pagani lagged behind, while Alex George (Kawasaki) \nand Jack Findlay, on  his  semi-factory-supported Suzuki \nTRSOO, were principal challengers, although well off the \npace of Agostini. \nCome the  racing in  1972 speeds increased slightly in \nthe  three Production classes, but  no  records were broken \nin  the  Sidecar races, where both 500 and 750cc victories \nwent to  Siegfried Schauzu (BMW). It was  the Formula 750 \nclass that people now looked to  for  record speeds and  Ray \n\nPickrell \n(Triumph) \nprovided \nthem \nin \nwhat \nhad \nbeen \nincreased \nto \na \nfive-lap \nrace. \nHe \nlifted \nthe \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nto \n104.23mph \nand \nthe \nlap \nrecord \nto \n105.68mph. \nOn \nhis \nTR750 \n3-cylin- \nder, \nwater-cooled \nSuzuki, \nJack \nFind- \nlay \nhit \na \nfastest \never \nrecorded \nspeed \nat \nthe \nTT \nof \n158.6mph, \nat \nThe \nHigh- \nlander. \nWednesday’s races were _post- \nponed to Thursday and the inclement \nweather was to  remain for the rest of \nthe  week. In the  Lightweight classes, \nPhil Read (Yamaha) won the 250 race \nand, receiving support from Yamaha, \nChas Mortimer the 125, while \nGiacomo Agostini took the  Junior \nwin on  his regular 350-3, rather than \nthe  new four. Yet  again, race reports \nproclaimed ‘Agostini’s Easy Junior \nVictory’. It was the  same scene in the \nSenior 500cc race, where he took his \ntenth TT  win, although an  impressive ride from John Wil- \nliams (Arter-Matchless) saw  him hold Alberto Pagani (MV \nAgusta) at bay until running out  of petrol at the  Bungalow \n‘on  the last lap. This allowed Mick Grant to take third place \non  his Kawasaki HI-R. This 3-cylinder two-stroke was  still \nair-cooled, with handling that was severely tested’ by the \nMountain Course. \nTIPPING POINT \nThe Tourist Trophy races had been run by the  ACU since \ntheir inception in  1907. Initially indifferent, the  Isle  of \nMan Government gradually began to  realize the  benefit \nthe races brought to  the  Manx economy and  to  publicizing \nthe  Island’s name. Recognizing that the  ACU were losing \nmoney on  organizing the  TT, in  1930 the  Manx Govern- \nment began contributing towards the  cost of running the \nevent. \nAs  it gradually increased its  financial contribution, the \ngovernment and its  Tourist Board sought a  greater say  in \nthe  running of the  TT. However, neither the  ACU nor \nthe government picked up  on  the  overall mood towards \nthe \nhigh \ncost \nof \nracing \nin \nthe \nearly \n1970s \nand, \nmore \nimportantly, \nthey \nappeared \nnot \nto \nrecognize \na \ngrowing \nantagonism \ntowards \nthe \nTT. \nPromoters \nof \nWorld \nCham- \npionship \nrounds \nwere \nnotoriously \nmean \nin \nthe \namounts \nthey \npaid \nout \nin \nprize \nmoney \nand, \nwith \nthe \nsum \npaid \nto \nthe \nwin- \nning \nentrant \nat \nthe \nBlue \nRiband \nSenior \nTT \nstill \nthe \nsame \n£200 \nas \nit \nwas \nin \n1930, \nthe \nTT \norganizers \nalso \nexcelled \nin \nGiacomo Agostini leaps his  MV  Agusta over the hump in the Quarter Bridge \nTROUBLED TIMES @  111 \nae \nRoad that is now known as  ‘Ago’s Leap’. \nparsimony. Had prize money increased at  a  rate to  match \ninflation since 1930, a  Senior TT  win would have been \nworth c£2,500 in the  early 1970s. \nThe days when the  sport was awash with funding from \nthe  major Japanese and European factories had  gone, and \nmost riders operated on  tight budgets, with the two-strokes \nof the  day requiring considerable expenditure on  mainte- \nnance. For  all  the  tradition associated with the  TT, that \nitself was not  enough in  the  hard-headed world of racing- \nto-earn-a-living in the  early 1970s, and there was  growing \nopposition to  the  event. There were multiple reasons for \nthis, but many felt that the payment of realistic prize money \nwould have overcome a lot of  them and  reduced the level of \nopposition. Few people went into motorcycle racing with \nthe  intention of getting rich, but there were some who did \ngo on  to  develop that notion, and  were particularly voluble \nat  the  time. \nEntered in  the  Lightweight 125cc TT  in  1972 was pop- \nular Italian rider Gilberto Parlotti, who was leading the \nWorld Championship at  the  time on  his  Morbidelli. Hav- \ning prepared for  his  TT  debut as  thoroughly as  possible, \nhe  came to  the line on  the  last day of race week under \nwet and  overcast conditions. Challenging the  experienced \nChas Mortimer for the  lead on  time, during the  second lap \nParlotti ran  wide at  the  Verandah, collided with a  row of \nconcrete posts and was killed. It was a  tragedy for  racing \nto  lose such a fine rider, and his  death was to  have serious \nrepercussions for Island racing. \n\n112 M  TROUBLED TIMES \nInfluential riders like  Agostini, Read and  Gould, among \nothers, immediately declared that they would not  return \nto  the  TT  and their actions were supported by a  growing \nnumber of World Championship contestants who did  not \nwish to  be forced into competing there. Taking this a  step \nfurther, they began a campaign to  have the  TT  stripped of \nits World Championship status. \nSadly, almost a  year later, on  the  approach to  the  1973 \nTT, the World Championship GP series showed that \nnowhere was really safe in  the  world of motorcycle rac- \ning. At the  historic Monza track, top  stars Renzo Pasolini \nand Jarno Saarinen were killed in the  250  race, in an  inci- \ndent that brought down a host of runners on  the high-speed \nCurva Grande. This famous bend was a right-hander with \nno  run-off area, only an  Armco barrier, which threw men \nand machines back into the tracks of following riders. It was \na racing tragedy that is remembered to  this day. \nThe incident at  Monza added weight to  what had been a \ngrowing campaign by riders for  safer race circuits. It was \nall \n<a \nvictory in the 500cc Sidecar race of  1973. \nFly-spattered \nKlaus \nEnders \nand \npassenger \nRalf \nEngelhardt \nround \nGovernor’s \nBridge \non  \ntheir \nBMW \non  \nape \na \neo \nsomething that would be  difficult to  achieve with the  TT \nMountain Course. \n1973: CHANGE \nBelatedly waking up to the threat it faced, the 1973 TT came \nwith the  offer of much-enhanced prize money: £1,000 for \na Senior win, £600 for a Junior, £750 for Formula 750  and \nslightly less for Lightweights and Sidecars. In the absence of \nsome ‘star’ entries, previous podium finishers now looked \nto  move up  a  step or  two and reap the  benefit of those \nincreased rewards, which had also been extended to  the \nlesser placemen. \nThat is how things worked out  in  the  Junior and  Light- \nweight 250 classes in  1973, where last  year’s second-place \nmen, Tony Rutter and Charlie Williams, took first in the 350 \nand  250cc races, while veteran Tommy Robb took his first \nTT  victory in the  125  race. Despite all the top places being \ntaken by over-the-counter Yamaha production race bikes, \nwhose year-on-year improvements kept them ahead of the \n'Mi \n\nfield, \nthere \nwere \nsome \ninteresting \nand \nhard- \nfought \nraces \nfor \nthe \nwatching \ncrowds, \nwho \nwere \nthee \nin \ngood \nnumbers. \nThe \nProduction \nrace \nkicked \noff  \nthe  \nweek \nand \nriders \nof \n750cc \nmachines \nwere \nthe \nfirst \nto \nbe \ndespatched \non \ntheir \nLe \nMans- \nstyle \nstart, \nfollowed \n2 \nminutes \nlater \nby \nthe \n500s \nand \nthen \nthe \n250s. \nThe \nweather \ndeteriorated \nduring \nthe \nrace, \nresulting \nin \nslowish \nspeeds \nfor \nclass \nwinners \nTony \nJefferies \n(Triumph), \nBill \nSmith \n(Honda) \nand \nCharlie \nWilliams \n(Yamaha). \nRecord speeds were set  in the  centre-of-attention, non- \nChampionship Formula 750 race, where Peter Williams \nand  his  75bhp John Player Norton upped the  race average \nspeed to  105.47mph and the  fastest lap to  107.27mph. It \ngave Williams his  first TT  win, from similarly mounted \nMick Grant. It was also the  second-fastest TT  race ever, \nbehind the  Hailwood/Agostini battle of 1967. \nPeter Williams claimed not  to  race on  the limit over the \nMountain course, but  his  personal account of a  lap on  his \nNorton in  that Formula 750 race had readers feeling that \nhe could not  have ridden much harder. It contained graphic \nphrases like ‘hard against the stop ...  flat on  the tank ...  the \nfront wheel comes off the ground ...  ride it through there \non  the  back wheel ...  ignore the  bumps ...  can  usually do \nflatout ..2 .  the front wheel \njust touches the  road here and  there ...  couldn’t believe I \ncould take it flat ... \nbut only because | don’t like  my head bouncing on  the  tank \nat  145mph!’ \nThe Sidecar races continued to  attract the top ‘World \nback wheel could suddenly go.. \njust heave on  the  bars ...  | sit up here \nChampionship runners, and race average speeds and lap \nrecords climbed by some 2mph in both 500 and  750cc cat- \negories, which were won by Klaus Enders (BMW) from \nSiegfried Schauzu (BMW). \n~   Winner of the  Senior race and its accompanying £1,000 \nwas Jack Findlay on  his  two-stroke, water-cooled Suzuki, \nwhich came with an  output of 75bhp to  make it  go  and \ntriple disc brakes with which to  stop. Closest challengers \nMick Grant and Tony Rutter, on  over-bored Yamahas, both \nslipped off in  Ramsey without injury. To  Grant went the \nfastest lap at  104.41mph. Second place went to  Peter Wil- \nliams with a race average speed of 100.62mph on  his Arter- \nMatchless, fitted with six-speed gearbox, disc brakes and \ncast \nalloy \nwheels. \nIt \nwas \nthe \nfirst \ntime \na \nBritish \nsingle \nhad \nset \na \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nof \n100mph \nat \nthe \nTT \nsince \nthe \ngreat \nMike \nHailwood \ndid \nso \nback \nin \n1961. \nSenior \nwinner \nJack \nFindlay \nhad \nmade \nnews \nearlier \nin \nthe \nseason \nby \nwinning \na \nContinental \nGP \non \na \ntreadless \nslick \ntyre, \nbut \nsuch \nrubber \nwas \nnot \nyet \nready \nfor \nthe \ndemands \nof \nthe \nMountain \nCourse. \nSo \nfinished \na \nTT \nwhere, \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nin \nover \ntwenty \nF   \nyears, \nthe \nonly \nMV \nAgusta \ntaking \npart \nwas \nthe \nrescue \nhelicopter. \nA \nfew \npeople \npretended \nthe  \nstars \nhad \nnot  \nbeen \nTROUBLED TIMES @   113 \nmissed, but although the  racing was keen, ev eryone likes to \nsee  the best riders in  action. Unfortunately, ihe only inter- \nest  some of those stars retained in  the  TT  was  to  snipe at  it \nfrom the  sidelines while casting covetous eyes on  what was \nnow one  of the  richest race meetings in Europe. \nMORETIME SAVED \nThe roads of the  Mountain Course continued to  receive \nimprovement. In  1973 resurfacing and bump-easing work \nwas carried out  through Laurel Bank to  Glen Helen, plus \nslight beneficial realignment at  Sarah’s Cottage. The effect \nof those was to  increase speed over the  combined bends of \nthat tricky section —  for those with sufficient skills. Further \nlengths of fencing were set  back on  the  Mountain, while, \nas  straight-line speeds continued to  increase, riders lived in \nhope that one day the  bumps would be  taken out  of Sulby \nStraight. \nIMPROVED YAMAHAS \nAlready dominant in  the  smaller classes of world racing, \nYamaha formally marketed an  air-cooled 125cc production \nrace bike in  1973, the TA125, putting out  24bhp. However, \nwhat really got the racing world excited was  the upgrading \nof what had become their TD3 and TR3 250  and  350 racers \nwith water-cooling and a little more power to create the TZ \ngeneration of racers. The TZ250 was  now said to give 48bhp \nat  10,500rpm and the TZ350 yielded 60bhp at  10,000rpm. \nNew six-speed gearboxes helped them towards maximum \nspeeds of 139  and 149mph. Those machines were to extend \nYamaha’s already huge influence on  racing, with the  350, \nin only slightly over-bored form, able to  challenge for wins \nin  the  bigger classes. Each bike came with with an  exten- \nsive spares kit  comprising barrels, pistons, crankshaft and \nso  on, for  unlike the old British single-cylinder racers, \nthey could not  be run for a  season without replacement of \nmajor components. Buyers found that performance came \nat  a  price and many were augmenting the  spares kit  with \nthe  purchase of further replacement parts well before the \nseason end. In  1974 the TZ750 went on  public sale. It was, \nin effect, a doubled-up 350  and was said to give over 90bhp \nat  10,000rpm in the state of tune in which it was  marketed \n—  which was below its maximum. \n1974: SUPERBIKES \nAway from racing, in  the  wider world of motorcycling, \ngrowing use  was being made of the  term ‘Superbikes’ in \nregard to  products from the  likes of Kawasaki, Norton, \nTriumph, BMW, Ducati, Honda, Moto Guzzi, MV Agusta \nand Yamaha, for  all  were producing road-going models \nto  support the  growing demand for  large-capacity sport- \n\n114 TROUBLED TIMES \ning  motorcycles. Perhaps to  reflect this, the  upper limit \nin  the  Production race was increased for  1974 from 750 \nto  1000cc. There was certainly plenty of scope for  variety \namong the  ‘Proddies’, although many preferred the  faster, \nnoisier and  more race-oriented models previously found in \nthe  Formula 750 race, which, perhaps to  recognize its  less \nrestrictive specification, was now named the  Open For- \nmula 750 Classic. \nOn the organizational front, additional contributions \nwere made towards riders’ expenses in  1974, and the  ACU \nbecame more selective about acceptance of entries. This \nmeant that some who had  previously entered just for  a  fast \nrun  around the  course had  their entries returned. \nSPEEDS \nThere were plenty of speedy laps set  during practice for \nthe 1974 TT, with ton-up ones now routinely expected \nfrom top runners in the  larger classes; well over fifty were \nrecorded in  practice week. Speed trap figures from The \nHighlander gave a  wide range of figures across each class, \nbut the  fastest were: \nMick Grant rides 750cc ‘Slippery Sam’ to  another TT  win in the  Production 1000cc race of  1974. \nUltra Lightweight 125cc — 128mph Yamaha \nLightweight 250cc 140mph Yamaha \nJunior 350cc 140mph Yamaha \nSenior 500cc 156mph Suzuki \nF750 Classic 156mph Yamaha \nSidecar 500cc 130mph Busch Spezial \nSidecar 750cc 136mph BMW \nWhile top capacity in the  Production race was now 1000cc, \ntop speed captured was only 132mph, with 130mph for the \nbest 500cc and 112  for  the  best 250cc. It would seem that \nthey did not  catch the 1,000cc Proddies at  their fastest, nor \ndid they time any of the quicker 350 race bikes, who should \nhave been over the  140mph quoted above. \nCome the racing and the winner's race average speed \nin  the Production 1000 class was 99.72mph, which was \njust below the previous best of  100.07mph. The winning \nmachine was ‘Slippery Sam’, the 750cc Triumph Trident, \nwhich in  1974 was ridden by Mick Grant to  its  fourth TT \nwin and his first. With a wrist in plaster, he finished ahead of \nthe 1000cc BMW twins of Helmut Dahne and Hans-Otto \n\nButenuth. \nKeith \nMartin \n(Kawasaki) \nwas  \nfirst \n500cc \nhome, \nsetting \na \nnew \nrecord \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nof \n93.85mph, \nand \nMartyn \nSharpe \n(Yamaha) \nwas \nthe \nfirst \n250cc, \nlifting \nthe \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nfor \nhis \nclass \nto  \n86.94mph. \nMick \nGrant \nlater \nwrote \nof \nSlippery \nSam: \n‘I \nsuspect \nit \nwas \nalso \nas legal \nas \na \nbent \ncopper \n— \na \nreal \nfactory \nspecial \nfull \nof \nbits \nthat \nappeared \nin \nofficial \nTriumph \nparts \nlists \nbut \nwere \nunavailable \nto \nJoe \nPublic \nat any \nprice.’ \nA  BMW was to  the fore in  the Sidecar 750cc race, \nwhere Siegfried Schauzu raised the race average speed \nby over 3mph, leaving it  at  96.59mph, after Rolf Stein- \nhausen (Konig) set a new lap record from a standing start of \n98.18mph. That was an  incredible Smph faster than before, \nbut Steinhausen’s two-stroke did  not  finish the race. Heinz \nLuthringshauser also rode BMW to  win the  Sidecar 500cc \nrace, from rising star George O’Dell on  his  Konig. It was \ninteresting to  see  O’Dell’s Konig followed by Weslake, \nYamaha, BSA and Honda-powered outfits. Seemingly, the \n500cc BMW’s long-term supremacy was under threat, but \nit had been a wonderful run. \nThe Ultra Lightweight and Junior races took place in \ngood conditions and  Clive Horton (Yamaha) was  first 125 \nhome at  88.44mph. It was this class that still had  the  big- \ngest gap to  close on  the existing record race average speed, \nwhich stood to Phil Read at 99.12mph. Fastest 350 was  Tony \nRutter (Yamaha), whose race average speed of 104.44mph \nwas  very close to Agostini’s record of 104.78mph, and Chas \nMortimer’s fastest lap of  106.39mph was within sight of \nMike Hailwood’s record 350cc lap of 107.73mph. Clearly, \nthe new water-cooled Yamahas came with sufficient speed \nto  challenge the  records set  by former works machines, \nalthough there was no  opportunity to  prove that in  the \nLightweight 250 race, for  wet conditions slowed Charlie \nWilliams’ (Yamaha) race average winning speed to just over \n90mph. Anyone lucky enough to  be  racing a  true works \nYamaha racer, a  YZR250 or  350, would have noticeably \nmore power in a bike that was  much lighter than a standard \nproduction TZ  model. \nThe 1974 Senior TT  lost its  customary Friday slot in \nthe  race programme to  the  Open Formula 750cc Classic \nrace and was scheduled for  Wednesday. However, poor \nweather saw  it moved to Thursday and reduced to five  laps, \nwhen it was  won by Phil  Carpenter (Yamaha) at 96.99mph. \nSuzuki’s new 4-cylinder RG500s appeared in the  Senior in \nthe  hands of Jack Findlay and  Paul Smart, but  did  not  last \nthe  distance. Conditions were slightly better for  Friday’s \nFormula \n750 \nrace, \nwhere \ninitial \nrain \ngave \nway \nto \ndrying \nroads. \nBut \nthe \nexpected \nbig-bike \nbonanza \nwas \nspoiled \n(for \nsome) \nby \nover-bored \nYamaha \nTZ350s, \nwhich \ntook \nthe \nfirst \nthree \nplaces \nin \nthe \nhands \nof \nChas \nMortimer, \nChar- \nTROUBLED TIMES MP  115 \nlie  Williams and  Tony Rutter, at  an  average race speed of \n100.52mph. Best four-stroke was  the Triumph of Percy Tait \nin fourth place. \nSo  ended an  interesting TT, although one in  which the \nsolo classes were dominated by the  sight, sound and  smell \nof  Yamaha two-strokes. A  similar situation prevailed in \nthe  wider world of racing and  attracted a  mixed response, \nleaving race followers wondering if the  company should be \nseen as  saviours of racing, or  as  wreckers, particularly as \nthey now had  new 4-cylinder works YZ500 and  TZ750cc \nmachines, which they intended to  make available to  pri- \nvateers, a  few of the  750s already being in  the  hands of \nfavoured riders. \nMORETHAN POWER \nWhile machines of the  early 1970s had  been gaining more \npower, there were other important factors that helped rid- \ners  reduce the  time they took to  do a lap of the TT  course. \nRace tyres were under continual development from the \nprincipal suppliers, Dunlop and  Michelin, with most types \nnow available in  differing compounds and tread patterns, \nwith the  trend being for  them to  get  ‘stickier’. Those sup- \nplied for Tourist Trophy races were still expected to  last for \na full  six-lap 226-mile race. \nJack Findlay is quoted on  a  Michelin website as  saying \nthat he used slicks while racing on  the  Island in  1974. This \noccurred during practice and  was not  too  well received by \nthe  organizers. Initially experimental, more riders tried \nthem in  1975 and  in  1976 Chas Mortimer won the  Junior \nrace on  a  Yamaha fitted with a  rear slick. Mick Grant was \nalso an  early user and  later described them as  ‘probably the \nbiggest single leap in  grip in  the  history of motorcycling’. \nInitially made just for the  rear, the  suppliers soon came up \nwith versions for the front. \nLike many major advances, there was  a price to  pay  for \nthe increased grip and, as  well as  the fact that riders had  to \nadjust their style to  suit  them, the new tyres also made the \nsuspension work harder. Both riders and  machines had  to \nadapt to  suit the  tyres. It was also a period when TT  races \nstill ran  in the rain, over wet  roads. Slicks were not  suitable \nfor use  in the wet, but there were no  such things as  full wets \nat  the  time and  tyres used in wet conditions were of road- \ntreaded type, built with racing compounds and  carcases. \nThe TT  organizers were initially against the  introduc- \ntion of slick tyres, mostly on  the  grounds that they could \nnot determine when they were worn. Steps were taken to \nhave them banned at the  TT, but that did  not  occur. How- \never, the  ensuing years were to  see  increased specialization \nin  the  world of tyres, which in  the  longer run was not  all \ngood for TT  racing. \n\n116 TROUBLED TIMES \nMost machines still ran  telescopic front forks and twin \nrear suspension units, with the  former becoming larger in \nfork-stanchion diameter and offering an  increasing range of \nadjustments. Rear units were now available with a  range of \nsprings, and  could be gas- or  oil-filled. \nDrum brakes were gradually giving way to  discs to  help \nstopping and this brought further changes to fork legs, upon \nwhich front-brake calipers were normally mounted. \nAll these changes interacted with one  another and  manu- \nfacturers tried to  develop machines in  a  balanced manner, \nalthough, inevitably, one feature often had more impact \nthan another. With the  above improvements combining to \ncreate better racing motorcycles, it  was no  surprise that \nTT  lap times were reducing and  thus lap speeds increasing, \nalthough perhaps not  quite as  rapidly as  might have been \nexpected. \nMajor changes for  1975 were that the  Ultra Lightweight \n125cc race was  dropped, and the  Production race became a \nten-lap affair for  1000 and  500cc machines and nine laps for \nthe 250s, with each bike ridden by a team of two riders. The \n750cc Sidecar race now became the 1000cc Sidecar race \nand the  Formula 750 race also had its  capacity increased \nand  became the  Classic 1000cc race, with machines from \n300cc eligible to  take part. Some know the  latter race as \nthe  Open Classic. \nThe above reflected the fact that most manufactur- \ners’ flagship roadsters had been growing in  capacity and, \nincreasingly, that was where TT race bikes were being \nderived from —  production models. \nThe TT  still counted towards the  World Championship \nin  its  relevant classes, but  rumblings about it  losing that \nstatus were getting louder and there seemed an  inevitability \nabout the  outcome. \nRECORDS \nNo  records were set  in  the  traditional Senior 500, Junior \n350 and Lightweight 250cc race classes in  1975, where \nwins went to  Mick Grant (Kawasaki), Charlie Williams \nThe \ncolourful \ngreen-and-white \ncombination \nof \nMick \nGrant \nand \nhis  \n3-cylinder \n500cc \nKawa \nin  \n1975. \n\n(Yamaha) \nand  \nChas \nMortimer \n(Yamaha). \nHowever, \nreminis- \ncent \nof \nthe \nformer \ndays \nof  \nNorton, \nYamaha’s \ncurrent \ndomi- \nnation \nwas \ndemonstrated \nby \nthe  \nfirst \nthirty-three \nfinishers \nin \nthe \nJunior \nand \nthe \nfirst \nforty-four \nin \nthe \nLightweight \nall \nbeing \non \nthe \nJapanese \ntwo-strokes. \nIn \nthe \nSenior, \nMick \nGrant \non \nhis \nKawasaki \nKR \n500 \ntriple \nhad \nthe \nbike \nseize \nearly \non \nthe \nfirst \nlap, \nbut \ncontinued \nat \nreduced \npace. \nWith \nothers \nfalling \nby \nthe \nwayside, \nthis \nwas \nenough \nto \ngive \nhim \nthe \nwin. \nThe \nKawasaki \nwas \nfollowed \nhome \nby \na \ndozen \nYamahas, \nbefore \nthe \ntrusty \nMatchless \nof \nDavid \nHughes \nin \nthirteenth \nplace \nand \nsimilarly \nmounted \nSelwyn \nGriffiths \nin \nfifteenth. \nTaking Slippery Sam to  yet another Production TT  vic- \ntory, the pairing of  Dave Croxford and Alex George did grab \na  new lap record, when George circulated at  102.82mph. \nCharlie Williams and Eddie Roberts rode a  Honda to  vic- \ntory in  the 500cc class, while Chas Mortimer and Billy \nGuthrie (Yamaha) were first riders home on  a  250. \nBiggest news on  the speed front from the 1975 TT \nwas that Mick Grant broke the  absolute course record of \n108.77mph, set  by Mike Hailwood back in  1967. Riding \nhis  3-cylinder, water-cooled Kawasaki two-stroke, Grant \ncompleted the second lap  of  the Classic 1000cc race at \n109.82mph to become the fastest man around the Mountain \nCourse. The Kawasaki snapped its chain on  the next lap and \nit was John Williams who took victory on  his  Yamaha, at \na  race average speed of  105.33mph, just short of the  race \nrecord, \nClaimed to  be  giving 110bhp, Grant’s KR 750 Kawa- \nsaki was reckoned to  be prone to  chain trouble, caused by \nthe  flexing of its  engine in  its  rubber mounts. While he \nwas pleased to  have broken Mike Hailwood’s absolute lap \nrecord, Grant acknowledged that he was  on  a 750  that was \nfitted with disc brakes and  running on  slick tyres and  that \nthe  breaking of Hailwood’s record was  long overdue. \nSidecars had  changed enormously since the  mid-1950s, \nwhen BMWs had  started to  monopolize the  winning posi- \ntions. They were now low, streamlined, kneeler machines, \nemploying various forms of hub-centre style steering, rather \nthan telescopic forks, and  with little suspension movement \nat  the  rear. They used a  variety of power sources, includ- \ning \nsome \nadapted \nfrom \nmarine \nengines, \nwhich \ngave \nover \n80bhp \nin \n500cc \nform, \nwith \nlarger \nversions \noffering \ncon- \nsiderably \nmore. \nAll \nthis \nwas \nconveyed \nto \nthe \nroad \nthrough \nwide-section \nracing \ntyres \non \nsmall \nwheels, \nusually \n7.00 \nx \n13 \non \nthe \nfront \nand \n9.00 \nX \n13 \non \nthe \nrear. \nThe \nfat \nrear \ntyres \nand \nextra \nweight \nof \nan \n‘outfit’ \nput \nadditional \nstresses \non \ntransmissions, \nwhile \nthe \nminimal \nsuspension \ngave \na \njar- \nring \nride \nthat \ntested \noverall \nbuild \nquality \non \nthe \nstill \nbumpy \nMountain Course. \nTROUBLED TIMES ME  117 \nIn  1975, victory in  the  500cc Sidecar race went to  Rolf \nSteinhausen on  a  Busch-Konig at  a  record race average \nspeed of 95.94mph, with a  new record fastest lap going \nto  second-placed Mac Hobson (Yamaha) at  96.71mph. It \nwas a  year when there were few BMWs entered in  either \nthe 500 or  1000cc Sidecar races, but multi-TT winner \nSiegfried Schauzu gave the  marque what was to  be its  final \nTT  victory when he  won the  big class at  record-breaking \nspeed. ‘Siggy’ lifted the  race average to  97.55mph and  the \nlap speed to  99.31mph. It was a  final flourish from BMW \nthat fell just 10  seconds short of the  first 100mph lap bya \nthree-wheeler, but  left  a target for the  ever more powerful \nmachines that were to  follow. \n1976: MORE RECORDS BROKEN \nBetween the 1975 and 1976 TT  meetings, several speed- \nrestricting curves on  the  stretch between Braddan Bridge \nand Union Mills were eased. Known locally as  Snugbor- \nough, the  road-straightening saved riders a  few  seconds on \ntheir lap times. \nThe Sidecar races again saw advances in  speed in  1976, \nalthough their absolute lap record remained at  just under \n100mph, with Mac Hobson (Yamaha) setting a  new figure \nof 99.96mph on  his way to  winning the  1,000cc race. Sieg- \nfried Schauzu lifted the  500cc Sidecar record to  97.50mph \nafter troublesome early laps, although the win went to  Rolf \nSteinhausen (Konig). \nIn  the Production race, postponed from Saturday to \nTuesday, BMW got their first solo TT win  since 1939, when \nHelmut Dahne and Hans- Otto Butenuth came home first in \nthe  1000cc class, where a new lap record of 103.13mph was \nset  by Roger Nicholls on  a  twin-cylinder Ducati. The Pro- \nduction TT  was a  strange form of handicap race, in  which \nthe  record books show that the fastest 250 was actually \ngiven the overall win, at a race pace 10mph slower than the \nfastest 1000cc machine and  having completed one  lap less! \nThe outright lap record of 108.77mph, set  back in  1967, \nwas achieved by Mike Hailwood ona 500cc machine. Mick \nGrant and  his big 750 Kawasaki had  gone faster during the \n1975 Classic 1000 race, but  Hailwood’s record still stood \nfor the  Senior and  had  been relatively unthreatened during \nthe  early 1970s. In  what was a  step-change for  the  Sen- \nior  TT, John Williams lifted both the  absolute and  Senior \nlap record to  a  heady 112.27mph on  his  works-supported \nSuzuki RG500. But  what had  seemed like  a certain victory \ndisappeared after Williams had problems at  Governor’s \nBridge on  the  last lap. The win went to  a  grateful Tom \nHerron ona Yamaha, while Williams pushed in to finish an \nexhausted seventh. \nThe 4-cylinder, water-cooled RG500 two-stroke had \n\n118 TROUBLED TIMES \nbeen around in works and  semi-works form for about three \nyears and was  known to Suzuki as  the XR14. After deciding \nto  switch emphasis from supporting Grand Prix racing via \nSuzuki GB  at  the  end  of 1975, the  parent company recog- \nnized that there was a shortage of 500cc race machinery and \nmade Mk! RG500s available for  sale. The price was about \n£6,000 and they were snapped up by privateers. Coming \ninitially with some 95bhp, the  RG500 was  much developed \nin all areas during the next eight years, offering opposition \nto  Yamaha and  proving the  mainstay of the  500cc class. \nRecords in the Junior class had also been under threat in \nrecent years, particularly from the top men on  TZ350s, and \nin  1976 Agostini’s race record and Hailwood’s lap record \nfor  the  class were both broken, the  former falling to  race \nwinner Chas Mortimer (Yamaha) at  106.78mph and the \nlatter being taken by second-place Tony Rutter (Yamaha) \nat  a  speed of  108.69mph. World Championship contend- \ners  Takazumi Katayama and  John Ekerold both tried their \nhands as  TT  newcomers in  1976, gaining very satisfactory \nresults of fourth and sixth in the  Senior, plus a splendid sec- \nond place for Katayama in the Lightweight. Also making his \nTT debut in that Junior race was  Joey Dunlop. With a start \nnumber of 65, he finished in sixteenth position. \nFriday’s Lightweight and  Classic 1000cc races were post- \nponed until Saturday due to  poor weather and, as  usual, \nthis meant crowds of disappointed spectators leaving the \nIsland rather than run  the  risk of not  being able to  get later \nboat bookings. \nHailwood’s race average record speed of 103.07mph was \nstill waiting to be broken in the Lightweight TT.  In what had \n\nbecome \nan  \nage  \nof \nscreaming \ntwo-strokes, \nthe  \nformer \nbark \nof \nfour-strokes \ngenerated \nfond \nmemories, \nparticularly \nso  \nin \nthe  \ncase \nof \nthe \nrasping \n250cc \nHonda-six \non \nwhich \nHailwood \nhad \nset \nhis \nfigure \nback \nin \n1967. \n. \nHowever, \nthe \nmarch \nof \nYamahas \nthrough \nracing \nwas \nirresistible \nand \nTom \nHerron \ngrabbed \na \nnew \nrace \nrecord \nof \n103.55mph \nto \ntake \nthe \nLightweight \n250 \nrace. \nBill \nIvy’s \nlap \nrecord \nof \n105.51mph \nremained \nintact. \nThoughts that the Classic 1000 race \nmight raise the  absolute record were not \nfulfilled, although John Williams did get a \nwin, this time on  his Suzuki TR750-3, lift- \ning both race average and lap record speeds \nto  108.18 and 110.21mph. Such speed \nincreases brought heavy fuel consump- \ntion. It was a time when the TT permitted \nowners to  provide their own quick-action \nfillers, something Suzuki must have been \nparticularly glad to  have available. \nThe 1976 TT  had produced a record- \nbreaking race week across six of the event’s \nnine classes, and there was a feeling that \nthe  quality production race bikes now available would see \ncontinued advance in speeds. Yamaha were still developing \ntheir smaller racers. Their new TZ250 and 350 C range \nbikes came with an  additional 2—4bhp, monoshock rear \nsuspension and disc brakes all  round. Claimed advantages \nfrom use of  a  monoshock were longer travel to  absorb \nbumps and keep the rear wheel on  the ground, a wide range \nof adjustment and an  overall improvement in handling. The \nopportunity was also taken to  redesign the  TZ  frames. \nWith improved performance in  the important fields \nof power, handling and stopping, plus changes to  riding \nstyles, faster laps looked inevitable. But perhaps reflect- \nTROUBLED TIMES MP  119 \nThe new frame for  the TZ-C series, with monoshock rear suspension. \ning the  relative lack of competition in  the  Senior class, its \nfastest laps progressed only slowly through the  late 1960s \nand  early 1970s, starting at  107.07mph in  1966 and  finish- \ning at  112.27mph in  1976, after a  spurt in  the  last  couple \nof years. \nRegrettably, not  all was well in the  world of TT  racing, \nfor  it was known that in  the  months ahead, the  FIM were \nyet again going to  review the  event’s World Championship \nstatus. Whatever was decided, what they could not  take \naway was the  atmosphere, camaraderie and excitement of \nthe true road racing, which was shared by thousands of TT \nenthusiasts on  their annual visits to  the  Isle  of Man. \n\nPAPA E Reso EvelaiN \nA  NEW ERA \nAt  the  end of  1976 the  FIM announced that the  Tourist \nTrophy races would no  longer count towards the  World \nChampionships. The news came as  no  surprise, for  the \ninfluential star riders who wanted to  race only on  artificial \ntracks were determined to take the sport away from natural \nroad circuits, both on  the Isle  of  Man  and on  the Continent. \nWith the decision made, riders could decide which element \nof the sport they would compete in.  Many were happy to do \nboth, but for those of a  single mind-set the  FIM’s decision \nconfirmed the  parting of the  ways. The gulf between the \ntwo could hardly have been made clearer with the news that \nBritain’s round of the World Championships would now be \nheld at  the  flat, featureless, former airfield of Silverstone. \nA greater contrast with the  TT’s Mountain Course could \nhardly be imagined. \nMuch was  written about the future of the Tourist Trophy \nraces in  early 1977, one  magazine headline encapsulating \nthe thoughts of many by asking, ‘Waterloo or  Watershed?’ \nPessimists forecast that the  loss of World Championship \nstatus signified the  beginning of the  end for  Island racing, \nwhile optimists regarded it as  the start of a new era. In sup- \nport of riders, the race budget was  increased to  £150,000, \nwith £100,000 going for  start and prize money, while \nto  make the  event more attractive to  visitors, the  Island \nworked hard to  create additional attractions at  TT  time. \n1977: RACE PROGRAMME \nThe 350cc race was dropped for  1977. Previously known \nas  the  Junior TT, that title was now given to  the  three- \nlap race for  250cc machines, which had been known as  the \nLightweight TT  since 1920. Someone, somewhere, prob- \nably knew the  reason for the  change of name, but race fans \nsaw no  logic in  the  decision. The Production TT  was also \ndropped. A  former winner in  that event, journalist Ray \nKnight, felt that it had lost its way, ‘due to convoluted rules \nthat permitted manufacturers to build any bike to a specifi- \ncation especially written by themselves for the  race’. \nReplacing the Proddies came four-lap races for  new \nclasses of  TT FormulaI, TT Formula II and TT Formula III. \nThey catered for road-based sports machines on which fairly \nextensive alterations could be made to  boost performance. \nFour-strokes were encouraged by giving them a  capacity \nadvantage over two-strokes and Formula races went on  to \ndevelop their own limited World Championship. \nOther changes for 1977 saw the 500cc Sidecar race \ndropped and new two-leg races created for  up  to  1000cc \nmachines. Each would be  of four laps, with an  individual \nwinner plus an  overall winner based on  the  best results \nfrom the  two legs. \nA four-lap Jubilee TT race was  also in the programme, in \nrecognition of Queen Elizabeth’s Silver Jubilee. \nYAMAHA \nEarly in  1977 Yamaha announced it would supply a  batch \nof new race machines to  Britain via sporting dealers. There \nwould be forty TZ250s, forty-eight TZ350s and five  OW31 \nTZ750s. It claimed they were being marketed on  a  sub- \nsidized basis with the  250 charged at  £2,709, the  350 at \n£2,884 and the  750 a  substantial £6,572. Before produc- \ntion of Norton single-cylinder race bikes stopped in 1962, a \nrider could buy a new Manx for £572. However, the OW31 \nwas ahead of its  rivals in  performance, so  it was the  bike \neveryone wanted, though few obtained, for  only seventy \nwere available to  satisfy worldwide demand in  1977. \nThe names of those who would ride the  new Yamahas \nwere publicized and  many of them were TT regulars, with \nmost being dealer-supported. The one-year-old models \nthey discarded would be eagerly sought after by those fur- \nther down the  chain, while riders of older machines who \ncould not  afford to  change bikes would seek more speed by \nupgrading with later parts, if they fitted. \nWith the TT races full of Yamahas, the demand for spares \nwas  always high and specialist dealers would be on the Island \nwith \nthe \nfull \nrange \nto \nkeep \ncompetitors \nmobile. \nThe \ncom- \nbined \ndistance \ncovered \nin \npractice \nand \nracing \nmeant \nthat \nthe \nTT \nwas \na \nhigh-mileage \nevent \nfor \nrace \nmachinery, \nand \nas \nmany \nmajor \ncomponents \nwere \ngood \nfor \nonly \na \nrelatively \nsmall \nnumber \nof \nracing \nmiles, \nit \nwas \nan \nexpensive \nbusiness \nto \nkeep \na \nbike \nin \ntop \norder. \nDespite \nthe \nexpense, \nthe \nmagic \nof \nthe \nTT \ncontinued \nto \nattract \nriders \nin \nlarge \nnumbers. \n\nHONDA \nBig news in  1977 was that Honda were returning to  the  TT \nwith a  works machine in  the  Formula I race and that Phil \nRead would be returning to ride it.  Looking for a profitable \nTT meeting, Read also put together an  RG500 to  use, with \ncomponents gathered from several sources. In  the  wider \nworld of racing, that model was now on  its  Mk2 and  Mk3 \nversions and gradually giving more power as  Suzuki devel- \noped it year on  year. \nPhil Read’s return to the TT was  not  universally popular. \nIndeed, it  attracted strong anti-Read feelings, with some \ncommentators \nexpressing \nthe \nopinion \nthat \nappearance \nmoney \npaid \nto \nhim \ncould \nhave \nbeen \nbetter \nused \non \nothers. \nThere \nwere \nno \nfigures \nmade \npublic, \nbut \nan \nACU \nspokes- \nman \nwas \nforced \nto \ndampen \nsome \nof \nthe \nwilder \nappearance \nPhil Read, on  his  return to  the TT  in  1977, speeds through Union Mills on  his  big Honda. \nmoney claims by announcing that his  fee  ‘was less  than half \nof the  £10,000 being spoken of’. By comparison, one of \nthe  top  sidecar men, George O’Dell, claimed he  received \n£500. \nIn  a  move that echoed Ray Knight’s earlier comments \non  problems with Proddie race regulations and one that \naroused widespread cries of  ‘fiddle’, Honda arranged for \nthe  last-minute homologation of larger carburettors for  its \nFormula I 4-cylinder, four-stroke racer. \nTHE COURSE \nA  competitor on  a  pre-practice reconnaissance lap noted \nnew road surfacing through Union Mills, but said, ‘this \nvery smooth half-mile of road only emphasizes how rough \nthe  rest of the course is’.  The approach to  Ramsey had  been \n\n122 M@  A  NEW ERA \nsurface-dressed with tar  and  chippings some weeks before, \nbut not all had bedded and practice saw  competitors return- \ning to the Paddock with broken screens, while others com- \nplained of being peppered with chippings when close on  the \nback wheel of another rider. \nRACING \nThe 1977 TT  got  under way with Junior 250cc and TT \nFormula I races run  in less than ideal conditions and at rela- \ntively low speeds. Charlie Williams notched another win \nin  the  Junior race dominated by Yamahas, where in  the \neternal quest for an  advantage over similar-powered oppo- \nsition, several riders were using Seeley, Maxton and  Spon- \ndon frames to  house their Yamaha engines. After making \nthe  big decision to  return to  the  TT, Honda were pleased \nto  see  Phil Read first home in  the  shortened TT  Formula \nI race, some 40 seconds ahead of Roger Nicholls (Ducati). \nActing as  one of the  race scrutineers and thus getting a \nclose-up view of the bikes, Tim Stevens later described the \ninteresting Formula I entry: \nGeorge \nO’Dell \nalways \nsought \nthe \nbest \nrace \nmachinery \nand \nwith \nit \nearned \na \nSidecar \nTT \nwin \nFk \nHere are  riders and motorcycles from all  over the  world \nwith V-twins, parallel twins, and flat twins, with \n120-degree threes and 180-degree threes, with in-line \nfours and a flat four, with shaft drive and chain drive, with \ntelescopic forks and leading links, swinging forks and paral- \nlelograms, with pushrods, single and double overhead cam- \nshafts driven by chains, bevel gears and belts. \nFormula I] and Formula III races ran  together with less vari- \nety  of machines entered, and  wins went to  Alan Jackson \n(Honda) and  John Kidson (Honda), the  four-stroke Hon- \ndas  showing greater reliability than the  many two-stroke \nYamahas in the race. \nIt was  Phil Read who again showed his class to win Mon- \nday’s 500cc Senior race at  record-breaking speeds on  his \nSuzuki, from Tom Herron and Eddie Roberts. The race was \nshortened by a  lap due  to  incoming rain and  mist, but  not \nbefore Read had taken advantage of the dry start and raised \nthe  lap record to  110.01mph and  the  race average speed to \n106.97mph. \nee SSS \nWorld Championship. \n\nRecords \nwere \nalso \nbroken \nin \nSidecar \nrace \nA.  \nDick \nGrea- \nsley \n(Yamaha) \nset \nthe \npace \nwith \nthe \nfirst \nton-up \nlap \non \nthree \nwheels, \nrecording \n100.59mph, \nbut \nit \nwas \nGeorge \nO'Dell \n(Yamaha) \nwho \nthen \ngot \ninto \nhis \nstride, \nlifting \nthe \nlap \nrecord \nto \n102.80mph \nand \nfinishing \nwith \na \nrecord \nrace \n. \naverage \nspeed \nof \n100.03mph. \nO’Dell \nwas \na \nhard \ncharger \non \nhis \nYamaha-powered \noutfit, \nleaving \nblack \nlines \non \nthe \nroad \nunder \nboth \nbraking \nand \nacceleration. \nThe \npace \nwas \nonly \na \nlittle \nslower \na \ncouple \nof \ndays \nlater \nin \nSidecar \nrace \nB, \nwhere \nMac \nHobson \n(Yamaha) \nwon \nat \n99.74mph \nfrom \nRolf \nBiland \n(Yamaha), \nwith \nfirst \nrace \nwinner \nO’Dell \ncharging \na \nbit \ntoo \nhard \nat \nthe \nBungalow \nand \nbreaking \nhis \nleg. \nTwo \nthird \nplaces \nfor \nRolf \nSteinhausen \n(Busch \nKonig) \nsaw \nhim \ntake \nthe \noverall \nSidecar \nvictory. \nThe \nraces \nwere \nnotable \nfor \nthe \nway \nin \nwhich \nYamaha \ntwo-stroke \nengines \nwere \nbecoming \nthe \npower \nunit \nof \nchoice \nfor \nmany \nof \nthe \nthree-wheeler \ncrews, \nalthough \nthey \nwere \nexpensive \nto \nrun, \nneeding \nreplacement \nparts \nat \neven \nmore \nfrequent \nintervals \nthan \nsolos. \nOutfits \nwere \nalso \ngetting \nlonger \nand \nlower, \nwith \nwishbone \nforms \nof \nsuspension \nat \nfront \nand \nrear, \ndisc \nbrakes, \nhuge \nradiators, \nwide \ntyres, \nlimited \nsteering \nlock \nand \nseveral \nforms \nof \nchassis. \nBack in  1960 Sidecars had returned to  race over the \nMountain Course, when winner Helmut Fath’s race aver- \nage speed was 84.10mph on  his  500cc BMW. The climb in \nspeed to George O’Dell’s 100.03mph average in  1977 came \nmostly from a lift in  capacity to  1000cc and  much change \nin machine design. \nHopes of a  hat-trick of solo wins by Phil Read in  1977 \nwere ruined by  an  open-road crash while testing one \nof his  race bikes. It  was an  incident that brought him a \ndamaged shoulder and a  court appearance. It  also meant \nthat he  missed the Classic 1000cc race, worth £6,000 \nto  the winner. Happy to  take the win was Mick Grant \n(Kawasaki), at  a  new record race average speed for  the \nclass of 110.76mph and a lap record of 112.77mph. Those \nspeeds would turn out to be the fastest of the week. Grant’s \nbig-triple Kawasaki was followed home by the smaller \nYamahas of  Charlie Williams and Eddie Roberts, after \nAmerican Pat Hennen (Suzuki) dropped out of second place \non  the  fifth lap. \nCome the  invitation Jubilee TT  race there was a first \nwin for Joey Dunlop on  a Yamaha TZ750 hybrid, at  a  race \nspeed of 108.86mph and  fastest lap of 110.93mph, which \nput him well up with the fastest men around the  Mountain \nCourse. \nSeemingly \nnot \nrated \nby \nthe \norganizers, \nDunlop \nwas \nallocated \nriding \nnumber \n30 \nin \nthe \nrace, \nso \nhad \nto \ncope \nwith \nplenty \nof \ntraffic. \nIn \naddition, \nconcerns \nabout \ntyre \nwear \nlate \nin \nthe \nrace \nsaw \nhim \nstop \nin \nRamsey \nto \ninspect \nhis \ntreaded \nrear \none \nbefore \nracing \nacross \nthe \nlast \n14 \nmiles \nof \nabrasive \nA  NEW ERA @   123 \nRENOLD \nEXTRA \nSTRENGTH <  | \nMOTORCYCLE CHAIN | \nye 25% Extra strength E \n% Thicker, heat-treated \nsideplates with exclusive \n___   Renold keyed bushes \n% Renold quality — \nrace proved by  today’s \ntop riders \nwe International standard \né’  pitch chain \n+ A SUPER chain for \nSUPERBIKE maximum \nperformance \nMORE T.T.

No  one  knew at  the \ntime that Joey Dunlop would go  on  to  win twenty-five \nmore TT  races and lift his personal best lap speed from his \nJubilee-winning 110.93mph to  over 123mph. \n1978: EVEN BETTER \nIts  first year in  non-World Grand Prix Championship for- \nmat  had been a good one  for the TT, but  1978 was  to be even \nbetter, for while Phil Read’s comeback in  1977 had sparked \ninterest, the  news that Mike Hailwood was to  return in \n1978 really set  imaginations alight. The current generation \nof racegoers would have been aware of Hailwood’s long TT \nhistory and that he took three record-breaking victories on \nhis last TT  appearance in  1967. However, it was only natu- \nral that most of them doubted that he could deliver anything \nlike that sort of form eleven years later. \nTT fans of  an  earlier generation could hardly believe \nthey were going to  have the  chance to  see  the  star of their \nyounger days back in action on  the Mountain Course. They \n\n124 A  NEW ERA \nPadgetts provided Mike Hailwood with a Yamaha to  film a  lap of the Mountain Course during the 1977 MGP —  or  might \nit have been reconnaissance for his 1978 TT return? \ntoo  would have nursed doubts about how he  would per- \nform, for unlike Phil Read, who had been racing at champi- \nonship level on  two-wheels during the whole of his five-year \nabsence from the  TT, Mike Hailwood had  spent his  eleven \nyears away racing cars and  picking up a  troublesome ankle \nin  the  process. In  addition, while he  was coming back to \nmuch the same TT course, the machines he  was to  ride \nwere very different in  terms of power, tyres, suspension, \nbrakes and other parts, all  of which now came with a bat- \ntery of variables in  set-up. This was particularly so  with \nthe suspension, the potential adjustments of which spanned \nareas like preload, spring rate, rebound and compression \ndamping. Could he  really jump on  1978 machinery, fine- \ntune it and then challenge current TT  stars? \nWhat was  in no  doubt was  that the level of interest gener- \nated by Hailwood’s return was phenomenal. The press did \nits bit to fan the flames of that interest and by race week the \nIsland was ‘bursting at  the  seams’. \nTRIUMPH AND TRAGEDY \nMike Hailwood’s last  TT  race in  1967 had  seen him wear- \ning old-style plain black leathers and  boots, with pudding- \nbasin helmet and  goggles. Times had  changed, and  in  1978 \nhis new red and white leathers came splashed with advertis- \ning from major names and his  trademark white, gold and \nred helmet colours were applied to a full-face-version. Mike \nlooked the  part, but the  38-year-old had  to  overcome what \njournalist Ted  Macauley described as  ‘a pack of youngsters \non  thoroughbred machinery, howling after his reputation’. \nRace week opened like a dream for Hailwood’s many fans, \nas  he rode an  unfancied 864cc Ducati to  victory in the  TT \nFormula I race at a record race average speed of 108.51mph \nand a  record fastest lap of  110.62mph. In  a  quality field, \non  a bike that was 20bhp down on  some of the  opposition, \nHailwood just rode away from them, catching and  passing \nPhil Read (Honda) who started 50 seconds in front of him, \nto  win  by 2 minutes from John Williams (Honda). His  last \n\nlap \nwas \na \nhuge \nTT  \nspectacle \nof \nwaving \narms \nand \nfluttering \nprogrammes \nurging \nhim \nto \nthe \nchequered \nflag. \nIt \nwas \nan \nunforgettable \noccasion, \nand \none \nthat \ngenerated \na \nfew \nmoist \neyes. \nDespite what Motorcycle Sport described as \n‘a sparkling cocktail of Yamaha and Martini \nsponsorship’, it was regrettable that a com- \nbination of machine failures, running out  of \npetrol and other mishaps prevented any fur- \nther successes with the  Yamahas he rode in \nother races that week. Even so,  the  crowds \nhad got what they came for, another TT win \nby ‘Mike the  Bike’. \nVictory in  the Senior race, run on  the \nMonday, went to  Tom Herron, who rode \nhis Suzuki RG500 Mk2 at tremendous pace, \nlifting the race average speed from the previ- \nous  best of 106.97mph to  111.74mph. Fast- \nest  lap went to  Pat  Hennen at  113.83mph, \nbut in  pressing to  catch the leader he  fell \nheavily at  Bishopscourt, sustaining injuries \nthat ended his racing career. \nPat Hennen’s accident brought the all- \ntoo-familiar swing of  emotions among TT \nfollowers, from the high of  Hailwood’s \nwin to  the  low of a  top  runner in  hospital \nfighting for  his  life. More bad news was to \nfollow, for  in  Sidecar race A,  the  popular \nMac Hobson crashed his  yellow and black \nYamaha part-way down Bray Hill on  the \nfirst lap and was  killed, along with his passen- \nger  Kenny Birch. Shortly after, in  the  same \nrace, Ernst Trachsel was killed in  another \ncrash at  the  bottom of the  hill. Dick Grea- \nsley’s win at  record speed and Rolf Biland’s \nrecord lap on  his  revolutionary Beo Yamaha \nwere received in subdued fashion after such \ntragedies. \nAs  ever, racing went on, and in  mixed \nweather \nSidecar \nrace \nB \nwas \nwon \nat \nslower \nspeeds \nby \nRolf \nSteinhausen, \nwith \nnewcomer \nJock \nTaylor \ntaking \noverall \nvic- \ntory. \nIn \nboth \nSidecar \nraces, \nwinners \nand \nfastest \nlap \nsetters \nwere powered by Yamaha. \nWhile \nmindful \nof \neverything \nthat \nhad \ngone \non  \nearlier \nin \nthe \nweek, \nriders \nand \nspectators \napproached \nFriday’s \nsix-lap \nClassic \nTT \nin \nexpectation \nof \na \ngreat \nrace. \nThe \nman \nwho \nhelped \nfulfil \nthose \nexpectations \nwas \nMick \nGrant, \nwho \nhurled \nhis \nbig \nKawasaki \ntwo-stroke \naround \nthe \nMountain \nCourse \nto \nachieve \nvictory \nfrom \nJohn \nWilliams \n(Suzuki) \nand \nAfter riding to  victory in the 1978 TT  Formula I race, Mike Hailwood \nA  NEW ERA @  125 \ntakes time to  sign autographs. \nAlex George (Yamaha) at  a new absolute record race aver- \nage speed of 112.41 mph and set  a new absolute lap record of \n114.33mph. Grant wasa professional racer who came up via \nshort-circuit, MGP and TT  racing, but who also raced GPs \nwith success on  Kawasaki 250cc tandem twins. In  talking \nof his preparation for a  worldwide season of racing and  the \narrangements he  made for  sponsorship, start money and \nso  on,  he revealed in his  autobiography Mick Grant —  Takin’ \nthe  Mick that ‘apart from the  TT, prize money was almost \nnegligible’. \n\n126 M@  A  NEW ERA \nWORKS SUPPORT \nThe level of works support received by top riders contest- \ning the TT varied through the  1970s, as  it did in the World \nChampionships. Yamaha had years when they were offering \nsupport and years when they were busy on  development and \nthus could not  give support. Sometimes their support was \ndirect from Japan, sometimes from their European branch \nin Amsterdam, or  from Mitsui in Britain. Usually the  sup- \nport was open and  publicized, but  at  other times it might \nbe  ‘under the  counter’. Suzuki were similar, with Suzuki \nGB  handling the  parent company’s TT  and World Cham- \npionship machines and  riders for  several years. Honda had \nnominally been out  of the  sport for  much of the 1970s, \nwhile Kawasaki had limited involvement, mostly with \ntheir 3-cylinder production racers. That involvement \ngrew later in the  decade with the  new FIM F750 Champi- \nonship and  the  appearance of their 250 and 350cc tandem \ntwins. \nIn the late 1970s Yamaha were producing race machines \nfor  the  250, 350, 500 and 750cc classes, having dropped \nthe  125  they marketed for  a  couple of years. By now the \n250 and  350  carried the TZF classification and for  1979 the \n350  received a substantial upgrade, with redesigned ports, \nnew exhausts and  new carburettors with power-jet sys- \ntem operating from 8,000rpm. Said to  give another 8bhp, \nwhich lifted output to  72bhp at  10,500rpm, when this  was \nallied to  considerable weight saving from magnesium cases \nand  aluminium swinging arm, the  350  became noticeably \nquicker. Far  less  work went into the  TZ250F and its  out- \nput remained 53bhp at  10,500rpm. Not  everyone liked the \nTZ’s handling in standard form, particularly with the extra \npower, and an  ever-growing number of specialist frame \nmakers offered alternatives. \nNota great deal was  seen of the YZR500 at the TT, where \nover-bored 350s tended to challenge for the Senior win, but \nthose lucky enough to  get their hands on  TZ750s did  use \nthem in  the  Classic race, although to  quote Tom Herron: \n‘Sulby Straight ...  now that is something out  of this world \non  a  750 Yam —  you have to  consciously brace yourself’, \nNot only did the biggest Yamahas test  a rider’s bravery and \nskill, but  they were also worryingly hard on  tyres over a \nlengthy TT race, where the latest slick tyres were available \nto  use  but  where mid-race tyre/wheel changes had yet to \nbe introduced. \nExperienced teams and riders would return to  the  TT \neach year with some idea of the  settings required for  car- \nburation, gearing and suspension on  the Mountain Course, \nbut much fine-tuning would be carried out  during practice \nto get the right balance. Newcomers often found setting-up \nto  be a daunting task; one  whose initial suspension adjust- \nment \nwas \nout  \ntold \nthat, \nfor  \nhim, \n‘Sulby \nStraight \nwas \none \nbig \ntank-slapper’. \n1979: MILLENNIUM \nThis \nwas  \nnot  \nthe  \nturn-of-the-century \nMillennium \nof \n2000 \ncelebrated \nby \nthe \nworld \nat \nlarge, \nbut \nthe \nlower \nkey \none \nin \n1979 \nthat \nmarked \n1,000 \nyears \nof Tynwald, \nthe \nManx \nPar- \nliament. \nHowever, \nthe \nManx \nworked \nhard \nto \nmake \nevery- \nthing \na \nlittle \nspecial \non \nthe \nIsland \nin \nMillennium \nyear \nand \nthe \nTT \nwas \nexpected \nto \ndo \nits \nbit. \nWhatever Mike Hailwood’s reasons were for  making a \ncomeback at  the  1978 TT, it is certain that a  profusion of \noffers of the  sort that could not  be refused helped make his \nmind up to  return in  1979. The fans were back too, want- \ning to  witness again the  seemingly unhurried and almost \ncasual style of the  man who, in  over twenty years of rac- \ning, showed that he  could ride anything and usually win. \nWhile he would have been guaranteed a good pay day from \nall  of his pre-race contractual arrangements in  1979, there \nwas also the  tempting target of a  £10,000 first prize for \nthe  Schweppes Classic TT  and  £5,000 for a  start-to-finish \nleader of the  Quintin Hazell Senior TT. \nPractice week was  troubled by poor weather, which made \nit difficult to  tell who was  really on  form amongst expected \nfront runners like Alex George, Charlie Williams, Helmut \nDahne, Tony Rutter, an  injured Mick Grant and, of course, \nMike Hailwood, who suffered handling problems with his \nDucati. \nRacing started with the  Formula I event on  Saturday \nafternoon and this time Hailwood could not overcome \nhis  substantial bhp deficiency compared to  the  full-blown \n1,000cc Honda and  Kawasaki fours. The race win went to \nAlex George (Honda), who raised race average and  fastest \nlap speeds to  new records of 110.57 and 112.94mph, leav- \ning Charlie Williams to  take second and Mike Hailwood, \nplagued with problems, to  finish fifth. Ironically, in  1979 \nthe Ducati factory had taken a little more interest in his bike \nthan they did in  1978, although not  all of it was  beneficial. \nSuzuki-mounted for  the  Senior TT, on  a  bike that had \nbeen subject to an  extensive weekend engine rebuild, Mike \nHailwood simply rode away from the  opposition, putting \nin laps of under 20 minutes and winning by 2 minutes from \nTony Rutter (Suzuki), breaking race and  lap records along \nthe \nway \nwith \nspeeds \nof \n111.75mph \nand \n114.02mph. \nThe \nlatter \nwas \nhis \nfastest-ever \nTT \nlap \nand \njust \n0.31mph \noff \nthe \nabsolute \ncourse \nrecord. \nSecond-placed \nTony \nRutter \nwas \na \nprevious \nT'T \nwinner, \nbut \nhe \nsaid \nto \nHailwood \nafter \nthe \nrace, \n‘When \nyou \ncame \nby \nI \ntried \nto \nkeep \nup \nwith \nyou, \nbut \nno \nway \n.... \nThat \nSenior \nrace \nwas \ndominated \nby \nSuzuki \nand \nYamaha \nmachinery. \n\nThenearest \nHailwood \ncame \nto \nfurther \nglory \nin  \n1979 \nwas \nin \nthe \nfinal \nrace \nof \nthe \nweek, \nthe \nsix-lap \nSchweppes \nClas- \nsic. \nIn \na \nrace-long \nstruggle \nwith \nAlex \nGeorge \non \nhis \nbig \nHonda, \nHailwood \nand \nhis \n500cc \nSuzuki \ngot \nahead \ntowards \nthe \nend \nbut \nlost \ntime \ngoing \nover \nthe \nMountain \non \nthe \nlast \n. \nlap. \nThe \nresult \nwas \nhe \nfinished \nhis \nTT \ncareer \nwith \nsecond \nplace, \nlosing \nby \njust \n3.4 \nseconds \nto \nGeorge, \nwho \nset \na \nnew \nrecord \nClassic \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nof \n113.08mph \nand \nnar- \nrowly \nmissed \nthe \nlap \nrecord. \nMike Hailwood’s name had been very much to the fore in \n1979, and  as  an  illustration of the  reason why it still  meant \nso  much at  the  TT, when Charlie Williams (Yamaha) rode \nto  victory in that year’s Junior 250cc race at record speeds, \nit  was Hailwood’s long-standing 250cc race record from \n1967 of 103.07mph that he broke, along with the lap record \nof another TT  great, Bill  Ivy. Williams set  impressive new \nrace and lap figures of 105.13mph and 106.83mph on  his \nMaxton-framed bike, during what had  been restored to  a \nsix-lap race. \nSUCCESSORS? \nWhen Mike Hailwood announced after racing had  finished \nin  1979 that his  TT  career was at  an  end, people looked \naround for  someone who might emulate his  fourteen TT \nwins. As well as  the established riders who shone that year, \nshort-circuit ace Ron Haslam showed in  his  second year \nthat he was  getting to  grips with TT  racing. Strangely, this \nmay have been aided by a spectac- \nular fall at Ballaugh Bridge, when \nhe admitted he was going for the \nhigh-jump record, for  it  might \njust have steadied his future pace. \nHaslam knew that he  needed to \ntreat the TT differently from \nshort circuits, telling how Mike \nHailwood ‘gave me  a  wonderful \nriding lesson on  the Island... I'd \ntag on  behind him and watch him \nride ...  it was a masterclass’. \nAnother to  excite and grab \nthe imagination of  the crowds \nin 1979 was Kiwi newcomer \nGraeme Crosby. With his big \nKawasaki fitted with high-bars, \nhis wheelying out  of slow corners \nlike the  Gooseneck brought him \nto \npeople’s \nnotice \nand \nhe \nwas \na \ndefinite \ncrowd \npleaser. \nHis \nrace \nperformances \nalso \nrevealed \nhis \ntalent, \nwith \nfourth \nplace \nin \nthe \nA  NEW ERA @  127 \nFormula I race at an  average of 107.39mph and a fastest lap \nof 109mph. They were the  fastest laps ever by a  newcomer. \nAmong up-and-coming sidecar racers, a  young Mick Bod- \ndice was another who liked to  entertain the  crowds at  Bal- \nlaugh Bridge with height and distance. That was until he \nbegan to  experience problems with stretched chains, when \nhe decided a more mature approach was required. \nPARADING \nThe TT  liked to  show off its  history and one way was to \nallow former stars to  parade around the  course between \nraces. Nowadays that is done in  strictly controlled condi- \ntions, with the  pace set  by travelling marshals. At the  1979 \nTT, the  ‘parade’ was more of a free-for-all. \nFastest in  that Millennium Parade was Percy Tait, who \nlapped in  23  minutes 9 seconds, at  an  average lap speed of \nsome 97.5mph. Alan Dugdale was second on  a  Matchless \njust ahead of Messrs Read and Surtees, whose lap times \nwere 96  and 95mph. Also in  the  field were past winners \nlike Stanley Woods, Georg Meier, Tommy Wood, Geoff \nDuke and Bill Lomas. All  commented that the  course was \nvery much smoother than in  their days. Indeed, even the \nnotorious Cronk y Voddy straight had received attention, \nalthough it still could not  be classed as  smooth. \n1980: A BUMPY RIDE \nThere were no  complaints from sidecar crews about the \nNot \na  \nrace \nbetween \nJohn \nSurtees \nand \nPhil \nRead \non  \nMV \nAgustas, \nbut \na \nparade \nlap \nin \n1979: \nhere \nthey \nare \nentering \nParliament \nSquare. \n\n128 M@  A  NEW ERA \nGrant broke clear to  win. \nMick Grant (Honda) and Graeme Crosby (Suzuki) exit Braddan Bridge. They circulated like this for three laps before \npartial smoothing of the Cronk y Voddy straight, for, in \nfrontrunner Trevor Ireson’s words, it did away with ‘Cronk \nY  Voddy Cronkiness’, which was his  name for  a  type of \ndouble-vision that previously afflicted him when he  rode \nit flat  out. Come the  1980 TT  and the  short-travel suspen- \nsion of sidecar outfits gave their crews serious problems on \nthe  bumpy Sulby Straight. Three-time winner Rolf Stein- \nhausen protested, ‘I  cannot race on  such a  road’, while \nNigel Rollason told that if it was not  levelled he would not \nrace the TT any more. Seemingly nothing was  done, for the \nfollowing year Jock Taylor talked of having to  ease off  ‘to \navoid wrecking the  bike’. \nIn  the  actual racing in  1980, it was Trevor Ireson who \ntook his third consecutive win in  Sidecar race A, with Jock \nTaylor setting the  fastest lap in  what were mixed condi- \nThe Cotton/Rotax engine of  1980. \n\ntions. \nIn \nthe \nfaster \nB \nrace, \nan  \ninspired \nTaylor \nrode \nat \nrecord \nspeeds \nthat \nno \none \ncould \nlive \nwith \nto \nbeat \nIreson \ninto \nsec- \nond \nplace. \nIn \ndoing \nso \nhe \nlifted \nthe \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nto \n103.55mph \nand \nput \nover \n3mph \non \nthe \nlap \nrecord, \nleaving \nit \nat \n106.08mph. \nIt \nwas  \nan  \nunusual \nyear’s \nracing \nfor \nsolos \nin  \n1980, \nbecause \nthe  \nless  \nthan \nperfect \nweather \nfor  \nmost \nof \nthe  \nweek \nmeant \nthat \nno  \nrecords \nwere \nbroken \nuntil \nthe \nlast \nrace. \nHowever, \nit \nwas \na \nweek \nwith \nits \nshare \nof \ncontroversy, \nmuch \nof \nit \ninvoly- \ning \nthe \nHonda \nand \nSuzuki \nworks \nteams \nand \ntheir \nnumber \none \nriders, \nMick \nGrant \nand \nGraeme \nCrosby. \nBoth \nteams \nused \ntheir \nmuscle \nwith \nthe \norganizers \nto get \ntheir \nway \nin \na \nmanner \nlesser \nlights \nprobably \nwould \nnot \nhave \nmanaged, \nwith \nmost \nof \nthe \nfuss \nrevolving \naround \ninterpretation \nof \nthe \nregulations \non \nissues \nranging \nfrom \nfuel-tank \nsizes \nto \nstarting \norder. \nSpeeds may have been down in  some races due to  the \nweather in  1980, but riding skills had to be at their highest \nto  cope with poor road conditions. Mick Grant (Honda) \ntook victory in  Formula I, Graeme Crosby (Suzuki) won \nthe Senior in only his second year at the event, Charlie Wil- \nliams (Yamaha) collected wins in  the  Junior and  Formula \nI] races and  Barry Smith (Yamaha) in  Formula III.  Those \nFIT  and FHI races were won on  Yamaha’s RD350LC and \nRD250LC machines, which were destined to  achieve cult \nstatus on  road and  track. \nAninteresting machine in the Junior was  the third-placed \nCotton of  Steve Tonkin. It  was equipped with a  Rotax \nwater-cooled, disc-valve, tandem-twin engine, which was \nto  make its  mark at  the  TT  with other makers during the \n1980s, so  challenging the  Yamaha monopoly of the  class. \nCLASSIC \nThe closing Classic race of the  1980 TT was open to  1300cc \nmachines, and  Mick Grant turned out  on  a  1060cc Honda, \nRon Haslam on  a  999cc Honda and Graeme Crosby on  a \n1084cc Yoshimura Suzuki. Along with Charlie Williams \n(Yamaha), they were the  pre-race favourites (Alex George \nwas  absent through injury). Each was  backed by what was \nas  close as  you could get to  works support, with equipment \nlike their quick-fillers saving them up to 40 seconds on  each \nfill  against the  less  well-equipped teams. Understandably, \nthey \nreceived \nthe \nmost \npre-race \nattention \nand \nthe \npresence \nof \nprivateer \nJoey \nDunlop \non \nan \nolder \nTZ750 \nYamaha \nwas \nbarely remarked upon. \nCanny \nDunlop \nhad  \nequipped \nhimself \nwith \na \nhuge \n8-gal- \nlon \npetrol \ntank \nto \nreduce \nthe \nnumber \nof \nhis \nrefuelling \nstops, \nbut \nearly \nin \nthe \nfirst \nlap \nits \nretaining \nstraps \nbroke, \nmeaning \nthat \nfor \nthe \nremainder \nof \nthe \nsix \nlaps \nhe \nwas \nforced \nto \nhold \nit \non \nwith \nhis \nknees. \nDespite \nthis \nmassive \nhandicap \nhe \nrode \nA  NEW ERA @  129 \nFu \nJoey Dunlop —  no  ordinary road racer. \nto  a  very satisfying victory over Mick Grant and in  doing \nso  set  a  new outright course record, with a  lap speed of \n115.22mph. \nWith Dunlop having convincingly beaten the Honda \nworks entries, the  only course open to  ‘Big H’  was to  sign \nhim up.  They did  this  later in the year and  so  started a long \nand  unconventional relationship, where the  company bent \nits  normally strict rules to  accommodate this special road- \nracing talent. \nJoey Dunlop headed an  influx of talented Irish riders \nto  the  TT  in the  early 1980s, which included Donny Rob- \ninson, Sam McClements, Con Law and Steve Cull. Irish \nroad racing provided its riders with good TT-like training, \nwhich yielded a prolific supply of good runners. \nSPEEDS \nThe drop from Creg ny  Baa to  Brandish was used for  the \nunofficial timing of  riders by at  least two magazines in \n1980, some of them recorded in  damp conditions. Fastest \nspeeds achieved were given as  follows: \nFormula I: Graeme Crosby (Suzuki) —  163mph, Mick Grant \n(Honda) —  159mph \nClassic: Jeff Sayle (Yamaha) —  164mph, George Linder \n(Yamaha) —  160mph \nSenior: Barry Woodland (Suzuki) —  156mph \nSidecar: Nigel Rollason (Barton) —  144mph, Jock Taylor \n(Yamaha) —  141mph \nIn total, fourteen riders exceeded 150mph. \n\n130 M@  A  NEW ERA \nA private timing venture at  The Highlander in  1973. \nSPEED COMPARISON \nThere had  been huge developments in  racing motorcycles \nin  the  twenty years since the  500cc Manx Norton was at \nits  peak, and in  1980 a  good Suzuki RG500 like Barry \nWoodland’s was putting out  about 120bhp. That was well \nover twice the  output of a  good Manx of the  early 1960s. \nNo  comparable figures are  available to  show what speed a \nNorton reached on  the drop from Creg ny Baa to  Brandish, \nbut  the  best-ever published speed of a  Norton single from \nSulby Straight was Mike Hailwood’s 138.46mph in  1960, \nwith several other 500cc singles hitting 130-plus mph there \nin the  same era. Hailwood’s 138.46mph at  Sulby has  to  be \nworth at  least 140-plus mph on  the  drop to  Brandish, sub- \nject  \nto  \ngearing, \nwhich \nindicates \nthat \nbig \nincreases \nin  \nbhp \ngive \nrelatively \nsmall \nincreases \nin \nmph. \nLooking \nat  \nthose \nsituations, \nwhich \nwere \nnearly \ntwenty \nyears \napart, \nif \nit \nis assumed \nthat \nthe \nspeed \nof \nHailwood’s \nSenior \nTT-winning \nRG500 \nof \n1979 \nwas \non \na par \nwith \nWoodland’s \nof \n1980, \nthe \ndifference \nmade \nby \nthe \nextra \ntop- \nend \nspeed \nachieved \nby \nMike’s \n500cc \nSuzuki \nover \nhis \n500cc \nNorton \ncan \nbe \nillustrated \nby \ncomparing \nhis \nfastest \nlap \non \na \nNorton \n— \n101.31mph \nin \n1961 \n— \nwith \nhis \nfastest \nlap \non \na \nSuzuki \nRG500 \n— 114.02mph \nin \n1979. \nThat \ngives \na \ngain \nin \nlap \nspeed \nof \nalmost \n13mph, \nwhich \nwas \nalso \na 13 \nper \ncent \nincrease. \nThat \ncame \nafter \na \ndoubling \nof bhp \navailable \nto \nthe \nrider. \nHowever, \ntop \nspeed \nis \nnot \nthe \nonly \nfactor \nto \ncon- \nsider \nwhen \ncomparing \nthe \neffect \nof \npower \non \nlap \ntimes, \nfor \nas \nwell \nas giving \nincreased \nmaximum, \nthe \ngreater \nbhp \non \ntap \ncan \ncontribute \nto a \nmuch \nbroader \nspread \nof \npower \nand \nimproved \nacceleration. \nFaster \nlap \ntimes \nwould \nalso \nhave \nowed \nsomething \nto \nthe \nimprovements \nmade \nto \nhandling \nand \nbraking, \nplus \nthe \neffect \nof \ncourse \nimprovements. \nBack in  the 1960s a  similar situation had applied to \nspeed/time gains for  Mike Hailwood, when he  switched \nfrom a  500cc Norton to  a  500cc MV Agusta. In that move \nhe gained over 20bhp, but even three years later, he had put \nonly 4’mph on  his best lap speed. That meant 40 per  cent \nmore power gave a 4 per cent gain in lap speed. \nJust to  throw in another detail —  in  1966 Giacomo Ago- \nstini (MV Agusta) and  Mike Hailwood (Honda) were the \ntwo fastest 500s timed on  the  drop from Creg ny  Baa at \n151.9mph. Their machines were said to  be  giving about \n80—85bhp. \nIt is worth mentioning that the only official timing at the \nTT  in those earlier eras was of the  time taken by competi- \ntors to  complete a full  lap. The resultant figures were then \nconverted to  lap speeds and published by the  organizers. \nAll other timing and  speeds quoted came from private ven- \ntures, whose accuracy was not  guaranteed. \n1981: EVER FASTER \nThe 1981 TT was oversubscribed with entries, showing the \nevent maintained its popularity with riders, although some \nreports \nsaid \nthat \nspectator \nnumbers \nwere \ndown. \nThose \nin \nattendance \nwere \nwitness \nto \ndramatic \nracing, \naccompanied \nby \nmanufacturers’ \nprotests \nand \nthe \nusual \nexamples \nof \ngood \nand \nbad \nluck. \nBut \nmost \nof \nall, \nthey \nsaw \never \nfaster \nracing \nand \nthe \nsetting \nof \nnew \nspeed \nrecords \nover \nthe \nMountain \nCourse. \nShown \nbelow \non \nthe \nleft \nare \nthe \nrace \nav \nerage \nand \nfastest \nlap \nspeeds \ncoming \ninto \nthe \n1981 \nTT \nand \non \nthe \nright \nthe  \nfigures \nachieved \nduring \nthe  \n1981 \nevent. \nIt \nwas \na \nspecial \nyear, \nfor \nonly \nthe \nrain-hit \nGenie \nevent \nfailed \nto  \nimprove \nits \nfigures. \n\nRace \nTT  Formula I \nSenior TT \nSidecar \nJunior \nTT  Formula II \nTT  Formula III \nClassic TT \nIn  \nHonda’s \nblack \n‘protest’ \nleathers, \nJoey \nDunlop \npushes \nhis  \nmachine \nalong \nthe \nGlencrutchery \nRoad \nto \nthe \npits, \nhaving \nrun \nout \nof \npetrol. \nHe \nrefuelled \nbut \nretired \nlater \nin \nthe \nrace \nwith \nmechanical \nproblems. \nTop speeds \npre-1981 \nrace average 110.57mph \nfastest lap 112.94mph \nrace average 111.75mph \nfastest lap 114.02mph \nrace average 103.55mph \nfastest re 06.08mph \nrace average 105.1 13mph \nfastest lap ‘106. 83mph \nrace average 101.5 Smph \nfastest lap 103.40mph \nrace average 97.82mph \nfastest lap 99.37mph \nrace average 11 3.08mph \nfastest lap 115.22mph \nTop speeds \n198] \n111  .81mph \n13.70mph \n106.14mph \n112.68mph \n107.02mph \n108.12mph \n106.21mph \n109.22mph \n101.91mph \n103.51mph \n99.66mph \n101.31mph \n113.58mph \n115.40mph \nDoing the winning in  1981 were Graeme C rosby (Suzu \nki), who took the  Formula I and Classi races, and Mick \nGrant, who had  moved from Honda to  Suzuki and  won the \nweather-hit Senior after the  first race was stopped and then \nrerun. Even the  rerun was  affected by rain showers towards \nthe  end, and riding Randy Mamola’s Suzuki RG  500 World \nChampionship bike on  slick tyres, Grant suffered substan- \ntial  wheelspin in  the  wet. Steve Tonkin took the  Junior on \nan  Armstrong and so  broke Yamaha's long domination of \nthe  class, Tony Rutter brought a  Ducati home first in  the \nFormula II race, Barry Smith a  Yamaha in  Formula III  and \nJock Taylor was dominant in  winning both Sidecar races \nwith Yamaha power. \nAs a sideshow to  the  racing, Honda and  Suzuki renewed \ntheir confrontations from 1980, Ron Haslam (Honda) los- \ning the  Formula race after a time penalty that was imposed \nupon Graeme Crosby (Suzuki) at  the  start was revoked \nafter protest, so  giving him the  win. Honda were unhappy \nwith the  decision and turned out  their three-man team of \nJoey Dunlop, Ron Haslam and Alex George in  all-black \nlivery for the  prestigious Classic race as  their form of coun- \nter-protest. Unfortunately it  backfired on  them, for  Joey \npay lost time after running \nout of  petrol near the  end of the \nan  unforgiveable error \nCrosby \nand Grant went on  to  take first and \nthird lap — \nfor a  works team — while \nsecond for  Suzuki. \nGraeme Crosby was also con- \ntesting the  World Championships \nfor  Suzuki (fifth in the  500cc class \n1981 and second in  1982), but \nhe  was a  true fan of the TT, say- \ning that what he liked about it was: \n‘the way the  racing is  spread out \nover ten days, the enthusiasm of \nthe  fans, dawn practice, hard par- \ntying on  the days off, the history of \nthe place ...  it’s  magic, really _  but \nit’s  so  hard to  explain the  Ble to \npeople who’ve never been there’. \nLooking at  other features of \nthe  1981 TT, Honda, in  what was \nbelieved to  be  a  first, carried out \na  mid-race tyre change for  Joey \nDunlop in  the Formula I race. \nThere was  a tightening of regula- \ntions for  sidecars, aimed at  avoid- \ning developments that were mak- \ning them more like three-wheeled \n\n132 A  NEW ERA \ncars; and to improve medical services, a second rescue heli- \ncopter was brought into use. \nThe sum available to pay to riders was  increased by 25 per \ncent in  1981, with a  £253,000 fund for  prize and  appear- \nance payments. It left  some claiming that ‘the TT  was the \nrichest motorcycle event in the  world’. Certainly the  good \nmoney on  offer attracted the  top  road racers and, perhaps \nindirectly, it thus contributed to  faster races. \nIn  the  wider world of racing, the  FIM announced that \n1982 would be  the  last year of the 350cc class in  World \nChampionships and Yamaha’s TZ350H of  1981 was their \nlast 350cc racer. It  came with a  power valve that oper- \nated on  the  exhaust at higher revs and 55bhp was available \nfrom an  engine that had seen elements of redesign aimed \nat  increasing reliability and component life. There were \nalso minor frame changes and  the  seat shape had  gradually \nbeen styled to  improve airflow. It was all part of a constant \nsearch for more power, increased flexibility and  drive, plus \nimproved handling and weight-saving. The aim was  to com- \nbine all such improvements to  help riders reduce lap times. \nMick \nGrant \non  \nhis  \n1982 \nSuzuki \nXR69 \nFormula \n| \nmachine, \nwhich \nhe \nfelt \nwas \nbetter \nthan \nthe \nWhile the  FIM had decided to  drop the  350cc class, the \nACU announced that a  race for  350s would return to  the \nTT  in  1982 and  be run concurrently with 500cc machines \nin the  Senior, even though there was some vagueness about \nwhat the  ‘new’ race would be called. It was  the only change \nto  the race programme for what was the  seventy-fifth anni- \nversary of the  first TT  meeting. This was recognized by \nthe  usual issue of commemorative postage stamps and the \nminting of 50p pieces bearing an  image of Mick Grant. Of \nrather more importance to  competitors was the fact that \nthe  weather held good throughout practice and racing. \nMissing from the anniversary meeting in  1982 was \nGraeme Crosby. He  had joined a GP  team run by Giacomo \nAgostini, where he  found that contesting the  TT  was not \non  Ago’s agenda. \nTHE RACING \nAfter 1981’s record-breaking spree, it was  hardly surprising \nthat some records remained intact in  1982.

As  is the  way \nat  such spots, his  wheels had  hardly stopped \nturning before a pint of beer was  thrust in his \nhand but, still keyed-up, he prowled round the \nbike and  suddenly spotted a kinked fuel line. \nPutting his beer aside, the  line was straight- \nened to allow a full flow of fuel, Williams put \non  his  helmet and gloves and rejoined the  race. Knowing \nthat he  had lost too  much time to  be  in  with a  chance of \nvictory, he was still determined to  show what he could do \nand on  his  fourth circuit he  broke the  Senior lap record, \nlifting it to  115.08mph. \nThis year the  350s had their own race within the  Senior \nand victory went to  Tony Rutter. His race average speed \nwas 108.53mph, which beat Chas Mortimer’s record \nof  106.78mph, set  back in  1976 at  the  last  running of a \nrace for  350s. Graeme McGregor set  a  new lap record \nof  112.03mph. Race speeds may have changed between \n1976 and 1982, but  what remained the  same was that the \nold  and  new figures had  all been set  on  Yamahas, for  they \nwere still the dominant race bikes of the day. Change was  in \nthe  air,  however, and  despite Yamaha swamping the  entry \nin the Junior 250cc event, it turned into a race of attrition \nfor  the  marque, with a  host of retirements, leaving Con \nLaw to  ride his  Ehrlich to  victory at  just below record \nspeed. A tandem twin, the Ehrlich was  variously described \nin  the  programme and results as  a  Waddon, a  Waddon- \nEhrlich and  a  Rotax-powered Waddon. It was also known \nas  an  EMC. \nThe only record broken in  the  two Sidecar races was in \nRace B, where Jock Taylor lifted the  fastest lap speed to \n108.29mph. \nSadly, \nTaylor \nwas \nkilled \nlater \nin \nthe \nsummer \nduring the  Finnish GP. \nPrevious \nyear’s \nFormula \nII \nwinner \nTony \nRutter \nwas  \nrid- \ning \na  \nDucati \nagain \nand, \nwith \nan  \nelement \nof \nworks \nsupport, \nlifted \nrace \naverage \nand \nlap \nrecords \nby \nan \nincredible \n6mph. \nThat \nsort \nof \nincrease \nwas \nunknown \nin \nTT \nraces \nin \nan \nage \nwhen \nthey \nwere \nbeing \nwon \nat \nover \n100mph \nand \nit \nwas \na \nperformance \nin \nwhich \nRutter \ntrounced \nthe \nopposition, \nwinning \nby \n4 minutes. \nNo  \nrecords \nwere \nset  \nin  \nthe  \nClassic \nrace, \nwhere \nHonda \nbrought \none  \nof \ntheir \nnew \nV4s  \nfor \nJoey \nDunlop \nto  \nride  \nonly \nto  \nfind \nduring \npractice \nthat \nit \nwas \nnot  \nup  \nto  \nthe  \ndemands \nof \nthe \nMountain \nCourse. \nDunlop \nreverted \nto \nhis \nwell-tried \nA  NEW ERA @  135 \nIn  recognition of Con Law’s record lap of  !!0mph on  his  EMC. \ntransverse-four, but  he  was among retirements from the \nrace, as  were fancied challengers such as  Charlie Williams, \nRon Haslam, Mick Grant and Steve Tonkin. Victory went \nto  Dennis Ireland (Suzuki) from Jon Ekerold (Suzuki). \n1983: TWO JUNIORS \nThe Formula III race was dropped for  1983 and  the  350cc \nrace machines were now given a race of their own, instead \nof running with the  500s in  the  Senior TT, as  in  1982. \nThe new race was called the  Junior 350cc TT  and  joined \nthe Junior 250cc TT in the race programme, both running \nover six  laps. The former Blue Riband Senior TT  had  lost \nits  premier status to  the  Classic TT  in recent years, but for \n1983 the two races were combined to give the Senior Clas- \nsic  TT, open to  machines up to  1000cc and  run on  Friday \nof race week. \nThe 1983 race programme opened with the  customary \nFormula I race, which went to  Joey Dunlop and his  new \nRS850 V4  Honda at  record race average and lap speeds, \nfrom Mick Grant and Rob McElnea on  997cc works \nSuzukis. Privateer Trevor Nation (Suzuki) took a fine  fifth \nplace on  second-hand tyres. Unusually for  the  TT, the \nweather was blisteringly hot, taxing the  riders even more \nthan usual over their six laps. The Sidecar races were run  at \na  slower pace than in recent years and  the  A race provided \na  second win for  Dick Greasley on  his  misfiring Yamaha, \nwhile race B gave Mick Boddice his first win after fourteen \nyears of trying. Popular winner of the  Junior 350cc race \nwas  Phil Mellor, after early leader Jon Ekerold dropped out, \nwhile \nCon \nLaw \nrepeated \nhis \nprevious \nyear’s \nvictory \nin \nthe \nJunior 250cc race.

However, \nBrown gambled on  getting three laps out  of a tank of petrol, \nbut  spluttered into retirement at  Creg ny Baa  towards the \nend of his  third lap. In  only his  second TT,  Rob McElnea \n(Suzuki) took over the lead and  raced to  victory from Con \nLaw (Suzuki) and Joey Dunlop (Honda) at anew record race \naverage speed of 114.81mph. Rider speeds were measured \nat The Highlander by Motor Cycle Weekly using a  police-type \nradar gun. The top fastest runners, against a slight headwind \nin the  Senior Classic, were all shown at  155mph. \nInarare TT occurrence, veteran Mick Grant finished the \nSenior Classic race off the podium, tyre troubles relegating \nhim to  fifth place. Suzuki works teamsters Grant and  win- \nner  McElnea both used the  same tyres, but  McElnea used \na  wider rear rim and somehow avoided problems. Unlike \ndays of old, the  correct choice of tyres was increasingly \nimportant to  a rider’s chance of race success, but with ever \nmore specialized compounds in use, rates of wear increased \nand changes of rear tyres at  pit stops were now common \namong the top riders. Principal suppliers of racing tyres at \nthe time were Dunlop and Michelin, with Pirelli also there. \nAmong other members of the trade, Shell Oils proclaimed \nin  post-race advertising that their products were used by \nmost of the winners in  1983. \nA  NEW ERA @  137 \nRiders making names for  themselves at  the  TT  in  the \nearly 1980s were Barry Woodland, Roger Burnett, Steve \nCull, Brian Reid, Geoff Johnson and  Gary Padgett. \nShowing that the TT  races still sorted the  men from the \nboys, the  Formula II and  Junior 350  TT  races were run  on \nthe  same day, with the  several riders who contested both \nraces each putting in ten  laps and 378  racing miles. \nSPEED \nFastest lap speeds moved from 108.77mph to  116.19mph \nbetween 1975 and 1983. While the increases were initially \nset by 500cc machines, the larger capacities allowed in For- \nmula and Classic TT  races saw the  bigger-engined bikes \nsetting the  fastest laps from the  late 1970s. \nMANX GRAND PRIX \nRunning since 1923, the  MGP had  seen many of its  com- \npetitors go  on  to  great things at  the  TT, with Tim Hunt, \nHarold Daniell, Freddie Frith, Phil Read and Norman \nBrown among those who went on  to  become TT  winners. \nWhile it  was not  known at  the  time, those standing on \nthe  podium after the  Newcomers race at  the 1983 MGP \nwere to  make a rich contribution to  TT  racing in the  years \nthat followed. They were: first, Robert Dunlop; second, \nSteve Hislop; and third, Ian  Lougher. While it  is  to  be \nexpected that Robert Dunlop’s early racing career would \nbe affected by the  activities of his  elder brother Joey, Steve \nHislop tells in his  autobiography, Hizzy, that it was watch- \ning Joey sweep through the  Eleventh Milestone at the  1983 \nTT  that inspired him to  sort out  his  life  and  make a  go  of \nhis racing. \n\nCHAP TERSEIGEE) \nPRODUCTION \nMACHINES \nYO \nFAHE \nOise \n1984: RACES OLD AND NEW \nThe 1984 TT  programme saw the  return of races for  Pro- \nduction machines. These offered the  chance for  manufac- \nturers to  show how their roadsters could go over three laps \nof the  Mountain Course, in  classes for up to  250, 750 and \n1500cc machines. There were other changes, with the Jun- \nior  350 TT  being dropped after only one year of running. \nSimilarly, although the previous year had  seen the  combin- \ning of the  Senior and Classic races into one Senior Clas- \nsic  event, for  1984 they reverted to  separate Senior and \nPremier Classic TT  races. Other changes saw the  capacity \nof the  Formula I race revert to  750cc, to  accord with the \nFIM’s new limit for  the  class, and among the  sidecars, a \nFormula 2 class was  introduced for up to  350cc two-strokes \nand  600cc four-strokes. \nQualifying times were further reduced to: \nFormula I, Junior 250 and Senior 500: 26 minutes \nPremier Classic: 25  minutes \nSidecar: 28 minutes \nThose times provided an  indicator of the spread of machine \nand  rider quality to  be found in  a  TT  race, for Joey Dun- \nlop was lapping in just under 20  minutes on a solo and top \nsidecar man Mick Boddice was getting round in just over \n21  minutes with his three-wheeler. \nCompletely new in  1984 was a  Historic TT  for  ‘old’ \nbikes. Rated a  hit  by most of those who saw the  array of \nManx Nortons, AJS 7Rs, BSA Gold Stars, Aermacchis and \nso  on,  those machines of yesterday were piloted by riders \nclad mostly in black leather and provided a dose of nostalgia \nas  they trailed Castrol ‘R’  in their wake. But  the  three-lap \nHistoric TT  was not  a  particularly quick one and ran  for \njust the  one year. It provided a first-ever TT  victory for \nan  American rider, the  forceful Dave Roper on  his  G50 \nMatchless, with Steve Cull taking the  350cc class win on \nan  Aermacchi. \nFierce competition amongst established riders like Rob \nMcElnea, Joey Dunlop, Mick Grant, Charlie Williams, \nTony Rutter, Roger Marshall, Graeme McGregor, Phil \nMellor and Trevor Nation saw records broken in  several \nclasses in  1984. First up  was the Formula I race, where \nDunlop, on  his V4, now reduced from 850cc to 750cc, won \nby 20 seconds from Honda team mate Roger Marshall, lift- \ning the  lap record on  his  last  lap to  115.89mph and  hitting \n175mph past The Highlander. Come the  Senior TT  and  he \nraised not  only the  Senior lap record, but  also the  absolute \nrecord to  118.48mph. Unfortunately, a  shortfall of petrol \non  the last lap saw  him hand the win to  Rob McElnea. This \ngave Suzuki their seventh consecutive Senior victory with \nthe  RG500. The same ‘Rob Mac’ restricted Joey Dunlop \nto second place in the  Classic TT, during a fierce battle that \nincluded Mick-Grant (Suzuki) until he had  problems with \nhis  clip-ons. McElInea lifted race average and lap record \nspeeds in the  process. \nGraeme McGregor had a  midweek day to  remember \nwhen he won the  Formula II race on  a  Yamaha from Tony \nRutter (Ducati) and the  Junior 250cc on  an  EMC from \nCharlie Williams (Yamaha). In  the  latter he  also had to \nfight off the  likes of Joey Dunlop (Honda) and  Phil Mellor \n(Yamaha), setting new record race average and lap speeds in \nboth events. It was to  be Charlie Williams’ last  year at  the \nTT, but  in third place was Brian Reid (EMC), who would \nprove to  be a  worthy successor to  him, going on  to  record \nfive  TT  wins. \nThe reintroduced Production races were rated a success, \nwith Geoff Johnson on  a  Kawasaki GPZ900R taking the \n1500cc class, Trevor Nation on  a CBX Honda being best \n750cc \nand \nPhil \nMellor \non \na \nYamaha \nRD250LC \ntopping \nthe \nsmallest class. All were won at higher speeds than at the last \nrunning of the  event in  1976. \nAmong \nthe  \nother \nrace \nmachinery, \nSuzuki \nwere \nnow \nup \nto \nthe \nMk7 \nversion \nof \nthe \nRG500, \nwhile \nYamaha \nwere \nmar- \nketing \nthe \n‘L’ \nmodel \nof \ntheir \nTZ250. \nThose \nbikes \nwere \nboth \n« \n\nPRODUCTION MACHINES TO THE FORE #139 \nHelmut \nDahne \nspeeds \nto  \nsecond \nplace \nin \nthe \n750cc \nclass \nof \nthe \n1984 \nProduction \nTT  \non  \nhis  \nHonda \nVF750. \nmainstays \nof \nracing \nand \nhad \nbeen \ndeveloped \nyear \non  \nyear, \nincorporating \nchanges \nto  \nengines, \nsuspension, \ntyres \nand \nso \non, \nWith \never-increasing \noutputs, \nthey \nwere \nmajor \ncon- \ntributors \nto \nfaster \nand \nfaster \nlap \nspeeds. \nAmong \nfour-stroke \nracers \nthere \nwas \na \ntrend \nto  \nfit \nslip- \nper-clutches, \nto  \ncounter \nback-wheel \nchatter \nand \npotential \nover-revving \nwhen \nunder \nfierce \nbraking \non  \nthe \napproach \nto \nslowish \ncorners. \nSidecars \nwere \nstill \nsetting \nfast \ntimes \nbut  \nwithout \nbeat- \ning \nJock \nTaylor’s \nrecords. \nOne \nmagazine \nof \nthe \ntime \nwrote \nthat \n‘the \ndevelopment \nof  \nsidecars \nhas  \nprogressed \nto  \nthe \npoint \nwhere \nthe \nmotorcycle \nconnection \nis \nbecoming \na \nlittle \nblurred’. \nBut \nthe \norganizers \nknew \nthat \nthe \nthree-wheelers \nwere \npopular \nwith \nthe \ncrowds, \nso \ntheir \nposition \nat \nthe \nTT \nwas \nassured. \nThey \nwere \nnot \nan \neasy \nride \nand \nsome \nexperi- \nenced \nshort-circuit \npassengers \nfound \nthe \nMountain \nCourse \ntoo \ndemanding. \nIt \nwas \nnot \nunknown \nfor \npassengers \nto \nwith- \ndraw \ntheir \nservices \nafter \na \ncouple \nof \npractice \nsessions. \n1985: A SENIOR CHANGE \nThe organizers had tinkered with the  Senior and Classic \nraces during the previous few years, but for  1985 the Classic \nrace was axed and the  traditional 500cc Senior TT  became \nthe  Senior 1000cc race. This was really in  recognition of \nthe fact  that racing was increasingly based upon production \nmachines, tuned in whichever way the regulations allowed, \nto  compete in  separately named races. Not many TT  fans \nknew the intricacies of the rules that saw  very similar bikes \ncompeting in those slightly different races, but competitors \nand sponsors welcomed being able to  use  stock machines \nthat could be upgraded to  racers at  reasonable cost. It wasa \ntrend that was to  increase in the  years that followed. \nEntries were up for the  1985 TT and they were dominated \nby the Japanese manufacturers Yamaha, Suzuki, Honda and \nKawasaki. Proving the  Island ’s lasting popularity with rid- \ners, there were nineteen former TT  winners among the \nentry and twenty-nine Manx Grand Prix winners. \n\n140 PRODUCTION MACHINES TO THE FORE \nThis was the  year that quick-fillers were finally banned \nfor refuelling, after several years of argument on  the  issue. \nNow everyone used the gravity-fillers supplied by  the \norganizers. Being very much slower, they increased the \ntime taken to  complete the  lap(s) when refuelling took \nplace, thus reducing race speeds. \nJOEY’S YEAR \nBy now known to  TT  fans simply as  ‘Joey’, William Joseph \nDunlop was  the  undoubted man of the meeting at the  1985 \nTT, taking three wins. Overcoming the handicap of having \nbeen on a fishing boat that sunk coming out  of Belfast just \nthirty-six hours before the start of practice, he was  the first \nto  achieve a  hat-trick since Mike Hailwood. Both did  it on \nHondas, all  three of Dunlop’s having the  company’s now \nfavoured V-configured engines, including the new Formula \nI RVF750, which, rather than being a  converted produc- \ntion bike, was much nearer a  purpose-designed race bike. \nHappy to ride large or  small machines, Dunlop’s wins came \nin  the  Formula I race where, not  pushed, he set  a  new lap \nrecord and won by over 5 minutes; in  the  Junior 250cc \nevent, where he set  new record race average and  record lap \nspeeds on  what was Honda’s return to  the  class; and  in the \nJoey Dunlop at  speed over the Mountain. \nnew 1000cc Senior TT, where he  beat team mate Roger \nMarshall at  slightly less than record pace. For that last \nrace of the  week, Dunlop chose Honda’s RVF 4-cylinder, \nfour-stroke, while Marshall rode their 3-cylinder 500cc \ntwo-stroke. The difference in  their race times was just 16 \nseconds. Dunlop loved the  RVF750, which was small and \nfast. It took him to  victory in all rounds of the  1985 World \nFormula I Championship and  provided the  basis for future \nTT  wins. \nBrian Reid (EMC) pushed Dunlop in the Junior 250 race \nand led  by 15  seconds on  the  last  lap, only to  run out  of \nfuel at  Hillberry. His  consolation was to  set  a new 250 lap \nrecord of 112.08mph. He  also broke the  lap record in  the \nFormula II race on  a Yamaha at  110.47mph, but again failed \nto  finish. \nNo  records were broken in the  1500cc class of the  Pro- \nduction race, but Mat Oxley (Honda) did raise the race and \nlap records in the  250cc class. Records were also broken in \nthe 750cc class by victor Mick Grant and by Glen Williams \nin setting the fastest lap. It was Grant’s seventh and last TT \nvictory and was achieved on  a  new Suzuki GSX-R750, a \nmodel that was to  go on  and carve a  name for  itself in  TT \nhistory. \n\nas \nProduction, Formula | and Senior TT races. \nTHE ‘GIXXER’ \nRay Knight described the  GSX-R750 in its  first year as  ‘an \nunashamed repli-racer for the road’.

Journalist Knight ‘road tested’ the Suzuki for Motorcycle Sport by riding it in the \nforks with anti-dive. It had  a  short wheelbase, 18in wheels \nand weighed in  some 66lb (30kg) lighter than the  oppo- \nsition such as  Honda’s 750cc V4  and Yamaha’s 20-valve \nFZ750. Power output was  also claimed to be higher than the \nopposition’s, at  close to  100bhp, although it was acknowl- \nedged that it needed the  services of an  experienced tuner/ \nblueprinter to  get  close to  that figure from the  original \nmodel. Other up-to-date features were flat-slide carburet- \ntors, large airbox under the fuel tank, hydraulic clutch, six- \nspeed gearbox and cast wheels. With its  excellent power- \nto-weight ratio, the  whole package was said to  give a  top \nspeed of just over 150mph, and  Tony Rutter was timed at \n155mph on  the  drop from Creg ny Baa  to  Brandish. \nTHE COURSE \nThere had been no  major changes to  the  Mountain Course \nfor several years, although there were always minor \nimprovements going on.  In  the  winter following the  1985 \n\n142 \nMl  \nPRODUCTION \nMACHINES \nTO \nTHE \nFORE \nVirtually every competitor now fitted a  steering damper \nfor  better control over the bumpy Mountain Course. \nTT, work started on  stage one of a  widening scheme for \nQuarry Bends. A really narrow and  tree-lined section, its \nseveral bends ran  between closely enclosing banks that lim- \nited riders’ speeds to  around 100mph. Changes from light \nto shade and retained dampness under the trees were also an \ninconvenience to  riders. It was a  spot where they all hoped \nthat they would not  come across a  slower competitor, for \na  swift passage through Quarry Bends had a big influence \non  the speeds achieved on  the following Sulby Straight. \nWhen the  changes were complete, they were reckoned to \nbe worth some 5 seconds a lap. \nHow much course improvements contributed to  faster \n|   lap speeds was a long-running topic, and  the  retired Geoff \nDuke chipped in with his opinion, comparing his 99.98mph \nlap in  1955 with Joey Dunlop’s 118mph absolute lap record. \nDuke felt  that of the 18mph increase, some 8mph came \nfrom course changes, which equated to  about 45  per  cent. \nThat percentage would have fluctuated down the  years. In \nthe  earliest days of the  TT, when poor course conditions \nrestricted riders from using full power, what small gains in \nspeed were made were probably due  to  machine and  rider. \nWith the rapid spread of tarmacadam surfacing in the early \n1920s, there were individual years when the  absolute lap \nrecord was  lifted by 4—Smph. Most of that gain would have \ncome from the course improvements. The rapid gains in lap \nspeeds of the  1960s were probably due to  the  outstanding \nworks machinery provided to  even more outstanding riders \nlike Mike Hailwood. Today most of the  speed gain comes \nfrom machines and riders, although every so  often there \nis a hike in speed that can  be related to  a major roadwork. \n1986: ‘PRODUCTION’ INCREASES \nThose who liked to  spectate at  the start and finish area \nwere able to  watch from a  new Grandstand at  the 1986 \nTT, \nalthough \nit \nwas \nstill \nmostly \nopen \nto  \nthe  \nelements. \nAlso \nopen \nto \nthe \nelements \nwere \nthe \nmany \ncompetitors \nwho \nchose \nto \ncamp \nnear \nthe \nPaddock, \nand \nearly \nin \npractice \na \nheavy \novernight \ngale \nblew \ndown \nsome \nof their \ntents. \nIt \nalso \nblew \ndown \nthe \nscrutineers’ \ntent \nand, \nmore \nimportantly \nto \nsome, \nthe \nbeer \ntent. \nOut on  the  course, riders returned from early practice \nsessions with customary complaints of how much bumpier \nthe  Mountain Course was than the  short circuits on  which \nthey were accustomed to  racing. Perhaps one of them was \nMichael McGarrity, who lost control of  his  Formula | \nHonda over the  notorious bumps of the  Sulby Straight and \nslid  down the  road for  150  yards. He  was lucky to  escape \nwith a broken shoulder and  abrasions. \nMention was made of the  increased use  of production- \nbased machines at the  1985 TT and this was  an  accelerating \ntrend in  1986, both at  the  TT  and in  the  wider world of \nracing. High levels of support for the races from Rothmans \nHonda, Heron Suzuki and Loctite Yamaha teams saw the \nvery best machinery being used over the Mountain Course \nby top TT  riders. The manufacturers also gave support to \nsporting dealers, for the organizers were keen to have them \nentering machines in what had become high-profile races. \nThe three Production classes of 1985 were increased to \nfour for  1986 and  named A, B, C and  D, with two-strokes \nand  four-strokes having different permitted capacity levels \nin  classes B, C and D.  In  Class B it was up  to  500cc two- \nstrokes racing against up to  750cc four-strokes; in  Class C \nup to  400cc two-strokes against up to  600cc four-strokes; \nand in  Class D  up  to  250cc two-strokes and up  to  400cc \nfour strokes. Class A retained its  1500cc upper limit. \nHIGH SPEEDS \nAt  the 1986 TT, where entry numbers were high —  some \nraces having 110  riders —  and spectator numbers were up, \nit was the  Production classes that delivered quite stunning \nresults. This was particularly so  for  Suzuki, whose blue- \nand-white machines took wins in  all  four classes. Trevor \nNation rode his  GSX-R1100 to  victory in  Class A, adding \nalmost 7mph to  the  race average speed and over 7mph to \nthe  lap speed. That was an  incredible performance, with \nNation becoming the  first rider to  lap at under 20 minutes \non  a  Proddie machine. He  left  the  race average speed at  a \nrecord 111.99mph and  the  lap record at  113.26mph. \nAnother impressive performance came from Phil Mel- \nlor on  the latest GSX-R750 with lengthened wheelbase. He \nadded \nalmost \nSmph \nto \nrace \nand \nlap \nspeeds \nin \nClass \nB, \nraising \nthem \nto \n109.23 \nand \n110.69mph, \nrespectively. \nIt \nwas \nthe \nturn \nof \na \nSuzuki \ntwo-stroke \nto \ntriumph \nin \nClass \nC. \nRiding \na \nspecially \nimported \n400cc \nversion \nof \nthe \nnormal \n500cc \n\nPRODUCTION \nMACHINES \nTO \nTHE \nFORE \n#143 \nTrevor Nation advertises Loctite support of his  Yamaha efforts. \nGamma, Gary Padgett raced to  victory after a  wheel- \nto-wheel battle with Malcolm Wheeler on  a  Kawasaki \nGPZ600, which lasted the whole three laps. Padgett’s race \naverage speed was 102.98mph and fastest lap 104.43mph. \nWheeler \nwas \njust \n1 \nsecond \nbehind \nat \nthe \nfinish. \nIn \nClass \nD, \nBarry \nWoodland \nused \nSuzuki's \nsmaller \nGSX-R400 \nfour- \nstroke \nto \ntake \nthe \nwin \nat \na \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nof \n99.82mph, \nMat \nOxley \n(Yamaha) \nsetting \nthe \nfastest \nlap \nat \n100.82mph. \nBoth \nfigures \nwere \n6—7mph \nfaster \nthan \nthe \nprevious \nyear’s \n250 times. \nWith \nBrian \nReid \n(Yamaha) \ncomfortably \nbreaking \nrace \naverage \nand \nlap \nrecords \nin  \nthe  \nFormula \nII  \nevent, \nit  \nreally \nwas \na \nmomentous \nyear \nfor \nproduction-type \nmodels, \npar- \nticularly \nas \nthe \nmajority \nof \nthe \nmachines \nentered \nin \nthe \nFor- \nmula I and Senior TT  races were also production-derived. \nIt was a  state of affairs that saw just the  Junior 250cc race \nbeing contested by some true ‘race’ bikes, plus a  few  of the \ntop runners in  the  Senior, which was won by rising star \nRoger Burnett on  his  3-cylinder, two-stroke Honda. In  a \nrare occurrence, Joey Dunlop slipped off his  250cc Honda \nat  Sulby Bridge in  the  Junior due to  petrol leaking onto \nhis  rear tyre. Unhurt, Dunlop remounted, but  a  damaged \nexhaust forced him to  retire. \nThe Production races were the undoubted success of \nthe 1986 TT, having received support from manufactur- \ners,  dealers, riders and spectators. By doing so,  they looked \nto  have re-established the  category as  an  important part of \nthe  TT  programme, although some had  reservations about \n\n144 HM  PRODUCTION MACHINES TO THE FORE \naspects of the  bikes’ handling at  speed. Strangely, reports \nof the  time failed to  mention how the  substantial 5—7mph \nincreases in lap speeds were achieved. The winning Suzukis \nwere ridden by good, but  arguably not  the  very best, rid- \ners  of the  day and  there had  been no  major changes to  the \ncourse. Therefore it would appear to have been down to the \nmachines, with Suzuki putting in much development effort \nand learning from the  worldwide racing successes of the \nGSX-R750 and its kin. \nTYRES \nOne thing that was changing racing in  the  mid-1980s and \ncontributing to an  increase in lap speeds was  the widespread \nadoption of radial tyres. The old  crossply design could no \nlonger cope with the  increasing strains imposed by high- \npowered race bikes, which created a  build-up of heat and \na falling-off of performance. The new radials were lighter, \nstronger, cooler running and made the  best use  of mod- \nern  materials, utilizing the improved compounds available. \nRacing would push the  development of radial tyres in  the \nensuing years and riders would benefit from the increase in \nperformance they offered. \n1987: FLOURISHING \nTen years after it lost its  World Championship status, the \nTT  was more popular than ever with riders who wanted to \nrace on  the  roads. For  1987 the  organizers tried to  accom- \nmodate as  many entries as  possible and the  upper capac- \nity of the  Senior TT  was increased to  1300cc. That must \nhave been to  accommodate the  biggest production-derived \nmachines, for nobody produced out-and-out racers of that \ncapacity. Similarly, although there was little in  the  way of \nnew 350cc race machinery, the Junior 250  TT  was  opened \nup  to  350cc machines, becoming just  the  Junior TT  and \nthus letting in  some of  the  older 350cc Yamahas. Total \nentries in  1987 were c870, with many riders having multi- \nple entries and  riding in as  many as  six  races. \nThe event as  a  whole was gaining more publicity from \nworldwide showing of race highlights on  satellite televi- \nsion. On-board cameras were getting smaller, so  armchair \nviewers got  an  improved and exciting TT  experience and \nalmost real-time results were available from information \nsources like Ceefax —  felt to  be high-tech in its day. \nThe rate of machine development by the  major manu- \nfacturers increased as  they strove to  take advantage of the \ngrowing publicity arising from the  racing of production \nmachines, and so  improve sales of their roadsters. Their \nglamorous large-capacity superbikes were now expected to \ndeliver race-track performance on  the  road, while being \nequally capable of running down to  the  shops in traffic and \ndelivering \nmotorway \nmile-munching \nperformance \nwhen \nused \nas  \nsports \ntourers. \nThey \nwere \nfar  \nmore \nversatile \nthan \nthe \nproduction-derived \nracers \nand \n‘TT \nReplicas’ \nof \nearlier \ntimes \nand \ncame \nwith \never-increasing \nuse \nof \nnew \ntechnol- \nogy \nin \nall \nareas, \nincluding \nengine, \ncarburation, \nsuspension, \nbrakes, \ntyres \nand \nelectrics. \nCompetition was particularly keen in  the  750cc cate- \ngory, with Kawasaki bringing out  its new GPX750 to  chal- \nlenge Suzuki, Honda and Yamaha, while Honda launched \nits  new CBR600, a  ‘middleweight’ tranverse 4-cylinder \nfour-stroke, for  which it claimed ‘heavyweight’ perform- \nance. That performance, from a  quoted output of 85bhp, \nwould be  progressively increased into a  far  greater figure \nduring its long, and  still continuing, production run. \nThe Mountain Course continued to  be the  supreme test \nfor any new motorcycle, with one  commentator remarking \non  ‘the  multitudinous bumps and  jumps that are  still  left \non  the course in spite of new roadworks every year’. Riders \ngreatly welcomed some smoothing of the  worst bumps on \nSulby Straight prior to  racing in  1987. \nWEATHER \nNow in  its  eightieth year of running, the  one factor that \nthe  TT  organizers had  never been able to  control was the \nweather, and  it affected both practice and  racing in  1987. \nAfter causing delays and postponements during race week, \nits worst impact was  on  the last day’s racing, where Produc- \ntion A and C races were cancelled entirely and  the  Senior \nwas  run  over a shortened distance of four laps. In conditions \nthat  were appalling, Joey Dunlop won at  an  average speed \nof 99.85mph, experiencing, in his words, ‘more slides than \nI've  had  in the  rest of my racing life’, \nRace week had started well, with Dunlop taking his cus- \ntomary Formula I win on  his works Honda at record-break- \ning race average and  lap speeds of 115.03 and 117.55mph. \nHonda had been good supporters of the TT races, but witha \nwidening area of racing to  support and  tightening budgets, \nthe  late 1980s saw  them enter a period where their level of \nsupport of the  TT  varied from year to  year. Dunlop was \nwithout the  ultra-rare RVF for  1987; instead, Mac McDi- \narmid tells in Joey Dunlop —  His Authorised Biography, he was \nprovided with ‘an American Superbike-spec V-four’, still in \nRothmans colours. \nRecords were not  threatened in  the  Sidecar or  Jun- \nior  races, but  a  first TT  win for  rising star Steve Hislop \n(Yamaha) \nsaw \nhim \nlift \nthe \nrecord \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nin \nthe \nFormula \nII \nrace, \nwhere \nEddie \nLaycock \n(Yamaha) \nset \na \nnew \nlap record of 112.36mph. \nIn  \nthe  \ntwo \nProduction \nraces \nthat \nwere \nrun \n—  \nB \nand \nD \n—  \nnew \nrecords \nwere \nset  \nby \nClass \nB \n(750cc) \nwinner \nGeoff \n\nGeoff Johnson rides his  Yamaha to  victory in  1987 Production Race B. \nJohnson and fastest lapper Trevor Nation, while Barry \nWoodland set  new records in Class D (400cc). In a change \nof  manufacturer fortunes, Yamaha took both wins with \ntheir FZR750 and FZR400. \nAmong the rising stars competing in  1987 were Nick Jef- \nferies, \nDave \nLeach, \nSteve \nLinsdell, \nRobert \nDunlop, \nJamie \nWhitham \nand \nCarl \nFogarty, \nwhile \non \nthree \nwheels \nwas \nDave Molyneux. \n} \n—  A \nThe \nFormula \nII  \nrace \nwas \ndropped \nfor  \n1988 \nalthough \nFIl \nrunners \nwere \naccommodated \nas  \na  \nseparate \nclass \nwithin \nthe \nJunior \nrace. \nProduction \nClass \nA \nand \nClass \nB \nwere \ngiven \nindividual \nraces \nand, \nin \na \nfirst \nat \nthe \nTT, \nthe \nrace \nfor \nthe \ncombined \nProduction \nClass \nC \nand \nClass \nD \nmachines \nwas \nrun \non \nthe \nFriday \nevening \nof \npractice \nweek. \nThe \ngrowing \nprofile \nof \nthe \nProduction \nraces \nsaw  \nthe \nsup- \nporting \ntrade \noffering \ngenerous \nbonuses \nto  \nwinning \nrid- \nPRODUCTION MACHINES TO THE FORI 145 \ners  using their tyres, brake pads, oils  and  so  on.  However, \nin  one of those strange twists of racing finance, Honda \nreduced their level of support to  riders, leaving their top \nman, Joey Dunlop, to  put  together his  own sponsorship \ndeals and  fund his  racing. Shell Gemini Oils and  Michelin \nwere among those to  step in  with support and  he  did  not \nlet  them down, taking the  Formula I event on  a  race-kit- \nted  Honda RC30. It was  a  time when the  World Formula I \nChampionship, of which the TT Formula I event was a scor- \ning round and Joey Dunlop a  multi-champion, was facing \ncompetition from a new World Superbike Championship. \nGoing on  to  further reward the  faith shown by his many \nsponsors, Joey Dunlop also  rode to  record-breaking wins \nin the  Junior and Senior races. In the  latter, Steve Cull on \nhis  3-cylinder Honda two-stroke set  a new absolute course \nrecord of 119.08mph, so  bringing the prospect of a 120mph \nlap firmly into view. Somewhat off that pace were the bikes \nfielded in  the Senior by the  returning Norton concern. \n\n146 PRODUCTION MACHINES TO THE FORE \nSporting Gemini Oil  stickers, Joey Dunlop prepares to \ndepart on  yet another lap of the Mountain Course. \ng maker \nof the  same the  name, the  Nortons were ridden by Trevor \nHaving little connection with the multi-TT-winnin \nNation and Simon Buckmaster. With air-cooled, flame- \nspitting rotary engines, they added interest to  the  event \nand  both finished the  race. \nThe growing importance of the  Production races meant \nthat stakes were higher and that every possible advantage \nwas taken of the  rule book in  the  bid  to  turn out  faster \nmachines. This led to  much behind-the-scenes murmuring \nabout eligibility and compliance, but  that was the  Way it \nhad always been in  racing, for  it was a  highly competitive \narena. Mick Grant, now in race management, claimed there \nwas  a saying in racing: ‘you should never fall behind in your \ncheating, but  never get too  far ahead’. Not that Grant was \nadvocating cheating, but  he  firmly believed that the  rules \nwere there to  be  pushed as  far  as  possible. Thus the  rule \nbook got ever thicker. \nOnce again the Production races yielded substantial \nadvances in race average and lap speeds. In the  Production \nA race, Dave Leach upped the race average speed by 2’2mph \nand  Geoff Johnson the  lap record by 3mph on  their Yamaha \nFZR1100 models, chased home by a batch of Suzuki GSX- \nR1100s and  Kawasaki’s new 1000cc ZX-10. In  Production \nB,  winner Steve Hislop (Honda) increased the  race aver- \nage  speed by 22mph and  Geoff Johnson (Yamaha) the  lap \nrecord by just over Imph. A titanic battle in  Production \nC between Steve Hislop and Brian Morrison on  their new \nHonda CBR600s saw  Morrison take the win and add almost \n6mph to  the  race average, while Hislop added just over \n6mph to  the  lap record. They were phenomenal increases \nand only in  Production D  were things more modest, with \nwinner Barry Woodland on a specially imported Yamaha \nFZR400R adding 0.43mph to  the lap record but leaving his \nown race average record intact. It was a  surprisingly lean \nyear for  former Production frontrunners Suzuki, whose \nbest results were fourth in  Production A and B.  However, \nthey were seriously under-funded at the time, compared to \nsome of the  works opposition. \nSuzuki did introduce their new GSX-600F roadster in \n1988 and, in what was  a growing trend to use  techno-speak \nBarry \nWoodland \nrounds \nQuarter \nBridge \non  \nhis  \n400cc \nYamaha \non  \nhis \nway \nto  \nvictory \nin  \n1988 \nProduction \nRace \nD. \n\nand \nacronyms, \nclaimed \nthat \nthis \nbike \n‘with \nimpeccable \nrac- \ning \npedigree’ \ncame \nwith \n‘Twin \nSwirl \nCombustion, \nSACS \n(Suzuki \nAdvanced \nCooling \nSystem), \nMicroprocessor \nCon- \ntrolled \nIgnition \nand \nDeca \nPiston \nBrakes’. \nAll \nwere \nstandard \nfeatures, \navailable \nnew \nfor \n£3,199. \nSIDECARS \nAmong the  sidecars, top  runners like Mick Boddice and \nLowry Burton were notching wins and  fastest laps of 106— \n107mph on  their Yamaha-powered outfits, but  still falling \nshort of Jock Taylor’s absolute lap record of  108.29mph, \nset back in  1982. Roy Hanks was in his twenty-second year \nof racing sidecars at  the  TT, but  showed that danger was \never-present when he  left  the  road near the  Thirty-third \nMilestone and  plunged down the  mountainside. The result \nwas broken limbs for  him and his  passenger-nephew Tom \nHanks, but they lived to race again. Their crash brought one \nof the rescue helicopters to  the  scene and  they became two \nof the roughly fifteen riders air-lifted to hospital at each TT. \nFortunately, many of those require only a  check-over. The \nhelicopters are  a hugely expensive part of the race organiza- \ntion but are  recognized life-savers. Costs increased for  1988 \nwhen the  Civil Aviation Authority decreed that the  single- \nengined choppers be  replaced with twin-engined versions \nas  they needed to  fly over built-up areas. \nDave Saville was a regular winner of the Formula 2 Side- \ncar  class, but  he  lost  out  to  Mick Hamblin in  1988. Aver- \nage  race-winning speeds for the  Formula 2 machines were \nc95mph, with 350cc Yamaha two-stroke engines being the \npower unit of choice. \n1989: MORE CHANGES \nNew for  1989 were races for  Supersport 400 and Super- \nsport 600cc machines, which took the  place of the  former \nProduction C and D races. Like the  Produc- \ntion classes, Supersport machines raced on \ntreaded tyres, but  modifications to  engines \nand suspension were allowed. The two \nremaining races for  production bikes were \nrenamed Production 750 and Production \n1300. \nReintroduced \nwas \na \nrace \nfor \nLight- \nweight \n125s, \nwhich \nlast \nran \non \nthe \nMountain \nCourse \nin \n1974. \nFalling \nin \nline \nwith \nFIM \nregulations, \ntwin-cylinder \nfour-strokes \nup \nto \n1,000cc \nwere \nallowed \nto \nenter \nthe \nFormula \nI race. \nSteve \nHenshaw \nand \nMark \nFarmer \nblast \nthrough \nthe \nbottom \nof \nBarregarrow. \nPRODUCTION MACHINES TO THE FORE MW  147 \nAllsolo and sidecar classes were filled by Yamaha, Honda, \nSuzuki and an  occasional Kawasaki machine. Those look- \ning long and hard at  the  entry lists might spot a  couple of \nEuropean makers’ names, with Steve Hazlett (EMC) best \nperformer with third place in the  Junior, but  the  only oth- \ners  to  be seen were a couple of Ducatis in the  larger classes. \nThe strong Rotax-powered challenge of a  few  years before \nseemed to  have faded away. \nThe top bikes were getting higher specifications and \nprices, with Honda’s RC30 costing £9,500 and Yamaha’s \nOW01 £12,000. The latter was quoted as  giving 121bhp, \ncomplete with EXUP (exhaust ultimate power valve), alu- \nminium perimeter frame and so  on.  For those serious about \nwinning, the  expense did  not  stop there, for  there were \nmany go-faster modifications that could be  applied to  a \nstandard machine. Joining the  TT  party for  1989 was the \nmuch cheaper Kawasaki ZXR750, which came in  Kawa- \nsaki’s traditional green. \nJohn Reynolds was a  three-times British Superbike \nchampion in the  1990s and  2000s, but only tackled the TT \non  one  occasion —  1989. In his words: ‘It pretty well scared \nme  to  death’. He  told in Motorcycle Racer in  2015: \nIt was  back in  1989; I’d just signed for Kawasaki and  they \noffered me  the  chance to  go  out  there just to  see if I liked \nit,  with no  pressure. I was  coming up to  a  place called Bar- \nregarrow on  a  Superbike and Steve Hislop came past me, \njust as  I was  shutting off the throttle for the corner. He  was \nstill accelerating and changing up  a  gear as  he  went into \nBarregarrow. His  bike bottomed out, I saw dust come off \nthe fairing as  it ground out  on  the floor and he disappeared \noff into the distance towards Kirk Michael. I thought, ‘You \nknow what? If that’s what you  have to  do to  win  a  TT, you \ncan  keep it —  there’s no  way I’m  ever going to  do that.’ \n\n148 HM  PRODUCTION MACHINES TO THE FORE \nJoey Dunlop was  not  fit to ride in  1989, for he was  recover- \ning from an  early-season injury suffered at  Brands Hatch, \nwhich would affect his  riding of big bikes for  some years \nahead. There was no  shortage of  up-and-coming riders \neager to  take advantage of his absence. \nCourse conditions from Ginger Hall to  Ramsey had \nalways been among the roughest, and in  1989, riders \nfighting their bikes through the  stretch described them as \nnoticeably worse. \nRECORD SPEEDS \nIn  a  year of eight solo TT  races and two sidecar, records \nwere broken in  all  solo and  in  one  of the  sidecar races. It \nwas  an  outstanding year for speed and American rider Chris \nCrew wrote of what was  required, saying, ‘You have to bet \nyour life  you know where the  next corner is  going over \nthe  crest of the  next hill.’ Of those crests, he said, “you go \nover wide open in top gear, 155  or  160mph, whatever the \nbike will pull, with your elbows and  toes tucked in,  head \nunder the  fairing, just watching the  white line, trying to \nsee  through the bugs’. \nMan of  the  week at  the 1989 TT  was Steve Hislop. \nAlready a  TT  winner, “Hizzy’ came with machines from \nHonda and  put his name firmly in the  record books with a \nhat-trick of wins at record speeds, which included the first \n120mph lap.

With a response that echoed the comments \nof many of the  great road racers of the  past, he  advised, \n‘work at the bends to get the best out  of the straights so  that \nyou can  carry the  speed with rhythm and flow, that’s the \nkey to  TT  success’. \nSpeeds were also  increased in  the  Junior race, won by \nJohnny Rea, with the  fastest lap coming from Eddie Lay- \ncock. It was Laycock who took victory in  the  Supersport \n400 race, with Production 1300 going to  Dave Leach and \nProduction 750 to  Carl Fogarty. Inevitably, records were \nbroken in the returning Lightweight 125  class, where Rob- \nert  Dunlop lapped at  103.02mph to secure his first TT win. \nAn  indication of what was achieved in this super-speedy \nyear is shown below, with previous records shown on  the \nleft and 1989 figures on  the  right: \nTop speeds 1989 \n119.36mph \nLil. 34mph \n118.23mph \n120.69mph \n107. 17mph * Formerly Production Class C and D. \n108.31mph \n** \nPrevious \nbest \nfigures \nset \nby \nBill \nIvy \nin  1968. \n115.61mph \n117.27mph A study of the  results from 1989 \nshowed that several established \n114.68mph midfield TT  runners, whose \nI \n16.91mph \nbest \nriding \ndays \nwere \nover, \nwere \nanya \nPosone \nPee \nlap \ntimes \nthan \n113.60mph \na \nDeas \npersonal \nbests. \nith course Improvements \n105.27mph \nlimited \nto \nthe \neasing \nof \nthe \ninside \n106.90mph \nof \nBrandywell’s \nleft-hander, \nit \ngave \na clear indication that it was faster \n102. \n56mph \nmachines \nthat \nwere \nresponsible \nfor \n103.02mph boosting their lap speeds. \n\nA PRICETO PAY \nEveryone —  manufacturers, rid- \ners, race commentators and \nspectators —  gloried in  the  high \nspeeds shown at  the 1989 TT, \nbut they came at  a  huge price, \nfor  five riders were killed dur- \ning practice and racing. Passen- \nger  Marco Fattorelli lost his  life \nin  a  practice incident, as  did  the \ndriver of a  separate sidecar out- \nfit,  John Mulcahy. At  Ballagarey \nCorner in  Friday morning’s prac- \ntice, 23-year-old local man Phil \nHogg was killed when he  fell \nfrom his  Yamaha after its  engine \nseized. Come the  racing, during \nWednesday’s Production 1300 \nrace double tragedy struck. Pre- \nvious TT  winner Phil Mellor was \nkilled when he fell at Doran’s Bend \nand, shortly after, Steve Henshaw \nsuffered the  same fate after fall- \ning at  Quarry Bends. Both Mel- \nlor and Henshaw were thirty-five \nand professional motorcycle rac- \ners. TT competitors were used \nto  coping with tragedies in  their \ndangerous sport, but this was too \nmuch for  some, who packed and \nleft  the  Island in  shock before the \nlast  of the  week’s racing. \nThe 1989 TT closed with \ndoubts being expressed by those \nclose to  the  racing about just how \nmuch faster production bikes \ncould go on  standard tyres, brakes \nand suspension. A  less technical \nview came from some spectators, \nwho claimed they were too  quiet \nand all looked alike. \nNo  doubt with the  need for  safer racing in  the  forefront \nof \ntheir \nminds, \nthe \norganizers \ndropped \nthe \npure \nProduc- \ntion \nraces \nA \n(1300cc) \nand \nB \n(750cc) \nfrom \nthe \n1990 \nTT \nrace \nschedule. \nThis \nstill \nleft \nthe \nproduction-derived \nSuper- \nsport \n400 \nand \n600 \nevents, \nwhere \nthe \nextra \nmodifications \nallowed \nwere \nconsidered \nto \ncreate \nmachines \nbetter \nsuited \nto \nracing. \nA \nsimilar \nsituation \napplied \nin \nthe \nFormula \nI \nand \nPRODUCTION MACHINES TO THE FORI 149 \nRiders are dwarfed by the stone wall at  the tight ‘S’  of Handiey’s Corner. \nSenior events, where most of the machines taking part were \nproduction-derived, but  much modified. \nThe decision to  drop the Production races seemed a \ndrastic one after all  the  favourable attention given to  their \nracing. Perhaps, though, in  their search for  publicity and \nglory, the manufacturers had lost the  balance between \npower and  handling, something that has always been essen- \ntial  for machines raced over the  TT  Mountain Course. \nThat was not  the  only change for  1990. Among others \nwere that maximum permitted engine size in  the Senior \ns \n\n150 PRODUCTION MACHENES TO: THE FORE \nrace was reduced to  750cc; competitors were now des- \npatched from the  start singly at  10-second intervals rather \nthan in pairs; and  in an  attempt to  improve safety in the pit \nlane, a  ‘stop box’ was introduced at  its  entrance, aimed at \nslowing riders’ passage through what could be a  congested \narea. \nSidecars were also subject to  a  reduction in  capacity in \n1990, the  former limit of 1000cc being dropped, and  eve- \nryone was required to  conform with the  Formula 2 engine \nspecifications, races for  which had been run in  tandem \nwith the  Sidecar A  and B races since 1984. They permit- \nted  two-strokes up to  350cc and  four-strokes up to  600cc. \nTwo-strokes had taken all  the  wins to  date and that was \nrepeated in  1990, when Yamaha-powered Dave Saville and \nhis  green-and-yellow Sabre-sponsored outfit came home \nfirst in both races at  record Formula 2 speeds, with a fast- \nest  lap of 100.97mph. At this  stage the  600cc four-strokes \nwere a little off the pace, but that would change. \nFormula I machines were the  same as  the  previous year \nonly faster, with young hot-shots like Carl Fogarty, Steve \nHislop, Nick Jefferies, Dave Leach, Trevor Nation, Ian \nLougher, Bob  Jackson and  Phillip McCallen chasing a fat \nprize purse of £6,000 for a  start-to-finish winner. Victory \nwent to  Carl Fogarty (Honda) with Steve Hislop (Honda) \nbreaking the  absolute lap record in pursuit and  leaving it at \n122.63mph. Joey Dunlop (Honda) was  back in  1990, but \nnot really up to racing a 750 at its maximum. He had to settle \nfor  eighth place. With the  capacity limit for the  Senior TT \nnow reduced to  750cc, riders were using their FI bikes in \nthe  Senior, with minor adjustments to  suit  the rules. How- \never, no  real comparison could be  made between 1990’s \n750s and  the  1000s of 1989, due  to  the  Senior race being \nweather-affected. Victory went to  Carl Fogarty (Honda), at \na relatively lowly race average speed of 110.95mph. \nAfter taking a  fine second place in  the  Formula I race \non  his works Mitsui Yamaha, Nick Jefferies gave an  indica- \nDave \nSaville \nand \nNick \nRoche \nblast \noff \nfrom \nthe \nstart \non  \ntheir \nFormula \n2 \noutfit \nin  \n1990. \n\nPRODUCTION MACHINES TO THE FORE W@   151 \nNick Jefferies leans his  big Yamaha inte Braddan Bridge. \nTrevor \nNation \nleads \nRobert \nDunlop \nthrough \nthe \nfast \nbends \nof \nthe \nThirty-third \nMilestone \non  \ntheir \nrotary-engined Nortons. \n\n152 M  PRODUCTION MACHINES TO THE FORE \ntion of the  commitment required to  achieve such a  plac- \ning by saying, ‘The only places it got out  of control were \nthose places where you expect to  be  out  of control.’ Fast \nand  reliable, Jefferies had been looking for a good finish in \nthe  Senior, but  it was not  to  be.  In  mixed weather condi- \ntions, he hit a wet  spot climbing Lambfell, lost traction and \ncrashed. He  described the  aftermath of his  120mph spill \nwith ‘Silence! Running feet, shouts, radio messages, the \nworld spinning round.’ \nThe ‘new’ Norton marque had  a good year, with Robert \nDunlop taking third spot in the  Formula I race and  Trevor \nNation coming second in  the  Senior. Spectators loved the \ndistinctive high-revving sound of the  rotary Norton, and \nDunlop told that with his  9-stone weight, the  black-and- \ngold machine would spin up the  rear tyre in all gears, even \nin the dry. \nIn good conditions, new race average and lap speeds were \nset by Dave Leach (Yamaha) in winning the Supersport 400 \nrace and he also set  a new lap record in the Supersport 600, \nwhere victory went to  Brian Reid (Yamaha), at just below \nrecord speed. Over half of the  sixty entrants in  the  four- \nlap Supersport 400 race were mounted on  a  mixture of \nYamaha 400RRSP, Honda VFR400 and Kawasaki ZX R400 \nmachines. None of  those were big sellers in  the British \nmarket, but revving to  14,000—15,000rpm, they were the \nrecognized four-stroke bikes for the  race. The two-strokes \ncontesting the  class comprised Suzuki RGV250 and  Kawa- \nsaki KRI250S models, both being closer to  race replicas \nthan roadsters. \nSteve Hislop (Honda) and  Ian  Lougher (Yamaha) had  a \nmomentous \nbattle \nin  \nthe  \nJunior \nrace, \nwith \nthe  \nlead \nsee- \nsawing \nfrom \nlap \nto \nlap. \nWhile \nHislop \nwas \nprobably \nfavourite \nfor \nthe \nwin, \nLougher \nheld \nhim \noff \nby \n1.8 \nseconds \nto \ntake \nhis \nfirst \nTT \nvictory \nand \nat \nrecord-breaking \nspeeds. \nIt \nwas \na special \nrace \nand \nto \nLougher \nwent \nthe \nnew \nrace \naverage \nrecord \nof \n115.16mph \nand \nthe \nnew \nlap \nrecord \nof \n117.80mph. \nBoth \nspeeds \nwere \n3mph \nup \non \nthe \nprevious \nbest \nand \nwere \nto \nstand \nfor \nsome \nyears. \nThat \nis \nperhaps \nunderstandable, \nconsidering \nHislop’s \nwords, \n‘the \nlast \nlap \nof \nthat \nrace \nwas \nwithout \nquestion \nthe \nhardest \nI \never \nhad, \nand \never \nwould \nride \na \nmotorcycle \nround \nthe \nIsle \nof \nMan’. \nHislop’s \ncause \nwas \nnot \nhelped \nby \na \npit \nstop \nin \nwhich \nhis \nfiller \ncap \nwas \ndropped \ninside \nthe \nfairing, \nlosing \nhim \nseveral \nfumbling \nseconds \nwhile \nit \nwas \nrecovered. \nAlong with Steve Hislop and Ian  Lougher, the third \nmember of the  talented MGP Newcomers podium of 1983 \nwas Robert Dunlop. In  1990 he took his  second TT  win, \nbreaking his  own records in  the  Ultra Lightweight 125cc \nrace. Dunlop was Honda RS-mounted, as  was every one  of \nthe  fifty other riders in the  race. \nSpeed was a particularly special commodity to  125s on \nthe Mountain Course and, once gained, they were reluctant \nto  relinquish it,  maintaining very high corner speeds and \ndiving over and under bigger race machinery they came \nacross in  bends. During a race, slipstreaming other riders \nwas important, as  were tricks such as  riding in  the  lee  of \nroadside banks to  lessen the  effect of the  wind. The Ultra \nLightweight 125s ran  at the same time as  the Supersport 400 \nrace and, setting off immediately after the  400s, their top \nriders were soon mixing it with the  bigger bikes. Indeed, \nthey were often held up by them. \nThe 125s may have been fast for \ntheir size, but  it was among the  big- \ncapacity bikes contesting the For- \nmula I and Senior TTs that ultimate \nlap  records were regularly broken. \nIn the  period 1983—90, the  outright \nlap record went from 116.19mph to \n122.63mph. \nRadio TT  broadcast round-the- \ncourse commentaries on  all  races, \nand in  1990 its commentary box \nwas close to  the action at  Ballaugh \nBridge, where commentator Geoff \nCannell would have admired Steve \nCull’s controlled leap. \n\nCHAPTER NINE \nJAN  (CLONING \nRacing motorcycles has always been an  expensive past- \ntime. Attempts to  cut  costs by shifting the  emphasis to  the \nracing of production-derived machines in  the  1980s were \npartly offset by the  never-ending spending on  expensive \nmodifications, aimed at  gaining an  advantage over other \ncompetitors. Speed was an  extremely costly commodity. \nThere were a  few genuine private runners at  each TT, \nbut the  majority of riders had their racing sponsored by \nothers. At the top end  of the  scale this would be full works \nsupport with machinery, a riding fee and  all expenses paid. \nIn  1991 riders entered by Mitsui Yamaha, JPS Norton Rac- \ning, Silkolene Honda Britain and Team Green Kawasaki \nwould have received the highest level of support. Other rid- \ners  would have their bikes supplied, but have to  meet some \nelement of costs. Their bikes would have come from names \nlike Millar Racing, Smith &  Aldridge, Shirlaws Motorcy- \ncles, Bill  Smith Motors and McMenemy Motors Racing. \nFurther down the  scale, it was the  rider who supplied the \nbike, with companies or  generous friends helping to  pay \nentry and  running costs, usually in return for  seeing their \nnames on  the  fairing. Few of those riders had the  finan- \ncial  contingency to  cope with a major mechanical disaster, \nwhich could be quite common over TT  fortnight, particu- \nlarly for those using ‘tired’ equipment. \nIn  the  early 1990s the  organizers provided about £250 \nto \neach \nrider \nto \nhelp \nwith \ncosts, \nplus \nappearance \nmoney \nto \nthe \nstars \nand \nprize \nmoney \ntotalling \n£129,000. \nMost \nof \nthe \nlatter \nwent \nto \nthe \ntop \nfinishers, \nand \nriding \nthe \nTT \nstill \ncost \na \nmid-field \nsponsor \nor \nrider \nthousands \nof \npounds. \nWhile \ntalking \nof  \ncosts, \nHonda \nfelt \nthe \nTT \nwas \nsuf- \nficiently \nimportant \nto \nsend \ntwo \nof \ntheir \nRVF750 \nmodels \nfor \nSteve \nHislop \nand \nCarl \nFogarty \nto \nuse \nin \n1991. \nSaid \nto \ndeliver \n145bhp, \nthe \nmotorcycle \npress \nestimated \nthe \nvalue \nof \nthese \nultra-special \nendurance-based \nmodels \nat \nbetween \n£250,000 \nand \n£500,000 \neach. \n‘Foggy’ \nwas \nriding \nhis \nin \njust \nthe \nFormula \nI \nrace \nand \nJoey \nDunlop \nwas \nto \nuse \nit \nin \nthe \nSenior. \nDave \nLeach \nwas \nalso \nsaid \nto \nhave \nthe \nuse \nof \na \nfull \nworks \nFVR750 \nYamaha \n— \nvalue \nnot \nquoted. \nYamaha \ngenerated \nmuch \npublicity \nover \nthe \nfact \nthat \n1991 \nwas \nthe  \nthirtieth \nanniversary \nof \ntheir \nfirst \nparticipation \nin \nIBSIULSIUN Te sys \nthe TT.  History shows that, along with other Japanese man- \nufacturers, they reshaped the  world of motorcycle racing \nduring those thirty years. However, not  all  of them had \ntotally mastered the  demands of the TT —  Kawasaki had  to \nwithdraw Ian  Lougher’s entry from the  Formula I and  Sen- \nior races, as  they could not  get their 750  to handle properly \nover the  Mountain Course. \n1991: PRACTICE \nIt was a  time when riders had three early-morning prac- \ntice sessions, five evening ones and a  Thursday afternoon \nin which to  learn their way around 37% miles and get up to \nrace speed. It really was not  long for newcomers over such \na  demanding course. Typically, many new riders experi- \nenced problems that would see  them missing a session, thus \nreducing the  learning time and, as  in  1991, the  first ses- \nsion was lost to  all competitors, due to  heavy mist. In one \nof those vagaries of Manx weather, that mist was between \nBallacraine and Kirk Michael and not, as  it  usually was, \nover the Mountain. Experienced runners used the  prac- \ntice sessions to  reacquaint themselves with the  course and \nlearn any  changes. They also spent much time fine-tuning \ntheir machinery to  the  particular needs of the  Mountain \nCourse so  they could ride it to  its  limits. A  rolling-road \ndynamometer was now available in the Paddock for them to  _ \nexperiment with engine settings, but  handling could only \nbe assessed out  on  the  course. \nIn  \n1991, \nriders \ncompleted \na  \ntotal \nof \n3,330 \nlaps \nof \nprac- \ntice, \nwith \nthe \nracing \nthat \nfollowed \ntimetabled \nfor \nSaturday, \nMonday, \nWednesday \nand \nFriday. \nRACING \nA  \ncompetitive \nfield \nof  \npast \nTT \nwinners, \nplus \nthrusting \nyoung \nriders \nwith \nsights \nset  \non  \na \nfirst \nwin, \nlike \nPhillip \nMcCallen, \nJim \nMoodie \nand \nBob \nJackson, \nmeant \nthat \nlap \nrecords \nwere \nunofficially \nbroken \nin \nmost \nclasses \nduring \npractice. \nSteve \nHislop \nand \nCarl \nFogarty \nheld \ncentre \nstage, \nalternately \nlifting \neach \nother’s \nspeeds \nfrom \nsession \nto \nses- \nsion \nin \nthe \npremier \n750 \nFormula \nI \nand \nSenior \nclasses. \nCome \nthe \nopening \nFormula \nI race, \nthe \ntwo \nof \nthem \nbattled \nwheel \n\n154 HM   A  COSTLY BUSINESS \n—— \neS \nCarl Fogarty (8) and Steve Hislop (11) enter the pits during the 1991 Formula I race to  refuel their 750cc Silkolene \nHonda Britain machines. Hislop was almost 30  seconds ahead of Fogarty at this point in the race. \nto  wheel in  the  early laps, before Hislop gradually eased \naway to  win by just over 1 minute, at a  record race average \nspeed of  121.00mph and a  new lap record of 123.48mph. \nJoey Dunlop brought his RC30 Honda home in third place. \nIt was a  similar situation in  the  Senior race, where Hislop \nagain used the  RVF to  win from Joey Dunlop and  Phil- \nlip McCallen, so  making it another Honda-filled podium \nat record speeds. \nSteve Hislop was the  man on  form at  the 1991 TT  and \nsecured a  third win in  the week in  the Supersport 600 \nrace at record speeds, riding Honda’s updated CBR-F2. As \nusual, the Junior race was  fiercely contested, Robert Dun- \nlop (Honda) taking the win and  Phillip McCallen (Honda) \nthe  fastest lap, at  slightly less  than the  exceptional record- \nbreaking speeds of 1990. \nThe Supersport 400 and Ultra Lightweight 125 races \nwere again run together, and while the mixed weather \nconditions held Dave Leach’s winning speed down a lit- \ntle  on  his 400 Yamaha, Robert Dunlop broke race average \nand lap records as  he  took his  125  Honda to  a  third con- \nsecutive win. He  described riding a  125  over the  Mountain \nCourse with the words, ‘you just sit there with it buzzing at \n13,000rpm and  wait for the corners to  come’. \nInterviewed after a  race, many riders will tell of  an \nuneventful ride and no  problems, but  not  everyone rides \nsmoothly to  victory. After his  Supersport 400 win, Dave \nLeach told how he thought his  race was over when, at  the \nMountain Box ‘I slid on  the white line. I was  nearly off.  The \nfront end just turned under me. My head was  down over the \nfront wheel and  my helmet hit the mudguard. It was a near \nmiss.’ Taking the  racing line around the  Mountain Course \nmeans that riders are  frequently crossing the  painted road \nmarkings while cranked over. Applied in a specially formu- \nlated ‘non-slip’ paint, there are  occasional complaints about \nsome lines being slipperier than others. \nWith two-stroke sidecar specialist Dave Saville unable \nto  compete in  1991 due to  injury, Mick Boddice took a \ndouble win with his  four-stroke Honda, at a little below \nrecord speeds. Boddice’s win was the  start of a takeover of \nthe  sidecar class by four-stroke power. \n\nCranked \nover \nand \napplying \npower \nwhile \ncrossing \nthe \nwhite \nlines. \nFASTEST \nClocked \nby \na  \npolice \nradar \ngun, \nSteve \nHislop’s \nannounced \nspeed \nof \n192mph \non \nthe \nSulby \nStraight \nin \n1991 \nhad \neveryone \ntalking \n— \nand \nsome \ndoubting. \nThe \nman \nhimself \nsaid \n“That’s \nscary, \nit’s \nfrighteningly \nfast, \nat \nthe \nspeeds \nwe’re \ndoing \nyou \njust \nhead \nfor \nthe \ngaps \nbetween \nthe \ngreen \nbits.’ \nHislop \nand \nCarl \nFogarty \npushed \neach \nother \nvery \nhard \nthat \nyear, \nand \nboth \nexpressed \nconcerns \nabout \nthe  \nspeeds \nbeing \nachieved. \nTHE COURSE \nOver \nthe  \nfollowing \nwinter \nthe  \n2-mile \nstretch \nof \nroad \nfrom \nthe \nTwenty-sixth \nMilestone \nto  \nthe \nMountain \nBox \nwas \nreconstructed \nand \nthere \nwere \nsimilar \nworks \nfrom \nWindy \nCorner \nto \nthe \nThirty-third \nMilestone. \nAt \nthe \nvery \nleast \nthis \nprovided \nriders \nwith \na \nsmoother \nsurface \non \nwhich \nto \nrace, \nand \nno  \ndoubt \na  \nfew \nbanks \nwere \ntrimmed \nback, \nroadside \ngutters \nfilled \nin \nand \ncambers \nadjusted. \nCompetitors \nwould \ntake \nadvantage \nof \nevery \nextra \ninch \nof \nextra \nroad \noffered \nif \nit \nimproved \nthe \nracing \nline, \nand \nthose \nworks \nmust \nhave \nhelped \nreduce lap times. \nFine \nperformances \nfrom \nsolo \nriders \nBrian \nReid, \nPhillip \nMcCallen \nand \nJoey \nDunlop, \nplus \nsidecar \nman \nGeoff \nBell, \nsaw \nthem \ntake \nwins \nand \nbreak \nrecords \nthroughout \nrace \nweek \non  \nYamaha \nand  \nHonda \nmachinery. \nIn \ntaking \nthe \nUltra \nLightweight \n125cc \nwin \nfrom \nbrother \nRobert, \nforty-year-old \nJoey \nDunlop \nequalled \nMike \nHailwood’s \ntotal \nof \nfourteen \nTT \nwins. \nHowever, \nafter \nthe \nstirring \n“big-bike’ \nFormula \nI \nrace \nthat \nopened \nthe \nweek’s \nracing \nwith \na \nfirst \nTT \nwin \nfor \n\n156 IN  (CCOSTMI IBUISIINTESS \nPhillip McCallen (Honda), most spectators spent the  inter- \nvening days preparing themselves for  more battles in  the \nfinal race of the  week, the  Senior TT.  There was  definitely \ntension in the  air  in  1992. \nA GREAT RACE \nSteve Hislop and Carl Fogarty had shown themselves to  be \nthe  premier racing talents at  the  previous year’s TT. Both \nwere enthusiastic over the event and were proud of the wins \nthey achieved in  Island racing early in  their careers. But \nthen came a  change of attitude as  they set  their sights on \nthe  wider field of racing and the  world stage. Both had left \nthe TT  in  1991, indicating that they were moving on.  It was \na  surprise to  everyone, not  least themselves, to  find them \nback racing at  the  1992 event, with Hislop entered on  Nor- \nton, Honda and Yamaha machinery from several sources \nand Fogarty on  a  Loctite Yamaha OWO1 for  the  Formula | \nand Senior TTs, plus a  Supersport machine. \nComing to  the  TT  after just eight troubled laps’ prac- \ntice around Oulton Park on  the  under-funded rotary Nor- \nton, a  machine with different characteristics to  any other \nrace machinery, Steve Hislop was not optimistic about his \nSteve \nHislop \non  \nhis  \nrotary-engined \nNorton, \nwhich \nbecame \nknown \nas  \nthe \n‘White \nCharger’. \n\nchances, \neven \nafter \nrespectable \nshowings \nin  \npractice, \non \nwhat \nwas \na  \n588cc-rated \nbike \nsaid \nto  \ndeliver \n150bhp. \nHow- \never, \nhe \nwas \nmuch \nencouraged \nby \na \ngood \nsecond \nplace \nto \nPhillip \nMcCallen \n(Honda) \nin \nthe \nweek’s \nopening \nFormula \nJ \nrace, \neven \nthough \nit was \none \nin \nwhich \nCarl \nFogarty \nled \nfor \nthe \nfirst \nfive \nlaps \nbefore \nretiring \nwith \ngearbox \nproblems. \nThe Senior race received a  big build-up in  1992, for \nmuch was expected of the  two young gladiators, Fogarty \nand Hislop. With Fogarty starting at  number 4 and Hislop \nat  number 19,  they were 2’  minutes apart on  the  road, \nso  it was to  be  a  typical against-the-clock race and one in \nwhich they did  not  see  each other out  on  the  track. It was \nalso a  race in  which there were other potential winners, \nfor  Phillip McCallen, Joey Dunlop and  Nick Jefferies were \nall riding top machines for  Castrol Honda, Robert Dunlop \nwas on  another Norton and Trevor Nation on  a Ducati 888. \nAs  expected, the 1992 Senior TT  turned into a battle \nroyal on  track between Steve Hislop and  Carl Fogarty. Both \nknew the Senior TT  had recovered much of its  prestige, \nthat the  manufacturers all  valued a  win and that, as  top \nTT  riders, they had  the  opportunity to  show their worth \nto  the  racing world. There was also the  small matter of a \npersonal battle to  show who was top  dog in  Island racing. \nBoth gave it  their all  over 226 racing miles and the  lead \nsee-sawed from lap to  lap, with pit-stop drama of wheel \nchanges and dropped fuel caps adding to  the  excitement. \nOn  the last lap Hislop held a narrow advantage but Fogarty \nmade a huge effort with the fastest lap of the race and a new \nabsolute course record of 123.61mph. However, it was  not \nenough, for  Hislop was only 1 second slower and with the \ncourse-side crowds cheering him on,  he kept his lead to the \nflag, to  win by just 4.4  seconds. It was no  surprise that his \nwinning speed was also a  new record average race figure \nof 121.28mph. \nThere were scenes of jubilation at  this British Norton \nwin, which was backed by Robert Dunlop bringing his \nNorton into third. The last  TT  win by a  Norton had  been \nMike Hailwood’s in  1961, where his race average speed was \n100.60mph and  fastest lap 101.30mph. \nThe 1992 TT  was voted a  particularly good one and the \nSenior race was one that would be  talked of for  years to \ncome. \nAmong \nriders \nwho \ncaught \nthe \neye \nand \nlooked \nlikely \nto \nget \na \nshare \nof \nthe \nglory \nin \nfuture \nyears \nwere \nSteve \nWard, \nRobert Holden, Iain Duffus and  Mark Farmer. \nTrade \nsupporters \nof \nthe  \nevent, \nlike \nMichelin, \nwere \nable \nto \nadvertise \nthat \ntheir \nequipment \nwas \nused \nby \nmost \nof \nthe \ntop \nsolo \nwinners \n— \nfor \nexample, \nSupersport \n400 \nand \n600 \nwins \nachieved \non \nMichelin’s \nstandard \nTX \nHi-Sport \nRadi- \nals. \nPirelli \nadvertising \ntold \nthat \ntheir \nKevlar-carcassed \nMP7 \nSports \nRadial \nwas \n‘so \nsticky \nit \ncan \ngive \nslicks \na \nrun \nfor \ntheir \nA  COSTLY BUSINESS MH  157 \nTT  \nHISTORY \nMADE \nON \nMICHELIN \nNorton men re-write 31  years of \nIsle  of Man TT  history.

Avon’s Kevlar belts and computer-designed tread \naided their AM22/23 tyres for sports roadsters, while Met- \nzeler claimed to  be  ‘the most successful Production Tyre \nof  the decade’. Tyre manufacturers were in  business to \nincrease sales and profits. They knew that racing success \ncontributed to both of those, so  they put development effort \ninto producing better tyres. In turn, this  allowed riders to \ngo  faster, particularly as  changing tyres mid-race on  the \nbigger bikes was  now becoming more common amongst the \ntop riders, permitting the  use  of compounds that provided \nmore grip, even if they wore faster. \nGETTINGTOO FAST? \nAfter the 1992 Senior race, both Steve Hislop and Carl \nFogarty called for  the introduction of  an  upper engine \ncapacity limit of 600cc at  the  TT, for  they felt  the  750s \nwere getting too  fast  for  the  course. Hislop explained: ‘it \nwould limit the mind-numbing spots like  Sulby Straight and \nGlen Duff, where the 750s are  going so  quick on  the bumps \nyou can’t focus properly’. Not everyone agreed, but  Hislop \npointed out  that there was a  huge difference between the \n\n158 PEO Si SB USINESS \ndemands imposed while riding a  record-breaking 123mph \nlap and those felt  during a  good runner’s 120mph one. He \nalso knew that bikes would get ever quicker. Easing of the \nbank at  Kate’s Cottage, resurfacing the  corner at  the  Creg \nand  slight easing at  Signpost Corner after construction ofa \nmini roundabout, meant that the  course also continued to \nget  ‘quicker’. \nMessrs Hislop and Fogarty were absent from the 1993 \nTT, but  evergreen Joey Dunlop was  there, together with \na  quality field of potential race winners. Now forty-one \nyears of age, Joey described himself as  ‘publican and  part- \ntime racer’ and although he  was still not  back to  his  very \nbest form on  a  750, he took a  convincing win in the  Ultra \nLightweight 125cc race. What made this result particularly \nspecial for Joey was  that it gave him  his fifteenth win, which \nwas  one  more than the previous best all-time winner, Mike \nHailwood. \nJoey \nDunlop \n(Honda) \non  \nthe \napproach \nto  \nWhitegates, \non  \nhis  \nway \nto  \nvictory \nin \nthe \n1993 \nUltra \nlighewelene \nI \nThe TT organizers worked to  give their event more \ninternational appeal, and in  1993 riders from eighteen \ncountries were on  the  Island to  do  battle with the  Moun- \ntain Course. It was not  a good year for newcomers seeking \nto  learn their way around, for the  first practice session was \ncancelled, several of the  following were held in poor condi- \ntions and  only one lap was possible on  what was usually the \nlong Thursday afternoon session. There must surely have \nbeen feelings of trepidation amongst those first-timers at \nthe thought of going out  and risking their lives in the proper \nracing that followed. \nMIXED RESULTS \nRising star  Mark Farmer had to  hand back his big Kawasaki \nduring practice, as  it did not  handle. Fortunate to get a ride \non  an  Oxford Products Ducati, he put it to  good use  to  lead \nthe  Formula I race at  the  end of the  first lap, setting what \nturned out  to  be  the  fastest lap of the  race, only to  retire \nsoon after, Victory eventually went to  Nick Jefferies, with \n3 \n25cc TT. \n\nA  COSTLY BUSINESS 159 \nThis was the power unit of John Britten’s unconventional TT  race machine. \nPhillip McCallen in  second. Both were riding for  Castrol \nHonda Britain and  after four previous second places at the \nTT, Jefferies’ win gave him the  unique record of having \nwon the  Manx Grand Prix, the  Manx Two-Day Trial and \na Tourist Trophy. \nNew records were set  by fractional amounts as  Jim \nMoodie won the  Supersport 400 and 600 races, but  apart \nfrom Joey Dunlop lifting the race average speed in the  125 \nrace to  107.26mph, it was  left to double winner of the Side- \ncar  races, Manxman Dave Molyneux (Yamaha), to  set  the \nonly other new records in  1993, as  he lifted the  race aver- \nage and lap speeds of the three-wheelers. The 600cc 4-cyl- \ninder, \nfour-stroke \nengines \nwere \nbeginning \nto \nsupplant \nthe \n350cc \ntwo-stroke \ntwins \nin \nsidecar \nracing \nat \nthe \nTT, \noffering \na \nwider \npower \nband, \nincreased \nrobustness \nand \nimproved \nreliability. \nIn  \nwinning \nthe  \nJunior \nrace \nfor  \nthe  \nsecond \nyear \nin  \nsuc- \ncession, \nBrian \nReid \n(Yamaha) \nset  \na  \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nof \n115.14mph. \nThat \ncompared \nalmost \nexactly \nto  \nhis  \nwinning \nspeed \nof \n115.13mph, \nset \nthe \nyear \nbefore. \nVictory \nin \nthe \nSen- \nior  race went to  Phillip McCallen on  his  RVF Honda. He \nhad been expected to  win  more, but he was  still recovering \nfrom pre-TT injuries received at  Mallory Park. \nDEVELOPMENT \nWhile major manufacturers continued with step-by-step \ndevelopment of their existing race machines, a  one-man \neffort tackled the  1993 TT witha ground-breaking machine \ndesigned and built in New Zealand. It was  a time when the \nbig firms were actively seeking financial support for  their \nBritish racing efforts from firms like  Castrol and Loctite, so \nhow could an  individual afford such a venture, particularly \none  that radically challenged many conventional aspects of \ndesign? \nThe man sufficiently confident to come from halfa world \naway to  race at the  TT  was  John Britten, with fellow Kiwi \nand  first-timer, Shaun Harris, as  rider. The new race bike \nquickly impressed with its  speed on  the  course, while its \ndistinctive sound, looks and  colour scheme also caught the \nattention. Full of Britten’s innovative ideas, the  chassis was \n\n160 MEOSTLY WUSINESS \nof kevlar and  carbon fibre, using the  engine as  a  stressed \nmember. Unconventional suspension and relatively light \nweight, plus its liquid-cooled, 8-valve, fuel-injected V-twin \nengine with belt-driven dohc and electronic engine man- \nagement system, saw  its  150bhp deliver plenty of speed for \nthe  power-hungry TT  course. Come the  racing, however, \nan  oil-line failure robbed the  Britten of a good finish. \nUndeterred, John Britten was  back at  the  1994 TT with \na  team of three machines and  riders, Nick Jefferies, Mark \nFarmer and Robert Holden. This time he  had an  element \nof sponsorship, going under the  banner of “ICI Autocolour \nBritten 100’. The huge challenge they faced was brought \nhome to  them when Mark Farmer was killed in  a  practice \naccident at the  Black Dub on  one  of their machines. It put a \ndamper on  their efforts in  1994 and  further tragedy struck \na few years later, when John Britten died young. \nyf f 7 a \nHonda’s degree of support to  the TT varied year on  year. \nEven when they claimed to  be  giving full-on works sup- \nport, riders would complain, saying that they did  not  have \nthe  latest forks or  swinging arm. Their RVF750 had done \nvery well in Island racing, but its appearances were sporadic \nand  Honda’s top riders would often be on  upgraded RC30s. \nBut  by 1993 the  successful and popular RC30 had lost its \nedge in the  big class, where development was being pushed \nby superbike racing. Honda’s answer was to  produce the \nRC45 and have it homologated for  competition at  World \nSuperbike level. Borrowing many design aspects from the \nRVF750, the  RC45 was again a  V4  four-stroke. Manufac- \nturers were all  incorporating the  latest technology in their \nengines and this one had ceramic- and graphite-impreg- \nnated cylinder liners, titanium con  rods, very short-skirted \npistons, fuel-injection and an  electronic control unit rely- \nThe \n1994 \nHonda \nRC45 \nin \nits  \nspectacular \nCastrol \nHonda \ncolours. \nHere, \nin \nthe \nPaddock, \nSteve \nHislop’s \nbike \nreceiver \nfinal \npreparation \nbefore \nhe \ntakes \nit \nout \nfor \na \npractice \nsession. \n\ning \non  \nsensors \nfrom \nmany \ndifferent \nparts \nof \nthe  \nengine. \nAll \nthat \nwas \nhoused \nina \nsubstantial \ntwin-spar \nalloy \nframe, \nwith \nsingle-sided \nswinging \narm, \n41mm \nfront \nforks \nand \nmulti-pot \ndisc \nbrakes \nall \nround. \nThe \nRC45 \nwas  \nan  \nexample \nof \nhow \ntechnology \nwas  \nmov- \ning \non, \nbut \nwhile \nsome \nof \nits \nnew \nfeatures \nundoubtedly \ncontributed \nto \nfaster \nspeeds, \nthey \nwere \nalso \nintended \nto \naid reliability. \nFrom lapping at  107mph on  a TZ350 Yamaha \nat  the 1984 MGP (above), to  over 123mph on \na  Honda RC45 (below), Steve Hislop proved \nhimself to  be  among the fastest around the \nMountain Course. \nA  COSTLY BUSINESS 161 \nThe advent of the  RC45 resulted in  Honda bringing more \npowerful machines to  the  1994 TT  for  their team of Joey \nDunlop, Phillip McCallen and a  returning Steve Hislop. \nBut, as  had happened before, the first lap of practice showed \nthat they did  not  bring the  required level of handling to \nmatch the  increase in  performance. As  Ray Knight put  it \nin  his  book Joey Dunlop —  A  Tribute, ‘when pitted against \n\n162 M  A  COSTLY BUSINESS \nthe  Island’s undulations, it  proved to  be  something of a \nwayward beast’. The three Honda works riders expressed \nthemselves far  more forcefully on  the  handling issue but, \nbeing paid to  race, they spent the  practice periods riding \nragged-looking laps while gradually improving their times, \nas  they sought to  get  the  elusive balance of stability and \nhigh-speed manoeuvrability. Steve Hislop showed his cour- \nage  and quality by eventually topping the  practice leader \nboard at  123.53mph. That was just a  fraction under the \noutright lap record. \nHislop had  not  wanted to  return to  the  TT, but  he was \nunashamedly using it as  a potentially good pay  day to  help \nfund his  short-circuit superbike racing. This worked out \nwell for  him, for  he  took the  RC45 to  wins in  both the \nFormula I and  Senior races, leading home his  Honda team \nmates in both and lapping at just Imph below record speed. \nSaturday’s Formula I race suffered from the  weather and \nwas stopped after two laps and  rerun on  the  Sunday. \nThat Sunday race proved a disaster for  Robert Dunlop, \nwhen the  rear wheel of his  Medd Racing RC45 collapsed \nas  he was leaving Ballaugh and  he  sustained serious injury \nin  the resulting crash. Riding in  his  first TT and also \nmounted on  a Medd Racing RC45 was Michael Rutter. He \nfinished the  Formula I race unscathed, but his entry in the \nSenior was scratched for his back wheel also showed signs \nof cracking. \nWhile Joey Dunlop was obviously troubled by  his \nbrother’s accident, he got on  with his  racing and  won the \nJunior and Ultra Lightweight 125 events. Running with \nthe  125s in  1994 was a  new race for  machines with four- \nstroke, single-cylinder engines —  the  Singles TT. Most of \nthose entered were of about 600cc and  featured machines \nfrom Yamaha, MZ, Honda, BMW, Kawasaki and others. \nThey were very much roadster-derived engines, although \nthere was a singles class run  as  a supporting event at World \nSuperbike meetings, which was  encouraging development. \nLap times of cllOmph were forecast and  the  race was won \nby Jim Moodie (Yamaha) with a  fastest lap of 112.66mph. \nMoodie also won the  Supersport 400 race, while Iain  Duf- \nfus took the  Supersport 600 at a record race average speed \nof 115.30mph. The latter used the new Yamaha FZR600R, \nwhich Yamaha claimed offered ‘the ultimate blend of street \nbike and track cred’. There was  certainly an  increased blur- \nring of specifications between the  two uses. \nA \nnew \nname \namong \nthe  \nSidecar \nclass \nwinners \nin  \n1994 \nwas \nRob \nFisher \n(Yamaha). \nWinning \nboth \nlegs \nin \njust \nhis \nsecond \ntime \nat the \nTT, \nhe \nalso \nset \na \nrecord \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nof 105.71mph \nand \nrecord \nlap \nfor \nFormula \n2 \nsidecars \nof \n106.49mph. \nAs \nwith \nmany \nof \nthe \nsidecar \nriders, \nRob \nbrought \nthree \ncomplete \nengines \nto \nthe \nevent, \nbut \nreturned \nhome \nwith \ntwo \ntired \nmotors \nand \nthe  \nthird \na  \ncollection \nof \nwhat \nremained \nafter \nit \n‘blew \nto \nbits’. \nThe \nTT \nis \nespecially \ntough \non \nthe \n‘chairs’, \nwhich \npull \ntwo \ncrew \nand \n16 \ngallons \nof \nfuel \naround \nthe \nMountain \nCourse \nfor \nthree \nlaps \nand \n113 \nnon-stop \nmiles. \nThe 1994 TT  saw  its share of high speeds, with some of \nthe  fastest laps almost matching record speeds, but  it was \nonly in  the  Sidecar and Ultra Lightweight 125  classes that \nrecords were broken. It was remembered as  a  good year \nand  one  that gave double victories to  Steve Hislop, Joey \nDunlop, Jim Moodie and  Rob Fisher, but perhaps it lacked \nthe  sparkle of some previous events. \nMost spectators show little interest in  who takes the \nManufacturers Award ina  TT race, but the makers do, and \nHonda were delighted to  come away as  the  major winner \nin  1994, \n1995: CHANGES TO RACE LINE-UP \nThere had been a change to machine eligibility for the  1994 \nSenior TT. Previously restricted to  machines from 601 to \n750cc capacity, it was opened to 201—250 two-stroke twin- \ncylinder and ACU/FIM Supersport 600cc machines. No \none  thought that a  250 was going to  win a  Senior TT, but \nit did  provide the  opportunity of an  extra race for  those \nriding them. \nThe race programme was subject to  change for  1995, \nwith the  title of Junior TT  (formerly for  201—350cc two- \nstrokes) now given to  a  race for  600cc machines to  FIM/ \nACU Supersport regulations. This resulted in  the  Super- \nsport 600 race being dropped and the two-strokes displaced \nfrom the Junior TT  coming back into the  programme in a \nLightweight race for  201—250cc two-strokes, which was \nalso open to  371—400cc four-stroke, 4-cylinder machines. \nInclusion of the  latter meant that the  Supersport 400 race, \nwhich previously catered for them, was also dropped as  an \nindividual event, although ‘official’ results continued to \nshow them under the  Supersport title for some years. \nQualifying times were now 22  minutes for  the  fastest \nsolo classes —  Formula I and Senior —  and 27  minutes for \nsidecars. That was a  4-minute reduction from the  time \nallowed ten  years before for solos, and 1 minute less for the \n‘chairs’, now operating to  the  smaller-engined Formula 2 \nspecifications. \nDUCATI \nCarl \nFogarty \nleft  \nthe  \nTT  \nfor  \na  \nwider \nstage \nand \nwon \nthe \nWorld \nSuperbike \ntitle \nfor \nDucati \nin \n1994. \nThis \nprompted \nincreased \ninterest \nin \nthe \nracing \nof \nDucatis \nand \nthe  \n1995 \nTT \nsaw \nfive \nentries \nin \nthe \nSenior \nrace, \nto \nbe \nridden \nby \nthe \nlikes \nof \nIain \nDuffus, \nMichael \nRutter, \nTrevor \nNation \nand \nSimon \n\n\\  COSTLY BUSINESS HP  163 \nOn  his  single-cylinder Ducati, Robert Holden tackles the Gooseneck on  his  way to  victory in  1995. \nBeck. With quoted capacities of  888cc, 916 and 955cc, \nthese twin-cylinder Italian machines came in various states \nof tune —and thus performance, depending upon how much \nhad  been spent on  them. They were twin-cylinder, 4-valve \ndesmos, liquid-cooled and relatively light. At the time they \nwere still considered to  be a little fragile for  TT  course \naction, but spectators loved the  sound of their booming \nexhausts. With three of them holding second, third and \nfourth places at  the  end  of the  first lap of the  1995 Senior, \nDucati hopes were high, but  only Duffus was there at  the \nend, albeit in a fine Castrol Honda-splitting second place. \nWhere Ducati did gain success in  1995 was  in the Singles \nTT. \nThe \ncompany \nbuilt \na \nlimited \nnumber \nof \ncostly \nsingle- \ncylinder \nracers, \nusing \nmuch \ncarbon \nfibre \nand \nmagnesium \nfor \nlightness, \nand \nKiwi \nRobert \nHolden \nrode \nhis \nto \na \nwin. \nMORE RACING \nAmong \nspectators, \nsome \nwondered \nwhat \nthe \ndifference \nwas \nbetween \nmachines \nthat \ncontested \nthe \nopening \nFormula \n| \nrace and the  closing Senior race. In  short, some could be \nthe  same. Both races were open to  motorcycles to  ‘ACU \nFI  Specifications’, with the Senior also accepting entries \nfrom ‘201-250 Two Stroke Twin Cylinder and  ACU/FIM \nSupersport 600 machines’. \nOnce again it was the  RC45 Hondas that won the  For- \nmula I and Senior races, ridden by Phillip McCallen and \nJoey Dunlop, with Dunlop also taking the ‘new’ Light- \nweight 250 race on  a  Honda, setting a  record race average \nspeed of  115.68mph. He  was just a  few seconds short of \nthe  lap record. Those with long memories could remem- \nber  when his  fellow Irishman, Tom Herron, won the  last \nrace to  go under the  Lightweight 250  name. That was back \nin  1976, when Herron’s race average speed was a  record \n103.55mph, achieved on  the dominant lightweight machine \nof the time, a  Yamaha. \nDunlop rated his  1995 Lightweight win as  one  of his fin- \nest  races, telling journalists after the  event: “The bike went \n100 per  cent, the  conditions were 100 per  cent —  dull and \n\n164 AHCOSTLY BUSINESS \ncool —  and once I| got  going I was 100 per  cent.’ Dunlop \nreadily admitted that if his  mood was not  right, then he \nwas not  always able to  give his all.  He  explained that it was \nnot  until he plunged down Bray Hill on  the  opening lap of \na race that he really knew if he was  going to be on  the pace. \nThose who knew him well felt  that they could tell  at  the \nstart how he would go.  TT  commentator of the time, Peter \nKneale, was one of those and would tell  listeners, “Joey’s \ngot his race face on’. \nThe only other records to  be  broken in  1995 were the \nUltra Lightweight 125 lap  speed, which winner Mark \nBaldwin (Honda) raised to  109.01mph, and  in  the  Sidecar \nclass, where double winner Rob Fisher (Yamaha) lifted \nthe  race average speed to  107.58mph and  the  lap record to \n107.67mph. Coming close to  another record, that of the \nclosest finish to  a TT  race, Mark Baldwin snatched his  125 \nvictory from Mick Lofthouse by just 0.6 seconds, after four \nlaps and 151  miles of racing. It was doubly disappointing \nfor  Lofthouse because he finished before Baldwin and was \ngiven to  believe that he had won the  race. \nThe 125s were mostly Hondas and competitors were \ndesperate to gain mechanical advantage and speed over each \nother, so  expensive performance-enhancing modifications \nsuch as  alternative ignition systems, exhausts and so  on \nwere incorporated by those who could afford them. In  1995 \nthere was much experimenting with airboxes, which were \nfound to  offer a  benefit to  carburation. But  the  application \nof science to  the  125s was  mixed with ‘rule of thumb’, and \nnowhere was this better illustrated than with their water- \ncooling. With no  thermostats, on  cool days the  use  of the \ncorrect amount of duct tape on  the radiator to  control tem- \nperature was  critical. Joey Dunlop got it wrong that year, \nhad  a cold seizure and  retired at The Hawthorn, some 62 \nmiles from the  start. \nPictured \nduring \nhis \nwinning \nride \nin \nthe \n1995 \nFormula \nI \nTT, \nPhillip \nMcCallen \nflies \nthe \nfrightening \njump \nof \nBallacrye \nat \nover 150mph. \n\nlain \nDuffus \n(Honda) \nset  \nspeeds \nin  \nwinning \nthe  \n‘new’ \nJunior \n600cc \nrace \nthat \nexceeded \nthose \nof \nthe \nprevious \nSupersport \n600 \nraces. \nPhillip \nMcCallen \n(Honda) \nwas \nan \nearly \nleader \nand, \nwhile \nhis  \nrather \nwild-looking, \nelbows \nout \nstyle \nalways \nappeared \nfraught, \nhe  \nusually \nstayed \non, \nBut \nafter \npassing \nDuffus \non \nthe \nroad, \nin \n‘hairy’ \nfashion, \nhe \nfound \na \nfalse \nneutral \nand \nfell \nat \nWaterworks. \nOn \nhis \nown \nadmission \nhe \nwas \n‘right \nup \non \nthe \nbanks \n.. \nevery \ncorner \n... \n.  sliding it into \nreal manic short circuit stuff’. Such are \nthe  pressures to  win, encountered by a professional racer. \nMcCallen was probably the  fastest rider at the  TT  in  1995 \nand was a man who always gave his riding 100  per cent. He \ndid  not  believe that you could ride at  ‘nine-tenths’ on  the \nTT  course and expect to  win. Nor did  he  favour one part \nof the  course over another, as  many riders did. For  him it \nwas flat out  all the way. \nMORE EXPENSE \nNot fully supported across all classes by Castrol Honda at \nthe 1995 TT, Joey Dunlop found himself racing a  V&M \nDuckhams Honda in the Junior race. This meant additional \nexpense on  a  set  of new leathers in yellow and  blue Duck- \nhams Oils colours, for  he  could hardly have ridden their \nmachine in the  green, red  and  white of Castrol. \nHelping to  offset competitors’ rising costs —  not that \nDunlop paid for  his own leathers —  more money was \npumped into  the TT the following year, taking the total to \nover £500,000 for  1996. \n1996: PRODDIES RETURN \nKnowing that the  handling of mid-1990s sports bikes had \nimproved, along with the  tyres they used, the  organizers \nfelt it was  safe to reintroduce the Production race for  1996. \nOpen to  machines of 701—1010cc, it was to  be  run over \nthree laps on  Senior race day and  was  a popular addition to \nthe race programme. \nJust like race bikes, production models improved year \non  year. Back in  1985 the  Suzuki GSX-R750 spawned a \nwhole new generation of race replicas for  the  road and  its \npower output climbed with each batch of modifications. \nIn  1996 a  new version was launched that was lighter, \nhad  an  all new short-stroke engine, twin-spar aluminium \nframe, ram-air induction, 190 section rear tyre and the \nby now customary ‘computer controlled ignition’. But  the \nSuzuki was only a 750  and  at the  1996 TT it faced Honda’s \nuprated Fireblade, which many felt to  offer the best overall \npackage \nof \npower, \nhandling \nand \nstopping. \nNow \nof \n918cc, \nwith \nimproved \naerodynamics \nand \ncooling, \nnew \nframe, \nmodified \nswing \narm, \nchanged \ndamping \narrangements \nfront \nand \nrear, \nit \nincorporated \nmany \nother \nminor \nmodifica- \nA  COSTLY BUSINESS Ml  165 \ntions and was claimed to  deliver 128bhp at  10,500rpm in \nroad trim. \nHondas were the  machine of choice for  the  majority of \nthe  Production entry, but  ‘all-new’ Kawasaki ZX-7R and \nZX-7RR were also available, along with new Yamaha Thun- \nderace models and a couple of Ducatis of 750 and 916cc. All \nwere claiming outputs of over 125bhp in  road trim and as \nwell as  the  customary range of adjustment for suspension; \nsome offered easy adjustment of steering geometry, ride \nheight and  wheelbase. \nProduction racing was not supposed to  be  the place \nwhere those who spent the most were guaranteed suc- \ncess, but the  machines that came to  the  grid in  1996 were \nallowed modifications from standard. Most would spend \nmoney on  things like a new higher-performance rear shock \nand steering damper, braided hoses, Dynojet kit  for  the \ncarburettors, a  race exhaust to  give a  few  extra bhp and  a \nfibreglass body kit. \nFor all  the  claimed advance in  technical specifications, \nwhat most spectators wanted to  know was how much faster \nwould the 1996 Proddies be  compared to  those of  1989, \nwhen the  event was last  run. The answer was ‘not much’, \nfor Phillip McCallen’s Fireblade win at  117.32mph was less \nthan 2mph faster than Dave Leach’s winning race average \nspeed on  a  1000cc Yamaha in  1989, and the  fastest lap, \nof  118.33mph in  1996, was only Imph faster. McCallen \ndid  say  that he  could have gone faster, which probably did \nnot  go  down too  well with Iain Duffus (Honda) who fin- \nished just 6 seconds behind him, but  it  is  doubtful if his \nrace figures impressed those who automatically expect ever \nhigher speed at  the  TT. However, most race fans agreed \nthat 165mph from a  Fireblade on  Sulby Straight was pretty \nimpressive for a road bike. They also knew that riders faced \nthe  old  bogey of needing a  lot  more power and speed to \nachieve relatively small increases in lap times. \nMcCALLEN’S YEAR \nTaking victory in  1996 in  the  Formula I race, Junior and \nSenior races, plus the  reintroduced race for  Production \nmachines, Phillip McCallen became the  first rider to  take \nfour TT wins in one  week, although it was  only in the Jun- \nior  that he lifted race average and  lap speeds to  new levels. \nNevertheless, it  was an  impressive performance to  leave \nriders like  Nick Jefferies, Joey Dunlop and  Iain  Duffus in \nhis  wake. It might have been five wins in  a week if, while \nrunning well in the  Lightweight 250 race, he had  not  holed \nhis  exhausts on  the  suspension-bottoming, flat-out bend \nat  the  bottom of Barregarrow. This knocked the  edge off \nhis  bike’s performance and  Joey Dunlop went on  to  win. \nDunlop also took the  Ultra Lightweight 125  race. The only \n\n166 be  COSTLY BUSINESS \nnon-Honda solo race win of the week was Jim Moodie’s \nvictory in  the  Singles race ona Yamaha. \n‘MOLY’ \nIf the solo races of 1996 belonged to  Phillip McCallen, then \nthe  top  performances in  the  sidecar races justifiably went \nto  Dave Molyneux, who added a  substantial 3mph to  race \naverage and lap speeds to  leave new records of 110.08 and \n111.02mph. When the 1000cc Sidecar race was dropped \nafter the 1989 TT, the race record for  the Formula 2 \nmachines stood at  99.23mph, but  the  rapid development \nof  the 600cc four-strokes through the early 1990s had \nmuch to  do with the  increase in  F2  speeds, as  did  “Moly’s’ \ndevelopment of his  own outfit, known as  the  DMR (Dave \nMolyneux Racing). That was  the  machine on  which he did \nhis winning in  1996, with the  help of passenger Peter Hill \nand aided by sponsorship from Team Mannin Collections \nand  others. \nThere was  no  recognized large-scale builder of F2 sidecar \noutfits and most riders used the products of specialist build- \nindication \nof \nthe \nlevel \nof \nsupport \nrequired \nto  \ngo  \nTT  \nracing. \nDave \nMolyneux \nand \nPeter \nHill \non  \ntheir \nway \nto  \nvictory \nin  \n1996. \nThe \nmany \nsponsors’ \nnames \non  \nthe \nbodywork \ngive \nan \ners  like Windle, Ireson, Jacobs, Baker and, of course, DMR. \nWith their wind-cheating, streamlined enclosures removed \nin  the  Paddock, there was little that remained secret and \nthese makers all borrowed each other’s ideas, which helped \nspeed development. The F2  outfits were rather different to \nGP  machines in  engine size and chassis construction. They \nalso needed tailoring from their normal short-circuit set- \ntings to  suit  the  going found over the TT  course. \nDANGEROUS \nThere was no  hiding from the  dangers of the  TT  Mountain \nCourse and four riders were killed during practice for  the \n1996 event. But, just as  there are  some riders who are  satis- \nfied with a  five-lap scratch around Brands Hatch, there are \nothers whose ambitions can  only be realized by competing \nin the  TT. Two who fulfilled their ambitions in  1996 were \nJohn McGuinness and  David Jefferies, with the  latter tak- \ning the  award for  best Newcomer. No  one had any  idea at \nthe  time of what TT  greatness those two would go  on  to \nachieve. \nBRECANTEN Z \nme Alsb BOE) \nSTLANX \nBLESS \nWYRE \nRBECAAG SPRALS \nse \na \n\n‘ROAD RACING CAPITAL OF THE WORLD’ \nThat was  the slogan used by the Isle  of  Man in  1996, accom- \npanied by the  claim that: ‘Not only is the  TT  the  pinnacle \nof puré road racing at  a world level but it is the  lynchpin of \na major festival of bikesport and motorcycling.’ Spectators \nof all ages still thronged to  see  the  races, with first-timers \nand long-term visitors sitting on  the  roadside banks or  at \ncourse-side pubs, swapping their TT  stories. \nAmong the subsidiary events in  1996 was a  parade of \nMoto Guzzi machinery to  celebrate the  seventy-fifth anni- \nversary of their first appearance at  the  TT. It was headed \nby an  original version of their exotic 1950s V8, ridden by \noriginal rider Bill Lomas, and a  replica V8  ridden by its \nbuilder, Giuseppe Todero. Veteran Lomas rode the full  lap, \nbut  young Todero threw his  £500,000 machine down the \nroad at  Braddan Bridge, less than 2 miles from the  start. \nFortunately the  only damage was to  the  bike’s fairing and \nthe  rider’s pride. \nBy 1997 the TT had been running for ninety years and much \nhad changed in that time. The early pioneers who gathered \nA  COSTLY BUSINESS 167 \nat  St John’s in  1907 had no  conception of the  journey that \nreal road-racing would take after they had  chugged around \nin  that first race, with most setting lap speeds of under \n40mph. Come the  early 1990s, the  top  men were circu- \nlating the  Mountain Course at  over 120mph. In  1997 the \nrace average and  lap record speeds of the  big Formula I and \nSenior races were still stuck at those set  by Steve Hislop and \nCarl Fogarty during their epic battle in the  1992 Senior TT, \nThere was a similar situation in  the  Lightweight 250 class, \nwhere Ian  Lougher’s lap record, set  in battle with that man \nHislop again, had remained intact since 1990. There had \nbeen plenty of growth in  speeds in  other solo classes and \nin  the  sidecar classes, but  speeds in  those three solo ones \nremained about Imph short of the records. It was a position \nthat did  not  change in  1997. \nMounted on  a  special, ultra~expensive Honda Britain \nRC45, Phillip McCallen won both the  Formula I and Sen- \nior races with best laps approaching, but not quite reaching, \nthe  123mph mark —  Fogarty’s absolute lap record stood at \n123.61mph. In  the  latter race, second place was taken by \nJim Moodie on  a Padgetts Honda NSR500 two-stroke, said \nto  cost £90,000 and to  put out 135bhp. With a  win in  the \nPhillip \nMcCallen \nwas \nsponsored \nby \nMotorcycle \nCity \nwhen \nhe  \nrode \nto  \nsecond \nplace \nin \nthe \n1997 \nJunior \nTT. \nHe  \nis \nseen \nhere \nat  \nthe \nslowest \npoint \non  \nthe \ncourse, \nGovernor’s \nBridge. \n\n168 M  A  COSTLY BUSINESS \nProduction race giving him a hat-trick, McCallen finished \nthe  meeting on  eleven TT  wins and a  second place in  the \nJunior race, plus a  high-speed spill at  Quarry Bends while \ngoing well on  his  250. \nVictory in the Lightweight 250 race went to Joey Dunlop \non  his  Honda Britain RS250R from Ian  Lougher (Honda). \nThe man who achieved the  fastest lap and made his  first \npodium appearance was Aprilia-mounted John McGuin- \nness in  third place. Ian  Lougher took his  125cc Honda to \nvictory in  the Ultra Lightweight race, setting a  new race \naverage speed record of  107.89mph and a  new lap record \nof  109.25mph, while Ian  Simpson took another Honda to \nvictory in  the  Junior at  record speeds, with his  fastest lap \nat  119.86mph —  so  close to  120mph on  a  600 and a reflec- \ntion of the  development put  into those models. The only \nnon-Honda winner of a  solo class was Dave Morris on  a \nBMW in  the  Singles race, where he set  a  new lap record of \n112.07mph. \nWhile Dave Morris was a  new name among TT  win- \nners, he had  been close to  victory in  the  Singles class for  a \ncouple of years. Other up-and-comers going well in  1997 \nwere Derek Young, Adrian Archibald, Simon Beck, Adrian \nMcFarland and  Mark Flynn. \n1998:THE 120MPH CLUB \nIt  was Steve Hislop who set  the  first 120mph lap back in \n1989. Since then, a fairly select group had joined him in \nthe ‘120mph Club’. Totalling about twenty, some ten  of \nthem were present at  the  1998 TT, where spectators were \nstill waiting for  Steve’s absolute race average record speed \nof  121.28mph and Carl Fogarty’s absolute lap  record of \n123.61mph to  be  broken. Quite why those records set  in \n1992 remained intact in  the  face of manufacturers’ claims \nof  ever-increasing outputs from their machines and tyre \nmakers’ talk of increased performance from their rubber, \nwas  a bit  of a  mystery. Six  years is a  long time for  a  record \nto  stand in TT  racing. \nUnusually, only one  race record was  broken in  1998 and \nthat was in  the  Production TT. Jim Moodie was already a \nmember of the 120mph Club, but in  bringing his  Honda \nFireblade home in  first place at  record-breaking pace he \nlifted the  Production lap record to  120.70mph, thus bring- \ning Production machines into the Club. Of  course, his \n4-cylinder Fireblade was of greater capacity than the 4-cyl- \ninder 750s of the  Formula I class, but  it  was quite a  per- \nformance for a  sports roadster. Moodie was delighted with \nthe Fireblade, finding the standard set-up ‘brilliant’ and \nleading home Nigel Davies \non a  Kawasaki ZX-9RR, \nfollowed by  Michael Rut- \nter  on  another Honda. In \nfourth place came a rapidly \nimproving David Jefferies \non  Yamaha’s new YZF-R1 \n—an encouraging display by \nboth bike and rider, rein- \nforced by  Rls also taking \nfifth and sixth places. \nPhillip McCallen did  not \nride the  TT  in  1998 due to \ninjuries received at  Thrux- \nton, and Joey Dunlop was \nnot fully fit. In  addition, \nlain Duffus suffered a  freak \naccident stepping out of \nhis  motorhome in  the TT \nRobert Dunlop was \nmaster of the Ultra \nLightweight TT  for I25cc \nmachines, winning it on \nfive occasions. \n\nPaddock and  broke his  leg. Both the  For- \nmula I and  Senior races went to  Ian  Simp- \nson  (Honda), although some felt that  Bob \nJackson might have snatched a  rare TT \nvictory for Kawasaki had his filler cap not \nbeen dropped during his single refuelling \nstop. The winning/losing margin was \njust 3.7  seconds. In  a  Honda CBR600- \ndominated Junior race, Michael Rutter \ntook one to  his  first TT  victory, while in \nthe  weather-hit Lightweight race, Joey \nDunlop used all his  skills to  splash home \nto  a  courageous first place, while Rob- \nert  Dunlop ended his  post-accident lean \nyears with a win in the  Ultra Lightweight \n125  race. Both Dunlops rode Hondas, as \ndid all the other winners, except for Dave \nMorris taking the  Singles race again on  a \nBMW. \n1999: CAPACITY CHANGES \nThe TT races have always been shaped to  accommodate \nthe  popular engine capacities of the  time. In the  early days \nthey were for  350 and 500cc, with 250cc machines join- \ning in  1920, That was the  situation for almost thirty years, \nuntil a race for  125cc machines was introduced. There was \na  brief period in  the 1960s when 50cc bikes were catered \nfor, but  they were dropped and  the  next major change was \nthe  acceptance of 750cc machines. Thereafter the  upper \nlimit gradually increased, touching 1500cc for a while —  not \nthat there were any  race machines of that capacity. Engine \nsizes were then reduced to  750cc fours, with up to  1010cc \ntwins allowed into the  Senior race. \nWith manufacturers wanting to  showcase their flagship \nsportsters, which were now tending towards 1000cc, the \nTT  accommodated them by opening up the  Formula I race \nto  four-strokes of any engine configuration from 700 to \n1010cc. They also accepted 500cc GP  machines manufac- \ntured after 1994. \nThe \nLightweight \n250 \nTT \nfor  \ntwo-stroke \ntwins \nhad \naccommodated \nthe  \n351—400cc \nfour-strokes, \nbut  \nfor  \n1999 \nthe  \nlatter \ngot  \na  \nseparate \nrace \n—  \nthe  \nLightweight \n400 \nTT. \nThis \nmeant \nthe \nTT \nnow \nhad \nten \nraces, \nwith \nentries \nslightly \nup \non \nthe \nprevious \nyear. \nA CHANGE AT  THETOP \nHonda \nhad \ndominated \nthe  \nbig \nclasses \nat  \nthe  \nTT  \nin  \nrecent \nyears \nWw \nrith \ntheir \nexpensive \nworks \nRC45s, \nbut \nin \n1999 \nYama- \nhe \nrecovered \nmuch \nof \ntheir \nwinning \nways \nwith \na \nrelatively \nnew \nmachine \nand \nrider. \nThe \nmachine \nwas \ntheir \nYZF-R1, \na \nccacdate ay spies Rees nS : \nioe Dunlop’ eneering Quarter Bridge on  his  Honda at  the 1999 TT. It was a \nyear in which he  rode at  number I|2, instead of his  customary 3. \n1000cc transverse 4-cylinder four-stroke, said to  deliver \n140bhp in road trim. More like  a  600 in size, it came with \na new design feature of a  ‘stacked’ gearbox, which allowed \nfor areduction in wheelbase. The R1  was  very well received \nby press and buyers as  a  road bike, with Yamaha advertis- \ning proclaiming that it had  all the  best attributes to  attract \nthe  sporting rider, saying that it was ‘the shortest, lightest \nand  most powerful in its  class’. Their advertising extended \nto  the  glossy TT  programme, where a  double-page spread \nmentioned that ‘the R1  delivers levels of performance that \nwere quite simply inconceivable before its  launch’. They \nwere bold claims being made to  a knowledgeable audience, \nwith the  TT  Mountain Course waiting to  put them to  the \ntest against the  likes of Hondas, Kawasakis, Suzukis and \nDucatis. \nHowever good Yamaha’s R1  was  claimed to be, it needed \na top runner to  ride it anda top team to  prepare it.  No  one \ndoubted the  talents of the  latter in the  shape of the  experi- \nenced V&M Racing, but their chosen rider, David Jefferies, \nwas only rated at  number 15  in  the  organizer’s seedings, \nalthough he had  ridden to  fourth place on  an  R1  in the pre- \nvious year’s Production TT. \nIt turned out  to  be a timely choice of rider, whose father \nand uncle were both TT  winners, and whose riding was \nimproving from meeting to  meeting in  a  mixed schedule \nof short-circuit and  road racing. The young David Jefferies \nhad  starred at the  1999 North West 200 a  couple of weeks \nbefore \nand \nhis \nperformance \nduring \nTT \npractice \nhad \nevery- \none \ntalking. \nWhat \nis \nmore, \nhe \ncarried \nhis \npractice \nperform- \nances \nover \ninto \nthe \nracing \nand \nin \nso \ndoing \nhelped \nmake \nit \n\n170  M  A COSTLY BUSINESS \nan  exceptional year, where speed records were broken by \nriders in seven of the  eight solo races. \nOne surprise entry was Phillip McCallen, who had \nmissed 1998 due  to  worries on  the  injury front. He  was \nback to  ride in four races and, in  another surprise, he was \nriding Yamahas. Honda Britain (also calling themselves \nHonda UK) had their usual strong line-up of Joey Dunlop, \nIan  Simpson, Jim Moodie and Michael Rutter. In the  For- \nmula I and Senior TTs they were all  mounted on  RC45s, \nwhile John McGuinness and  Ian  Lougher were also Honda- \nmounted, using NSR500 GP-style V-twins. \nTHE RACING \nRacing got  under way with the  Formula I event and, as \nmany expected, David Jefferies took his  first TT  win, cir- \nculating at record speed and finishing 15.8 seconds ahead of \nJoey Dunlop. The  race was  shortened to  four laps, and Jef- \nferies opted not  to take a new rear tyre at his single pit stop. \nTo make Yamaha’s day, lain  Duffus brought the other V&M \nR1  into third place. The motorcycle press had a field day at \nHonda’s expense and Motorcycle News headlined ‘A £20,000 \nProddie Bike Shouldn’t Humble £500,000 Honda RC45s. \nSomeone Forgot to Tell David Jefferies’. In later years Classic \nRacer described the  winning machine as  ‘a modified street \nbike which, eight weeks before its first race, was  wearing a \nlicence plate and was  taxed for the street’. The R1’s victory \nbrought to  an  end  Honda’s seventeen-year run  of success in \nthe  Formula I race. \nHonda recovered some face during race week with Jim \nMoodie winning the Junior race, although Yamaha’s other \nthreat, their 600cc R6,  took second and  third places with \nJefferies and Duffus. More Honda wins went to Ian Lougher \nin  the  Ultra Lightweight 125, Paul Williams in  the  Light- \nweight 400  and  John McGuinness in the  Lightweight 250, \nwith the last two breaking records in their races. For  good \nmeasure, Honda also took both sidecar races with Dave \nMolyneux and Rob Fisher, with Moly lifting the three- \nwheeler’s lap record to  a heady 112.76mph. \nCome the  last  day’s racing and  it was very much Honda \nversus Yamaha again. The three-lap Production race opened \nproceedings and David Jefferies took his second TT win  on \nan  R1  at  record-breaking pace, while leading home Jason \nGriffiths and  Phillip McCallen on  their R1s. \nHonda \nknew \nthey \nwere \nup  \nagainst \nit  \nin  \nthe  \nSenior, \nso \nhatched \na plan \nto \nsend \nJim \nMoodie \noff \nat \na pace \nthat \nthey \nhoped \nwould \nlead \nyoung \nJefferies \nastray. \nMoodie \ncertainly \nset \na \nfast \npace, \nfor \nhe \nbroke \nthe \nabsolute \nlap \nrecord \nfrom \na \nstanding \nstart, \nleaving \nit \nat \n124.45mph. \nBut \nHonda’s \nplan \nfailed \nwhen \nMoodie \nwas \nforced \nto \nretire \non \nthe \nsecond \nlap, \n8 \nmiles \nout \nat \nBallig \nBridge, \nwith \na \nshredded \nrear \ntyre. \nThis \nleft \nDavid \nJefferies \nto  \ncomplete \na \nhat-trick \nof \nwins \nat \na \nnew \nrace \naverage \nrecord \nspeed \nfor \nthe  \nSenior, \nwith \nJain \nDuffus \nsecond, \nIan  \nLougher \nthird \non  \nthe  \nfirst \nHonda, \na \nNSRSOOV, \nNigel \nDavies \non \nhis \nYamaha \nR1 \nin fourth \nand \nJoey \nDunlop \nan \nunaccustomed \nfifth \non \nhis \nRC45. \nROADSTER TO RACER \nDavid Jefferies’ TT-winning Yamaha R1  race  bike may have \nbeen a roadster some eight weeks before, but  it underwent \nmuch change to  make it a  winner over the  TT  course, as \ndid  most production-based bikes of the  time. V&M rac- \ning comprised Jack Valentine and  Steve Mellor, who both \nwere vastly experienced in the  preparation of competition \nmachinery. Their R1s, for they also built the one  ridden by \nlain Duffus, received a  complete engine strip-down, fol- \nlowed by a  rebuild that included things like a  lightened, \nrebalanced and  polished crankshaft with new oval section \nand chrome-moly steel con rods. The cylinder head was \nported, flowed and  polished, compression ratio raised and \nspecial valve springs fitted. They fitted their own camshafts \nand  adopted ram-air induction, special airbox and a radia- \ntor  twice the  size  of the  original. \nHaving seen 132bhp from a stock R1, V&M were pleased \nwith the 174bhp available after they had worked their \nmagic, which also included remapping the  ignition for the \nhigher revs now available and  a  special exhaust. The frame \nremained virtually standard, although a  Penske rear shock \nwas fitted, while front forks were re-valved and dropped \n10mm in new adjustable yokes. Among other changes it was \nfitted with new cast iron discs and six-pot calipers, while \nthe  petrol tank was enlarged to  allow completion of two \nlaps on  a tankful. So, no  longer your standard R1, but a TT- \nwinning motorcycle that V&M were prepared to  replicate \nfor customers on  payment of £26,000. \nSPEEDS \nEveryone had  their own view as  to  Yamaha’s resurgence in \nthe  big bike classes, with some crediting it to  the  machine \nand others to  the  men riding them. Most debate on  the \nmachines centred on  whether the  1,000cc Yamaha R1  was \nfaster and better handling than the  750cc Honda RC45s, \nfor without naming the opposition, Yamaha advertising had \nbuilt up an  aura of superiority in those areas. \nInformation on  speeds achieved was hard to  come by. \nSome of the  teams now had  set-ups from which they could \ngather \ndata, \nbut \nit \nwas \nnot \nthe \nsort \nof \ninformation \nthey \nmade \npublic. \nAware \nof \nthe \nfascination \nwith \nspeed, \nthe \norganizers \ninstalled \nan \nelectronic \nspeed \ncheck \nopposite \nthe \nGrand- \nstand \non \nthe \nGlencrutchery \nRoad, \nwith \na \ndigital \ndisplay \nof \nthe \nspeed \nachieved \nby \neveryone \nwho \npassed. \nThe \nfast- \n\nest  \nrunners \nin  \n1999 \nwere \nJim \nMoodie \n(Honda \nRC45) \nat \n164.9mph, \nlain \nDuffus \n(Yamaha \nR1) \n163.8mph, \nJoey \nDun- \nlop \n(Honda \nRC45) \n163.8mph, \nDavid \nJefferies \n(Yamaha \nR1) \n163.5mph \nand \nIan \nLougher \n(Honda \nNSR500) \n163.5mph. \nIt showed \nthat \nspeeds \nwere \nquite \nclose \namong \nthe \ntop \nrun- \nners. \nIt was \nnot \na point \nwhere \nthey \nhit \nmaximum \nspeed \nand \nmost \nwere \nstill \naccelerating \nas they \npassed \nthe \ntiming \npoint. \nOn \nthe \nfastest \nparts \nof \nthe \ncircuit, \nthe \nbest \nriders \nwould \nreach \n180—185mph. \nIn  the  Production race, David Jefferies and  Iain Duffus \non  their Yamaha Rls were joint fastest at  153.2mph, fol- \nlowed by three more Rls, while in  the  Junior race Phillip \nMcCallen (Yamaha R6) and Joey Dunlop (Honda CBR600) \nwere joint fastest at  149.9mph. \nDavid \nJefferies \nsweeps \nthrough \nGinger \nHall \non  \nhis \nwinning \nV&M \nYamaha. \nA  COSTLY BUSINESS @  171 \nAs  manufacturers produced machines with more speed, \nriders had  to  adapt to  cope with it.  Braking points changed, \ncorner entry now required a rider to  tip the machine in ear- \nlier, and  some sweeping bends that had  previously been flat \nout  now required riders to  drop a  gear. More speed meant \nmore of a challenge. Seemingly, riders could not  get enough \nand previous calls for reductions in machine capacities were \nno  longer heard. However, for  all  the  growth in  machine \nperformance, it  was becoming increasingly difficult to \nturn that gain in  power, handling and braking into faster \nlaps. Getting past 122mph lap speeds proved particularly \ndifficult and took several years, but  in  the  period 1990— \n99,  the  outright lap record did  go  up  from 122.63mph to \n124.45mph. \n\nGHAPT ERS TEN \nEAS LERe AND) aassiees \nThe Tourist Trophy race meeting was proud of  its  long \nhistory stretching back to  1907, no  more so  than at  the \nstart of the new millennium in  2000, when people were \nlooking both backwards and forwards, making compari- \nsons with the  past and  anticipating the  future. The event's \nprospects looked bright, with race enthusiasts anticipating \never-growing speeds around the  Mountain Course, where \nthe  absolute lap record now stood at  124.45mph. \nThe term ‘TT’ became embedded into the world of \nmotorcycling during the  twentieth century and with the \never-increasing spread of communications, those same ini- \ntials were becoming familiar to  many in the wider world. It \nwas claimed that 500 million people would watch televised \ntransmissions of the races in 2000 and developing technolo- \ngies were expected to allow ever more people to tune in and \nshare the  excitement of real road racing. Such growth in \nnumbers brought an  increase in associated advertising and, \nin  current jargon, the  TT  would be  turned into a  ‘brand’ \nto  be marketed worldwide. But  while a few sought to  profit \nfrom the  commercial side of the  event, true supporters got \ntheir reward from the  annual dose of high-speed excite- \nment generated by the  top road racers of the day. \nThose racers would continue to  compete for  a  Tourist \nTrophy over the  enduring Mountain Course, where, apart \nfrom customary resurfacing and maintenance, the only real \nimprovement was  to  the  last  of the  Quarry Bends. There \n—— aa \nJoey \nDunlop \nat  \nQuarter \nBridge \non  \nhis  \nwinning \n250 \nHonda \nin  \n2000. \n\nthe  \ncamber \nhad  \nbeen \nadjusted \nin  \nriders’ \nfavour, \ngiving \nan \nimproved \nexit \nonto \nthe  \nSulby \nStraight \nand, \nperhaps, \nan \nextra \nfew \nmph \non \ntheir \nspeeds. \n2000: THE WEATHER \nIn  \n2000, \npractice \nstarted \non  \nSaturday \nevening \nrather \nthan \nthe  \ncustomary \nMonday \nmorning \nand \nsuch \nearly-morning \nsessions \nwere \nnow \ndown \nto \ntwo. \nHowever, \nweather \ncondi- \ntions \nturned \npoor \nin \nthe \nmiddle \nof \npractice \nweek, \nleaving \nNewcomers \nstruggling \nto \nput \nin \nenough \nlaps \nto \nqualify \nand \nexperienced \nriders \nstill \ntrying \nto \nachieve \nthe \nright \nset-up \nfor \ntheir \nrace \nmachines. \nAmong those troubled with set-up problems was  Joey \nDunlop. Armed with a  choice of  a Honda VTR1000SP-W \nfrom World Superbike and a Fireblade for the big races, he \nfound that the former, usually called the  SP1, had a stutter- \ning power delivery and that it did not handle. Much of prac- \ntice was spent doing single laps then coming in to tweak the \nsuspension, before going out  again to  see  if there was any \nimprovement. In the  end, reverting to  the  previous year’s \ntype of tyre helped solve the  handling difficulties. Other \nHonda Britain men on  Fireblades were lain Duffus, Jim \nMoodie and Adrian Archibald. Riding for  Yamaha UK  on \nV&M Ris, David Jefferies and  Michael Rutter had  a  good \npractice. Jefferies’ bike was  also  referred to  as  an  R71, for \nV&M claimed to  have squeezed his  R1  motor into a  modi- \nfied 750cc R7  frame. \nJoey Dunlop’s problems were made all the harder by the \nfact that he had  six  machines to  get race ready. Seemingly, \npast settings did no  more than provide a baseline when rid- \ners  returned to  the  TT, either with a new machine or  one \nthat had been subject to  a  season’s racing since it last  ran \non  the Mountain Course. It was an  intensely busy time. \nGrabbing his  250 for an  early morning lap, Dunlop found \nthat it had  not  been fuelled and spluttered to  a halt at  The \nBungalow. Needing to  get  back to  the  start to  take out \nanother bike, he  found a  paper cup and borrowed some \npetrol from a travelling marshal’s machine. As  his  Honda \nran  on  ‘petroil’, he also needed to  find some oil to  add  to \nthe \npetrol. \nWith \nthe \nassistance \nof \na \nwilling \nspectator \nand \nhis \nbike, \nhe \nremoved \nthe \ndrain \nplug \nfrom \none \nof \nits \nfork-legs, \nmixed \nsome \nof \nthe \ndrained-off \noil \nwith \nthe \npetrol \nin \nhis \ntank \nand \nwas \naway \nto \ncomplete \nhis \nlap. \nAlways \nknown \nas \na \ncanny \nrider, \nDunlop \nhad \ntwenty-five \nyears \nof \nIsle \nof \nMan \nracing \nknowledge \nto \ncall \nupon \nto \nget \nover \nhis \nproblems. \nSuch \nhard-earned \nexperience \nwas \nsomething \nthat \nprevious \nTT \ngreat \nMick \nGrant \ndescribed \nas \n‘priceless’. \nTHE RACING \nJoey \nDunlop \nshowed \nhis \nenduring \nclass \nby \nwinning \nthe \nFASTER AND FASTER @  173 \nopening Formula I race at the  2000 TT. Then, in an  almost \nunbelievable display, he went on  to  take the  next two solo \nraces, the  Lightweight 250  and  the  Ultra Lightweight 125. \nBoth of those wins came against stiff opposition. Just half- \nway through the  meeting, Dunlop already had a hat-trick \nof wins, bringing his total up to  twenty-six. The next best \nwas Mike Hailwood on  fourteen. \nWednesday afternoon’s Junior race at  last  gave Yamaha \na chance to  shine, for it was David Jefferies who took over \nthe  winning ways. He  also went on  to  win the  Production \nand Senior races, which meant that for  the  first time at  a \nTT, two riders achieved hat-tricks of wins in the same year. \nEn  route to  his  victories, ‘DJ’, as  he  was known to  most, \nraised the  race average speed in  the  Junior to  119.13mph \nand  in  the  Senior to  121.95mph, topping it all  with a  new \nabsolute lap record in  the  Senior race of  125.69mph. He \nwas  the first rider to  lap at  125mph —  yet another TT speed \nbarrier smashed. \nHonda’s share of the record-breaking came in the Junior, \nwhere Adrian Archibald lapped at  121.15mph to  become \nthe  first rider to  break 120mph on  a  600. \nNow in  his  fifth year at  the  TT,  John McGuinness was \nslowly building his tally of wins, taking victory in the  Sin- \ngles race, while Rob Fisher was victorious in  both sidecar \nraces, so  making it his third double. \nIn a difficult-to-believe scenario, the declared winner of \nthe  Lightweight 400 TT  was disqualified when his  engine \nwas measured and  found to  be  600cc. The win was  justly \ngiven to  Brett Richmond. \nJOEY —THE ENIGMA \nForty-eight-year-old Joey Dunlop finished 2000 TT  week \nwith third place in  the  Senior race. In doing so  he record- \ned his  fastest ever TT  lap at  123.87mph, setting it on  the \nvery last  lap of the  race. Some three weeks after receiving \nworldwide acclaim for his successes at the renowned Inter- \nnational TT  meeting, Dunlop loaded his  125  Honda into \nhis van, collected long-time supporter John Harris and  his \nCBR600 racer, and  set  off for Estonia to  take part in some \nlocal races. That was  his style —  he did what he fancied. But \nthere, ona rain-soaked surface, he left the  road on  his  125, \ncollided with trackside trees and  was  killed. \nAfter twenty-five years’ racing over the dangerously \nnarrow roads of his  native Ireland and on  the  high-speed \nTT  course, as  well as  on  short circuits worldwide that \nearned him several World Formula | championships, the \nseemingly immortal Joey was  dead. Mourned by the world \nof  motorcycling and beyond, his  funeral in  Ballymoney \nbrought the  town to  a  standstill. Reports talk of  50,000 \nmourners. \n\n174 M  FASTER AND FASTER \nPreviously known as  the Twenty-sixth Milestone, this \nspot on  the Mountain climb was renamed Joey’s in \nrecognition of his  twenty-six TT  victories. \n2002: RACING GOES ON \nHeartless as  it may sound, like all of the  many deaths that \noccur in the dangerous sport of motorcycle racing, follow- \ners  quickly accepted that they represented the past. While \nJoey Dunlop would never be forgotten, race fans now had \nto  look to  the  future. However, what was scheduled to  be \nthe  next TT, in  2001, did  not  happen, for  an  outbreak of \nfoot and  mouth disease in  Britain had  the  Island fearful for \nits farming activity, so  the TT  was  cancelled. \nOn  the  wider stage there was concern that despite the \nproduction-based formula of World Superbike racing, costs \nwere spiralling out  of control, so  manufacturers were look- ° \ning for  ways to  reduce them. There was also recognition \nthat many people were now choosing to  buy 1000cc road \nbikes rather than the 750cc ones raced in the  World Super- \nbike series. \nTwo years after its  last running, the TT returned in  . \n2002. The Isle  of Man welcomed it back, claiming it had \n‘pulled \nout \nall \nthe \nstops \nthis \nyear \nto \nprovide \ngreat \nracing \nand \na \nhuge \nvariety \nof \nentertainment’. \nThere \nwere \nchanges \nto \nthe \nrace \nprogramme. \nThe \nLightweight \n400 \nTT \nand \nthe \nUltra \nLightweight \n125 \nTT \nnow \nran \ntogether, \nwhile \nretaining \ntheir \nseparate \nrace \nidentities. \nA \nsimilar \nsituation \nwas \ncreated \nfor \nthe \nLightweight \n250 \nTT, \nwhich \nwas \nscheduled \nto \nrun \nwith \nthe \nJunior \n600 \nTT. \nThe \nProduction \nTT \nbecame \ntwo \nraces, \non \ndifferent \ndays. \nFirst \nwas \nthe \nProduction \n1000 \nevent \nfor \nfour-stroke \nmachines \nof \n701—1010cc \nto \nACU \nProduction \nRegulations, \nrun \non \nthe \nMonday. \nThe \nother \nwas \nthe \nPro- \nduction \n600 \nTT \nfor \nfour-stroke \nmachines \nup \nto \n600cc \nto \nACU \nProduction \nRegulations, \nrun \non \nFriday. \nThe \nSingles \nTT \nwas \ndropped \nfrom \nthe \nrace \nprogramme. \nAmong other changes were the  introduction of random \nbreathalyzer tests for  competitors and trials of bike-fitted \ntransponders to  aid  lap timing. The organizers also upped \nthe  prize money, with a  ‘bonus’ of £5,000 being paid to \neach race winner. \nCrowds returned in  2002, for  the  TT  was an  essential \npart of many peoples’ lives. Some were satisfied with the \nannual two-week ‘high’ they received from attendance at \nrace time, but for many it was a year-round focus of inter- \nest. Much was expected by the  speed-seeking element in \n2002, for while the TT was  a unique event, it was  also part \nof the  wider motorcycling racing scene, where develop- \nment was driven by World Superbike and GP  racing. Two \nyears’ progress in  those fields should have filtered down \nthrough the  competition departments of firms like  Honda, \nYamaha, Suzuki, Kawasaki and Ducati, to  the  benefit of \nTT  machinery. \nTHE RACING \nThe man expected to  do  much of the  winning was David \nJefferies. However, having switched from Yamaha to  Suzu- \nki shortly before the  event, there was a question mark over \nhow he would go on  a  new bike. Along with Ian  Lougher, \nDJ now rode under the TAS (Temple Auto Salvage)/Suzuki \nbanner. Top Honda runners were John McGuinness and \nAdrian Archibald, while Jim Moodie and  Iain  Duffus rode \nYamahas for V&M Racing. \nDavid Jefferies was  by now the  crowd favourite and  he \ndid  not  disappoint his  many fans, taking record-breaking \nwins in the  Formula I, Production 1000 and  Senior TTs of \n2002. Not  only did that give him his third consecutive hat- \ntrick of wins, but  in  the  Senior he lifted his  own absolute \ncourse record to  127.29mph. It was a  stunning perform- \nance, marred only by his smaller Suzuki breaking a valve in \nthe \nJunior \nrace; \na \nchallenging \nJohn \nMcGuinness \nalso \nblew \nhis \nHonda \nengine \nin \nthat \nrace, \nresulting \nin \nJim \nMoodie \nhap- \npily taking the Junior win  on  his Yamaha. \n\nFASTER AND FASTER 175 \nABOVE: David Jefferies \npowers out of the \nGooseneck on  his  TAS \nSuzuki. \nRob Fisher and Rick Long \nat the Bungalow during \none of their winning rides \nin  2002. \n\n176 M  FASTER AND FASTER \nThe 4-cylinder 600cc motors used in  the  Junior TT \nhad been subject to  much development by manufacturers \nin  their efforts to  offer ‘fastest in  class’ to  potential buy- \ners  of their road machines. Preparation for  racing raised \nengines to  an  even higher state of tune, and John McGuin- \nness’ Honda was redlined at  15,500rpm, a figure that he \nwould seek to  reach as  often as  possible over the  four-lap \nand 151-mile race distance. \nIan  Lougher gave solid support to  his  Suzuki team mate \nDavid Jefferies, including winning the  Production 600 \nrace. Switching to  a  Honda, he  then came home first in \nthe  Ultra Lightweight 125  event, setting new race average \nand  lap records, leaving the  latter at  110.21mph. That was \nsome going for a single-cylinder 125cc machine putting out \napproximately 46bhp. \nAmong first time winners in  2002 were Bruce Anstey \n(Yamaha) in  the  Lightweight 250 and Richard ‘Milky’ \nQuayle (Honda) in the  Lightweight 400, while Rob Fisher \n(LMS) achieved another double on  three wheels. \nIf those watching the  racing were not  convinced from \nthe multitude of new records that bikes were getting faster, \nthe digital speed recorder opposite the  Grandstand showed \nspectators that the  highest speed of  165mph recorded in \n1999 increased to  170mph in  2002, at  a  point where the \nbikes were still accelerating. \nThe Joey Dunlop Trophy was introduced for  2002 and \nawarded to  the best aggregate performance across the  For- \nmula I and  Senior TT  races. As winner of both, David Jef- \nferies collected the  trophy and the  accompanying cheque \nfor £10,000. \n2003: MINOR CHANGES \nTaking its  usual late  May and  early June spot in the  racing \ncalendar, the 2003 TT arrived with an  entry of 319 individ- \nuals, 150 of them being from the seventy-five sidecar crews. \nIt  was to  be  the  last  year of early-morning practice, a \nritual that had started with the  first event in  1907. Many \nriders complained about early-morning practice down the \nyears, as  did some marshals and  officials, for they had to be \nin position well before the  racers arrived. \nThe few Lightweight 250s again ran with the  Junior \n600s, but without a recognized race of their own, and  the \nJunior race was described as  being ‘for Machines to  TT \nSupersport 600 Regulations’, The term Supersport was \none  that would be heard more of in the future. Out on  the \ncourse the  series of bends at  the  Thirty-second Milestone \nwere renamed Duke’s, in honour of star of the  1950s and \nambassador for the TT races, Geoff Duke. \nTransponders were now mandatory and used to  deter- \nmine race results. Timing strips triggered by the  trans- \nponders \nwere \nlocated \nat  \nGlen \nHelen, \nBallaugh, \nRamsey, \nThe \nBungalow, \nCronk \nny \nMona \nand \nthe \nGrandstand. \nThose \ntiming \npoints \ngenerated \nadditional \ninformation \nfor \nrace \ncommentators \n— \nnow \nsitting \nin \nfront \nof \ncomputer \nscreens \n— \nwho \nwere \nable \nto \nquote \nsector \nspeeds, \nplus \nthe \nincreasing/ \ndecreasing \ngaps \nbetween \nriders \nand \nother \ninformation \nthey \nthought \nmight \nbe \nhelpful \nto \nspectators \nand \nsupport \nteams. \nThe \nlatter \nincluded \nthose \nlocated \nin \nthe \npits \nand, \nfor \nsignal- \nling \npurposes, \nthose \nout \naround \nthe \ncourse. \nHONDA DOWN, SUZUKI UP \nHonda had been long-time supporters of the  TT, but  in \n2003 they gave restricted input to  the  event, limiting their \npublicized involvement to Ian Lougher and Dave Molyneux. \nLougher had Colin Edwards’ 2002 World Superbike SP2 and \nMoly had  help with engines. The SP2 was much upgraded \nin fuelling, frame and  engine compared to  the  earlier SP1 \nand  was said to  give 180bhp. Not that Lougher was able to \nuse  all  of that in  the  early stages of practice, for  the  bike \nhad  stability problems at high speed. They were eventually \nironed out  and  a good race set-up obtained. \nSoichiro Honda, founder of  the  company bearing his \nname, knew that success in  racing sold road bikes, but \nsomething Honda no  longer seemed to be the bike of choice \nfor  riders to  compete on  at  the  TT. Five years earlier, at \nthe  1998 event, there were thirty Hondas in the  Formula I \nrace out  of seventy entries and  seventy-two Hondas in the \nJunior race out  of ninety-one entries. In  2003 there were \njust seven in the  Formula I race and  fourteen in the Junior. \nIt was a  change that would not  have escaped the  notice of \nthe  motorcycle-buying public. \nHonda had done their best to  keep their name in  the \nforefront of racing by winning the World Superbike Cham- \npionship with Colin Edwards in  2000 and 2002, although \nDucati probably made a  greater impact with their several \nwins earned by Carl Fogarty and Troy Bayliss. Indeed, their \nracing successes are  said to  have transformed the  Italian \ncompany. But  even Ducati’s multi-wins did  not  encourage \nracers to buy, for there were only seven of them in the 2003 \nFormula I TT.  Yamaha had been successful at the TT of late \nand  there were some twelve R1s  entered, but it was Suzuki \nwho dominated the Formula I  entries in  2003, filling \nthirty-nine of the  eighty places. Just two  years earlier they \nhad  replaced their GSX-R1100 with the  GSX-R1000, fit- \nted  with an  enlarged and  uprated 750cc engine. The 2003 \nversion was claimed to  weigh less, had more power and \nhandled \nbetter. \nThere \nwas \ntalk \nof \n180bhp \nat \nthe \ncrankshaft \nand \n143bhp \nat \nthe \nrear \nwheel \nfor \nthis \n180mph \nmotorcycle. \nDavid \nJefferies \nand  \nAdrian \nArchibald \nwere \nto  \nride \nTAS \nSuzukis, \nJohn \nMcGuinness \nwas \non \na \nDucati \n998, \nwhich \nhe \n\nFASTER AND FASTER 177 \nOver a wet road and with the sun in his  eyes, John McGuinness takes one of the patriotically painted ValMoto \nTriumphs through Ballacraine. \ndescribed as  better than his  previous year’s Fireblade but \nwhich needed a roller-starter after pit stops, and Jason Grif- \nfiths received Yamaha’s support on  an  R1. Those top  men \nwould be looking over their shoulders at  established riders \nlike Iain Duffus, Bruce Anstey, Jim Moodie, Sean Harris \nand  Ian  Lougher, while also being aware of promising ones \nlike Ryan Farquhar, Richard Britton and Martin Finnegan. \nSpectators were particularly interested in seeing how a Val- \nMoto team of Triumphs went, on  their first appearance in \nthe Junior race. \nA SAD DAY \nDavid Jefferies had been slightly slower than team mate \nAdrian Archibald in the early stages of practice in 2003, but \nduring the  long Thursday afternoon session he  was up  to \nspeed and  in Archibald’s slipstream as  they powered down- \nhill into Glen Vine and the sweeping left-hander by the Vic- \narage, which they prepared to  take with barely an  easing of \nthrottles. Then it went wrong for Jefferies as the Suzuki slid \nfrom under him and  both crashed into a  roadside wall. In \nan  instant, the brightest TT star of his generation was  killed \nand  a  family steeped in TT racing was  thrown into mourn- \ning, along with every race follower. After three consecutive \nhat-tricks of TT  victories, the  young superstar was gone. \nEveryone knew that racing could be  a  cruel business and \nthe  TT  more so,  for  it allowed little room for  either rider \nor  mechanical error. A tragedy like  DJ’s made many think \nabout stepping back from motorcycle racing, but it  was \nan  addictive pastime, whatever role a  person took —  rider, \nspectator, sponsor, organizer —  and  most soon returned. \n\n178 M  FASTER AND FASTER \nFAST RACING \nAfter the previous year’s record-breaking spree, speeds \nwere just  slightly down in  some classes in  2003. Adrian \nArchibald rode his Suzuki to  victory in Formula I and  Sen- \nior TTs, but  Imph down on  2002 figures. John McGuinness \nled both of those races on  his Ducati before dropping back \nslightly and Ian  Lougher finished both on  the podium, with \nJason Griffiths taking two fourth places. In  the  Formula \nI race, only the  latter three, out  of the  first thirty-three \nfinishers, rode anything other than Suzuki. \nShaun Harris ensured that Suzuki continued their win- \nning ways by taking both Production 1000 and 600cc \nraces, while fellow-Kiwi Bruce Anstey brought his  Tri- \numph home first in  the  Junior at  a  record-breaking race \naverage speed of 120.36mph. It was a race in which relative \nnew boy Ryan Farquhar impressed by raising the lap record \nto  122.30mph. Another lap record went to  winner of the \nUltra Lightweight 125  race, Chris Palmer (Honda), and he \nalso took the barely recognized 250  win within the  Junior \n600 race. In a world where the  major manufacturers were \nno  longer making ‘proper’ race bikes for  the  Lightweight \nclasses, 125  and 250cc riders faced an  uncertain future as \nmachines aged and  entry numbers fell. \nIan  Bell (Yamaha) and  Dave Molyneux (Honda) took a \nwin each in the  Sidecar races, while runner-up in both was \nlocal man Nick Crowe (Ireson). \nFor  several years, entries for the  Senior TT  had been by \ninvitation, based upon the  fastest riders in  practice. Allo- \ncated number 1 in 2003, Adrian Archibald felt that was  not \nright, as  David Jefferies had  set  a  fractionally faster time. \nAccordingly, he obtained the organizer’s permission to con- \ntest  the  Senior under number 0.  It was part of Archibald’s \ntribute to  a great rider and team mate. \nFurther tragedy struck away from the TT  later in  2003, \nwhen eleven-times winner Steve Hislop was killed in a hel- \nicopter crash shortly after winning the  British Superbike \nChampionship. \n2004: NEW ORGANIZERS \nThe ACU had  run  the  TT  races since 1907, with what, at \ntimes, had  seemed to  be  the  reluctant involvement of the \nManx government. But  times had changed. The financial \nvalue of the  races to  the  Island was recognized and from \n2004 the  government took a  twenty-year licence to  run \nthe \nentire \nevent. \nIt \nappointed \nthe \nManx \nMotor \nCycle \nClub \nLtd to  organize the  racing on  its  behalf. Having run the \nManx \nGrand \nPrix \nsince \nits \ninception \nas \nthe \nAmateur \nraces \nin \n1923, \nthe \nclub \nwas \nin \na \ngood \nposition \nto \ndo \nso. \nThe \ngov- \nernment \nalso \ninjected \nsome \nextra \neffort \nto \nattract \nquality \nriders, for the TT  was  in need of a boost. \nLike \nany \nnew \nbroom, \nthe  \nMMCC \nmade \nits \npresence \nfelt \nwith \nchanges. \nIts \nfirst \naction \nwas \nto \ndo \naway \nwith \nearly- \nmorning \npractice, \nthe \nloss \nof \ntrack \ntime \nbeing \npartially \ncom- \npensated \nfor \nby \nthe \nintroduction \nof \npractice \nlaps \nafter \neach \nday’s \nracing. \nNo \none \ngave \na \ndefinitive \nreason \nfor \nthe \nchange. \nIt \nwas \nknown \nthat \nmany \nriders \ndisliked \nearly \npractice, \nthat \nmarshals \nwere \nharder \nto \nget \nand, \nalthough \nunspoken, \nthat \nthe \ngrowing \nspecialization \nof \nrace \ntyres \nmeant \nthey \nwere \nbecoming \nunsuitable \nfor \nthe \nmixed \ndamp/dry \nconditions \nmost \nlikely \nto \nbe \nmet \nat \nsix \no’clock \nin \nthe \nmorning. \nA surprise move was the  reduction of the  race distance \nfor the Formula I and  Senior races from six laps to four. The \nreason given here was  that statistics showed more accidents \noccurred late in the race. The majority opposed the change. \nThe entry system for the  Senior TT, whereby the  fastest \nriders in  practice received an  invitation to  take part, was \nshown to have caused a reduction in the number who turned \nup to ride. For  2004, entries were invited in advance, as  for \nthe other races. \nENTRIES \nOverall numbers of race entries were good for 2004 at 731, \nbut, as in previous years, the level of support from manufac- \nturers varied. Honda had no  named presence although they \nmay have given Ian  Lougher support in  the  Formula I and \nSenior races on  a  CBR-RR through Mark Johns Motors. \nIan  had  other Honda-mounted rides from private entrants \nin  the  Junior, Production 1000 and  600, and Ultra Light- \nweight 125  classes. Official support from Yamaha Motor \n(UK) Ltd  was  given to  John McGuinness and  Jason Grif- \nfiths, while Adrian Archibald and  Bruce Anstey were with \nTAS Suzuki. Potential front runners on  Kawasakis were \nRyan Farquhar and Shaun Harris, while a Newcomer des- \ntined to  catch the  eye was Guy Martin. \nRECORDS GALORE \nJohn McGuinness showed his  true class as  a TT  rider in \n2004, taking his  first hat-trick of wins. He  was victori- \nous  in  the  opening Formula I race on  a  Yamaha, where \nhe  became the  first to  achieve a  race average speed of \n125mph (125.38mph) and  where he  lifted the  lap record \nto  127.68mph. He  went on  to  break records in  the \nLightweight 400 race on  a  Honda, before reverting to  a \nYamaha \nfor \nrecord-breaking \nwins \nin \nthe \nJunior. \nDespite \nhis \nundoubted talent, McGuinness admitted to being ‘a bit laid \nback’ \nin \nhis \napproach \nto \nracing, \nbut \nin \n2004 \nhe \nhad \nJim \nMoodie \nin \nhis \nsupport \nteam \nand \ncredited \nhim \nwith \nkeeping \nhim focused. \nElsewhere, \nBruce \nAnstey \n(Suzuki) \nlifted \nProduction \n1000cc \nrecords \nto \na \nnew \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nof \n123.72mph \n\nand a   new lap record of \n125.10mph; Ryan Farquhar \n(Kawasaki) took his  first TT \nwin in  the Production 600; \nChris Palmer (Honda) raised \nrace average and lap  records \nin  the Ultra Lightweight 125 \nrace; and Dave Molyneux \n(DMR Honda) did the same in \nthe Sidecar races. To  Adrian \nArchibald (Suzuki) went the \nSenior TT win, after initial \nleaders John McGuinness and \nIan Lougher both retired. It \nwas a very good year for those \nwho liked their racing to  be \nfaster and  faster. \nThe scale of  high-speed \nactivity generated by the \nTT can be  seen from figures \nshowing that riders com- \npleted 3,065 laps in  practice \nand 1,780 in  the  races. Total \ndistance covered was nearly \n183,000 miles. \nABOVE: Dave Molyneux and Dan Sayle (DMR) take a tight line through the sweeping \nbends at  the Eleventh Milestone. \nBELOW: Newcomers experiencing their first lap over closed roads behind a travelling \nmarshal. \n\n180 PAS TER AND FASTER \nThe organizing MMCC made slight changes to  the  regula- \ntions for bikes contesting the TT in 2005, aimed at bringing \nthem in  line with those raced on  British short circuits, It \nalso renamed the race classes to  reflect what was  happening \nelsewhere. The Formula I race now became the  TT  Super- \nbike race, Production races were replaced by TT  Super- \nstock and the Junior became the Supersport Junior TT.  The \nabove were now only open to  four-strokes; there was no \nplace in  the  new race programme for  125  and 250cc two- \nstroke machines, nor for  400cc four-strokes. It  was said \nthat the changes reflected the  views of riders and  manufac- \nturers, but  there was no  mention of those held by specta- \ntors. Manufacturers Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki and  Kawasaki \nwere present to  support a seven-race programme, compris- \ning two Sidecar races (A and B), two Supersport Junior (A \nand  B),  an  opening TT  Superbike and  closing Senior TT \nthat were, in effect, duplicate races, and one  TT  Superstock \nrace. \nTyre \nmarks \non  \nthe \nroad \nshow \nthe \neffect \nof \nfull  \nthrottle \nbeing \napplied \no \nThe changes brought no  visual differences to the machines \nraced in  2004 and  the  harmonization of regulations saw  no \nattributable enhancement of performance. Superbike and \nSenior TTs reverted to  six  laps, but  the  number of individ- \nual competitors dropped to  244, with the organizers claim- \ning that they were now concentrating on  quality rather than \nquantity. Many found it  regrettable that there were only \nfour non-Japanese machines in  the  entire solo and.sidecar \nentry —  one MV Agusta, one Aprilia and two Triumphs. \nIn a  bid  to  help Newcomers, they were given their own \nintroductory lap at  the  outset of practice. Going out in  a \ngroup, they were shown the  way by travelling marshals \nriding at  the  head, middle and rear, at  controlled speeds. \nIn later years, these orange-jacketed first-timers would be \nbroken into smaller groups and led  by former racers. \nTYRES \nWith tyre manufacturers chasing the  publicity to  be gained \nfrom success in  racing, their development efforts resulted \nn  \nthe \nexit \nof \nthe \nlast \nof \nthe \nQuarry \nBends, \nto \ngain \nmaximum \nmomentum \nfor  \nthe  \nSulby \nStraight \nthat \nfollows. \n\nen \nSweeping through light and shade at  Union Mills. \nin  tyres that now laid continuous black stripes around the \nentire 37% miles of the  Mountain Course. There certainly \nwas no  secret as  to  where the  racing line was, for  it  was \nthere on  the  road surface for all to  see, both on  the  corners \nand the straights. However, it did reveal differences of opin- \nion  as  to  what exactly was the  right line, being up  to  2m \nwide on  some corners. \nIncreased tyre performance came from greater speciali- \nzation in  design and construction. With the  Island known \nfor  its  variable weather conditions, the  TT  really needed \ntyres that could cope with roads that were wet and dry \nduring a  race, but  that flexibility was not  a  feature of cur- \nrent tyre development. There were tyres for wet roads and \ntyres for  dry ones, but  the  in-between going often found \nat  the  TT  presented problems, because ‘wets’ would soon \ndeteriorate over drying roads and ‘slicks’ were unsafe in the \nwet. Such problems were compounded for  both solos and \nsidecars by the  ever-increasing power outputs of modern \nrace machines. \nThe situation was brought into focus during practice for \nthe  2005 TT, when time was lost due to  wet conditions. \nClerk of  the  Course, Neil Hanson, laid  down a  marker for \nthe  future when he  stated that he  would no  longer start a \nTT  race in  wet conditions. That decision was taken in  the \ninterests of safety, but  it was one that would impact upon \nfuture events. Indeed, it  affected the  opening Superbike \nrace in  2005 and saw it postponed until Sunday. \nRACING \nWhilst Superbike, Superstock and Supersport races intro- \nduced new titles to  the  2005 TT, it was still reasonable to \ncompare their results and  speeds with previous Formula I, \nProduction and Junior races. A fast pace was  set  throughout \nthe  seven-race programme, with records broken in  four of \nthem. Bruce Anstey (Suzuki) lifted the TT  Superstock (for- \nmerly Production 1000) average race speed to  124.44mph \nand  TAS Suzuki team mate Adrian Archibald set  a  new lap \nrecord of  126.64mph. In  TT  Supersport A  (formerly Jun- \nior  TT), Ian  Lougher (Honda) increased the  average race \nspeed to  120.93mph, while in  the  Senior TT, winner John \nMcGuinness (Yamaha) set  off with the aim of establishing a \nlead from the outset and raised the  lap record to  127.33mph \n\n182 PASTERVAND FASTER \non  his  opening lap. McGuinness also won the  opening TT \nSuperbike race (formerly Formula I), at just under record \nspeed. \nOn three wheels, a charging Dave Molyneux lifted aver- \nage speeds by an  impressive 3'mph, leaving the  race aver- \nage figure at  114.90mph and  the  lap record at  116.04mph. \nMoly set  his  new records in  Sidecar race B, having struck \ntrouble in race A, which saw a first win for Nick Crowe. \nTOO HOT \nThe TT  Supersport races attracted the  highest number of \nentries in  2005 and 2006. The 4-cylinder 600cc machines \nused in  them were subject to  development effort by the \nmanufacturers and by race tuners, but, as  always, there was \na  price to  pay  for  speed and in  2005 it showed itself in the \nform of reduced reliability. There were seventy finishers \nin  race A  from eighty-one starters, but  only fifty-eight in \nrace B  from seventy-five starters. Significantly, amongst \nthose failing to  complete the  second race were the  factory- \nJohn \nMcGuinness \nkeeps \nhis  \nmany \nsponsors \nhappy \nby \ndisplaying \ntheir \nlogos. \nsupported Hondas and  Suzukis, plus the  Yamaha of John \nMcGuinness. \nWhile a  private runner might have to  effect an  engine \nrebuild at the TT in the back of a van, 600cc works engines \nneeded full workshop attention. Notwithstanding the \nexcellent service facilities available from the expensive \nmobile workshops run  by many teams at the TT, they could \nnot  undertake the  between-races sort of rebuilds required \nby machines that had been overstressed by the  demands of \nthe  Mountain Course. The solution chosen by the  manu- \nfacturers, and accepted by the  organizers, was to  reduce \nthe  TT  Supersport to  one race for  2006, giving a  six-race \nprogramme. \nThe slimmed-down programme of  six  races did not go \ndown well with all  TT  fans, for  many remembered when \nthere were ten, and  even if some of them were combined \nto  give races within races, they did  offer variety in  sights \nand sounds. For others, six races \nwere enough, because a large number \nof  them were present to  enjoy the \nTT  scene as  a  whole, with its  varied \nentertainments and general motorcy- \ncling theme. To them, the  races were \njust a part of that scene. \nOn the organizing side, efforts \nwere being made to attract more qual- \nity riders to  the  event, although the \noverall number of  entries accepted \nwas reduced to  give slightly smaller \ngrids. For 2006, there were just 226 \nindividual competitors across solos \nand sidecar events, with revised \ntimetabling bringing some changes to \ntheir race days. They did  at  least now \nenjoy free entries, but a  new intro- \nduction was a  ‘TT licence’, designed \nto  ensure that competitors had  recent \nand relevant racing experience. \nThe big  four Japanese manufac- \nturers were again supporting the  TT \nin  2006, along with major private \nentrants and sponsors. For Honda it \nwas HM Plant, Suzuki used Temple \nAuto Salvage (TAS), Yamaha were \nrepresented by  AIM Racing, and \nKawasaki appeared in  the colours \nof McAdoo Racing. As  had been the \nway for  some years, the  manufactur- \n\ners’ efforts were made through such \nprivate teams. Quite what their level \nof support to  those teams amounted \nto  was a closely kept secret. \nAlong with improving the  quality \nof competitors it invited to  race, plus \nbetter promotion and  marketing, the \nTT was now portraying itself to  a \ngrowing audience in  an  increasingly \nprofessional manner. In  the  modern \nworld such factors registered and \nwere important, resulting in  grow- \ning interest from riders, sponsors, \npress and TV. \nTHE COURSE \nThe Mountain Course still had more \nthan its  share of bumps, jumps, off- \ncamber corners, changes in surfacing \nand other factors that affected han- \ndling. Part of a  rider’s TT  education \nwas learning how to  deal with them. \nThe worst bumps could sometimes \nbe  avoided by taking a  non-standard \nline, while jumps needed the correct \ntechnique. Newcomer Ian  Mackman \nhad not  mastered that technique and \ntold of his experience: \nBallacrye is  a  14Omph jump \nfollowing a_   sixth-gear left- \nhander. You come around the \ncorner, get the  bike upright as \nquickly as possible and crack the \nthrottle open. I didn’t quite get \nthe  bike upright and it  landed \nwith the  wheels out  of line. I \nthink the  spectators could hear \nme  screaming before the  wheels \neven hit the deck. The bike \nlanded and the rear wheel threw \nitself from full lock one  way to \nfull lock the  other repeatedly, \neventually straightening itself \n200 yards up  the  road. A  big \nmoment. \nRoad conditions changed from year \nto  year, meaning that the learning \nprocess was  never complete. \nFASTER AND FASTER 183 \na \n_— | \nEven \n|25cc \nmachines \n‘jump’ \nat  \nBallacrye, \nas  \nNigel \nBeattie \nshows \nat  \nthe \n2003 \nTT. \n\n184 M  FASTER AND FASTER \nThere had been few major changes to the course in recent \nyears, but  2006 saw  reconstruction of Windy Corner. An \nopen, windswept bend at a height of 1,220ft (372m), it had \nseen its  share of racing incidents. From the 1930s to  the \n1950s it  was a  second-gear corner taken at  55—60mph. \nToday it is a  fourth-gear job, with riders taking advantage \nof its wide, positively cambered, right-handed sweep to get \nthe fastest run  on  towards the Thirty-third Milestone. The \n2006 improvements were thought to  save riders 4 seconds \na lap and, apart from the cat’s eyes on  the inside of the bend \nhaving to  be  lowered after John McGuinness complained \nthat he was  catching his knee-sliders on  them, the work was \nrated a major improvement. \nThe upgrading of Windy Corner was carried out  princi- \npally on  road safety grounds. Other measures introduced \nfor  the  benefit of the Manx motoring public included a \nprogramme of applying ‘Shell-grip’ at  busy junctions and \non  some bends. A blend of epoxy resin and  bitumen with \ncalcined bauxite chippings, it gave enhanced grip, but there \nwas little comment as  to  whether it offered benefit to  the \nracers. \nPractice week normally experienced mixed weather, \nbut in 2006 it was  almost completely dry. This enabled the \nrubber laid on  the  track to  remain and  riders felt  that this \ncontributed to grip. \nRACING \nMorecambe’s John McGuinness was  now recognized as  the \ntop TT rider of the era, although he had plenty of challeng- \ners  for that position. McGuinness was  riding works Hondas \nunder the  HM Plant banner in 2006 and  got off to  a  flying \nstart with victory on  a Fireblade in the  opening TT  Super- \nbike race, setting a  new lap record in  the  process. With \nrecord-breaking wins in  the  Supersport and Senior TTs, \nhe also raised the  absolute lap record to  129.45mph in the \nSenior and led something of a resurrection for Honda at the \nTT, where Nick Crowe also  used their new 600 engines to \nachieve a Sidecar double at record-breaking speeds. Having \nunofficially broken the  Sidecar lap record during practice, \nDave Molyneux was  travelling at  145mph when he managed \nto flip his outfit onto its back at Rhencullen in a later session \nand  put himself out  of the racing. \nOnly \nin  \nTT  \nSuperstock \ndid  \nHonda \nmiss \nout  \nin  \n2006. \nThere \nvictory \nwent \nto \nBruce \nAnstey \n(Suzuki) \nat \njust \nbelow \nrecord \npace, \nwith \nlan \nHutchinson \n(Kawasaki) \nsecond \nand \nJason \nGriffiths \n(Yamaha) \nthird. \nThe \nlatter \nwas  \n‘Mr \nConsist- \nent’ \nat \nthe \nTT, \nfor \nwhile \nnever \na winner, \nhe \nachieved \nmul- \ntiple \npodium \nfinishes. \nIn \nonly \nhis \nsecond \nyear \nat the \nevent, \nCameron \nDonald \nshowed \nthat \nhe \nwas \na \nman \nto \nwatch, \nwith \nsecond \nplace \nin \nthe \nSenior \nrace, \nand \nfuture \nstar, \nManxman \nConor \nCummins, \nmade \na  \nsteady \ndebut, \nas  \ndid  \nWilliam \nDunlop. \nSPEEDS ON  BRAY HILL \nThis fearsome drop has  fascinated spectators and fright- \nened riders down the  years, with many and  varied claims \nas  to  speeds achieved. At  the  first running of the  TT  over \nthe  Mountain Course in  1911, a  local newspaper forecast, \nperhaps optimistically, that riders would take it  at  up  to \n70mph. By the mid-1930s they were timed at 95mph; after \nsome smoothing, Omobono Tenni took it at a highly coura- \ngeous 120mph in  1948; while in the early 1950s, Manxman \nJackie Wood was  the  fastest at  127mph. \nOne thing that race followers always wanted to  know \nwas were riders flat  out  coming down Bray? For  their part, \nriders indicated that they were and speeds quoted were usu- \nally close to  the  maximum speed of the  day, although, in \nreality, only the  fastest riders kept the  throttle wire really \nstretched to  the  limit. Lesser riders would usually permit \nthemselves a little slack —  and  who can  blame them? \nAs  machine speeds increased, the  pace down Bray Hill \nalso got  quicker. By  1967 Mike Hailwood was talking of \n‘doing about 145mph ...  and everything bottoms in  the \ndip’. In the  1980s, top riders reckoned they could use  full \nthrottle on  the  popular Suzuki RG500s of the  day, which \nwould have been about 155mph. \nIn the  early 1990s Steve Hislop took an  RVF Honda and \nthe  rotary-engined Norton through the  bottom flat  in  top \ngear, which he thought equated to  167—170mph, while fast- \nest  lapper in  the  early 2000s, David Jefferies, felt  that his \nYamaha had  too  much power, and ‘I rolled it back’. How- \never, after moving to  a  Suzuki he  told, ‘I managed to  do \nBray Hill absolutely flat in the  Senior race ...  doing at least \n175mph, possibly 180’. \nIn  2006, John McGuinness explained, ‘I normally click \nthe big one  into top gear as  I crest the brow of Bray Hill ... \nit’s about 180mph down there’, with Guy Martin confirm- \ning ‘it must be knocking on  180mph’, \nA big enough challenge on  a  solo, Bray Hill must seem \nmuch narrower with a sidecar. In  the  late 1970s top man \nJock Taylor told  how he  used to  be  flat  out, but  how the \ndevelopment of bumps in  the  road meant he  backed off \nto  120mph. Moving on  some forty years, it is perhaps no \nsurprise that many-times winner and current star, Dave \nMolyneux, holds his  self-designed DMR outfit flat out, \nextracting every bit of power to  hit  150mph. \nTT CENTENARY 1907—2007 \nIn \n2007 \nthe \nIsle \nof \nMan \nwas \nawash \nwith \njustifiable \ncelebra- \ntion, \nas \nthe \nTT \nreached \nthe \ncentenary \nof \nits \nfirst \nrunning \n\nover \nthe  \nSt \nJohn’s \nCourse \nin  \n1907. \nIt \nreally \nwas \na  \nfantastic \nachievement, \nfor \nhaving \nsuffered \ncountless \nproblems \ndown \nthe \nyears, \nit \nhad \novercome \nthem \nall \nand \nreached \n2007 \nin \na \nposition \nof \nstrength, \nwith \neveryone \nexpecting \nfast \nand \nexciting \nracing. \nTo \nthat \nend, \nas \nJohn \nMcGuinness \nhad \nset \na \nnew \nabsolute \nlap \nrecord \nin \n2006 \nof \n129.45mph, \npeople \nlooked \nto \nhim \nto \nmake \na \ncentenary \nstatement \nby \nbreaking \nthe \n130mph \nbarrier \nin \n2007. \nBy \ncomplete \ncoincidence, \nthe  \nHighway \nAuthority \ndid \nits \nbit \nto \nspeed \nriders’ \npassage \nwith \nconsiderable \nwiden- \ning \nworks \nat \nBrandish \nCorner. \nThis \npreviously \ntightish \nleft- \nhander, \nwith \nroadside \nbanks \nand \nrailings, \nwas \nthus \nmade \nmuch \nfaster. \nEarly \nin \npractice, \nJohn \nMcGuinness \nvoiced \nthe \nopinion \nthat \nthe \nalterations \nat \nBrandish \nhad \nturned \na \n‘S5Omph \ncorner \ninto \na \n150mph \none’. \nHe \nwas \nprobably \nbeing \na \nbit \nconservative \nin \nputting \nthe \nformer \nspeed \nas \nlow \nas \n50mph, \nbut \nthe \nmessage \nwas \nclear \n— it \nwas \nnow \nconsid- \nerably \nfaster. \nEstimating \nthat \nit \nwould \n‘reduce \naverage \nlap \ntimes \nby \nthree \nseconds’, \nhe \nadded \nthat \nbecause \nit \nwas \nso \nsmooth \nand \nopen \nit \nwould \nbe top \ngear \non \na \n600, \nbut \nthat \nhe \nwould \n‘knock \nit \nback \none \nand \nroll \nit \non \nthe \nbig \none’. \nThere was nothing new about course improvements \ncontributing to  the reduction in  lap  times. It  had been \nhappening for  100 years and, while it was not  possible to \nmake an  accurate assessment of the time saved, it certainly \namounted to  many minutes. \nWhatever was going to happen on  the race front in 2007, \nthe  supporting industry ensured that there was plenty of \nTT centenary memorabilia available to  fans: books were \npublished, commemorative stamps issued, special coins \nminted, compilation DVDs of  former races offered and \nthere were photo exhibitions looking back over the  past \n100  years, plus a  re-enactment of the  first TT  over the  St \nJohn’s Course. \nQUALITY RIDERS \nAn active rider recruitment campaign meant that \nthe TT was into a  period where each year saw new \nentries from established short-circuit racers who fan- \ncied the challenge and potentially good payout TT \nracing offered them. For  2007, former British Supersport \nchampion and  regular British Superbike competitor, Steve \nPlater, tried his  hand on  R1  and R6  Yamahas supplied by \nAIM Racing, while Keith Amor and Gary Johnson were \nother first-timers. Also, although this was a  return from \nyears \nat \nBritish \nSuperbike \nracing \nrather \nthan \nan \nIsland \ndebut, \npast \nregular \ncompetitor \nand \nTT \nwinner \nMichael \nRutter, \nstill \nonly \nthirty-three, \nmade \nan \nIsland \ncomeback \non \nKawasaki \nZX-10R \nand \nZX-6R \nbikes \nfrom \nMSS \nDiscovery \nKawasaki. \nFASTER AND FASTER MP  185 \nGROWING SPEEDS \nThe influx of such quality riders served as  a  spur to  estab- \nlished TT stars and  was  just another factor that helped con- \ntribute to  the  year-on-year growth in  speeds, as  everyone \nupped their game. Its effect would not  be measurable but it \njoined other influences like increased pressure from high- \nlevel sponsors, greater coverage and the subsequent gaining \nof publicity from TV  and online activities and, of course, \nthe  associated growth in  financial rewards available to  top \nriders. All  served to  heighten expectations and perform- \nances. \nAt  the  same time, a  never-ending stream of  machine \nimprovements played a  major part in increasing speeds. As \nit had  been for  a  century, this was a  step-by-step process, \nwith the  effect of each individual improvement being dif- \nficult to  quantify. John McGuinness arrived for  the  2007 \nevent with his  big Honda having a  ‘new spec’ engine with \nimproved engine management electronics, plus new fork \nyokes. He  was confident they contributed to  a better bike, \nbut no  one  could predict or  measure what effect that would \nhave on  race speeds. As  far  as  straight-line speeds went, \nMcGuinness reckoned his  Honda was giving him 195mph \non  Sulby Straight. It was such Sulby moments that caused \nhim to  say, ‘when you  are  on  the  bike, wide open and  flat \nout, it’s  the  best feeling in  the  world’. Lesser mortals can \nonly imagine, with envy, the  heightening of all  senses that \nmust occur in such a situation. \nRECORDS ALLTHE WAY \nThe result of  100 years of motorcycle development was \nshowcased at the 2007 TT. Contesting the event had helped \nmanufacturers enhance design and performance across all \naspects of the racing motorcycle, with those getting it right \nreturning home in triumph, while for those who got things \nwrong it was a  case of going back to  the  drawing board. \nThe pace was hot in  practice, and further proof that \ndesign and performance were still advancing came when, \nin  the  ensuing Centenary race week, records were broken \nin  all  classes. However, although nobody disputed that \ntyres were a  factor contributing to  advances in  perform- \nance, their unsuitability for  use  in  mixed road conditions \nand a  claim of poor visibility caused the  postponement of \nSaturday’s opening races until Sunday. \nWith track conditions still not  perfect, John McGuin- \nness (Honda) opened his  2007 TT  with a  win in the  post- \nponed Superbike race, leading home Guy Martin (Honda) \nand breaking both race average speed and lap records for \nthe  class, at  125.55mph and 128.27mph. Next day, ‘King \nof the  Superstocks’, Bruce Anstey (Suzuki), took his  third \nconsecutive win in  the  class in  perfect conditions. Again \n\n186 FASTER AND FASTER \n| \n| \nrecords were broken, with Anstey actually getting around \nfaster than the  Superbike speeds, his  race average being \n125.87mph and fastest lap 128.40mph. It was  a tremendous \nperformance by the  Kiwi on  what was said to  be  a  stock \nbike fitted with a  forks kit and  aftermarket rear shock but, \nstrangely, Anstey could not  get his  big Suzuki to  handle in \nthe  Superbike and  Senior races. A welcome sight and sound \nin  the  Superstock event was Martin Finnegan bringing a \nfactory-supported MV Agusta into fourth place. \nA less  than fully fit lan  Hutchinson (Honda) rode to  his \nfirst PT victory in  the Supersport race, setting a  new race \naverage record speed of  123.22mph, with John McGuin- \nness (Honda) just 2.84 seconds behind and Guy Martin \n(Honda) being the  first to  break the  125mph barrier on  a \n600. Martin took third place and left  the  new lap record \nat  125.16mph. The sidecar races saw two wins for  Dave \nMolyneux using Honda power, although he was just short \nof his  own race average record, but  Nick Crowe used his \nHonda power to break the outright lap record for the three- \nwheelers, leaving it at  a heady 116.67mph. Unfortunately, \nsuch treatment also  saw  Crowe break his Honda engine, so \nhe did  not  finish the  race. \nCome the  last  race of the  week, the  Senior TT, and the \ntarget of a 130mph lap was there for the  taking by the  top \nriders. The man who rose to  the occasion and  put his name \ninto the  record books was John McGuinness. With some \nHistory is made as  the \nscoreboard opposite \nthe Grandstand \nrecords the first \n130mph lap. \n200bhp available from \nhis Honda, he  opened \nwith a standing-start lap \nspeed of 129.98mph, \nsmashed the 130mph \nbarrier on   his second \nlap at  130.35mph and \nraced on  to  victory at  a \nnew Senior race aver- \nage record speed of \n127.25mph. McGuin- \nness won by 32  seconds \nfrom Guy Martin, who \nwas followed by lan \nHutchinson and Ian  Lougher. The first four all rode Honda \nFireblades. \nJohn McGuinness joined a select band of record-breakers \nand  the  130mph title was truly his, for he was the  only one \nin the  race to  reach the  figure. It was an  achievement that \nset  the seal on  a memorable and record-breaking Centenary \nIe. \nSPEEDS \nShown below is the  progression in  speeds since the  Moun- \ntain Course was brought into use in  1911. \nFirst lap achieved at  _—_ Rider Year \n50mph Frank Philipp 1911 \n60mph Jimmy Simpson 1924 \n70mph Jimmy Simpson 1926 \n80mph Jimmy Simpson 1931 \n90mph Freddie Frith 193y7 \n100mph Bob McIntyre 1957 \n110mph John Williams 1976 \n120mph Steve Hislop 1989s \n130mph John McGuinness 2007 \nDuring the  period covered by this chapter, 1999-2007, \nfastest \nlap \nspeeds \nincreased \nfrom \n124.45mph \nto \n130.35mph. \nThat was impressive. \n\nGre PE RAEI E VEN \nONWARDS \nAND \nUPWARDS \nANNO a> » — rrz An rT r ab a Tmne \nEvery TT brings changes, and the  2008 event had  its share. \nSome affect the average spectator ina way that he or  she can \nsee  and feel, but many leave them untouched. Coming in the \nlatter category was the  news for  2008 that after four years \nin the hands of the Manx Motor Cycle Club, organization of \nthe races was to  revert back to  the  ACU under the auspices \nof ACU (Events) Ltd. Of more direct effect on  fans  seeking \nto  watch from their favourite spots around the  Mountain \nCourse, was the introduction of a wide range of restrictions \non  where they could stand. This came about after a  safety \nreview, following an  accident towards the  end  of the  2007 \nSenior race when a rider and two spectators were killed, \nand two marshals severely injured. The accident occurred \n\n188 HM  ONWARDS AND UPWARDS \nOld hands: top sidecar man Dave Molyneux (right) shares a joke with top solo \nrider John McGuinness. \nat Joey’s —  the  Twenty-sixth Milestone. Despite the  impo- \nsition of those restrictions, there still remain many places \nwhere spectators can  stand close the  racing and so  experi- \nence the  high-speed thrills of TT-watching. \nOn the racing front, the second Supersport race returned \nto  the  programme for  2008, and the 125 and 250cc TT \nraces were also reinstated. Rather diluting the news of \nthe  two-strokes’ return was the  fact that they would run \nover the 444-mile Billown Circuit in the south of the  Island \nrather than over the  Mountain Course. They would be part \nof Billown’s customary Steam Packet Race meeting, run  on \nthe  Saturday after the  Senior TT. \nTHE YOUNG GUNS \nA promotional theme at the  2008 TT  went under the head- \ning of ‘Young Guns’ and featured some of the  star young \nriders contesting the  event. The basis of the promotion was \nthat their growing talents showed that the  future of the \nTT  was in good hands. Those included were Conor Cum- \nmins, William Dunlop, Martin Finnegan, James Hillier, \nlan Hutchinson, Gary Johnson, Olie Linsdell and Guy Mar- \ntin. Of course, “Hutchie’ had already won a  TT  and Guy \nMartin had  come close to  doing so. \nJoining his  brother William, a  young Michael Dunlop \nrode his  first TT  in  2008. They were the  sons of the  late \nRobert Dunlop, himself a  five-times TT  winner. \nAll  of the  above would have been \non  high-class machines, but every- \none’s aim was to  achieve a  works \nride. It was an  age  where most fac- \ntories entrusted the  preparation and \nmanagement of their bikes to  private \nentrants like  TAS and HM Plant. \nHonda had  given much support to \nthe  TT  down the  years, but  its  level \nhad fluctuated in  recent times. This \nwas probably caused more by budg- \netary constraints than a reduction in \nenthusiasm. In  2008 there were no \nofficial Honda works entries at  the \nTT. It meant that John McGuinness \nwas mounted on  Padgett-supplied \nHondas, which, he  was assured, \nincorporated the  best Honda Racing \nbits. Honda’s decision not  to  support \nthe 2008 TT meant that both Ian \nHutchinson and Jan  Lougher had to \nfind alternative machinery. Hutchie \njoined Steve Plater at  AIM Racing, \nwhere they would race Yamahas. \nPlater was back at  the  TT  for a  second year, having set  the \nfastest-ever Newcomer’s lap of 125.61mph in  2007, on  an \nAIM RI  that was deliberately softer in  engine and chassis \ntune than their normal British Superbike machine. Indica- \ntions were that he would be on  a sharper version for  2008. \nAn  already strong sidecar class of established ‘drivers’ \nlike Dave Molyneux, Nick Crowe, John Holden, Steve \nNorbury and former World Champion Klaus Klaffenbok \nwere joined by three-times World Champion Tim Reeves. \nBetween them they used a mix of Honda and Suzuki power \nunits in Dave Molyneux Racing (DMR) and Louis Christian \nRacing (LCR) chassis. Like the solos, the sidecar men were \nkeen to  incorporate every new power-enhancing engine \n‘mods’ that the regulations allowed. They also sought \nimprovements in areas like the chassis, cooling, suspension, \nbraking and streamlining. \nNEW STARS \nWith solid previous TT placings, including a fine second in \nthe  2006 Senior race, Cameron Donald probably missed \nout  on  being classified as  a  “Young Gun’ at  twenty-nine \nyears of age. However, the  Australian was to  be the  star of \nthe  2008 meeting, mounted on  TAS Suzukis. \nIn the  opening Superbike race he moved to  the front on \nthe  fourth lap after earlier leader, Guy Martin (Honda), \nwas forced to  retire. Holding off  a  challenge from team \n\nmate \nBruce \nAnstey, \nhe  \nrode \nto  \nhis  \nfirst \nTT  \nwin, \nsetting \na \nnew \nrace \naverage \nrecord \nof \n126.82mph, \nwith \nthe \nfastest \nlap \ngoing \nto \nGuy \nMartin \nat \na \nnew \nrecord \nspeed \nfor \nthe \nclass \nof \n129.54mph. \nAfter \nthe  \ngeneral \nrecord-breaking \nspree \nof \n2007, \nit \nwas \nperhaps \nnot \nsurprising \nthat \nrecords \nin \nall \nother \nsolo \nraces \nremained \nintact \nin \n2008. \nThat \nis \nnot \nto \nsay \nthe \npace \nwas \nslow, \nfor \n‘Cam’ \nDonald \ntook \nhis \nsecond \nwin \nin \nthe \nSuper- \nstock \nrace \nat \njust \n0.10mph \nbelow \nthe \nrecord. \nAt  \nthirty-five \nyears \nof \nage, \nSteve \nPlater \n(Yamaha) \nwas \ndefinitely \ntoo \nold \nto \nbe \nconsidered \na ‘Young \nGun’, \nbut \nhis \nperformances \nin \n2008 \njustifiably \nsaw \nhim \ndescribed \nas \nanother \nnew \nstar \nof the \nMountain \nCourse. \nPutting \nina \nstun- \nning \nride \nin \nthe \nfirst \nSupersport \nrace, \nhe \nsnatched \nvictory \nat \njust \nbelow \nrecord \npace, \ntaking \nthe \nwin \nby \n3/2 \nseconds \nfrom \nJohn \nMcGuinness \n(Honda), \nwith \nanother \nsecond-year \nman, \nKeith \nAmor \n(Honda), \na \nfurther \n8 \nseconds \nbehind. \nThe \nThe \nmassed-start \nracing \non  \nthe \nBillown \nCircuit \ncreated \nclose \naction. \nHere \nChris \nPalmer \nleads \nlan  \nLougher, \nRyan \nFarquhar \nand \nMichael \nDunlop \ninto \nCastletown. \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS 189 \nsecond Supersport race, or  to  give it its full  title, Relentless \nSupersport TT  Race 2, went to  Bruce Anstey on  his gothic \nblack-liveried ‘Relentless by TAS Suzuki’. Bruce took the \nwin from from Ian  Hutchinson (Yamaha) and  Ryan Farqu- \nhar  (Kawasaki), setting a  new lap record of  125.53mph. \nThe four major Japanese manufacturers thus shared the \npodium placings across Supersport Races | and 2. \nJohn McGuinness had won the  Senior TT  for  the  pre- \nvious three years and he  made it  four in  a  row in  2008, \ntaking his  Padgett’s Honda around at  fractionally less  than \nhis  own race average record pace to  win from Cameron \nDonald and Ian  Hutchinson. It was an  action-packed race \nthat saw the lead change several times. Early front man \nBruce Anstey retired at  the  pits at  the  end of the  second \nlap and his  place as  leader was taken by Cameron Donald. \nHowever, Cam’s prospects of a  hat-trick of wins in  2008 \nwere thwarted when he  was forced to  ease the  pace after \nSS eeea  ee: i PSO \n\n190 ONWARDS AND UPWARDS \nhis Suzuki developed an  oil leak. This was said to  have been \ncaused by repeated bottoming of the crankcases at  the  foot \nof Barregarrow. The win by John McGuinness was  number \nfourteen and it put  him into joint second place with Mike \nHailwood in overall number of TT  victories. \nFirst place in  both sidecar races went to  Manxman \nNick Crowe and, although he did  not  threaten his  own lap \nrecord, he did set  a new record race average speed in Race | \nat  114.37mph. Newcomer Tim Reeve showed his class with \nthird and  fifth places. \nDown in  the  sunny south of the Island, a  good entry \ndelivered close racing over the  Billown Circuit in the  rein- \nstated 125cc Ultra Lightweight TT  and 250cc Lightweight \nTT. Chris Palmer won the  former and Ian  Lougher the  lat- \nter. They were both Honda-mounted, as  were the  major- \nity of the  entry. There were other race meetings that still \ncatered for  the  small two-strokes and there were enthu- \nsiastic owners and riders who continued to  pursue their \ndevelopment, often at  considerable expense. \nPrize money in  the  Lightweight TT  races, the  overall \nresult of which was decided by the  best points total earned \nover two legs, was £900 to  the winner of each leg and \n£1,300 to  each overall winner, giving potential winnings \nof £3,100 for  winning each race. By contrast, a  start-to- \nfinish winner of the Superbike or  Senior TT races collected \n£22,000. That was a lot to  race for, particularly as  second \nplace took a  much-reduced £12,950. Supersport winners \ncould earn £10,000 for the  Lightweight TT, as  could Side- \ncar  winners. Top riders also relied on  being paid substan- \ntial  appearance/start money at  the  TT  and for  some, that \nmoney served to  underpin their racing for the  season. \nTOO LONG \nIt was  no  secret that  manufacturers, teams and  many riders \nfelt the two-week TT was  too  long. Indeed, the involvement \nwas greater than two weeks for  some of the  teams with \nlarge transporters, for they had  to  cross to  the  Island in the \nweek preceding the event and  would not  get away until into \nthe  week after it had finished. However, controller of the \nTT  purse strings, the  Isle  of Man government, had no  wish \nto  reduce the timespan of the event, for that would see  visi- \ntors staying for shorter periods and  spending less. \nJohn \nMcGuinness \ntackles \nthe  \nflat-out \nright-hand \nbend \nat  \nthe  \nend \nof \nthe \nBishopscourt \nStraight \nin \n2009. \n\nNOT ONLY THE RACERS \nCompetitors \nare \nnot \nalone \nin \nseeking \nthe \nthrill \nof \nspeed \nover \nthe \nTT \ncourse. \nFor \nas \nlong \nas \nthe \nraces \nhave \nrun, \nTT \nfollowers \nhave \nsought \nto \nemulate \nthe \nstars \nby \nriding \nthe \ncourse \nat \nthe \ngreatest \npossible \nspeed. \nWhether \non \nbelt-driv- \nen \nsingles \nof \nyore \nor \non \nthe \nfully \nfaired \nmultis \nof \nthe \ntwenty- \nfirst \ncentury, \nfor \nover \na \nhundred \nyears \nthey \nhave \nstriven \nto \ncopy \nthe \nMountain \nCourse \ndeeds \nof \nHarry \nCollier, \nStanley \nWoods, \nGeoff \nDuke, \nMike \nHailwood, \nJoey \nDunlop \nand \nJohn \nMcGuinness. \nThey \ndo \nit \nwith \nthe \nroads \nopen, \ndicing \nwith \neach \nother \nand \nwith \neveryday \ntraffic, \nthrowing \ncau- \ntion to  the  winds as  the  speed bug bites and  the  only way \nthey know to  deal with it is to  open the  throttle wider. \nMuch of the  riding over those years has  been reckless, \naccidents have been plenty and fatalities not  infrequent, but \nthe majority survive and finish up with stories that they can \ntell  their mates for years to  come. Not surprisingly, in the \ntelling, it sometimes becomes a case of ‘the older I get the \nfaster I was’. \n2009: PUBLICITY \nThe organizers had done a  good job of bringing the  TT \ninto the twenty-first century and their advance publicity for \n2009 described it as  “The Greatest Show on  Earth’, while \nrenowned motor sport commentator Murray Walker, who \nhad links to  the  event stretching back over almost eighty \nyears, called it “The Greatest Motor-Sporting Event in the \nWorld’. Allied to such self-publicity, growing exposure was \ncatching the  imagination of the  world at  large and  bring- \ning more TT  coverage, which also helped attract quality \nsponsorship of the  event and its  riders. Self-generating in \na  way, such increased publicity saw ever more people add \nthe  TT  to  their lists of things they must see. Some would \nmake their pilgrimage as  enthusiasts for  the  sport, often \nwhile strapped for cash, while others would take the easiest \noption to  see  this high-speed festival, being happy to  pay \nwhatever it cost to be part of the TT  experience. \nMany of the  latter would be  based around the  Grand- \nstand area, where everything was  organized for them, while \nthe  former were more likely to  seek out  high-speed view- \ning points around the  course. Unfortunately, the  growth \nin  restrictions on  viewing points means that much of \ntoday’s most exciting on-course action goes unseen. \nThe picture shown here illustrates the commitment \nrequired from those who ride to  win at  the TT. John \nMcGuinness described the experience here with the words: \n‘You \n... \nget \ninto \ntop \non \nthe \nstraight, \nthen \nit \ngoes \nleft \nand \nright. \nWell \nthat \nright-hander, \nyou're \na \ncomplete \npassen- \nger \n... \nsat \non \na \nmoving \ntorpedo \nthat’s \ndoing \nits \nown \nthing \nand \nyou \njust \nhave \nto \nlet \nit \ndo \nit’. \nHe \nadded, \n‘You’re \nprob- \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS #191 \nably doing about 180, it’s  blind, you  can’t see  through it’. \nMcGuinness puts his life on  the line here perhaps fifty times \nat each TT meeting during practice and racing, but the only \npeople to  see  this  supreme display of high-speed riding are \nnearby marshals, for  spectators are  now banned from the \nspot and  even photographers, like Juan Cregeen, who took \nthis shot, are  no  longer permitted there. \nTHE ‘GREEN TT’ \nAmong claims that the “TT Festival’ had anew look for 2009, \none genuinely new event was a  Time Trials Xtreme Grand \nPrix (TTXGP) race, for  clean-emission race machines. \nThis was described as  ‘providing an  exciting opportunity \nfor  leading global innovators in  racing and clean emission \ntechnologies to  compete and  prove to  the  world that being \ngreen does not  mean being slow’, It was given the  status of \na genuine race for a Tourist Trophy, although it was to  run \nover only one  lap of the  Mountain Course. \nSeemingly there were not  too  many ‘global innovators’ \nwishing to  take up  the  challenge, and  after the  small bat- \ntery-powered field had done their lap, it  was Rob Barber \n(Agni XO10) who was  fastest at  87.43mph and  thus headed \nthe  “Best Buy Pro  Class’, while Chris Heath (Electric Mot- \norsport) was first home in  the  ‘Open Class’. Spectators \nwere divided on  the  merit of the  event, but just to  remind \neveryone that the  TT  is a business, the  Isle  of Man govern- \nment made a  business-based decision that a  place be  made \nfor the  Green TT  in future years. \nHONDA \nHonda may not  have given direct works support to  the  TT \nin  2008, but  the  name was everywhere in  2009, in  cel- \nebration of the  fiftieth anniversary of the  company’s first \ncompetitive visit in  1959. However, the most important \naspect of Honda’s presence was that it came with increased \nsupport of the racing. Under the banner of HM  Plant, John \nMcGuinness and Steve Plater were down to  contest the \nsolo classes and Nick Crowe received engine support for \nhis sidecar. \nWhile the  2009 TT  was not  quite a  Honda walkover, \nit gave the  marque much cause for  celebration, with wins \nand a  multitude of new lap and race records. The biggest \npotential threat to  Honda was seen as  TAS Suzuki-mounted \nCameron Donald, but after setting a blistering pace in early \npractice, he fell at  Keppel Gate, damaged his  shoulder and \nwas  out of the racing. There remained plenty of challengers, \nbut  Honda’s John McGuinness took victory in  the  open- \ning Superbike race, lifting the  absolute race average speed \nto  127.99mph and the  absolute lap record to  130.44mph. \nMcGuinness was in  control throughout, riding to  his  sig- \n\nIC \nONWARDS \nAND UPWARDS \nABOVE: Entries in \nTTXGP, like this \nMotoCzysz, carried a \nheavy battery load. \nLEFT: lan  Hutchinson \nwheelies over the top \nof Creg Wyllies in \n2009.

Staying with the  big bikes, Steve Plater gave \nHonda yet another chance to  celebrate with his  victory in \nthe  Senior TT. Plater set  a new absolute race record for the \ncourse of 128.27mph while John McGuinness rode to a new \nabsolute lap record for the course of 131 .57mph. Manxman \nConor Cummins (Kawasaki) was second and Gary John- \nson  (Honda) third. The speedy McGuinness was denied a \nlikely victory when his  chain snapped leaving Ramsey on \nthe  fourth lap. \nIn  Supersport Race 1, Ian  Hutchinson (Honda) took the \nwin at  record-breaking pace with Bruce Anstey (Suzuki) \nraising \nthe \nlap \nrecord \nto \n126.54mph. \nThen, \nin \nonly \nhis \nsec- \nond \nyear \nat \nthe \nTT \nand \nriding \nover \ndamp \nroads \nin \nSuper- \nsport \nRace \n2, \nMichael \nDunlop \n(Yamaha) \ntook \nthe \nfirst \nof \nJenny Tinmouth is the fastest woman rider at the TT, having lapped at  119.95mph in 2010. \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS 193 \nmany victories on  his  road to  TT  stardom. This was also \nthe  year in  which Jenny Tinmouth took over from Maria \nCostello as  the  fastest woman racer around the  Mountain \nCourse, lapping at  116.48mph. \nSidecar Race A  saw victory go  to  Dave Molyneux \n(Suzuki) after a  challenging Nick Crowe (Honda) retired \non  the  second lap. Far  worse disaster was to  befall Crowe \nand  passenger Mark Cox in Sidecar Race B, when they col- \nlided witha hare on  the approach to Ballaugh. The resultant \ncrash inflicted injuries that ended their racing careers. Such \nwas the scale of emergency support activity required at the \nscene that the  race was abandoned. \nDown at  the  Billown circuit, lan  Lougher gave Honda \nanother two TT  wins, beating the  fastest lap of 2008 on \nhis  125cc Ultra Lightweight and matching the  250cc lap \nspeed on  his  Lightweight. When veteran Lougher opened \nhis  2009 race week in  the  previous Saturday’s Superbike \nTT, it had  been his  100th TT  start. \n\n194 HM  ONWARDS AND UPWARDS \nA NEAR MISS \nRiding on  the limit on  the TT course means that, for much \nof the  time, riders are  only a  moment away from disaster. \nThe stretch from Ginger Hall to  Ramsey has  always been \nrecognized as  the  bumpiest on  the  course and, at  today’s \nspeeds, bikes are  always fighting the  rider for  control. It \nwas  there that John McGuinness had  a bigger than average \n‘moment’; in  fact, it was close to  a  disaster. He  recalled, \n‘There’s a  bit,  slightly left  and  right by the  Council Yard \n(Highways Depot) at  Glen Duff. It looks nothing ...  but \nmy  600 went lock-to-lock, big time. Smashed the  clocks, \nbent the fairing stays, I ran  over my feet and broke the brake \nlever.’ \nSuch incidents are, literally, par  for  the  course to  those \npushing the  limits of their bikes’ performance, because, as \neleven-times TT winner and  a man who always rode on  the \nedge, Phillip McCallen said, ‘You simply can’t afford to ride \nwell within your limits or  you’re going to  be left behind.’ \nSAFETY \nThe concepts of safety and riding the TT course on  the limit \ndo not  really go together, but  the  organizers put increasing \neffort into lessening the  chance of a  rider falling and also \ninto dealing with the  consequences should one  do so. \nNewcomers are  encouraged to  visit the Island as  often as \npossible before racing. There they receive official support \nand tuition about riding the  course, while being encour- \naged to  fit in as  many learning laps as  possible. Away from \nthe Island, many study videos of top riders and even play TT \ncomputer games in  an  attempt to  glean knowledge. Come \ntheir first practice lap, they are  guided around the  course \nat  speed, behind an  experienced rider. \nIn  further improvements to  safety, the  number of mar- \nshals and flag points were increased, with all  marshals \nundertaking regular training in  the  job. Radio communi- \ncations were extended with modern equipment. Medical \nsupport was  available via helicopters, medics on  the ground \nThere \nare  \ntwisty \nstretches \non  \nthe \nMountain \nCourse \nrequiring \na  \nknee-down \nstyle \nmore \noften \nseen \non  \nshort \ncircuits \nHere \nis \nDan \nStewart \non  \nthe \napproach \nto  \nGlen \nHelen \nin  \n2009. \n\n~ « BN   tae oe \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS 195 \nThis rider escaped injury when he  tested the air-fencing at  Ballacraine. \nand from travelling marshals. Such facilities were as  good \nas  they could be  made, and much money was invested in \nmodern Reticell air-fencing on  corners, which was better \nable to  absorb impacts. \nThe organizers publicly acknowledge that the  TT  races \nare  high risk, but do everything possible to manage the risk. \nMention is  made above of Newcomers watching video \nlaps to  aid  course-learning, but such is  the unrelenting \nspeed and  commitment put into a lap by someone like John \nMcGuinness that the  picture it reveals could be discourag- \ning to  someone trying to  find their way. However, for race \nfollowers who want to  gain an  impression of the speeds \ninvolved in  TT  racing, the  constant changes of direction, \nthe  multiple places where bikes are  airborne, the  relative \nnarrowness of the  road in  places, the  uphill and downhill \ngoing, the  lack of run-off, the  frequent changes from light \nto  dark and the  constant crossing over white lines while \ncranked over —  on-board videos offer an  insight into what \nis \ninvolved. \nThis \nis \nparticularly \nso \nwhen \naccompanied \nby \na \nsoundtrack, \nfor \nto \nhear \nthe \naural \nsymphony \nas \nJohn \nMcGuinness seeks to  keep his  Fireblade delivering maxi- \nmum revs, along with the  associated upward and down- \nward gear changes on  a  130-plus mph lap, makes for  an \nOo oO \nexciting 17-minute experience. \nThe swings and roundabouts of top  road racers’ fortunes \nwere shown at the  2010 TT  by the  fact that Cameron Don- \nald  was  fit again, but  Steve Plater was  injured. Otherwise, \nthe  recognized top runners were all present for what were \nthe customary five solo races and two sidecar, plus the zero- \nemissions event. The latter was now called ‘TT Zero’ and \na  £10,000 prize was  on  offer for the  first 10Omph lap by a \n‘green’ machine. The 125  and 250 Lightweight TT  races, \npreviously held at  Billown, were dropped as  TT  events. \nAfter being tried at  the  previous year’s MGP, a  60km/h \n(37mph) limit was introduced in  the  pit lane, with time \npenalties imposed for speeding. \nPre-TT publicity told that good short circuit-riders like \nDavid Johnson, Dan Hegarty, Hudson Kennaugh, Dan \n\n196 ONWARDS AND UPWARDS \nCooper and Stephen Thompson were all  hoping to  make \ntheir TT  debuts. Not all  made it to  the  event, but  it was \nindicative of the healthy interest being shown in the  ‘roads’ \nfrom those racing the  ‘shorts’, \nSPEEDS UP \nlan  Hutchinson, a  quiet-spoken thirty-year-old from Bin- \ngley, was in  the  form of his  life  at  the  2010 TT. Showing \nhis intention, his  opening lap of practice was completed at \nover 129mph. Riding Padgett-supplied Hondas, ‘Hutchie’ \ncarried his form into the races, achieving an  unprecedented \nfive victories across all  solo classes. Not only that, but  he \nbroke race average or  lap records —  sometimes both —  in \nalmost all of them. \nHe  warmed up  with a  win in  the  opening Superbike \nrace at  just below record pace, leaving Conor Cummins \n(Kawasaki) to  set  a  new lap record of  131.51mph. Mov- \ning to  the  Superstock race, Hutchie grabbed the  win with \nrecord-breaking race average and lap records of 128 .10mph \nand  130.74mph. He won Supersport TT Race 1 at a record- \nbreaking average speed, leaving Keith Amor (Honda) \nto  break the  lap record, and then repeated his  winning \nways in  the  second race, lifting the  race average speed to \n125.16mph, while Michael Dunlop (Yamaha) raised the lap \nrecord to  127.83mph. \nWith those four wins under his  belt, Hutchinson came \nto  the  line on  Senior race day with everyone asking if he \ncould achieve an  unprecedented fifth win in the week. The \nanswer was yes, along with a  new race average record of \n128.60mph and  the  fastest lap of the  race at  131.48mph, \njust 0.10mph slower than the  absolute course record speed \nset  by John McGuinness in 2009. \nThe complete dominance shown by Ian  Hutchinson in \n2010 is  revealed by the  list  of names that filled the  other \npodium places in the five  solo races: Michael Dunlop, Cam- \neron Donald, Guy Martin, Ryan Farquhar, Conor Cummins, \nKeith Amor and  Bruce Anstey. A name missing from that list \nis John McGuinness. It was  not a good year for McGuinness, \nwho failed to  finish two races and  was  restricted to  fourth, \nfifth and  seventh places in those he did  complete. \n\nAs  \nfar \nas  \nrace \nwins \nwere \nconcerned, \nit  \nseemed \nlike \nalmost \na \none-man \nshow \nby \nHutchie \nin \n2010. \nHowever, \non \nthree \nwheels, \nKlaus \nKlaffenbok \ntook \na \ndouble \nvictory \nat \njust \nunder \nrecord \npace, \nwhile \nin \nTT \nZero, \nMark \nMiller \n(MotoCzysz) \ngave \nan \nemphatic \nupward \nboost \nto \nelectric- \npowered \nspeeds, \nwinning \nat \n96.82mph, \nan \nincrease \nof \nalmost \n10mph \non \nthe \nprevious \nfastest. \nTT  \nZero \nhad \nechoes \nof \nthe  \nvery \nfirst \nTT  \nraces, \nwhen \ncompetitors \nreceived \na \nfixed \namount \nof \npetrol \nand \nhad \nto \njudge \ntheir \npace \nto \nensure \nthat \nthey \nhad \nsufficient \nto \ncomplete \nthe \nrace. \nIn \n2010 \nit \nwas \nlimited \nbattery \noutput \nthat \nmeant \nthat \nsome \nriders \nhad \nto \nrestrict \nthe \nspeed \nat \nwhich \nthey \ntravelled \non \nthe \nflattish \nsection \nof \nthe \ncourse \nto \nRamsey \nto \nensure \nthey \nhad \nthe \npower \nto \ncope \nwith \nthe \nMountain \nclimb \nand \nfinal \ndownhill \nrun \nto \nthe \nfinish. \nWith \na \nsound \nresembling \na \nvacuum \ncleaner, \nTT \nZero \nmachines \nwere \nbeginning \nto \nimpress \nwith \ntheir \nspeeds, \nbut \ntheir \nrace \nneeded \nrather \nmore \nparticipants \nthan \nthe \nnine \nstarters \nand \nfive \nfinishers \nof \n2010 \nif \nit \nwas \nto \ngrip \nthe \nimagination \nof \nthe \nthousands \nof \nwatching \npetrolheads. \nHUTCHIE \nFor  all the  bravado they show in racing over the  Mountain \nCourse at  fantastic speeds, TT  riders are  only human. Ian \nHutchinson said, when interviewed by Chris Moss after his \nfive-wins-in-a-week 2010 TT, ‘when you’re coming down \nto  the  Creg on  the  last  lap on  the \nFriday, it’s  a  relief to  see  the  sea \nand  know you're going back home \non  it’. \nHutchie was more than just a \nTT  runner, for  he  also plied his \ntrade as  a  professional motorcycle \nracer on  the  short circuits. Three \nmonths after his  TT  successes, he \nfell from his  machine at  Silver- \nstone, was struck by another rider \nand sustained compound fractures \nto  his  left  leg that were to  prove a \nmajor setback to  his racing career. \nBALLAGAREY \nKnown to  many as  ‘Ballascary’, \nthis fearsome wall-bound right \nBefore his  accident at  Ballagarey \nin 2010, Guy Martin powers his \nway down the Mountain. \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS @  197 \nhander before the  drop into Glen Vine was in  the  news in \n2010. It has always been a major test  of courage, being taken \nat  close to  maximum speed. Back in  1938, Harold Daniell \nrode it ‘full blast in top’ during his record-breaking Senior \nwin. Some twenty years later, multi-winner John Surtees \ndescribed it as  ‘one of the most difficult to  get right on  the \nTT  course’. Another thirty years on  and  Ray Knight said  it \nwas the  only spot between Union Mills and  Greeba Castle \nwhere a rider ‘should allow any slack in the  throttle wire’, \nIn  that same era, Steve Hislop reckoned to  go  through in \ntop on  a 600, but told how he hooked it back a gear on  the \nbig bike, enabling him to  hold a  tighter line. Today, John \nMcGuinness approaches it  ‘mega flat  out  in  sixth’, before \ndropping into fifth. \nThe demanding nature of Ballagarey was  shown in  2010 \nwhen, in  Supersport Race 2, which was postponed until \nThursday, the  experienced Paul Dobbs fell  there and was \nkilled. The day after Dobbs’ death, Guy Martin, a  rider \nrarely out  of the news, lost control there while challenging \nfor the  lead in the  Senior race. In the  ensuing ‘off’, which \nhe  rated a  170mph one, bike and rider disappeared in  a \nfireball and  everyone feared the  worst. But, in  the  lottery \nthat results from a high-speed fall on  the TT course, Martin \nescaped with minor injuries. He  did  receive a  whole lot of \nextra publicity, however, for  film of the  incident received \nworldwide viewing via  the  internet. \n\n198 ONWARDS AND UPWARDS \nThe vision shown by the early TT organizers in moving rac- \ning to  the  more demanding Mountain Course in  1911 was \nresponsible for  pushing motorcycle design and developing \nreliability in  the  century that followed. In  2011, manufac- \nturers were still using the same challenging circuit as  a test- \nbed to  prove their ideas, while competitors needed ever- \nincreasing skills and courage to race 200-plus bhp machines \nover its  3774 miles. \nThe centenary offered another publicity opportunity for \nthe  TT, with same-day transmissions of the racing increas- \ning worldwide and ever more documentaries being made. \nAll contributed to growth in interest and  served to  increase \nthe  number of visiting spectators. \nIt was a  year in  which several riders swapped saddles. A \nstill-injured Ian  Hutchinson signed for  a Yamaha ride with \nSMR Racing, and  Bruce Anstey moved to  Padgetts Honda. \nThe latter were also to  supply John McGuinness with a \nSupersport bike, while he  rode a  Superbike for  the  Honda \nTT Legends team, along with Keith Amor. Guy Martin \nmoved to  TAS Suzuki, while nurturing a growing career in \ntelevision, and among Newcomers was British Super Bike \nstar Simon Andrews. Regrettably, Ian  Hutchinson’s endur- \ning injuries prevented him from actually contesting the  TT \nin  2011 and  past winner Steve Plater was no  longer racing. \nBMW had burst onto the world Superbike scene a couple \nof years earlier with their 4-cylinder S1OOORR. A handful \nappeared at  the  TT  in  2010 and twelve were entered in the \n2011 Superbike race, making up  some 15  per  cent of the \nentry. With a  claimed output of 193bhp straight from the \nshowroom, no  one  doubted their straight-line speed. Keith \nAmor was timed at  189mph on  one at  Sulby in  2010 in the \nSuperstock TT, but  they were still to  show that they were \na threat over the  Mountain Course. None of the  top fifteen \nseeded riders were BM W-mounted. \nManxman \nConor \nCummins \nwas \namong \nthe \nfastest \nriders \nat  \nthe \n2010 \nTT  \nbut \nsuffered \na  \nsetback \nto  \nhis  \ncareer \nafter \na \nheavy \nfail  \nat \nthe \nVerandah \nduring \nthe \nSenior \nrace. \nHere \nhe  \nputs \non  \nthe \npower \nand \nthe \nstyle \nas  \nhe  \nleaves \nRamsey \non  \nhis \nMcAdoo Racing Kawasaki. \n\nIn  \nthat \nsame \n2011 \nSuperbike \nrace \nthere \nwere \neighteen \nHondas \nentered, \nseventeen \nKawasakis, \nfourteen \nSuzukis, \nnine \nYamahas \nand \none \neach \nof \nDucati \nand \nAprilia. \nGone \nwere \nthe \ndays \nwhen \nbig \nKawasakis \nhad \nto \nbe \nwithdrawn \nbecause \nthey \ndid \nnot \nhandle \nover \nthe \nMountain \nCourse. \nNow \nthey \nwere \nchallenging \nfor \nvictory. \nWhile \nthe  \nBMWs \nwould \nhave \nbeen \nvirtually \nnew \nbikes, \nthe  \nothers \nwould \nhave \nbeen \nof \nmixed \nages \nand \nspecifica- \ntions, \nfor \nnot \neveryone \ncould \nafford \nnew \nrace \nmachinery. \nIn \ntruth, \neven \nworks \nbikes \nwere \nunlikely \nto \nbe \nnew, \nbecause \nthose \nbuilt \nto \nrace \nthe \n‘roads’ \ndida \ncomparatively \nsmall \nrac- \ning \nmileage \neach \nyear. \nBeing \nso \nstrongly \nbuilt, \nafter \na winter \noverhaul \nand \nonce \nfitted \nwith \nthe \nlatest \nupgrades, \nthey \nwere \nready \nfor \nanother \nseason’s \ncompetition. \nTT  SUPERBIKES \nBack in the year 2000, David Jefferies set  anew absolute lap \nrecord of 125.69mph on  his Yamaha when winning the Sen- \nior TT. A decade later, and fastest lap in 2010 went to Conor \nCummins (Kawasaki) in the  Superbike race at  131.51mph, \nfractionally under John McGuinness’ absolute lap record \nof  131.58mph, set  on  a  Honda in  2009. The almost 6mph \ngrowth in  lap record speed during this decade was twice \nthat of the  previous one  and came from engines delivering \noutputs that had increased from cl70bhp in  2000 to  over \n200bhp. \nContesting the  TT  was  a fiercely competitive business, \nand while the  machines brought to  the  event might still \nbe  referred to  by the  stock reference of Fireblade, GSX- \nR1000, ZX-10 and so  on,  apart from engine, transmission \nand major frame components, very little of the original bike \nremained after preparation as  a  top  TT  race bike. Among \nitems changed would be forks, steering damper, rear shock, \nwheels, brake discs, calipers, master cylinders and  hoses, \nradiator(s), oil-cooler, handlebars and clamps, clutch, \nexhaust system, chain, sprockets, quick-shift, fuel tank, \nfairing, seat, tyres, battery and all  electrics/electronics. \nThe replacement items would be the best that money could \nbuy —  or  that the team could afford. Sometimes the best, say \nthe  suspension, came with a  hidden cost, because it could \nbe so  ‘trick’ that it needed a specialist to  get the best out  of \nit. Today’s suspension is five-way adjustable, with main ele- \nments like compression and  rebound adjustments each hav- \ning something like thirty-two settings. While most teams \nmake use  of the  support of manufacturers’ representatives \nin areas like suspension, they learned to  be wary of getting \nout \nof \ntheir \ndepth \nwith \ntoo \nmuch \nadjustability, \neven \nthough \nthey \nand \ntheir \nriders \nrecognized \nthe \nsupreme \nimportance \nof \nachieving \nhigh-speed \nstability \nover \nthe \nMountain \nCourse. \nWhere \nengines \nare  \nconcerned, \nall \ngo \nthrough \nthe  \nhands \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS #   199 \ncGuinness \nSteve \nMercer \nie \nDerek Huxley fine-tunes a Jackson Racing Honda via  his \nlaptop. \nof specialist tuners, who apply their blueprinting skills and \nbring specialized knowledge to  traditional areas like pis- \ntons, valves, springs, porting and so  on,  with the aim of lift- \ning output. Overriding the importance of those will be the \ncorrect application of the  electronics package used. This is \nanother area that can  be both hugely expensive and  difficult \nto  get the  best out  of if too  complicated. It usually needs a \nspecialist within the  team to  use  it to  full  advantage. \nBefore the  introduction of electronic control, areas like \nignition and carburation operated in  a  compromise mode. \nThe restrictive effect of that would have been more pro- \nnounced at low revolutions, for the limited settings of which \nthey were capable were generally utilized in  gaining the \nbest use  of a  racing engine’s potential at  full  power. Philip \nNeill, of TAS Suzuki, explained how the  use  of modern \nelectronics ‘allow you to  use  finer increments of change’. \nCorrectly applied, you could now achieve optimum per- \nformance throughout the  engine’s rev  range by the  precise \ntailoring of ignition and fuelling settings. Such refinement \nand control is  what everyone strives to  achieve from their \nelectronic packages. \n\n200 M  ONWARDS AND UPWARDS \nOn  this screen is overlaid performance information for two members \nof the same team, so  enabling the team manager to  spot strengths and \nweaknesses at  particular points on  the course. \nThe use  of electronics extended to  other areas, and  by \nincorporating a  GPS data-logging system, teams could see \nwhat a  bike was doing at  every point on  the  course rather \nthan relying on  riders to  remember details such as  the revs \nand gears they used at a particular corner. How much infor- \nmation was  available depended upon the number of sensors \nfitted, and it was  only accessible when the bike returned to \nthe  pits. It could take time to  interpret and the  resulting \nalterations to  set-up might have to  be varied for each rider \nin a team to  suit  their different riding styles. \nSuperbikes were still purpose-built for  the  demands of \nthe  TT  course, but they were very close to  those prepared \nfor  use  in  British Super Bike racing, perhaps sacrificing \n10bhp at  the  top end to  gain a little more performance in \nthe mid-range. With few major changes to  the  course dur- \ning the previous decade and with tyres easily able to last two \nlaps, most of the increase in lap speeds at the TT since 2000 \nhad  come from faster bikes. While developments across all \nareas of the machine would have played their part in giving \nmore speed, it was refined electronics that made the  big- \ngest contribution to  increased performance. That may not \nmean greatly increased maximum speeds, it being more the \ncase that the faster laps come from improved rideability and \nmore efficient power delivery throughout the  rev  range. \nRACING AND SPEEDS \nHaving written above about increases in \npower and  speed, the  only record bro- \nken during racing at the  2011 TT was in \nthe opening Superbike race, where win- \nner  John McGuinness (Honda) raised \nthe  race average speed to  a  new high \nof  127.87mph. McGuinness also won \nthe  Senior race at  slightly faster speed \nbut  below the  Senior’s records. Other \nHonda wins went to  Bruce Anstey in \nSupersport Race 1 and  Gary Johnson in \nRace 2, while Michael Dunlop rode a \nKawasaki to  win the  Superstock TT. \nIn  the  sidecar races, Klaus Klaffen- \nbok took Race A  and John Holden \nRace B,  while in  TT  Zero the  seven- \nteen entries saw nine starters and five \nfinishers. Michael Rutter led  the lat- \nter  home on  a  Segway MotoCzysz at \n99.60mph. Michael and  the  MotoCzysz \nwere timed at an  impressive 149.45mph \nat  Sulby, with the  fastest ‘normal’ solo \nbeing Michael Dunlop (Kawasaki) \nat  195.6mph and the fastest sidecar \n145mph. \n2012: LIGHTWEIGHT TT \nA  familiar race title returned to  use  in  2012, when the \nname Lightweight TT was  applied to a new race, for bikes of \n‘Super Twin’ specification. That really meant 650cc four- \nstroke, twin-cylinder machines based upon production \nmodels produced by Kawasaki and Suzuki, with engines \nboosted from a  standard 70bhp to  over 90, giving a  top \nspeed of 150mph. Already well established at other venues, \nparticularly on  the  Irish road circuits, it would be run  over \nthree laps and, hopefully, would add interest to  the  race \nprogramme, \nNEWS \nMost of the  familiar faces were back at  the  TT  for  2012 \nand there were also  entries from Newcomers such as  Jamie \nHamilton, Jimmie Storrar, Lee  Johnston and  Karl Harris. \nYoung Lee Johnston said, ‘the  Isle  of Man TT is the biggest \nand best road race in  the  world’, while established star of \nthe short circuits, Karl Harris, claimed he was  taking to the \nroads to broaden his racing career. \nAn  \narticle \nin  \nthe  \nTT  \nprogramme \nsurveyed \nthe  \nfitness \nlevel \nof \nriders. \nWhile \nthe  \nsuper-slim \nclaimed \nto  \nexpend \nmuch \nenergy \non  \ntraining, \nJohn \nMcGuinness \nand  \nMichael \n\n3  at i \noO \nAlltruck \na \nThe Norton team transporter in the TT  Paddock. \nDunlop explained their more substantial physiques by say- \ning ‘they were not  built for the gym’. \nAfter a  less  than successful return to  the  TT  a  couple \nof years previously, Norton were back in  2012 with 2011 \nTT  Privateer Champion, Ian  Mackman, entered on  their \nAprilia-engined machine in the  Senior race. The team cer- \ntainly looked the  part of serious contenders. \nSAME AGAIN \nAs  in  2011, the  only record broken in  2012 was by John \nMcGuinness, when riding to  victory in  the opening \nSuperbike race, where he  lifted the  race average speed to \n128.08mph. Perhaps indicating how difficult it was  getting \nto  go  faster around the  Mountain Course, McGuinness’ \nrecord represented a reduction of just 10 hard-earned sec- \nonds in the overall time it took him to complete the six-lap, \n226-mile race distance. \nThe remaining solo and sidecar races were all  run at \nbelow \nrecord \npace, \nsome \nsuffering \npostponements \ndue \nto \npoor \nweather \nconditions. \nThose \npoor \nconditions \nextended \nto \nthe \ncustomary \nSenior \nrace \nday, \nFriday, \nand \nso \nits \nscheduled \nraces \nwere \npostponed \nuntil \nSaturday. \nWith \nless \nthan \nper- \nfect \nconditions \nprevailing, \nthe \nraces \nwere \ndelayed \nthrough \nSaturday \nuntil, \neventually, \nrunners \nin \nthe \nnew \nLightweight \nrace \nwere \ndespatched \nat \n6.30pm. \nRyan \nFarquhar \ntook \nvic- \ntory \nin \nthe \nmixed \nconditions, \nlapping \nat \na \nhealthy \n115mph. \nhalfords| Yoraz= annua Obrembo Gah @oumor \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS @®  201 \nThen, in an  unwanted first for the Tourist Trophy meeting, \nthe  decision was taken to  abandon the  Senior race without \na wheel being turned. Officials had  made inspection laps in \ncars accompanied by top  riders and the  joint opinion was \nthat the  220bhp bikes would be impossible to  race on  slick \ntyres over the  mixed wet and  dry conditions of the  Moun- \ntain Course. No  other tyre was available to  suit  the  mixed \nconditions. \nThe abandonment of the  Senior TT  was a disaster for all \nconcerned. The organizers had taken a stance against racing \nin totally wet conditions some years previously. Since then \nthe  manufacturers had  continued to  increase the  power of \nthe machines from which the racers were derived, and tyre \nmanufacturers developed ever more specialized tyres for \nuse  in the  dry. The Mountain Course was renowned for its \nmixed conditions, but  machine and tyre development for \nthe  Superbike and Senior races had reached a  stage where \nthey could not  cope with them. \nThere seemed to  be  no  way out  of the  dilemma and, \ngiven the  changeable Manx weather, most recognized that \nthe  same situation will almost certainly happen again. Had \nsidecars been faced with the same scenario, they also would \nnot  have been able to  run  due  to  lack of suitable tyres. That \nmeant with Superbike, Senior and both Sidecar races unable \nto run  in mixed wet  and dry track conditions, 50 per cent of \nthe  race programme was at  risk. Riders’ views clearly had \n\n202 HM  ONWARDS AND UPWARDS \nto  be  respected on  the  issue of what the  Superbikes could \nand  could not  do, but  spectators were aware that 1000cc \nSuperstock bikes, from which the  Senior/Superbikes were \nderived, were lapping at only Imph less on  road-legal tyres. \nPrior to the gloom cast by the abandonment of the Senior, \nthe  ten  starters in  the  2012 TT  Zero had  hummed around \nfor their one-lap race. For the  first time, John McGuinness \nhad a ride in  the  class on  a  costly Mugen Shinden. How- \never, Michael Rutter headed the  four survivors home for \nthe second year, with McGuinness in second place. Proving \nthat this was the  class where speeds were increasing, Rut- \nter  broke the  100mph barrier, earning the £10,000 bonus, \nand added 4 per cent to his previous best lap time, finishing \nwith a  speed of 104.06mph. \n2013: THE COURSE \nThere were no  major changes to  the  course for 2013, apart \nfrom it being subject to  the  usual cycle of repairs, where \nJohn \nMcGuinness \n(Honda, \nno.  \n3), \nCameron \nDonald \n(Honda, \nsome stretches were relaid with super-smooth black- \ntop, whilst others were surface-dressed with chippings. \nThe former reduced rolling resistance and sped bikes on \ntheir way, while the  latter increased it and slowed them. \nIt  is  doubtful if the  effects could be  measured, although \nthe  smooth stretches, particularly if incorporating bends, \nprobably gave riders increased confidence. \nThere were two new course-related items for spectators \nto  get used to,  and  they were the  application of names to \ntwo previously untitled bends. The right-hand sweep at the \nend  of the  Cronk y Voddy straight became Molyneux’s, in \nhonour of sixteen-times sidecar winner Dave Molyneux, \nwhile the  left- and right-handers after the  Twelfth Mile- \nstone, soon after Handley’s, became McGuinness’s, named \nafter nineteen-times solo  winner John McGuinness. \nA few  years before, McGuinness had revealed that those \nbends and  the  following straight were among his  favourite \nspots on  the course.

In the \nsecond year of the  Lightweight TT  for  650 twins, David \nJohnson was  entered on  a  Chinese-made WK650i, while \nSplitlath Redmond racing had the  Chinese rider Cheung \nWai On  entered to  ride their Kawasaki. Regrettably, com- \nplications with Ian  Hutchinson’s injuries from Silverstone \nin  2010 still prevented him riding the  2O1seinle \nDUNLOP’S YEAR \nThe Dunlop name had a  proud TT  heritage and in  2013 it \nwas \nyoung \nMichael \nDunlop \nwho \nkept \nthe \nname \nat \nthe \nfore- \nfront of the  event, riding a  Honda to  victory and records \nin \nfour \nraces. \nWinning \nthe \nSuperbike, \nSuperstock \nand \nboth \nSupersport \nraces, \nhe \narrived \nat \nthe \nlast \nday \nof \nracing \nwith \nentries in  the  Lightweight and Senior TT.

Bruce Anstey (Honda) was  third and \nset the fastest lap of the race at  131.53mph, just fractionally \nunder the  absolute course lap record of 131.67mph, set  by \nJohn McGuinness on  his  Superbike in the  opening race of \nthe  week. \nJames Hillier took his first TT win in the new  Lightweight \nrace, while Michael Rutter (MotoCzysz) took another win \nin  TT  Zero, with John McGuinness (Mugen) less  than 2 \nseconds behind. Rutter again raised the lap record by 5 per \ncent, leaving it at  109.68mph. There were eight finishers \nfrom ten  starters, but  the  lap times of the  last two were \nsome 35mph slower than the  winner. \nThe race average record for  the  sidecars had remained \nunbroken since 2009 and  their lap record since 2007. The \nrace regulations limited what changes could be  made to \ntheir 600cc engines, and in 2013 the winning speeds of  Tim \nReeves and Ben Birchall were below record pace. \nSPEEDS \nLap speeds of the  1000cc Superbikes grew from 125.69mph \nto  131.67mph between 2000 and 2013, representing an \nincrease of 4.75 per cent in a period when output increased \nby just over 10  per  cent, to  approximately 220bhp. The \nspeeds for  600cc Supersports went from 121.15mph to \n128.68mph, an  increase of 6.22 per  cent, with their out- \nputs increasing to  140bhp. \nWhen looking for the fastest lap in a TT race, it is worth \nremembering that only the final one  is a true flying lap. All \nthe  others are  either standing start laps, like  the  first one \nand those after pit stops, or  slowing down for  refuelling \nlaps. While the flying lap should offer the best opportunity \nof the  fastest lap, for  by then riders are  well accustomed \nto  course conditions and  have a light fuel  load, it does not \nalways happen. This is particularly so  if a  rider has  estab- \nlished a good lead, for he can  then ride his last lap at a con- \ntrolled pace, checking the time gap to his nearest Opponent \nby way of his  signalling boards. Many fastest laps are  set \nearly in a race, when riders are  trying to establish a position \nat the  front. \nFUEL CONSUMPTION \nCompetitors \nusually \ntry \nto \ngain \nan  \nidea \nof \nfuel \nconsumption \nduring \npractice, \nbut  \nmany \nfind \nthat \nit \nincreases \nwhen \nthey \nuse  \nthe  \nthrottle \nharder \nunder \nrace \nconditions. \nIndeed, \nthe \nnumber \nof top \nriders \nwho \nhave \nrun \nout \nof fuel \nand \nlost \na \nTT \nwin \nis legion. \nDuring \nthe  \nfirst \ntwo \nyears \nrunning \nof \nthe  \nevent \n(1907 \nand  \n1908) \nriders \nreceived \na \nfixed \nallocation \nof \nfuel \nand \ntheir \nconsumption \nfigures \nwere \npublished. \nChapter \n1 \ntold \nhow \nwinner \nof \nthe \nSingles \nrace \nin \n1907, \nCharlie \nCollier, \nused \nfuel \nat the \nrate \nof \n94.5mpg \nand \nwinner \nof \nthe \nrace \nfor \nMul- \ntis, \nRem \nFowler, \naveraged \n87mpg. \nBy the mid-1930s, British single-cylinder machines refu- \nelled just once in their seven-lap, and  264-mile races, using \nfuel at about 30—35mpg. Post-war multis were much thirst- \nier,  as  were the two-strokes that followed. \nToday, the race regulations restrict fuel-tank capacity to \n24 litres, which equates to  5% gallons. This is, usually, just \nenough to  complete two laps of racing before refuelling is \nrequired and gives a  fuel consumption figure of approxi- \nmately 1S5mpg. \nTT  GETS TOUGHER \nThe moment riders unleash the 220bhp of  a  Superbike \naround the  TT  course they are  taking their lives in  their \nhands. All know that they need every ounce of control and \nso  recognize the need to  show respect to other riders while \nriding in  close company and when passing. But the  often \nsmall time differentials between first and second place, the \nincreased presence of short-circuit specialists, the riches to \nbe  won and  just  the  overall pressure to  win, saw  tougher \ntactics coming into use on  the course. \nThe organizers were selective in  accepting entries and \nqualifying standards were based upon a  percentage allow- \nance over the average speed set  by the fastest three riders in \na class. However, there were big speed differences between \ntop riders and those lower down the order, and the fast men \nwere increasingly bullying their way past. It was a  cause \nfor  regret for  older riders like  John McGuinness, but  the \nnewer stars took it for granted. Such tactics would certainly \ncreate worrying moments for  those being passed, and it \ntakes a degree of bravery to  race with the  really fast riders. \nRising star Ivan Lintin remarked, ‘the likes of Anstey and \nMcGuinness will not  give you any slack if you  are  paddling \naround —  they will scare the living daylights out  of you’. For \nhis part, Bruce Anstey commented, ‘catching a slower rider \ncan  cost you  between 2 and  4 seconds’, \nSET-UP \nElectronic control packages now dealt with the  set-up of \nengine performance, while another important area that rid- \ners  spent much of practice getting right was suspension, \nfront and rear. With components that allowed ever more \nadjustments, most teams relied on  the support of specialists \nfrom \nfirms \nlike \nOhlin \nand \nK-Tec \nto \nhelp \nget \ntheir \nsettings \nright. \n\nONWARDS AND UPWARDS 205 \nThe \nexperienced \nDavid \nParedes \n(62) \nabout \nto  \nbe  \npassed \nat  \nthe \n‘K-Tree’ \nby \nhard-chargers \nJohn \nMcGuinness, \nMichael \nDunlop \nand \nCameron \nDonald \nin \nthe \n2013 \nSuperbike \nTT. \n\n206 ONWARDS AND UPWARDS \nWatching riders on  a  fast  corner reveals those who have \ntheir suspension set  up  correctly, for  they go  round rock \nsteady, while those without the correct adjustment are \nnoticeably less  stable. Something else to  be observed is that \nsome riders who are  steady on  the  first lap will then lose \nthat stability later in  the  race, as  their suspension ‘over- \nheats’ and loses performance. Those who pay  the  most for \ntheir suspension hope to  avoid that failing. \nSpecialist support extends to  other areas, for with every \ncompetitor wanting the bike tuned to  suit their own riding \nstyle, areas like  braking also benefit from the  attention of \nAt  \nover \n150mph \nthrough \nthe \nbottom \nof \nBarregarrow, \nsuspension \nis \ngiven \nits  \nultimate \ntest. \nAn  \nairborne \nConor \nexperts.

There are  firms involved in  developing brake \ncalipers, pads, hoses and  levers, who are  capable of tuning \neach element to  suit  individual riders’ styles. \nPerhaps the  biggest news on  the run-up to  the 2014 TT \nwas that Michael Dunlop switched from riding Hondas to \nBMW S1000RR models in  the  Superbike, Superstock and \nSenior TTs. He  remained on  Hondas for  the Supersport \nCummins \nshows \n(above) \nhis  \nsuspension \nat  \nmaximum \nextension. \nA \nfew \nyards \nlater \nand \n(next \npage) \nit \nis \non  \nmaximum \ncompression, \nwith \nthe \nbelly-pan \nabout \nto  \nscrape \nthe \nroad. \n\nraces. Ready to  challenge the  established names were ris- \ning TT  stars James Hillier, Dean Harrison and Ivan Lin- \ntin,  with hot-shot from the  short circuits, Peter Hickman, \nabout to make his TT debut on  a BMW. Taking things very \nseriously, Hickman completed seventy learning laps of the \ncourse in a  car  on  visits to  the  Island between January and \nApril, plus many viewings of onboard video laps. \nChanging his  big bikes made no  difference to  Michael \nDunlop’s winning ways and 2014 saw  him take another four \nwins \nin \nthe \nweek \n— \nSuperbike, \nSuperstock, \nSupersport \nRace \n2 \nand \nSenior \nTT. \nStill \nonly \ntwenty-six \nyears \nof \nage, \nDunlop \nhad \nstarted \nhis \nTT \nwinning \nways \non \n600s \nand \nwas \nnow \nundoubted \nmaster \nof \nthe \n1000s. \nNudging \nrecord \nspeeds \nin \nall \nraces, \nhe \nbroke \nthe \nSenior \nTT \nlap \nrecord, \nraising \nit \nto \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS 207 \n131.66mph. That was a little below the  latest absolute lap \nrecord, set  earlier in  the  week in  the  Superbike race by \nBruce Anstey, who became the  fastest around the  course \nat  132.29mph. \nPeter Hickman set  the  fastest lap ever by  a Newcomer \nwhen he recorded 129.10mph on  his way to  eleventh place \nin the  Senior, where nearly men Conor Cummins (Honda) \nfinished second and  Guy Martin (Suzuki) was  third. It was \na reversal of their finishing positions in the  Superbike race. \nMichael Dunlop’s BMW wins were well publicized by \nthe  German factory, and  they made much of the  ‘fact’ that \nit  was the first BMW win since Georg Meier’s in  1939, \nwhich, conveniently, made it  a  seventy-fifth anniversary \nevent. While it was  certainly their first Senior TT win  since \n\n208 ONWARDS AND UPWARDS \n1939, for some reason they chose to  ignore Helmut Dahne \nand  Hans-Otto Butenuth’s Production TT  win of 1976 and \nDave Morris’s three BMW wins in  the  Singles TT  in  the \nperiod 1997-9. \nDunlop’s performance had shown what a BMW could \ndo  at  the  TT, bringing the  marque from the  lower leader \nboard placings, achieved by others on  the  S1OOORR in  the \nprevious few years, to  the top step of the podium. The only \n‘petrol’ solo races not  won by him in  2014 were the  Super- \nsport Race 1, which went to  Gary Johnson on a Triumph by \na winning margin of just over a second from Bruce Anstey \n(Honda); and  the  Lightweight TT, where Dean Harrison \n(Kawasaki) took his first TT win. In one  of those occasions \nloved by TT  ‘anoraks’, the  Sidecar A  victory by Conrad \nHarrison (Honda) earlier in  the  week meant that he  and \nDean were the  first father and  son  to  win in the  same year. \nDave Molyneux took Sidecar B and gave Kawasaki power \nits  first win in the  class. \nJohn McGuinness came to  the  TT  with a  wrist injury \nthat restricted him from riding with his customary vigour. \nHowever, he  did  achieve a  win in  TT  Zero on  his  Mugen \nShinden, lifting the lap  record by an  impressive 8mph \nto  117.36 and heading home the  six  finishers from nine \nstarters. \nADVERTISING \nA TT win  always generated publicity from suppliers of com- \nponents used on  winning machines, usually the providers of \ntyres, brakes, chains and  oil.

There are  many \nwho consider that the  straightening of bends over a period \nof  100 years must have reduced the  distance around the \nMountain Course and  it is a  topic that  has  been subject to \nmuch debate. \nFrom 1911 to  1914 the lap length was  given as  37’ miles. \nThe distance of 37% miles was  first used in  1920, when the \ncourse was extended from Cronk ny Mona to  include Sign- \npost Corner, Governor’s Bridge and Glencrutchery Road. \nThe organizers’ ‘General Conditions for  the  International \n1920 Auto-Cycle Tourist Trophy Races’ described it as  37 \nmiles and  6 furlongs, which equals 37% miles, a figure that \nseemed generally accepted. \nPerhaps not  everyone did  accept it,  though, for  in  its \nissue of 12 April 1923, The Motor Cycle said, “The TT Course \nis to  be  measured accurately: to  do  this it will be  neces- \nsary to  employ a revolution counter attached to  the  sidecar \nwheel of an  outfit driven slowly.’ The figure that resulted \nwas 37  miles and 1,299 yards. As  %  mile is  1,320 yards, \nthey obviously thought the  course was 21  yards short of a \nfull 3734 miles. But  did  the  sidecar take a  central line or  a \nracing line, and is a three-wheeler’s racing line  the  same as \na two-wheeler’s? \nFrom 1923 the organizers used a figure of 37 miles 1,300 \nyards and  a speed/distance table was published based upon \nthis, quoting an  equivalent lap distance of  37.739 miles. \nAfter another official measure in  1937 it was  declared to be \n37  miles 1,291 yards, or  37.733 miles; the  ACU used the \nfigure of 37  miles 1,29074 yards to  calculate lap times in \nthe pre-war period, which they said was 37.733 miles. The \nrace regulations for  1937 settled for  37 miles 1,290 yards. \nPresumably \nthere \nwas  \nmore \nagitation \nover \nlap \ndistance \nin \nthe \nearly \n1950s, \nfor \nassisted \nby \nTT \nwinner \nFergus \nAnder- \nson, \nThe \nMotor \nCycle \nmeasured \nit \nin \n1954 \nusing \na \nSmith’s \nInstruments \nwheel-revolution \ncounter \nand \ncame \nup \nwith \na \nfigure \nof \n37.449 \nmiles, \nwhich \nequates \nto \n37 \nmiles \nand \n790 \nyards. \nSo \nwas \nit \nreally \nsome \n500 \nyards \nshorter \nthan \nin \npre-war days? \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS @  209 \nIt was  the turn of Motorcycle News to have a measure before \nthe 1978 TT. The method used was not  declared, but  its \nresult of 37.195 miles (37 miles 343  yards) was. It seemed \nperfectly happy with its  figure, which showed that getting \non  for  1,000 yards had disappeared since 1920, although \nthe race organizers seemed equally content to continue cal- \nculating lap times based on  37.733 miles, as  it had  done for \nmany years. \nThe next record of the  course being measured comes \nfrom the  centenary year of 2007, when Alex Coward, a \nveteran cyclist and official course measurer for Manx cycle \ntrials, was  asked to ride a lap and establish a figure. The line \nhe  took was generally 1 yard out  from the  left-hand kerb, \nwith just the  occasional cutting of a  corner. After several \nhours of pedalling, Alex came up with a distance of 37.7224 \nmiles, which is just 17’ yards (52.8ft was  the actual figure \nquoted) short of the  official 37.73 miles given in  the  cur- \nrent regulations for the race, although it is now shown in its \nmetric equivalent, 60.70km. \nThe power put down by modern bikes sees them wheel- \nspinning under full  throttle even in the  dry, and  they also \nspend more time than in  the  past with their wheels off \nthe  ground over bumps. So  might those factors affect any \nconventional on-board recorded lap  distances? Further- \nmore, do all riders cover the  same distance, for the  ‘racing \nline’ of tyre marks on  bends can  be 6 to  8 feet wide, which \nbegs the question, do the fastest riders take the tightest line \n(and thus the  shortest lap distance) or  does their greater \nspeed through corners mean they take the  widest? So  the \nquestions go on.  Perhaps after a century of use  and  in this \nage  of on-bike GPS and  data-logging, it should be possible \nto  get a  precise figure of distance covered. But  what if the \ncourse is  shorter than is  officially stated, will TT  fans be \nhappy if current lap speeds are  ‘corrected’ to  sub-130mph \nfigures? \n2015: SPEEDS \nIn 2015 top riders were reaching 196mph on  Sulby Straight. \nThey had been nudging that figure for  several years and \npeople were beginning to  think that 200mph was  possible, \na  speed already reached on a longer straight at  the  North \nWest 200. Also, Bruce Anstey’s outright lap record speed \nof 132.29mph was  completed in  17 minutes 6.6 seconds, so \nthere was  talk of a rider getting into the  ‘sixteens’. Former \nTT  winner Nick Jefferies, thinking back to  his early days, \nsaid in  2015, ‘the  speed increases of the  bikes —  it’s mind- \nblowing’. \nOver the  winter of 2014—15, works of resurfacing and \nreprofiling were carried out  on  the  bends at  Keppel Gate \nand  the  results were expected to  benefit the  racers. \n\nBallaugh. \nINTHE NEWS AGAIN \nHaving ridden to  four wins in 2013 on  Hondas and  another \nfour wins in 2014 on  a mix of  BMWs and  Hondas, the ever- \nrestless Michael Dunlop came to  the  2015 event on  Mil- \nwaukee Yamahas. However, early in  practice he  decided \nthat the new Yamahas were not  for him, so  he put out a call \nto  his  2014 BMW winning team for help and they obliged \nwith bikes for the three big races, while he located Hondas \nfor the  Supersport races. It was  a headline-grabbing move, \nfor  no  one could remember a top rider taking such action \nduring practice. \nMichael Dunlop’s brother William seemed happy on \nhis Yamahas, hitting over 170mph on  Sulby Straight on  his \n600cc R6. However, he then crashed at Laurel Bank during \npractice and damaged his  ribs, putting himself out of the \nracing. Michael stopped at  the  incident and helped carry \nWide of the  ‘racing line’ and out on  the loose stuff, this rider throws up  chippings with his  rear wheel as  he  exits \nthe  stretcher taking William to  the  rescue helicopter. If \nthat was not  newsworthy enough, Michael then tangled \nwith another rider at  the  Nook on  the  last lap of the  open- \ning Superbike race, fell  from his machine and  was injured. \nAlthough he  played down the  seriousness of his  injury, it \naffected his  performances in  the  remaining races. Despite \nthat, in a  courageous ride, he set  his  fastest ever lap of the \ncourse in  the  Senior at  132.5lmph, but  his  injuries meant \nthat he could not  maintain the  pace and  he finished in fifth \nposition. \nCOMPROMISES \nLong-established motorcycle dealers Padgetts supplied \nHondas to  two top  runners in  2015 —  John McGuinness \nand  Bruce Anstey. However, unlike many teams, they did \nnot  believe in using on-bike data-logging, relying instead on \n\nfeedback \nfrom \ntheir \nriders. \nThe \ncompany \nwas \nvastly \nexpe- \nrienced \nat \nthe  \nTT  \nand  \nknew \nthe  \nimportance \nof \ngetting \nthe \nchassis \nand  \nsuspension \nright \nwhile \nbuilding \na \nstrong \nmotor- \ncycle \nto \ncope \nwith \nthe \nrigours \nof \nthe \nMountain \nCourse. \nBut \nClive \nPadgett \nexplained, \n‘everything’s \na \ncompromise \non \nbike \nset-up \n— \nbrakes, \nchassis, \nsuspension, \ngearing \n— \nyou \nhave \nto \nwork \nout \nwhere \nthe \nbiggest \ngain \nmight \nbe \nin \nyour \ncompromises’. \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS 21 \nIt was a time when road machines were being fitted with \never  more electronics offering riders multi-modes to control \nthe  performance of engine, suspension and  other features. \nAlong with claiming 197bhp at  13,000rpm, Kawasaki’s \nadvertisement for  its  latest road-going ZX-10R mentioned \nthree riding modes, five levels of traction control, ABS, \nquickshifter, wheelie control and launch control. By con- \ntrast, the  TT  regulations did  not  permit ‘traction control, \ncoher \nCummins \n(Honda) \nstares \ninto \nthe \nsetting \nsun \nas  \nhe \ntops \nCrosby \nHill \nduring \nevening \npractice \nin \n2015. \n\njay ONWARDS AND UPWARDS \nlaunch control, anti-wheelie, closed-loop engine braking, \ncorner-by-corner/distance-based adjustments, competitor \nadjusted trims’. A mode switch covering fuel and ignition \nsettings was allowed, plus on-board data-logging, but  no \nassociated bike-to-pits telemetry was  permitted. \nSPEEDS OF  130MPH-PLUS \nFrom being an  elusive barrier, 130mph lap speeds had  now \nbecome almost the  norm for  top runners in  the  Superbike \nand Senior races, with Superstocks not far  behind. For \nmany ordinary motorcyclists, even briefly reaching a speed \nof  130mph would be  special, but  the  very best TT  riders \nnow expect to  average that figure for the  entire 226 miles \nof a six-lap race. They may not  always look it, but in motor- \nThe \nnumber \n| \nrider \nand \nmachine \nin \nthe  \n2015 \nSenior \nTT, \nJohn \nMcGuinness \nleans \ninto \nBallacraine \nit \nhis  \nHonda \nFireblade. \ncycling terms those riders really are  supermen and speed is \nwhat they live  by. \nTime was lost during practice week in  2015 due to \nadverse weather, but in  improved conditions, Bruce \nAnstey opened race week with a  win, taking his  Honda \nCBR1O0ORR Superbike to  victory at  exactly the  same race \naverage speed —  128.75mph —  as  Michael Dunlop achieved \nduring his winning ride in  2013. Anstey also set  the  fastest \nlap at  131.78mph, which was just under his  own record of \n132.29mph from 2014. The middle of  the week belonged to \na back-to-form Ian  Hutchinson, who took three victories — \nSuperstock and  Supersport Races | and 2. His  wins were at \nslightly under record pace, using a Kawasaki in  Superstock \nand Yamaha in  Supersport. Ivan Lintin broke race and lap \n\nrecords \non  \nhis  \nKawasaki \nin  \nwinning \nthe  \nLightweight \nrace, \nwith \nspeeds \nof \n119.93mph \nand \n120.84mph. \nA \nfew \nriders \nwere \nbeing \npenalized \nfor \nexceeding \nthe \nspeed \nlimit \nin \nthe \npit \nlane, \nand \nRyan \nFarquhar \nlost \nany \nchance \nof \nvictory \nin \nthe \nLightweight \nrace \nwhen \nhe \nwas \nhit \nwith \na \n30-second \npenalty \nfor \nspeeding. \nThe \nBirchall \nbrothers \nrode \nto  \nvictory \nin  \nSidecar \nRaces \nA \nand \nB, \nsetting \na  \nnew \nrace \naverage \nrecord \nof \n116.26mph, \nwhile \nDave \nMolyneux \nset \nthe \nfastest \nlap \nin \nboth \nraces, \nfin- \nishing \nwith \na \nnew \nrecord \nspeed \nof \n116.785mph \nin \nRace \nB, \njust \n7 seconds \nbehind \nthe \nwinners. \nJohn McGuinness did  not  have the  best of TTs in  2015, \nalthough he  did  win TT  Zero, raising the  lap record to \n119.27mph, to  head home six  finishers from nine starters. \nHis Mugen Shinden team mate Bruce Anstey finished in \nsecond place. Now forty-three years of age, family man \nMcGuinness admitted to  nervousness each time he took to \nthe  Mountain Course, and when he  lined up  for  the  Sen- \nior  race in  his  customary number 1 position, he  was very \naware of the  strength of challenge from the  younger riders \nbehind him. \nJust \npart \nof \nthe \nstock \nof \nMetzeler \ntyres \nbrought \nto  \nthe \n2016 \nTT  \n-  \namong \nthem \nare  \nslicks, \ntreaded \nand \nwets. \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS 213 \nUnfortunately, \nthe  \nSenior \nrace \nwas \nred-flagged \non  \nthe \nsecond \nlap \nafter \nan accident \nto \nJamie \nHamilton \non \nthe \ndrop \nto the \nEleventh \nMilestone. \nIt \nwas \na \nspot \nwhere \nthirty \nyears \nago \nthe \nfront \nwent \na \nlittle \nlight \non \na \ndownhill \nhump, \nbut \nin \n2015, \non \nvery \nmuch \nmore \npowerful \nbikes, \nriders \nfound \ntheir \nfront \nwheels \nreaching \nfor \nthe \nair \nand \nhad \nto \nwork \nfor \ncontrol. \nThe Senior race was shortened to  four laps and re- \nstarted. John McGuinness again gave his  clutch the  ulti- \nmate test, with searing acceleration off  the  line. At  the \nend of  the  first lap  he  led  Ian  Hutchinson by  just 1 \nsecond, but when he  pitted for  his  fuel stop at  the  end \nof the  second lap, he  was 11  seconds up,  for  Hutchie lost \ntime by overshooting Signpost Corner. With his usual slick \npit stop, McGuinness went out  to  build on  his  lead, com- \ning home victorious at  a  new record race average speed of \n130.48mph and a  new absolute lap record of  132.70mph. \nSecond place went to  James Hillier (Kawasaki) some 14 \nseconds behind, with Ian  Hutchinson third, a further 6 sec- \nonds in arrears. On  the  second lap, eleven riders lapped at \nover 130mph. \n\n214 M  ONWARDS AND UPWARDS \nIt was an  emotional John McGuinness who embraced his \nfamily after the  Senior race. Drained after a  fortnight of \nhigh-speed riding around the  Mountain Course and  all the \nassociated demands made on  his  time as  a  top  TT  rider, \nhe  knew that his  status had  been under challenge. But  he \nhad  dug deep to  achieve his  victory and  had  equalled Mike \nHailwood’s record of seven Senior TT  wins. McGuinness \nknew his Honda was  not  the  fastest bike on  the  track for it \nwas an  ageing model, but  he gained huge satisfaction from \nhis 2015 Senior TT win at record speeds, rating it as  one  of \nhis finest victories. \nSo  ended a  weather-hit TT  meeting that was attended \nby 42,000 visitors over the  two-week period, an  increase \nover previous years. More visitors was what the  Island was \nseeking to achieve, for it meant more money into the Manx \ncoffers, but TT enthusiasts noted a change in visitor profile, \nwith some of the  newer ones seeming to  be  there for  the \noccasion rather than the  racing. \n2016: NEWS \nAmidst the  hustle and bustle of preparations for  the  TT \nchallenge came a reminder that racing motorcycles could be \na cruel sport. Two young men who had shown their talents \nwith wins at  the  2015 MGP, Billy Redmayne and Malachi \nMitchell-Thomas, had entries for  the  2016 TT, but  both \nwere killed in pre-TT race meetings —  Redmayne at  Scar- \nborough and  Mitchell-Thomas at the  North West 200. \nAs  ever, racing went on. There were minor changes \nto  the Supersport regulations to  bring them in  line with \nJohn \nMcGuinness \npublicizes \nhis  \nEMC? \n‘cloud \ncomputing’ \nsponsorship \nas  \nhe \npasses \nthe \nHalfway \nHouse \non \nhis Superstock \nHonda \nin \n2016. \nevents \nat \nWorld \nlevel, \nwhile \nsidecar \nregulations \nwere \neased \nin \nrespect \nof \nchassis \nand \nstreamlining, \nwith \nthe \naim \nof \npro- \nmoting \ndevelopment. \nThe \nsecond \nsidecar \nrace \nwas \nmoved \nfrom \nWednesday \nto \nFriday \nof \nrace \nweek \nand \nthe \nLight- \nweight \nrace \ntook \nthe \nWednesday \nslot. \nThe \nIsle \nof \nMan \ngov- \nernment \nwas \nlooking \nfor \nan \nexternal \npromoter \nto \ntake \nover \nthe \norganizing \nof \nthe \nTT \nand \nto \ngrow \nthe \nevent, \nso \nbringing \nmore \nmoney \ninto \nthe \nManx \nExchequer. \nThere was the  usual publicity about tyres, with several \nmakers telling how they had  spent the  winter testing their \nlatest ideas and Avon claiming to  have been working on \n‘development of prototype rubber, with different carcass \nconstruction and compound mixes’. Everyone knew the \nimportance of tyres at  the  TT, although they were maybe \nnot  quite so  critical as  in  Moto GP, where tyres were the \ndominant factor affecting bike design. At  the  TT, riders \nnow ran  120  front and 200 rear, a  far cry  from the  cycle- \nsized tyres of the  first event. \nSpectators were always keen to  see  and  hear something \ndifferent in TT machinery and much interest was  generated \nby the news that Padgetts were providing Bruce Anstey with \na  Honda RCV123, which was a  limited edition road-going \nversion of the  V4  Moto GP  bike. In  addition, veteran Jan \nLougher was to  run a  576cc Suter MMX500 two-stroke. \nMost acknowledged that the  Suter was a new machine and \nso  expectations were not too high, but there was  keen antic- \nipation of what the  Honda would deliver. Along with the \ndistinctive sounds of those two  bikes, Norton were back for \nanother year with their Aprilia-powered machine, ridden \nby David Johnson. The  Norton’s unique \nexhaust note made it sound fast and 2016 \nwas to  prove that it was, with 130mph \nlaps. \nOn  the  rider front, Guy Martin was \nabsent, taking a  year out, while Ian \nHutchinson was to  ride a Tyco BMW in \nthe big classes and a Team Traction Con- \ntrol Yamaha R6  in  Supersport. It was a \nmachine choice mirrored by  Michael \nDunlop, but with different teams. \nManxman Dan Kneen was looking to \nmake a  step up from his  regular top-six \nplacings, having earned a  ride on  top- \nspecification Mar-Train Yamahas. How- \never, a fall  from a mountain bike on  the \nrun-up to  the  TT  landed him with arm \ninjuries and  unable to  ride. \nJohn McGuinness was again on  Hon- \ndas. He  was supported by several differ- \nent  sponsors and wore different leathers \n\nONWARDS \nAND \nUPWARDS \n215 \n| \nABOVE: There was no  doubting the seriousness of Honda’s support for  the 2016 TT. Count the number of ‘used’ engines \non  the shelf, part-way through practice week. On  the floor were a  similar number of new engines, waiting to  be  issued. \nBELOW: lan  Hutchinson holds a tight line on  his  600cc Yamaha as  he  enters the ultra-fast Quarry Bends. \n\n216 M  ONWARDS AND UPWARDS \nto  reflect this. McGuinness knew that in the big classes his \nFireblade was  slower than the opposition, but he still  felt  it \nto  be a  well-balanced bike for the  Mountain Course. \nREADY AND WAITING \nIn  contrast to  the  poor weather often experienced during \npractice, the sun  shone throughout 2016’s week of prepara- \ntion. Getting underway on  Saturday evening, riders were \nimmediately on  the  pace and a few  of the  fastest put in six \nlaps in  their first practice session. By mid-week, stars like \nJohn McGuinness and Ian Hutchinson were saying that their \nbike set-ups were complete and they were ready to  race. \nBy the  end of practice all  competitors had  ridden more \nlaps than usual, and the high speeds achieved created \nexpectations of a  record-breaking TT  meeting. Arguably \nthe most experienced of the top-level riders, John McGuin- \nness, still rode a total of thirty-one practice laps, which was \nmore than any  other rider. Going on  to  ride twenty-five \nrace laps, all together he put in 2,114 ultra high-speed miles \nat the  2016 TT. \nSidecars were usually sent out  after solos and  often did \nnot  get the best practice conditions, but they enjoyed those \nof 2016, although two passengers were unfortunate to  fall \nfrom their very basic sidecar platforms and were injured. \nPast winner Conrad Harrison failed to find a passenger who \ncould stand the  pace, so  withdrew from the races. \nWhen interviewed, John McGuinness was  complimen- \ntary about the course, remarking on  the eradication of \nbumps at Tower Bends and  new surfacing on  some of the \nMountain Road. However, he was critical of the  condition \nof the  Sulby Straight, saying it was  ‘beginning to  feel  like a \nMoto-Cross course’. Sadly, later that day, the  experienced \nPaul Shoesmith lost control of his  BMW at  speed on  the \nSulby Straight and was  killed. The Mountain Course was  still \nso  very demanding; later in the week it also claimed the lives \nof sidecar drivers Dwight Beare in  Sidecar Race A, Ian  Bell \nin Sidecar Race B and rider Andrew Soar in the  Senior race. \nFASTEST SPEEDS \nFastest speeds recorded on  Sulby Straight during practice \nand racing in  2016 were: \nSuperbike/Senior: 196.8mph \nSuperstock: 191.2mph \nSupersport: 173mph \nLightweight: 154.6mph \nSidecar: 146.8mph \nTT  Zero: 158mph \nAll figures were set  in near perfect weather conditions. \nThe fastest riders were now timed at  175mph as  they \npassed the  Grandstand en  route to  the  descent of Bray Hill. \nBruce Anstey’s Honda RCV123 Moto GP-derived bike proved fast at  its debut TT  in 2016. \n\nONWARDS AND UPWARDS 217 \nDean \nHarrison’s \nlaurels \nfor  \nSupersport \n| \nrace \n-  \namended \nto  \nrecognise \nhis  \npromotion \nto  \nsecond \nplace. \nWhen first introduced in  1999, the  timing clock showed a \nmaximum speed of 165mph at the  same point. \nTHE DUELLISTS \nPractice \nperformances \nshowed \nthat \nMichael \nDunlop \nand \nIan \nHutchinson \nwere \nthe \nmen \non \ntop \nform \nand \ntheir \nduels \nwere \nto \nbe \nthe \nmain \nfeature \nof \nthe \nweek’s \nracing \nin \n2016, \nDun- \nlop \nleapt \nto \nthe \nfront \nof \nthe \nopening \nSuperbike \nrace, \nheld \nHutchie \nat \nbay, \nset \na \nnew \nabsolute \nlap \nrecord \nof \n133.39mph \nand \nbecame \nthe \nfirst \nman \nto \ncomplete \na \nlap \nin \nunder \n17 \nminutes. \nHe \nwon \nby \n20 \nseconds \non \nhis \nBMW \nfrom \nsimilarly \nmounted \nIan \nHutchinson, \nwhile \nJohn \nMcGuinness \n(Honda) \nwas third. \nThe \nnext \nsolo \nrace \nwas \nSupersport \nRace \n1,  \nand \nJan \nHutchison \n(Yamaha) \nled \nfrom \nthe \nstart \nto \ntake \nvictory \nfrom \nMichael \nDunlop \n(Yamaha) \nby \n15 \nseconds, \nsetting \na \nnew \nlap \nrecord of 128.72mph in  the  process. Then, after post-race \nmachine inspection, came the  announcement that Dunlop \nhad been disqualified ‘for a  technical infringement’. This \nbrought Dean Harrison (Kawasaki) up  into second place, \nwith James Hillier (Kawasaki) in third. \nLater \nthe  \nsame \nday  \nHutchinson \nand \nDunlop \n(BMWs) \nwere \nfighting \nit \nout \nin \nthe \nSuperstock \nrace, \nwhere \nHutchie \nagain \ntook \nthe \nlead \nwith \na  \nrecord-breaking \nopening \nlap \nfor \nthe  \nclass \nof \n133.09mph \non  \ntreaded \ntyres. \nMichael \nDun- \nlop \nthen \nretired \nwith \na \nbroken \ngear \nlever \nand  \nthe  \nwin \nwent \nto \nHutchinson \nby \n27 \nseconds \nfrom \nDean \nHarrison \nand \nJames \nHillier \non  \ntheir \nKawasakis. \nCome \nthe \nSupersport \nRace \n2 \nand \nHutchinson \nconfirmed \nhis  \nsuperiority \nin  \nthe \nclass \nby \nleading \nfrom \nthe \noutset, \ncontrolling \nthe \nrace \nfrom \nthe  \nfront \nand \nwinning \nby \n17  \nseconds \nfrom \narch-opponent, \nDunlop. \n\n218 HM  ONWARDS AND UPWARDS \nThe final contest for  these two top runners came in \nthe Senior race, where, over six  laps, Michael Dunlop \nand his  BMW were not  to  be  denied. Leading from the \noutset, Dunlop broke the  absolute course record, storm- \ning around the 37% miles in  16  minutes 53.93 seconds, at \nan  incredible average speed of  133.96mph. Ian  Hutchin- \nson  (BMW) was  in second place and  there he stayed, com- \ning home some 30  seconds behind Dunlop in  what was a \nrecord-breaking Senior TT, with John McGuinness \n(Honda) third. \nIt  was nine years since John McGuinness set  the  first \n130mph lap, back at  the  2007 TT. Indicating how difficult \nit had become to  increase lap speeds, it  then advanced in \nonly small increments, spending five years in  the 131mph \nbracket, until Bruce Anstey’s Superbike ride in  2014 took \nit  through the 132mph barrier. Just two years later and \nWe \nThe TT  Zero-winning Mugen after the 2016 race. \nMichael Dunlop raised it to  almost 134mph, leaving com- \nmentators searching for  words to  describe his  outstanding \nSenior TT-winning ride. \nEarlier in  the  week, Ivan Lintin won the Lightweight \nrace at  just below his  own record pace set  the  year before, \nwhilst among the three-wheelers, John Holden won Sidecar \nA, where Ben Birchall set  a  new lap record of 116.798mph \nbefore retiring. The Birchalls—Ben’s brother Tom occupied \nthe  ‘chair’ —  won Sidecar B after a close contest in the initial \nstages with John Holden and Dave Molyneux. It was a  year \nwhen Honda power dominated the  sidecar races, but  their \nengines also had some notable failures. Seventeen-times \nwinner Dave Molyneux did not  start the first race and failed \nto  finish the  second with Honda power and  he was publicly \ncritical of their ageing design, declaring that he would use \nYamaha engines in  2017. \n\nA first-time win in  TT  Zero for  Bruce Anstey saw  him \nbring his  Mugen home ahead of William Dunlop (Victory \nBrammor), at  just under record pace. With five  finishers \nfrom seven starters, this was the  first year since the  intro- \nduction of the class in 2009 that the electric-powered bikes \nhad  failed to  record an  advance in lap speed. \nTHE FUTURE? \nThis book on  ‘Speed at  the  TT  Races’ concludes with a \nrepeat of the quotation that appeared in The Motor Cycle after \nthe  first races for  a  Tourist Trophy in  1907: ‘It  is useless \nto  say  that fast speeds are  not  to  be  encouraged, human \nnature being what it is.’  One hundred and  ten  years later, \nit still provides a  basic explanation of why riders strive to \nride ever faster around the  unforgiving Mountain Course. \nThere have been many machine developments aimed at \nproviding greater power, improved handling, better brak- \ning and increased reliability, all  of which have combined \nto  provide riders with faster racing motorcycles. Allied to \nthat extensive machine development, even the most ardent \nTT  follower has  lost count of the  countless improvements \nto  the  course that have aided the process of riding it faster. \nAnother, more speculative factor, is that with the  greater \nfamiliarity the human race now has with mechanically pow- \nered two-wheel devices, it is perhaps breeding even better \nriders. \nDespite the  developments on  all  these fronts, it is still \nhugely impressive that average lap speeds around the \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS #219 \nMountain Course have increased from 50.11mph in  1911 \nto  133.96 in  2016. However, it should be remembered that \nthe  object of the  first races was not  to  go ever faster, but  to \nbreed reliability in  motorcycles that were still in  the  early \nstages of development. Thus riders competed for a  ‘Tourist \nTrophy’. \nIn the years that followed, there have been many instances \nwhen the  motorcycle press announced that the  motorcycle \nhad  reached the  peak of its development in terms of power \nand reliability. They were repeatedly shown to be wrong, as \nadvances continued to  be made in all aspects of motorcycle \ndesign and  use. \nToday’s large-capacity motorcycles come with perform- \nance that far outstrips what can  be used on  the  open roads \nand, while the  highest measured top  speed of TT  Super- \nbikes is  196.8mph, they are  probably hitting 200mph on \nthe  drop from Creg ny Baa  to  Brandish, which is, in round \nterms, 100  yards per  second. Some may think that is fast \nenough, but the strong competitive urge present in TT rac- \ners  will see  them striving for  even more speed from their \ntwo-wheeled projectiles. \nAt present there seems no  desire to  cap  speeds, so  they \nare set  to  continue onwards and upwards, albeit with \nsmaller increments than in  the  past.

For  two weeks, \nthe  roads that make up the  37% miles of the  famed Isle  of \nMan Mountain Course are given over to  top motorcycle \nracers, to  ride the  fastest bikes of the  day in pursuit of one \nof the  most highly coveted prizes in  motorcycle racing: a \nTourist Trophy. \nThis is the  way it has  been for  110  years, during which \ntime the  annual event has  evolved from a single race into a \nfestival of motorcycling. But  however varied the  interests \non  show, the  main reason for  the  high-octane atmosphere \nthat envelops the Island during those two weeks is  the \nunfettered spectacle of raw speed generated by racing over \nthe public roads of the  TT  Mountain Course. \nIt was the  opportunity to  break free from the  shackles \nof mainland Britain’s then 20mph speed limit and to  ride \nfaster than the  next man that brought the  first motorcycle \nTT to  the  Isle of Man in  1907. Recognized from the  outset \nas  being one of motorcycling’s greatest challenges, for over \na century the island has attracted the very best road racers, \nwhile successive generations of followers have crowded the \nroadside banks and marvelled at  the  way in  which riders \nhave gone ever faster at this unique event. \nIn  the  following pages you can read about the  attrac- \ntion of speed to  competitors and  spectators, and how faster \nmotorcycles have caused the time required to lap the Moun- \ntain Course to  shrink from 45  minutes to  under 17  min- \nutes. Also considered are  how changes to  the roads and the \nrules of racing have affected race speeds, plus the  many \nfactors in the  development of racing motorcycles that have \ncontributed to  lap speeds growing from an  average of just \nover 40mph to  well in  excess of 130mph. All  this is inter- \nwoven with the  history of the  event and will leave you in \nno  doubt that it is speed that has shaped most aspects of the \nnow legendary TT  races. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nA book like this cannot be written without assistance across \nmany areas and I am  grateful for  the  support provided by \nStan Basnett, David and Joan Crawford, Ralph Crellin, \nTony East, Geoff Judges, Paul Wright, Manx National Her- \nitage and the VMCC Library.

      "text": "CASO ESHEI COIN aE \nGATHERING MOMENTUM \nFollowers of the Isle  of Man Tourist Trophy races are  inter- \nested in many aspects of the annual event, but the dominant \nattraction to  most of them has always been the  spectacle of \nraw  and unbridled speed on  offer over the roads of the famed \nand feared Mountain Course. Through successive genera- \ntions of  TT  racing, spectators have marvelled as  riders have \nexhibited their skills and  courage over those public roads, \nwhile extracting maximum performance from their \nmachines. Each will have given their all, but  history \nconfirms that it has always been the fastest riders who \ncommanded the  most attention, received the  great- \nest  publicity and entered the  record books. \nMuch has  been written to  explain man’s wish to \ntravel ever faster, but just one  week after the first TT \nrace in  1907, when the  event faced criticism from \nsome quarters, The  Motor Cycle magazine neatly sum- \nmarized the  situation with the words: ‘It is useless to \nsay that fast speeds are  not  to  be encouraged, human \nnature being what it is.’ \nTop motorcycle racers have always demanded the \nvery best motorcycles to  ride and over a  century of \neffort has  now been committed to  developing more \npowerful racing engines, together with improved \ntransmissions, suspension, brakes, tyres, electrics \nand the like, all  with the aim of  putting better \nmachines into the hands of riders, to travel ever faster \naround the 37%4-mile lap of the TT Mountain Course. \nHas all that effort been successful? Well, in the  first \nrunning of the  race for  the  Tourist Trophy over the \nMountain Course in  1911, winner Oliver Godfrey \nthrilled spectators with speeds they had never before \nexperienced, as  he  rode his  clObhp Indian to  first \nplace at  a  race average speed of 47.63mph, reach- \ning perhaps 65mph in  the  process. In  2016 Michael \nDunlop \ndid \nexactly \nthe \nsame \nwith \nhis \n220-plus \nbhp \nBMW as  he  rode to  victory at  a  race average speed \nof \n130.68mph, \nwhile \nhitting \nclose \nto \n200mph. \nThat \nsimple \ncomparison \nreflects \nover \n100 \nyears’ \ngrowth \nin \npower \nand \nspeed, \nsubstantial \ntechnical \nprogress \nand \nan  awful lot of excitement. \nSt John’s \nCourse \n| OVIC  BATES Cartographer Ltd  2016 \nEARLY TT  RACES \nThe first Tourist Trophy race for  motorcycles was run in \n1907, over ten  laps of a  15'/-mile circuit in the  west of the \nisland called the  St John’s Course. \nIt presented a  challenge for  motorcycles of the  era, for \nthey were still in  an  early stage of development.

      "text": "8  M  GATHERING MOMENTUM \nRiders tackle the sharp downhill turn at  Douglas Road \nCorner, Kirk Michael, on  the St John’s Course. \nof the  first event: in  words of the  day, the  Tourist Trophy \nrace was created ‘for the  development of the  ideal tour- \ning motorcycle’. To help achieve that ideal, machines were \nequipped with silencers, had to  carry a  specified mini- \nmum weight of tools, be  fitted with a  proper saddle and \nuse  touring-type mudguards. The regulation that had  most \ninfluence on  speeds, however, was the  one that specified \nfixed allocations of fuel for  the  race. This was limited to \n1 gallon for  every 90  miles of race distance for  single-cyl- \ninder machines and 1 gallon per 75  miles for  those with \nmore than one cylinder. For many competitors the  effect \nof that regulation was to  govern the  speed at  which they \ncould ‘race’, because trying to  run at  maximum throttle \nwould see  them use  up their fuel before completion of the \n158-mile total distance. \nAfter spending their practice sessions seeking the  right \nbalance between speed and economy, twenty-five riders \nlined up  in  front of the  historic Tynwald Hill at  St John’s \nto  start the  first TT. As  there were no  specified standards \nfor  riding gear, they turned out  in a selection of leather, \ntweed and oilskins. Wearing additional belts and pouches \nfor  spare parts and  sometimes a  spare inner tube over the \nshoulder, they probably looked a  motley crew, but  they \nwere courageous pioneers, for few would have ridden a race \nthat was anything like the  one that faced them on  28  May \n1907. Dispatched in pairs at one  minute intervals, all had to \nride with fuel consumption in mind; the amount remaining \nin each rider’s tank at the end was  measured and publicized. \nFastest rider on  a  twin-cylinder machine in  1907 was \nRem Fowler ona Norton. Suitably braced with ‘a glassful of \nneat brandy tempered with a little milk’ before starting, he \nreturned a  race average speed of 36.22mph, set  the  fastest \nlap of the  day at  42.91mph, and had a petrol consumption \nfigure \nof \n87mpg. \nFastest \nov \nerall \nand \nwinner \nof \nthe  \nnewly \ncreated \nTourist \nTrophy \nwas \nfirst \nman \nhome \non \na \nsingle- \ncyl- \ninder \nmachine, \nCharlie \nCollier. \nOn \nhis \nfamily-built \nMatch- \nless, \nhe \nrode \nto \na \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nof \n38.22mph, \nwith \na \nfastest \nlap \nof \n41.81mph \nat \n94.5mpg. \nFowler had an  eventful race, with delays to  progress \ncaused by falling off twice, repairing a  front-wheel punc- \nture, changing several sparking plugs, tightening his  drive \nbelt twice and fixing a  loose mudguard. Such problems \nwere quite usual in  early TT  races, meaning that competi- \ntors needed to have mechanical skills as  well as  riding ones. \nIn contrast to  the many difficulties experienced by Fowler, \noverall winner Collier had a relatively trouble-free run  dur- \ning the  4 hours, 8 minutes and 8 seconds it  took him to \ncomplete the  first race for  the  magnificent silver Tourist \nTrophy, a gift to the organizers from the  Marquis de Mouz- \nilly St Mars. \nThe motorcycles used in  1907 were still recognizably \nderived from pedal cycles but  they were not  easy to  con- \ntrol. While trying to  race at  speed over poor road sur- \nfaces, riders had to  juggle levers to  achieve the  right bal- \nance between mixture strength, spark timing and throttle \nopening, whilst also remembering to  top  up  the  drip-fed \ntotal-loss lubrication system by  operating a  manual oil \npump at  regular intervals. The bikes were tall  with wide \nhandlebars, had  virtually no  springing and  possessed only \npoor brakes. Tyres were of a narrow 24-inch beaded-edge \nsection and were inflated to  high pressures to  help them \ngrip the  rims. Most lacked any  form of clutch or  gearbox, \nso  the  single gear chosen had to  be a  compromise between \nReady \nfor  \nthe \nfray \nprior \nto  \nthe \n1908 \nTT, \nCaptain \nSir \nRobert \nKeith \nArbuthnot, \nBt, \nshows \noff \nhis \nTriumph, \na \ntypical \nmachine \nof \nthe \nday."

However, the  Nor- \nton  Manufacturing Company Ltd countered with an  adver- \ntisement saying ‘The fastest machine in the Tourist Trophy \nwas the  Norton twin, in  spite of misleading statements to \nthe  contrary’. \nGETTING FASTER \nPedals, previously used for starting and to aid hill-climbing, \nwere banned for  1908. That had little effect on  race speeds, \nbut  the  elimination in  1909 of the  fixed petrol allowance \nand the  freedom given to  run without silencers certainly \ndid, because it allowed for  full  throttle all the  way, where \nmachine and road conditions allowed. This meant that as \nwell as  meeting the  need for  speed, riders could satisfy \nanother aspect of human nature —  trying to  defeat their fel- \nBallacraine \nwas \napproached \nfrom \nthe \nopposite \ndirection \nin \nthe \nearly \nTT  \nraces. \nIn  \n1910 \nthe  \norganizers \nramped \nthe \noutside \nof \nthe \ncorner \nto \nhelp \nthe \nsingle-speed \nmachines \nmaintain \nmomentum \nfor \nthe \nclimb \nthat \nfollowed \nup \nto  \nBallaspur. \nNot \neveryone \ngot \nit \nright \nand \nthere \nwere \nspills. \nHowever, \na \ndoctor \nfrom \nPeel \nwas \non \nhand \nand \nhis \ncar \ncan \nbe \nseen \nhere, \nparked \non \nthe \ncourse \nand \nwith \nthe \nhandles \nof \na \nstretcher \nsticking \nout \nof \nthe \nwindow. \nGATHERING MOMENTUM #9 \nlow riders. Asaresult, Harry Collier (brother of 1907 win- \nner  Charlie) brought his  Matchless home in  a  time almost \n25  per  cent faster than previous winners, pushing the  race \naverage speed up to  49.01mph and  setting the  fastest lap of \n52.27mph. That was a huge increase from the previous fast- \nest  lap of 42.91mph and  provided an  early example of how \nrule changes can  impact on  race speeds. \nThe speeds achieved in  1909 may not  sound fast  to  cur- \nrent TT  fans, but  they would have impressed those who \nsaw and read about them. The maximum speed allowed \non  the  roads of Britain at  the  time was  20mph (14mph on \nthe  Isle of Man), and with a low level of vehicle ownership, \nfew people had any  experience of what it was like to  travel \nat  60-plus mph. They would have been in justifiable awe of \nthose early racers. \nA  force to  be  reckoned with in  the  early years of TT \nracing, past winners Charlie and Harry Collier took their \nMatchless machines to  first and second places at  the 1910 \nTT, although it was Harry Bowen on  his  BAT who set  the \nfastest lap at  53.15mph, in  what turned out  to  be  the  last \nTT  to  be run over the  St John’s Course. \n1911: THE MOUNTAIN COURSE \nThe Isle  of Man Tourist Trophy races were organized by \nthe  Auto Cycle Union (ACU), who governed motorcycle \nsport in  most of Britain. In a  deliberate attempt to  hasten \nmotorcycle development, in particular to advance the adop- \ntion of variable gears, it moved the  races from the  St John’s \nCourse to  the  far  more demanding Mountain Course in \n1911. No  one could have realized what a  profound effect \nthat move would have on  motorcycle development over the \nnext 100  years, for the Mountain Course became a test-bed \nfor  almost every new design feature, with manufacturers \nconfident that if a  new development could withstand the \nrigours of a TT race, then it was  fit to  market to the general \npublic. \nEarly TT  meetings comprised just a  single race, with \nclasses for single- and multi-cylinder machines. But  in  1911 \ntwo separate races were run, carrying the  titles of Senior \nand  Junior, in  which singles and multis raced each other. \nThe multis (almost exclusively twins) were permitted to \nrun  with a greater engine capacity; for the  Senior they had \nan  upper limit of 585cc with singles limited to  500cc, while \nin the Junior, twins could be up to  340cc and singles 300cc. \nRace distances were five laps and 187’ miles for  Seniors \nand  four laps covering 150  miles for Juniors. \nMachines entered for  the  smaller class were considered \n‘Lightweights’ of the  day and  some manufacturers wanted \nto  retain pedals for the  race.

Meanwhile, as  has always been the  case with \nthe Tourist Trophy meeting, other people had ideas on  how \nthe event should be run, with the motorcycle press floating \nthe  notion of a  minimum weight limit for  riders because \nthey believed that those of  small stature would gain an \nunfair advantage on  the  climb of the  Mountain. Indeed, \ntheir proposal was that any  rider weighing less  than 140— \n150lb (63—68kg) in full  riding gear should be barred from \nthe  event. There were dissenting voices on  other aspects, \ntoo; for  example, not  everyone agreed with moving the \nTT  to  the  Mountain Course. There were claims that the \nParliament Square \nWS = as \n*The 33rd \n34m \nKate’s Cottage 4 \ndescent from Snaefell would be \ndangerous, even though the real \nconcern for  most was the 1,400ft \n(430m) ascent of  ‘the Mountain’, \nparticularly as  the  iron engines of \nthe  day were known to  lose power \n= — \nwhen hot. \nWhen first used for motorcycles \nin  1911, the  Mountain Course over \nSnaefell (Snow Mountain) was  3712 \nmiles long and its route was almost \nthe  same as  today’s, except that on \nthe  outskirts of Douglas at  Cronk \nny  Mona, riders turned right and \nrode through Willaston to  reach \nthe  top  of  Bray Hill, rather than \ngoing via  Signpost Corner, Gover- \nnor’s Bridge and the  Glencrutchery \nRoad as  they do  today. The start \nand finish were located on  a flat \nstretch of road after the  bottom of \nBray Hill before it commenced its \ndescent to  the  Quarter Bridge. \nOn the approach to that first 1911 \nMountain Course TT it  became \nclear that most manufacturers had \naccepted the need for variable gears \nand examples of most of the  avail- \nable types could be  seen.

It was clear from the  first \nlap of practice that the section from Ginger Hall to Ramsey \nwas in  very poor condition, as  was the  Mountain Road, \nwhich was strewn with loose stones and  was described by \nThe Isle  of Man Weekly Times as  ‘dreadful’. The same newspa- \nper urged that Bray Hill be swept before riders tackled it at \nwhat it said would be 70mph. \nPractice sessions were all  early morning and started \nfrom the  Quarter Bridge on  the  outskirts of Douglas. Per- \nhaps seeking to  minimize disturbance to  local inhabitants \naround the  course, the  ACU decreed that practice would \nbe allowed for just one  week prior to  racing in  1911. How- \never, after representations from the  traders and  hoteliers \nof Douglas, who sought to  maximize income from the TT, \nthis was extended to  two weeks of practice, all  of which \nBray \nHill \nin \nDouglas, \njust \na \nfew \nyears \nbefore \nuse \nin \nthe \nfirst \nMountain \nCourse \nTT \nin \n1911. \nWinner of the 1911 Junior TT, Percy Evans (Humber), \ntakes a tight line at the tricky Ramsey Hairpin. \ntook place over open roads. That decision to  extend the \npractice period was an  early example of peripheral com- \nmercial interests influencing the running of the TT, as  they \ndo to  this day. \nGiven the conditions in the first year of using the  Moun- \ntain Course, it is not  surprising that there were accidents \nto  riders during practice and, regrettably, the  TT  saw its \nfirst fatality when Victor Surridge fell  from his  Rudge at \nGlen Helen. \nBoth the  Junior and Senior TT  races of 1911 were held \nin  dry weather, with the  former run on  Friday, 30  June \nwith thirty-seven entries over four laps, and the  latter on \nMonday, 3 July with sixty-seven entries over five  laps. The \nman who rode to  victory in  the 150-mile Junior TT  was \nPercy Evans on  a  twin-cylinder Humber with belt drive \nand three-speed hub gear. He  averaged 41.45mph and set \nthe  fastest lap of 42.00mph, finishing well ahead of Harry \nCollier (Matchless) in second place. \nRacing bikes of the  day generally ran  with small-bore, \nstraight-through exhausts, which gave them a  crackling \nnote. Riders would also have been able to  hear a  regular \nslap-slap from their belt drives, sundry clickings from the \nexposed valve gear and usually a  loud knocking from the \nengine when it was put under load at low  revs. \nDISQUALIFICATION \nIn  the 1911 Senior race, the  two most fancied runners, \nCharlie Collier and French-Canadian ace  Jake de  Rosier, \nbattled closely for  the  lead on  the  first few  laps, until de \nRosier fell  at  Kerromoar. Limping in  to  what was then \nnamed the  Ramsey Depot (what we  now call  the  Pits, of \nwhich there was another at  Braddan Church), de  Rosier \nborrowed tools to  fix  his  Indian and, although he rode on \nto  the  finish, he  was disqualified for  what the  organizers \nclassed as  ‘receiving outside assistance’."

The latter’s average race speed was  47.63mph, \nwhile the  fastest lap  went to  Frank Philipp (Scott) at \n50.1lmph. Thus the 1911 event established the  first race \naverage speeds and fastest lap  speeds for  the Mountain \nCourse, so  offering a  target for  future years and causing \none  publication to  speculate ‘is  a 6(0mph or  even a  70mph \nTT possible in the future?’. \nMention has  been made of Jake de  Rosier’s disqualifi- \ncation and, although Charlie Collier was initially credited \nwith second place, he  too  was disqualified. In  his  case it \nwas for taking on  fuel at  other than the  authorized depots \nat  Ramsey and  Braddan. \nDe  Rosier was probably the  top racer in North America \nat the  time while Collier held a  similar position in Britain, \nso the serious penalties incurred by those star  riders showed \nhow important it  was to  be  fully prepared for  a  TT  race \n—  in  all  respects. De  Rosier’s Indian would undoubtedly \nhave received the most careful mechanical preparation, but \nfailure to  secure his  tool-bag properly meant that he  lost \ntools during the  race and thus had to  borrow some when \nhe  stopped at  Ramsey, so  leading to  his  disqualification. \nQuite how past-winner Collier managed to miscalculate on \nfuel and thus be forced to borrow some at Ballacraine is not \nknown, for he was  such an  experienced racer. However, it \nis worth mentioning that the  TT  was still the  only race of \nits  kind run  in  Britain. Collier had  taken part in point-to- \npoint road races on  the  Continent, but  in  Britain his  only \nopportunities to  race were on  some of the  larger boarded \ncycle-tracks, in relatively short hill-climbs, at the concrete \nspeed bowl of Brooklands, or,  if he had chosen to,  in  the \noccasional sand race. \nBoth of the  1911 races provided victories for twin-cylin- \nThe intrepid Charlie Collier speeds over Ballig Bridge on \nhis  Matchless. \nder  machines, and  the  fact  that they were fitted with vari- \nable speed gearing was no  doubt to  the  satisfaction of the \norganizing ACU.

Collier &  Sons Ltd \n(makers of Matchless machines) being amongst those who \nrefused to  sign, but  it left  the  ACU to  run an  event that \nwould be mostly made up of private runners. Having previ- \nously relied on  the  entry fees and voluntary contributions \nfrom manufacturers to  help fund the running of the  event, \nthis was a real blow to  the  ACU and could easily have fin- \nished the TT  after just one year’s running on  the Mountain \nCourse. To its credit, the ACU decided to take the financial \nrisk and go ahead with the  1912 races. \nSales of motorcycles were booming and in  a  crowded \nmarket, with little other than the  views expressed in  the \nfew motorcycling magazines of the day to go on,  the buying \npublic still looked for honest pointers as  to  which machines \nto  buy. TT  results could help provide those pointers. \nA FRENCH TT? \nEven today the Isle of Man TT races cannot be run  without \nthe  annual approval of Tynwald, the  Manx government, \nand the  ACU were kept waiting for  that approval for  the \n1912 races. Perhaps in  an  attempt to  provoke a  decision, \nthe  motorcycle press wrote about how easy it was to  get \npermission to  run  road races in France and  that, for many, \nit would actually be simpler to  get there rather than to  the \nIsle of Man! This notion began to  build momentum and \neven found support in the French motorcycle press. In Janu- \nary 1912 the  ACU decided to  write to  the  Manx authori- \nties and press for  a  decision. If an  early response was not \nforthcoming, it resolved ‘to  communicate with one  of the \nprincipal French motorcycle clubs with a  view to  holding \nthis \nimportant \nevent \nin \nFrance’. \nTynwald’s \napproval \nwas \nreceived before the  end  of the  month. \nREDUCED ENTRIES \nCome \nthe \nclosing \ndate \nfor \nentries \nto \nthe \n1912 \nTT \nand \nthose \nGATHERING MOMENTUM #13 \nfor  the  Senior totalled forty-nine, while for  the  Junior it \nwas  twenty-six. Comparative figures from 1911 were sixty- \nseven and  thirty-seven, showing the  effect of the  manufac- \nturers’ boycott. Sadly, racing had  taken its  toll  on  some of \nthe previous year’s top Indian riders, for Jake de Rosier was \nlying badly injured in a  Los  Angeles hospital, while Moor- \nhouse (third in  1911) had  been killed at  Brooklands. The \ndanger of practising on  open roads, as  all TT  sessions were, \nwas brought home to  riders after John Gibson, ‘travelling \ndown Bray Hill at  a  good speed’, collided with a  car  that \nbacked out  of a side road into his path. Gibson survived the \ncrash, but was injured. \nThere was nothing radically new in  design-wise for  the \nmachines entered for  1912, but  one important change to \nthe  regulations saw the  upper capacity limit for the  Senior \nrace set at 500cc and for the Junior 350cc. This meant that, \nfor the  first time, single- and  twin-cylinder engines would \ncompete on  level terms in each race. Entrants in the  Senior \nwere chasing a first prize of £40 and  for  the  Junior it was \n£30. In addition, gold medals were awarded to the winners \nand to  any  other rider finishing within 30  minutes of the \nwinner’s overall race time. \nCourse conditions in  1912 were much the same as  in pre- \nvious years, although the island had gained its first stretch of \ntar-sprayed macadam on  the  short straight between Quar- \nter  Bridge and  Braddan Bridge on  the outskirts of Douglas. \nQuarter Bridge itself had been widened considerably, as had \nthe  Hall Caine bends, which were now described as  ‘all \nout’. Hall Caine was a  renowned author who lived some 6 \nmiles from the  start at  Greeba Castle, which is how those \nbends are  known today. \nWET \nIt was difficult to  gain real pointers to  riders’ form during \npractice in  1912, for  several of the  sessions were affected \nby rain, making the roads muddy and riding conditions dif- \nficult. Come race day, riders in the Junior faced torrential \nrain at the start of their race, which eased and then stopped \non  the  second lap. \nVery wet conditions at  Quarter Bridge for  Harry Bashall \n(Douglas) in the  Junior TT  of  1912."

      "text": "14  M@  GATHERING MOMENTUM \nThis was the  first TT  to  be held under really wet condi- \ntions, and  as  well as  affecting the  course, it offered a chal- \nlenge to  the  waterproofing of magnetos and plug leads. \nUnfortunately, some machines were found wanting in \nthose areas, leading to  early retirements. To  add  to  rider \ndifficulties, the exposed belt drives used by most machines \nwere prone to slip when coated with road mud and this had \nthe  effect of reducing speed, particularly on  hills. \nFastest man proved to  be  Harry Bashall on  his  Doug- \nlas; as  an  indication of the  difficult conditions, he stopped \neight times during the race to give attention to his machine. \nBashall’s race average speed was 39.65mph, which was a \ncommendable figure when compared with the previous \nyear’s winning average speed of 41.45mph in the  dry. Fast- \nest  lap was by second-placed man Eric Kickham, also ona \nDouglas, at 41.76mph. There were just eleven finishers out \nof twenty-one starters. \nSINGLES OR TWINS \nAt  the  previous year’s TT, twin-cylinder machines had a \ncapacity advantage over the singles and were victorious in \nboth races. The question for  1912 was how would twins \nfare against singles now that they were on  equal capacity \nterms. By taking the first two places in the Junior race, the \nDouglas concern showed that twins were still front run- \nners, but how would the big bikes do? \nConditions for the Senior TT held on Monday, | July were \nbetter than for the  previous Friday’s Junior race, although \nthere was rain before the  start, the  wind was strong and \nthere was some mist over the  Mountain, where wander- \ning sheep were said to  be  troublesome.

Not everyone made the finish and \nthe  post-race reports tell  of falls, valve troubles, fuel dif- \nficulties, fires, punctures and failure of other components. \nDRIVE BELTS \nThese were mostly of leather, one  reason being that it had \nplenty of ‘give’ and was thus able to  cushion some of the \nshocks imposed by each firing stroke. Prone to  slip in  wet \nand  muddy conditions, belts also had  a  tendency to  stretch \nand to  snap their fastening links. Riders carried repair kits \nto  deal with such problems. \nWhile chain drives tended to stretch less than belts, most \nriders liked to subject new chains toa lap of the course before \nusing them in  a  race, thus taking out  some of the  stretch. \nOnce stretched, a  metal chain stayed stretched. Users of \nleather belts also liked to  stretch them before a  race and \nhaving done so  they would remove them from the machine \nand \nhang \nthem \nup \nwith \na \nsubstantial \nweight \nattached. \nThis \nwas \nto \npreserve \nthe \nstretch, \nfor \nleather \nwould \ngradually \nshrink \nback \ntowards \nits \noriginal \nlength \nwhen \nnot \nloaded. \nBRAKING \nEarlier \nmention \nwas \nmade \nof \ndrive \nbelts \nslipping \nunder \n| \nmuddy \nconditions. \nThis \nwas \nmostly \ndue  \nto  \nmud \ngetting \non \nthe \ndummy \nrim \nof \nthe \nrear \nwheel, \nwhich \nthe \nbelt \nwas \ntry- \ning \nto \ndrive, \nand \non \nthe \nengine \npulley. \nThat \ndummy \nrim, \nsometimes \ncalled \nthe \nbelt \nrim, \nwas \nalso \nused \nfor \nthe \nbasic \nslowing \nprocess, \na \nblock \nof \nfriction \nmaterial \nbeing \npressed"

The basic rear brake \nis also visible. \nagainst it  by operation of a  brake pedal. \nAgain, mud on  the  dummy rim reduced \nbraking effect, just adding to the difficulty \nof racing in the  wet. With the  same tyres \nused in all weathers, poor conditions also \nincreased the danger of  losing adhesion \nand  creating what riders of the  day called ‘sideslip’. \nMachines were fitted with two brakes, the  second usu- \nally being of the horseshoe or  stirrup shape that utilized two \nbrake blocks bearing against the wheel rim  —  like  the pedal \ncycles of the time —  and  could be on  either the front or  back \nwheel. It was a time when riders were cautious about using \nthe  front brake, but  even when used together, the  brakes \noffered limited stopping power to  reduce speed for  cor- \nners, or  to  control the  descent to  Creg ny  Baa, which was \ndescribed as  ‘the sharpest pull-up on  the  course’. Brakes of \nthe time were not progressive in action, having a  tendency \nto  ‘grab’ and induce skidding, but some must have been \nbetter than others, for  a  report from the  1912 Senior race \nobserved: ‘the Triumph riders approached the bends much \nfaster than the majority, relying absolutely on  the efficiency \nof their brakes in the last  50 yards to steady their breakneck \nspeed’. \nIn  addition to  using their brakes, riders sought to  aid \nthe slowing process by making use of the  valve-lifter on \nthe  approach to  corners. By pulling a  lever they lifted the \nexhaust valve off its  seat and  broke the  seal to  the  combus- \ntion chamber. This largely negated the  effect of the  firing \nstroke and thus reduced drive. As they rounded the corner, \nthe  lever would be  released and the  exhaust-valve would \nrevert to  normal operation. \n1913: ENDURANCE \nEarly TT  races were a  test of endurance and Frank Apple- \nbee had to ride for almost 4 hours to take victory in the five- \nlap Senior TT  of 1912, with lesser riders in  the  saddle for \nmuch longer; some had to be helped from their machines at \nthe  finish. In a continuing quest to  push motorcycle devel- \nopment and reliability, the TT organizers shocked everyone \nwhen \nthey \nannounced \nthat \nthe \nSenior \nTT \nof \n1913 \nwould \nbe \nover \nseven \nlaps \nand \nthe \nJunior \nover \nsix. \nFortunately, \nthey \nrecognized \nthe \nextreme \ndemands \nthis \nwould \nput \non \nriders \nand \nso \nsplit \neach \nrace \ninto \ntwo \nsessions. \nTwo \nlaps \nof \nthe \nJunior \nwere \nrun \non \nthe \nWednesday \nmorning, \nafter \nwhich \nSq 7 \n4 \nthe machines were locked away under ACU control and the \nSenior runners did  three laps. After a  day’s rest, the  riders \nthen rode their remaining four laps on  Friday. The event \nhad recovered its  popularity with manufacturers by 1913 \nand those that were left  from a combined original entry of \n148  rode together on  the  Friday, with Seniors identified by \nred  waistcoats and Juniors wearing blue. \nOverall victory in  the 1913 Junior TT went to  Hugh \nMason (NUT-JAP), who despite spending most of  the \nprevious week in  hospital after a  practice crash, lifted the \naverage race speed to  43.75mph and set  the  fastest lap of \n45.42mph.

Spectators, and  most of those who read about the \nraces, were pleased to  see  the  lap record broken by a hand- \nsome 4 per  cent, but  it induced a  magazine of the  day to \npublish an  article titled ‘Slowing Down the  Senior Tourist \nTrophy’. Interestingly, a  read of the  article revealed that \nwhile the  title was a  recognition of some peoples’ views, \nthe  writer was of the  opinion that, ‘figures seem to  show \nthat the limits of speed fixed by the roads and by the engine \ndimensions have already been reached in the  Senior event’. \n1914: NEW FACES \nFor  the  1914 races, the  start was moved to  the  top of Bray \nHill, where temporary pits, grandstand and scoreboards \nwere erected. It  was a  year when crash helmets became \ncompulsory for the record entry of 159  and  one  where two \nnew marques joined the  list  of TT  winners, as  Eric Wil- \nliams took an  AJS to  race and  lap records in the Junior and \nCyril Pullin piloted a  Rudge to  record-breaking victory in \nthe  Senior. Tim Wood (Scott) was  credited with the  fast- \nest  lap in  the  Senior, breaking his  own record from 1913, \nwith a speed of 53.50mph and, in an  unusual occurrence, \npast winner Oliver Godfrey (Indian) tied  for second place \nwith newcomer Howard Davies (Sunbeam). TT  watchers \nnoted that both victories in  1914 went to  single-cylinder \nmachines. This was a  contrast to  previous years, when \ntwin-cylinder machines had prevailed, although the  fast- \nest  lap and  second places by Wood and Godfrey on  twins \nshowed they were still  a  force to be reckoned with. \nHANDLING \nA recurring theme at  the  TT  during the  years running up \nto  the  outbreak of the  First World War in  1914 was that \nalthough manufacturers were increasing engine outputs \nIn  1914 the  start was moved to  the  top of Bray Hill, where \nEric Williams (AJS) is shown finishing the Junior race. \nand \nthus, \nin \ntheory, \nspeeds, \nthe \npoor \nroad \nconditions \nmeant \nthat \nriders \nwere \nunable \nto \nuse \nthe \nfull \n10—12bhp \navailable \nto \nthem. \nThose \nwho \nstudied \nthe \nhandling \nof \nmachines \nover \nthe \npotholed \nand \nloose \nsurfaced \nroads \nmet \nwith \nin \nTT \nrac- \ning \ncould \nsee \nthat \nsome \nmakes \nhandled \nbetter \nthan \nothers. \nThis \nresulted \nin \ngreater \nattention \nbeing \ngiven \nto \nframe \nand \nfork \ndesign, \nto \nimprove \nhandling \nand \nallow \nriders \nto \ntravel \nmarginally \nfaster \nover \nthe \npoor \nroads. \nIt \nwas \nan \nearly \nles- \nson \nfor \nmanufacturers \n— \nwhich \nwould \nbe \nrepeated \nmany \ntimes \nover \nthe \nnext \ncentury \n— \nthat \nengine \npower \nover \nthe \nTT \nMountain \nCourse \ncounted \nfor \nlittle \nwithout \ncomparable \nroad-holding. \nSPEED SELLS \nWhether the  phrase ‘Speed Sells’ was in  use  in  the  early \ndays is not  clear, but  manufacturers were certainly aware \nthat speed was a plus factor and used it in  their advertis- \ning. Many of them added a  “TT Model’ to  their catalogues, \naimed at buyers who desired a machine resembling a racer, \nwith slightly downturned handlebars, sometimes a little \nengine tuning and usually a premium on  the purchase price. \nNot all such machines would have been from manufacturers \nwho had actually contested the TT, but a report told that by \n1914: ‘It is the  exception to  peruse a  catalogue which does \nnot  list a TT  model’. However, another report described \nmost manufacturers’ TT  models as:  ‘merely his  standard \nmount masquerading under false colours’. \nDespite the general wish to go faster, the poor road con- \nditions over the Mountain Course limited the growth in TT \nlap speed in the period 1911-1914 to just over 3mph, going \nfrom 50.11mph to  53.50mph. \nSoon after the 1914 TT the development of  racing \nmotorcycles was put  on  hold, as  major nations spent four \nyears fighting the  First World War.

      "text": "GEUMP | ERE TWO \nA  Sele BION IDS ODE \nWhen the First World War ended in  November 1918, \nmanufacturers gave priority to  the production of motorcy- \ncles for road use, so  racing had  to  wait its  turn. It was the \nsummer of  1920 before the  sound of racing motorcycles \nonce again reverberated around the  Mountain Course. \nDEVELOPMENT \nThe concentrated efforts put  into war usually accelerate \ndevelopment in  specific areas and 1914—18 saw consider- \nable advances in aero-engine design, often on  a no-expense- \nspared basis. With similarities in the performance needs of \naero and motorcycle engines, such as light weight combined \nwith low fuel consumption, high output, reliability, acces- \nsibility and so  on,  there was speculation on  how post-war \nmotorcycles might benefit from wartime advances in aero- \nengineering. Surprisingly, the  answer given by some well- \nregarded names was  along the  lines of  ‘not  a  lot’. James \nNorton, of Norton Motorcycles Ltd, explained that ‘aero \nproduction methods could not  be applied profitably to  the \nmotorcycle industry’, while George Stevens of A.J. Stevens \n&  Co. Ltd, makers of AJS, opined: ‘I cannot say  that the \nexperience gained during the  war has  helped manufactur- \ners  in  the  matter of improved general design, but  it will \nundoubtedly result in better and improved methods of con- \nstruction.’ \nA  strike of  moulders in  early 1920 threatened both \nnormal production and the racing plans of many firms. \nAs  early as  February, some realized that they would not \nbe  able to  compete at  the TT due to  the effects of  the \nstrike, while firms like Triumph and Zenith —  with full \norder-books —  continued to  concentrate on  production \nof roadsters, rather than divert efforts to  the  preparation \nof machines for racing. BSA, Ariel, Scott and  Rudge were \namong others not  making works entries, but  there were \nwhispers that some of those non-contenders lobbied for \nthe TT not to  be  run in  1920, perhaps because they \nrealized that their actions would lose them the chance \nof a  prestigious TT  win. Fortunately their efforts failed \nand  the  good news was that there were several new com- \npanies who intended to  enter. In  addition, there were \nprivate runners ready to  challenge the  Mountain Course, \neven though some would surely have been put off  by \nthe  £21 entry fee  —  a substantial sum, equivalent to  some \n£850 today. \nadvertisement \nfrom \n1919 \nreminded \npotential \nbuyers \nof \nAJS’s \nearlier \nTourist \nTrophy \nsuccess \nand \nracing \npedigree."

TT  riders tackled it on \nthe diagonal, from left  to  right, and were airborne over \nthe hump. \n1920: THETT COURSE \nWith many Manxmen away fighting, the  Mountain Course \nreceived only basic maintenance during the war, but an \noptimistic report from February 1920 told that ‘hundreds \nof men —  mostly discharged soldiers —  are  now employed \ngetting the Isle of Man roads in good condition’. Reporting \non  an  inspection lap a  month later, The  Motor Cycle claimed \nthat, ‘with the  exception of a  few  short stretches, it is in a \nsafe and satisfactory condition for  the  forthcoming race’. \nHowever, when ACU Secretary, Tom Loughborough, vis- \nited the  Island in  late April, he was not  so  impressed with \ncourse conditions. He felt that while much of the going was \njust about acceptable for  racing, the  stretch from Ginger \nHall to  Ramsey was in  such a  deplorable state that, as  he \ninformed the  Manx authorities, if it was not  put into good \nrepair the  1920 races would have to  be abandoned. \nThere was a  change to  the  route of the  TT  course in \n1920: as  riders neared the  end of a  lap, they no  longer \nturned right at  Cronk ny Mona but  carried on  to  Signpost \nCorner, then went via  The Nook and Governor’s Bridge \nto  join the Glencrutchery Road, where a  new start, fin- \nish  and  pits  area had  been created just before St  Ninian’s \ncrossroads.

It  came \nwith some sixty entries, almost evenly distributed between \nSenior and Junior races, which were scheduled for Tuesday \n15  and  Thursday 17  June. Early morning practising was \navailable for two weeks before, with riders warned: “‘Com- \npetitors should note that the  roads are  not  closed to  other \ntraffic during the times allotted to practising, and carts and \nother traffic may then be encountered’, \nIn  another slightly difficult-to-believe scenario, an \nappeal was made early in  practice for  anyone with a  spare \nACU-approved crash helmet to  offer it to  the  organizers, \nfor some competitors arrived on  the  island without one! \nIt was mentioned in  Chapter 1 how in  the  early days of \nthe  TT, 350cc machines were informally known as  Light- \nweights. For 1920, machines up  to  250cc were invited to \nrace in  a  class of their own within the  Junior (350cc) TT \nrace and  those 250s were given the  formal title of Light- \nweights. \nTo  qualify to  race, each competitor had to  complete a \nminimum of six  laps in  practice, with at  least one being \ncovered within 1 hour by Seniors, within one  hour and 10 \nminutes by Juniors and 1! hour 30 minutes by Lightweights. \nExtra safety \nstraps.

      "text": "Riders competing in the  TT  in  1920 knew they were \ntaking on  a challenge of man versus mountain. \nThe TT was still a  unique event in  Britain. Post-war \nmotorcycle competition had recommenced with events like \nhill-climbs, long-distance trials, sand racing and  so  on,  but \nwith Brooklands not  having reopened until April 1920 and \na  dearth of other venues, real speed events were largely \nabsent, and speed and spectacle was what both riders and \nspectators sought. Many pre-1914 TT  riders had been to \nwar and some had  not  returned. Who would take a  win in \nthe  1920 TT was  difficult to forecast, for those pre-war rid- \ners  with course knowledge were now six  years older, while \nfor some of the  newcomers it would be  their first attempt \nat genuine road racing. \nPROGRESS? \nFor all the talk of war-time developments not being of much \naid to motorcycle design, everyone expected racing motor- \ncycles at the  1920 TT to be faster than those of 1914. Chain \ndrive and variable gears had become almost universal, while \nadvances in metallurgy allowed the use  of components that \ndid not suffer the same degree of  performance-robbing \nheat distortion as  in  previous years. Also, better produc- \ntion machinery permitted manufacture to  closer toleranc- \nes.  Aluminium alloy pistons were to  be  used by several \nmakes, overhead valves were being introduced, steel fly- \nwheels lightened and  bikes given a  lower overall build. All \nwere considered to  be  improvements that could enhance \nperformance. \nSo  \nwhile \nthose \nmanufacturers \nwith \nTT  \nentries \nin  \n1920 \nlike \nNorton, \nSunbeam, \nABC, \nDuzmo, \nIndian, \nAJS, \nBlack- \nburne, \nWooler, \nDouglas, \nDiamond, \nLevis, \nIvy, \namong \noth- \ners, \nhad  \ndone \ntheir \nbit \nfor \nprogress, \nwhat \nabout \nthat \nother \nvital \nconstituent \nof \nracing, \nthe  \nMountain \nCourse \nitself? \nAs \nA  SPEEDY DECADE @  19 \nCyril Pullin rounds the loose-surfaced Gooseneck on  the \nearly part of the Mountain climb. \nindicated above, it was  in no  better condition than in  1914, \nwith an  often loose and stony surface littered with multi- \nple potholes and ruts that could not  be  dodged, together \nwith particularly rutted and  rocky going along parts of the \nnarrow Mountain Road. That meant, once again, that in \nspite of manufacturers’ best efforts to  boost machine per- \nformance, course conditions would restrict speed in many \nlocations. \nThere had been pre-TT talk of  1920 race bikes with \n80mph performance, but hard information was difficult \nto  come by. In  the  secrecy of their own testing facilities, \nmanufacturers may have measured output in units of brake \nhorse power (bhp) as  we  do  today, perhaps seeing figures \naround the  15bhp mark, but the most commonly published \nratings were generic ones. All 500cc machines were classed \nas  34%2HP and 350 models as  274HP, with no  distinction \nbetween stages of engine tune or  any attempt to portray true \noutput. It was said that 500cc Sunbeam side-valve engines \nwere showing 5,000rpm on  the  bench, but  limitations in \nvalve gear performance would see  their peak power being \nproduced at  nearer 4,000rpm, or  less. Norton’s entries \nwere under the  care of Brooklands record-breaker D.R. \nO’Donovan, and while the  company maintained that its \nbikes were close to  standard, he calculated that they were \nachieving revs of 4,300 in  top down the  Mountain, which \nequated to  a  speed of 76mph. It was a time when any  bike \nwith a  compression ratio approaching 6:1  was regarded as \nhighly tuned. \nRACING RETURNS \nSix years after the last TT and following two  weeks of prac- \ntising to hone riding skills and prepare machinery, the com- \nbined field of Junior and  Lightweight competitors lined up \non  the  Glencrutchery road, ready to  be despatched on  five \nlaps and 18712 miles of racing over the  Mountain Course."

      "text": "20  M@  A  SPEEDY DECADE \nAJS brought what was the  nearest to  a  new engine to \nthe race. Of  350cc, it  had a  hemispherical combustion \nchamber, exposed pushrods and valve springs operating \noverhead valve gear, plus lightened piston and flywheels. \nTheir riders had four gears available to them and Roy Bacon \ntells how that was achieved with ‘a two-speed countershaft \ngearbox, the  choice of ratios being doubled up  by fitting \ntwo primary chains with a selector at the engine sprockets’. \nOverall machine weight was  claimed to be just 2171b (99kg) \nand output rated as  10bhp. The AJS offered a lively package, \nwhich allowed 1914 Junior winner, Eric Williams, to  leap \ninto the  lead of the  Junior race, with similarly mounted \nHoward Davies and ‘Harry’ Harris second and third. The \npace was hot  at  the  front, but  became too  hot  —  approach- \ning the  mid-point those first three dropped out, each with \nserious mechanical issues. Fortunately for  AJS, they had \nbeen able to  call up  second-place man in  the  1914 Junior, \nCyril Williams, as  a  late  replacement for a  rider injured in \npractice and  he took over and  built a substantial lead. \nAs he began his descent of the  Mountain on  the  last  lap, \nCyril Williams must have felt that victory was  his.  But noth- \ning is certain in TT  racing and  at  Keppel Gate he suddenly \nlost all drive. The remaining 4 miles to  the finish must have \nbeen a nightmare, as  he coasted downhill, struggled uphill \nand shoved manfully on  the  long stretch from Governor’s \nBridge to  the  finishing line. Aware that his  lead was being \neroded at  every step, he staggered over the  line exhausted \nand only just able to  take in that he had  held on  and taken \nvictory from Jack Watson-Bourne on  his  Blackburne. \nThe race and lap speeds told the  story of this dramatic \nrace, for  Cyril Williams’ average race speed of 40.74mph \nwas much slower than Eric Williams’ race speed of \nRonald Clark (Levis) leaves Sulby Bridge in a  cloud of \ndust. \n45.58mph \nback \nin  \n1914. \nIt \nwas \nEric \nwho \nset  \nthe  \nfastest \nlap \nin \n1920 \nbefore \nhis \nforced \nretirement, \nboosting \nhis \n1914 \nlap \nrecord \nfrom \n47.57mph \nto \n51.36mph. \nLevis two-strokes dominated the  new Lightweight class \nand took the  first three places. First of them was Ronald \nClark, who survived a spill near the Thirty-third milestone \nand whose fastest lap time was 43.00mph. This was an \nexcellent effort for  a  250, for  they were severely taxed by \nthe  Mountain climb, with some of their riders talking of \n‘foot-slogging’ around the  Gooseneck. \nTwo days later twenty-seven riders lined up for the six-lap \nSenior TT. It was pace-setter in practice, George Dance, on \nhis  Sunbeam who led  for the  first two laps, until forced to \nretire. Manxman Dougie Brown then led for the  next two \non  his Norton, before being reeled in by Sunbeam-mounted \nTommy de la Hay, who held the lead to the finish. This time \nrecords were set  in both race average speed and lap speed, \nthe former being lifted from 49.49mph to  51.48mph, while \nlap speed went up  from 53.50mph to  55.62mph, a figure \nset  by George Dance on  his  second lap. \nIt was a year when single-cylinder machines were victo- \nrious in all three races, despite the presence of V-twins and \nflat-twins in the  Senior and Junior classes. \nTOO FAST? \nEven with the less than fulsome support received from man- \nufacturers in  1920, the races were rated a success, although \none item that attracted post-race discussion was whether \nthe 500cc machines were too  fast for course conditions. The \nMotor Cycle was strident on  the issue, writing ‘engine capac- \nity must be reduced for future races. Machines of 500cc are \ntoo  fast for the  course’. It went on  to  advocate a maximum \ncapacity of 350cc for TT  race bikes. \nWhile people recognized that riders of 500cc machines \nwere not  always able to  use  full  power in  1920, what they \ncould not  know was that the  Isle  of Man would accelerate \nits road-surfacing programme through the early years of the \n1920s and  thus offer much improved conditions for racing. \n1921: THE ‘TRADE’ RETURNS \nManufacturers and their associated component suppli- \ners \nwere \noften \nreferred \nto \nin \nmotorcycling \ncircles \nas \n‘the \nTrade’. \nSome \nhad \nabstained \nfrom \nsupporting \nthe \n1920 \nTT, \nbut \nthey \nwere \nback \nin \nforce \nfor \nthe \n1921 \nevent. \nThis \nresulted \nin \nentries \nof \nsixty-five \nfor \nthe \nJunior \nrace \nand \nsixty-eight \nin \nthe \nSenior, \nwith \nten \nmanufacturer’s \nteams \nnominated \nfor \nthe \nJunior \nand \neight \nfor \nthe \nSenior \n— \na \nhealthy \nsituation. \nWith \nopportunities \nfor \ntrue \nroad \nracing \nlimited \nto \nthe \nIsle \nof \nMan, \nBritish \nmanufacturers \nknew \nthat \nthe \nTT, \nwith \nits \nlong \nlap \nof \nvaried \ngoing, \noffered \nthem \ntest \nand \ndevelop-"

Stripped-out racers were \nnot wanted and the  race regulations specified minimum \nweight limits for each class. In  1920 it was 132%lb (60kg) \nfor 500cc machines and  110'4Ib (50kg) for  350cc. \nWhile the  1920 TT had  come too  soon after the  war for \nsome manufacturers to  get organized to  race, a  year later \nmany of them had  their TT  machinery out  and  about early, \nwith reports of several teams visiting the  Isle of Man for \nunofficial testing in March and  April 1921. \nCOURSE CONDITIONS \nThe Manx Highway Board was tar-spraying more of the \nIsland’s roads, although most of its activities were confined \nto  the  towns and larger villages, with little done on  the \nroads that linked them. The 3774 miles of the  Mountain \nCourse were still largely of rolled macadam with its  cus- \ntomary potholes, ruts and loose material, meaning that in \ndry weather riders trailed dust clouds that rose to  hedge \nheight and lingered for minutes. Not only was  this unpleas- \nant  for all concerned, but it created a real danger for riders \nattempting to pass. In the wet the potholes filled with water \nAt \nan  \nearly \n1920s \nTT, \nBert \nLe \nVack \napplies \ntoo \nmuch \nthrottle \ntoo \nsoon, \non \nthe \nloose \nsurface \nof \nRamsey \nHairpin. \nA  SPEEDY DECADE @  21 \nthat could not  be avoided by anyone travelling at  speed, so \nmachine and rider got covered in  mud. \nIn  1921 the  Mountain Road was not  the  principal route \nbetween Ramsey and Douglas that it is today, as  most trav- \nellers took the  coast road. Little use  meant little mainte- \nnance and it showed —  so  much so,  that on  the  descent of \nthe Mountain there were places where the road surface \nwas the  natural bedrock, which was a  highly dangerous \nand  uneven surface to  race over. Fortunately the  Highways \nBoard offered to  blast the  rock away and create a  better \nsurface before racing commenced. As an  illustration of the \nrelatively poor wearing qualities of the  ordinary unbound \nmacadam road surfaces, a report from early May said, ‘the \nMountain Road is rather bad, but  will not  be repaired too \nearly in case of rain rendering further repair necessary’. \nTHE MACHINERY \nManufacturers approached the  1921 TT  with real enthusi- \nasm and there was a ‘buzz’ on  the approach to the event that \nenveloped everyone concerned, leading to  claims that they \nwere to  witness ‘the finest motorcycle races in history’. \nThe previous year’s Senior TT  winners, Sunbeam, were \nback with both side-valve (sv) and overhead-valve (ohy) \nmodels, but  decided to  use  their tried and tested sv  ver- \nsions in the race. Norton again claimed to  be running near- \nstandard models, which came with a  shortened wheelbase \nand lower build, aimed at  improving handling. They also \nhad  a  couple of experimental ohy  models, while advertis- \ning their 16H sv  model as  ‘undoubtedly the  fastest coun- \ntershaft-geared 3'2HP machine extant’. Triumph brought \n4-valve ohv engines and 2-valve side-by-side versions, but \ndecided to  stick to  their older sv  design for the  race. Scotts \nwere back with their two-stroke twins and were the  only \nmaker with water-cooled engines. \nIt was a  TT  debut in  works form for  the  sizeable BSA \nconcern, who entered six  riders on  new models in the  Sen- \nior.  These were fitted with an  inclined ohy engine incor- \nporating new design elements in the valve gear, mechanical \nlubrication and a  distinct low overall build. They received \nplenty of pre-race publicity and, after setting fast  times in \ntesting at  Brooklands, much was expected of them. \nAmongst the  entries for  the  Junior race, 1920 winners \nAJS returned with 350cc machines that were similar to  the \nones they used in  1920. They had  their cylinder heads and \nbarrels copper-plated to  aid heat dispersion, before receiv- \ning a customary coat of black. Pistons of the  day were full- \nskirted and often heavily perforated below the  rings. The \noverall trend was for  three-speed countershaft gearboxes, \nincreased use  of small internal-expanding brakes, plus a \nmixture of manual and  mechanical oil pumps."

The little \n‘Ajays’ were in a class of their own and  Williams set  a new \nrace record of 52.11mph, while Davies took the  fastest lap \nat  55.15mph, claiming his top speed was  just 73mph. \nWhile the AJS men were the heroes of the hour after the \nJunior, they were not  without challengers during the  race. \nJim  Whalley on  his  Massey Arran was  in  the  running for \nmost of the time, but on  the  last lap suffered a front-wheel \npuncture at Windy Corner and  took a heavy fall.

Again there was talk of 80mph potential from some \nSenior bikes, with Freddie Dixon claiming 85mph from \nhis  Indian, which was a  single-cylinder model with a rear- \ninclined cylinder. Destined to  ruffle a  few feathers, how- \never, was Howard Davies, who was down to  ride his  ‘73 \nmiles-an-hour’ 350cc AJS in the  Senior race against all the \nothers mounted on  500s. \nThe Senior got under way in good conditions and  spec- \ntators were treated to  the  usual variations in riding styles, \nparticularly when cornering. Most leant in,  while some, \nincluding Freddie Dixon, often leant out, although earlier \nfoot-down styles had now been dropped. But it was  the  sit- \nup and neat cornering style of Howard Davies and his little \n350cc AJS that won the day after six laps and  226” miles of \nracing, adding over 3mph to the average race speed to make \nit 54.50mph and leading home the Indians of Freddie Dixon \nand Bert le Vack. Fastest lap went to  Freddie Edmond (Tri- \numph) at  56.40mph. \nNot all of the new ideas and machinery that manufactur- \ners  bring to  the  TT  are  successful, but few  fail on  the  scale \nof BSA in  1921. The Birmingham concern’s TT  debut was \na disaster, for  none of its six machines finished the race. \nWith speeds advancing, there were ever more people \nwho maintained that the  500cc Senior machines were too \nfast for the Mountain Course, and with his lower-powered, \nneat-handling 350  taking a Senior victory in  1921, Howard \nDavies probably added fuel to  their argument. Perhaps \nreflecting the  discontent around the  topic, one magazine \npicked up on  post-race gossip and wrote, ‘there was  talk in \nthe  Island of arranging next year’s TT  on  French soil, and \nthere is much to be said  in support of the  suggestion’, Oth- \ners  talked of the races going to  Ireland. \nBOMBSHELL! \nWhat \nhad \nbeen \ngossip \nabout \nmoving \nthe \nTT \nfrom \nthe \nIsle \nof \nMan \ntook \non \na \nfar \nmore \nserious \ntone \nin \nAugust \n1921, \nwhen \nthe \nACU \nCompetitions \nCommittee \npublicized \nits \nrecom- \nmendation \nthat \nthe \n1922 \nTT \nraces \nbe \nheld \non \na \n30-mile \nroad \ncircuit \nat \nSpa \nin \nBelgium. \nMuch \ndiscussion \nfollowed \nin \nwhich \nmany \nclaims \nand \ncounter-claims \nwere \nmade. \nThe \nbalance \nof \nopinion \nseemed \nto \nfavour \nthe \nmove \nto \nBelgium, \nbut \nat \nits \nmeeting \nin \nOctober, \nthe \nACU \nGeneral \nCommit- \ntee \nmeeting \nrejected \nthe \nrecommendation \nof \nits \nCompeti- \ntions \nCommittee. \nThis \nwas \na \nsurprise, \nfor \nit \nreally \nlooked \nAS  \nthough \nthe  \nTT \nhad \nbeen \nlost \nto  \nthe  \nIsland."

As far as \nthe  TT  course was concerned, it was  good news for riders \nto hear that the new surfacing now reached over 4 miles out \nfrom Douglas to  Crosby. \nIn a  small change of route, riders returned to  using the \noriginal private stretch of  road leading from Parliament \nSquare to  Cruickshanks Corner in Ramsey, which they had \nused up to  1914. It was  a change that must have saved time, \nfor  it was slightly shorter and eliminated a  couple of slow \ncorners. Also, what were described as  “big changes for the \nbetter’ had  been made on  sections of the  Mountain Road, \namongst them being substantial widening at Windy Corner \nand Keppel Gate. Everyone expected those improvements \nwould contribute to  faster lap speeds. \nEntries were slightly up in  1922, with thirty-two Light- \nweights, thirty-eight Juniors and sixty-seven Seniors, for \nwhich experienced top  riders like Davies, Dance, Dixon \nand Bennett were joined by three newcomers who were des- \ntined to go on  to  make TT history: Stanley Woods, Walter \nHandley and  Jimmy Simpson.

That is hardly surprising, for  with virtually \nno  racing experience and in his first TT, he  had just \ncompleted five mishap-strewn laps and 187  miles of the \nMountain Course, finishing in fifth place at an  average \nspeed of 50mph. \nReminiscences that his debut in  1922, ‘was the very first time \nI had ridden in a long-distance road race of any description’. \nThis was not  unusual, for apart from a few  races held over \nsomewhat shorter courses in  Ireland, there was nothing in \nBritain that offered riders the  type of road-racing experi- \nence that would be helpful in contesting the Isle of  Man  TT. \nDespite his lack of experience, Jimmy Simpson managed to \npersuade the  Scott concern to  provide him with a machine \nto race, while Stanley Woods talked the Cotton Motorcycle \nCompany into supplying him with a  machine. Woods had \ndone a lap when visiting the  TT  as  a spectator in  1921, but \nneither Simpson nor  Handley had been around the  course \nbefore setting out  on  their first lap of official practice. With \nSimpson it showed when he fell off near Governor's Bridge, \nthen ignored signals to  stop. Handley made TT  history by \nstarting off in  the  wrong direction on  his  first lap. Both \nfound themselves in trouble with the  race organizers. \nStanley Woods had a  most eventful ride on  his  350cc \nCotton, for  he  struck the  kerb at  Governor’s Bridge just \nbefore his refuelling stop, dislodging his exhaust pipe from \nthe engine and coming in for petrol with naked flames flick- \nering from the  exhaust port. There was no  requirement to \nstop the  engine while refuelling in those days and  with his \neager pit attendant a little careless, Woods and the  Cot- \nton  were suddenly engulfed in  flames.

Hastily fitting a  spare, he  continued, but \nlater lost the  use  of his  back brake. This meant he  had to \nrely on  the minuscule front brake visible in the photo. This \nwas not  enough to  slow him on  the  approach to  Ramsey \nHairpin, where he  took a  heavy fall. Picking himself up, \nhe  once more rejoined the  race and was glad to  see  the \nchequered flag, after an  exhausting 3 hours 50 minutes and \n33  seconds riding, in a creditable fifth place. No  one  could \nhave forecast that his  raw young racer would go on  to  win \nten  TT  races, finishing his  career with a  best race average \nspeed of 89mph. \nBy  1922 the Lightweight race was in  its  third year of \nrunning and was  awarded its own Tourist Trophy, while the \nprevious practice of awarding gold medals to  winners and \ntop finishers in each race was dropped and  silver replicas of \nthe  Tourist Trophy given instead. \nThere was  a good feeling running up to  the  1922 event, \nfor  factory competition departments had been busy and \nwere keen to  put their ideas to  the test of  TT racing. \nGrumbles could still be  heard about the  course not  being \nable to  handle 500s at  top speed, but most riders of 500cc \nmachines aimed to ride the TT course at less than full throt- \ntle,  because those who went flat  out  from the  start with \nwhat were still fairly fragile engines rarely made the finish. \nAlmost every winner’s post-race comments indicated how \nthey started carefully, nursed the  engine until mid-race, \nassessed their positions and then, only if necessary, finished \nat  full  throttle. \nRECORD SPEEDS \nRace week in  1922 was blessed with good weather \nthroughout, and riders responded to  a  year’s development \nof machines and improvements to  the  course with record \nspeeds in  all  classes. How much of that increased speed \ncould be  attributed to  the  hard work put into machine \ndevelopment and how much to course improvement, no  one \ncould say  for  certain. This combination of machine devel- \nopment, course improvements and, often, a  star rider’s \nefforts, was  to be the pattern of future TT speed increases. \nWhat was noticeable in  1922 was how the  top places \nwere distributed over a  wide number of manufacturers, \nwith five different makes among the  first seven finishers \nin  the  Senior (won by Alec Bennett on  a  Sunbeam), eight \ndifferent makes among the  first nine finishers in the Junior \n(won by Manxman Tom Sheard on  an  AJS), and  the  first \nsix  finishers all  riding different makes in  the  Lightweight \nGeoff Davison refuels his  Levis at the Pits. The job of the \nBoy Scouts was to  clean the rider’s side number plates. \n(won by Geoff Davison on  a  Levis). Those results would \nhave been pleasing to  manufacturers, for  it allowed more \nof them to  obtain publicity for their products. \nThe increase in  race speeds achieved in  1922 ranged \nfrom around 8 per  cent in  the  Senior to  over 10  per  cent \nin  the  Lightweight, but  what really grabbed public atten- \ntion was Alec Bennett’s new lap record in  the Senior at \n59.99mph. It meant that a 60mph lap was within touching \ndistance at  a  time when most ordinary people, including \nmany motorcyclists, still had no  idea what it  was like to \ntravel at  a  mile a  minute, let  alone to  average it  for  226 \nmiles while riding through towns, villages and over moun- \ntain and  moorland. \nMACHINE DEVELOPMENT \nRace machines were providing increased performance year \non  year at the TT and from the purely mechanical side, this \narose from both engine development and  improved general \nconstruction. However, Alec Bennett’s Senior race victory \nin  1922 came on a bike with an  established single-cylinder, \nside-valve, long-stroke engine measuring 77  X  105.5mm, \nat  a  time when there was a  trend to  use  a  shorter stroke. \nIt turned out  to  be  the  last  side-valve to  win a  TT. It had \nbeen \nrecognized \nfor \nsome \nyears \nthat \nthere \nwere \nperform- \nance \ngains \nfrom \nthe \nadoption \nof \noverhead \nvalves, \nbut \nit \nwas \nonly \nin \nthe \nearly \n1920s \nthat \nimproved \nvalve \nmaterial \ndid \naway \nwith \nthe \nsnapped \nvalves \nand \nsubsequent \nwrecked \nengines \nso \noften \nexperienced \nby \npioneers \nof \nthe \nohv \nlayout. \nMost \nvalves, \nsprings, \npushrods \nand \ntappets \nwere \nexposed, \nmaking \neffective \nlubrication \ndifficult, \nalthough \nthere \nwould \nbe \nsufficient \noil \nand \ngrease \naround \nto \nattract \ndirt \nand \ngrit. \nThis \nunpleasant \nmixture \ncould \neven \nbe \nenough \nto \naccelerate"

This was sometimes foot-operated. That \nsort of caution also extended to those running ohvy engines, \nwith riders known to  carry spare pushrods during a race. \nGearboxes were almost all  three-speed with hand- \nchange, but the two-speed Scotts utilized foot-change, \nwhile some Nortons were fitted with a form of foot-change \nthat lacked any positive-stop mechanism. Primary drive \nwas by exposed chain, and  most clutches were exposed to \ncounter the  build-up of heat in use. \nComponent suppliers continued to develop their products \nfor increased performance and reliability. This extended to \nchains, carburettors, tyres, sparking plugs and  magnetos. \nIn  respect of the  latter, ignition was universally by way of \nhigh-tension magneto.

If successful, then the  modification or  improve- \nment would usually be incorporated in the following year’s \nroad-going models. However, by 1923 there was a feel- \ning that the  machines produced to  challenge for  a  Tour- \nist  Trophy had lost their previous connection to  ‘the ideal \ntouring motorcycle’ for  which the event was originally \ncreated. They had, instead, become close to  out-and-out \nracing motorcycles. Writing some fifty years later in  his \nbook Racing Round the  Island, Bob Holliday attributed a \nchange of emphasis at the  event to  the  impact of Alec Ben- \nnett’s 59.99mph lap in  1922, saying, ‘Dramatically, from \nbeing a happy-go-lucky, free-for-all sporting adventure, the \nTT  had become serious, professional business.

Of the  increased speeds that followed, Bob Hol- \nliday wrote, ‘it  was the  speed aspect which gave the  TT \na  new life, transforming it into a  spectacle irresistible to \nmillions who have fallen under the spell of its unique, magi- \ncal attraction’. \nADVENTURE \nThe TT  has  always been a  great adventure for  both riders \nand spectators. Even getting to  the  island was exciting for \nthose with everyday working lives. Racers would mostly \ntake their bikes by train to  Liverpool and  push them from \nthe  ferry terminal to  the  landing stage, for  support vans \nwere a rarity. Spectators would ride their bikes to  the ferry \nfrom all over Britain. One persuasive advertisement of the \ntime rather underestimated the  problems associated with \neffecting passage by telling them: \nThere is  no  difficulty whatsoever in  getting the  motorcy- \ncle aboard at  Liverpool, and plenty of porters are  available \nshould no  pals be present to  assist up the gangway at  high \ntide. It is less easy to get it ashore at  Douglas, but here again \nthere are  porters in plenty, though it is wise to fix a  fee with \nthem before giving the  order. \nThere was  no  mention of how steep those gangplanks could \nbe  at  certain states of the  tide, nor of how slippery they \ncould become. \nOnce aboard, passengers hoped for  a  smooth crossing. \nUnfortunately, a  lot of the  sailings were anything but, and \nwith many of the  bikes making the  trip \non  the open decks, most riders were \nglad when that part of their TT  adven- \nture was Over. \nTUNERS \nManufacturing concerns who supported \nthe TT varied greatly in  size and this \noften dictated how they went about their \nracing. Some would set  aside a  small \narea at  their works and divert a  few of \ntheir most skilled workers to  preparing \nbikes for the TT in the weeks leading up \nto  the event, while a  select few could \nafford a  permanent race department. \nThere were even some small businesses \nwho took production bikes to  the  island \nand used the  two weeks of practice to \nturn them into race-ready machines. \nWhen it comes to  speed, there have \nalways been individuals who have been \nable to take a motorcycle and make it go faster than identical \nmachines from the same maker. Sometimes those men were \nto  be  found working for  a  particular manufacturer, but \noften they worked on  a  freelance basis. In the  1920s, many \nbased themselves at Brooklands, which was a hive of racing, \ndevelopment, testing and record-breaking. Previous men- \ntion has been made of Norton’s ace  tuner, Dan O’ Donovan, \nand among others who achieved fame as  tuners in the  1920s \nwere Bert Le Vack, Bill Lacey, Dougal Marchant, “Woolly’ \nWorters and Nigel Spring. Men like Le  Vack, who worked \nfor  several companies during the decade, had been top \nracers. All  had their tuning secrets, which might relate to \ncarburation, ignition, valve gear, fly-wheels or  other com- \nponents. They would even have pistons, valves, springs and \nthe  like  specially made out  of the newest metals of the  day. \nIt was  all part of their never-ending search for the speed and \nreliability that would bring their machines home at the head \nof the  field and  thus earn the retainers and bonus payments \nfrom the  trade that gave them a living. \n1923: IMPROVEMENTS AND \nDEVELOPMENTS \nEvery TT brings new mechanical developments, and \nin  1923 Douglas had redesigned their flat-twin engine, \nwhile Matchless returned to  the  event with a  350cc over- \nhead camshaft (ohc) model.

That did  not  happen, but  the  Manx MCC pressed \nahead and organized the  first Manx Amateur Road Race \nChampionship over the Mountain Course in  September \n1923. It was an  event that was completely separate from \nthe TT and one  that sought to distance itself from the grow- \ning commercialization, professionalism and specialization \nof the  TT. With a  change of title to  the  Manx Grand Prix \nin  1930, it runs to  this  day. \nCOMMERCIALIZATION \nIn  contrast to  the  ideals of the  Amateur races run by the \nManx MCC —  which itself had difficulties with defining and \nenforcing the  term ‘amateur’ —  The Isle  of Man Times wrote \nin  1924, ‘Let us  rid  our minds, once and for  all,  that the \nTT  races are  sport. They are  not. That idea was exploded \nyears ago, when the  present regime of the  ACU came into \npower. The whole series of races is  purely and simply a \nbusiness or  commercial proposition.’ That local newspa- \nper was merely stating what was obvious to  the motorcycle \nmanufacturers, hoteliers, the  motorcycle press, the  Steam \nPacket Company, local charabanc owners, publicans, Isle of \nMan Government and  the  many other concerns who expe- \nrienced financial gain from the TT. And it was  nothing new, \nfor as  far back as  1913, when the races seemed in jeopardy \nfollowing the  manufacturers’ boycott of the 1912 event, \ncolumnist ‘Ixion’ of The  Motor Cycle wrote, “The future of \nthe TT  is primarily a financial question’. \nConcentration on  the  commercial aspects by some ele- \nments involved in the  TT  has  not  prevented generations of \nroad racing enthusiasts from looking upon the  event as  a \ngreat sporting occasion. They learned to  love the  course, \nthe  top racers became their heroes, the  winning makes of \nmachine went to  the  top  of their wish lists and they were \nhappy to  part with their hard-earned cash to  support the \nevent. The TT was  an  annual adventure in speed for them, \nas  it was for those who competed. That is the  way it was in \nthe  1920s and, fortunately, that is the  way it is today, \n1924: SMOOTHER TIMES \nThe relationship between the TT  organizers and the  Isle  of \nMan authorities was still a  precarious one, with the  ACU \nmaking it known that they would like to  move the  event \nto  England, where it would make them money —  although \nparliamentary approval would be necessary to  close public \nroads —  while the  Manx authorities showed their dislike of \nthe ACU by giving minimum support in  the many areas \nwhere their cooperation was required.

The low figures for some of those races meant \nthere were hardly enough machines to  retain spectator \ninterest over a  37%4-mile lap, although the  acrobat antics \nof sidecar passengers while cornering certainly served to \nentertain. Due to  the  introduction of the  extra class, the \nfirst rider away in  practice left at  4.15am if it  was light \nenough, \nMuch money had been spent on  the  course and it  was \nalmost all  tar-sprayed. Riders were loud in  their praise for \nits  condition, but  still spoke of some ‘looseness’ in  places \non  the  Mountain, which was  also affected by long, shallow \nruts, which they called ‘tramlines’. \nOn the  run-up to  the TT there were the customary \nclaims of new and exotic racing engines under construc- \ntion, but  their manufacturers sometimes deemed it  pru- \ndent not  to  subject them to  this  most demanding of events. \nInstead, they brought modified versions of the  ones used \nin  1923. Press reports of the  day told of ‘engine efficiency \nhaving reached a high pitch’, although it was  a time when a \ncompression ratio of 7:1  was still considered too  high for a \n500 on  ordinary petrol. \nWhile larger firms built and developed their own \nengines, smaller concerns used proprietary power units \nfrom the likes of JAP, Blackburne and  Bradshaw, who pro- \nduced special versions for competition use. It was not  unu- \nsual for  seven or  eight different makes of motorcycle to  be \nusing JAP engines ina  TT race. \nHANDLING AND BRAKING \nIt was mentioned in  Chapter 1 how in  the  early years of \nMountain Course use, manufacturers recognized the  need \nto \ndevelop \nthe \nhandling \nqualities \nof \ntheir \nframes \nand \nforks \nto \ncope \nwith \nthe \npoor \ncondition \nof \nthe \ncourse \nand \nwith \nincreasing \npower \noutputs. \nThat \nneed \nwas \njust \nas \nimportant. \nin \nthe \npost-1920 \nperiod, \nwhen \nimproving \nroad \nconditions \nallowed \nthe \nuse \nof \ngreater \npower \nand \nso \nput \nmore \ndemands \non \nroad-holding. \nDevelopment \nin \nsuch \nareas \nthen \nrequired \nbrakes \nto \nbe \nuprated \nto \ncope \nwith \nthe \nhigher \nspeeds. \nStop- \nping \nwas \na \nhot \ntopic \nin \n1924, \nfor \nit \nwas \nrealized \nthat \nafter"

Taking this sweeping uphill right-hander as  fast  as \nthey dared, they would seek to  ride a classic line  from the \nleft  on  the  approach to  clip the  apex on  the  right and  then \nrun  out  to  the  left, avoiding running too  far because of the \nadverse camber, loose material and  substantial earth bank \non  the exit. With its long approach, it was  a bend that gave \nthem time to  build-up the  necessary ‘bottle’ to  take it on \ntheir personal limits. Apart from riding ability, speed was \nalso governed by the  solid bank on  the  apex, which jutted \nfurther into the road then than it does today. Some of the top \nriders were asked to estimate their speed through Hillberry \nand responded as  follows: Alec Bennett 60mph, Freddie \nDixon 55—60mph, Graham Walker 55mph, George Dance \n54—55mph, Tom Sheard 50—55mph. \nOnly the  previous year, when the  bend had still to  be \nproperly surfaced, a very impressed onlooker had described \nTommy \nde  \nla \nHay \ntackles \na \nloose-surfaced \nHillberry \non \nhis \nSunbeam. \nA  SPEEDY DECADE @  29 \nStanley Woods drifting through during his  winning ride \nin  the  Junior race and ‘throwing up  a  bow-wave of dirt \nand stone from his  wheels. All  through this giant slide at \nperhaps 60mph he was rock steady, master of his  machine \nand  himself.’ \nThat described the fastest corner, but what about the rac- \ning in 1924? Well, that too  was  the fastest, so  much so  that it \nis no  exaggeration to describe race and lap records as  having \nbeen ‘smashed’. Edwin Twemlow (New Imperial) lifted the \nLightweight lap record from 53.95mph to  58.28mph, while \nin the Junior race his brother Kenneth brought another New \nImperial into first place and  Jimmy Simpson lifted the  lap \nrecord from 59.59mph to  an  incredible 64.54mph. So  fast \nwas  Simpson’s best Junior lap that  it exceeded the  new lap \nrecord of 63.75mph set  by Freddie Dixon during his  ride \nto  third place in  the  Senior race. That was won by Alec \nBennett on  a  Norton, which, while still largely based on \ntheir standard Model 18, had been revitalized by the newly \nappointed Walter Moore. It was  the company’s first solo TT \nwin since 1907. The new Ultra Lightweights did  their best \nto join this festival of speed, with Jock Porter taking victory \non  his New Gerrard and setting the fastest lap at 52.61mph. \nOnly in  the  Sidecar race was the  previous record not  bro- \nken, Freddie Dixon’s fastest lap falling slightly short of the \n1923 figure and George Tucker taking another victory for \nNorton, using a  four-speed gearbox of their own design. \nIN  CONTROL \nIn what was  his  third year at  the  TT, Jimmy Simpson was \ndeveloping a reputation for being a fast rider capable of set- \nting lap records, but unable to bring his machine to  the fin- \nish.  It was  an  unwanted reputation that was  to grow through \nthe  rest of the 1920s and into the  1930s. By contrast, in \nwinning his  second Senior TT, Alec Bennett showed signs \nof why he would end the decade as  one  of the most success- \nful  and respected TT  riders. Of his  Senior ride in  1924, \nBennett told how he took absolutely no  chances during the \nrace and how he did not  use  more than three-quarter throt- \ntle  for  the  first four laps. Thereafter he  slightly increased \nhis pace in order to  keep second-placed man Harold Lang- \nman (Scott) at bay and finally triumphed by a margin of 11% \nminutes. \nTo  speedy Jimmy Simpson went the  glory of being the \nfastest over one  lap, but to  Alec Bennett went victory, the \nright to  hold aloft the  magnificent Senior Tourist Trophy \nin  front of cheering crowds and the  substantial winning \nbonuses from his  entrant and the  trade. Norton were jus- \ntifiably pleased with the  result and with the  subsequent \nincrease in  demand for  the  Model 18  roadsters, priced at \n£80."

It was the  New Imperial team \nthat introduced a basic flag-signalling system for its  riders \nas  they passed the pits on  a non-stop lap. In essence, if a red \nflag was shown from the  ‘New Imp’ pit the rider was  being \ntold to  go  faster, while if a  yellow was displayed, things \nwere OK and he was to  maintain the  same pace. \nAmongst the newcomers to the  1924 TT races was Irish- \nman Joe Craig. He was aman who was to exercise consider- \nable control over the racing activities of the Norton marque \nin later years. \n1925: THE ROARING \nTWENTIES \nThis was the expression used to \ndescribe the increased dynamism \nof the  decade’s social, artistic and \ncultural activities and it  was also \napplicable to  the  racing of motor- \ncycles at the  TT, particularly in the \nmiddle years. \nThings were moving on  apace \nin  several directions at  the Island \nraces, with the  whole of the  Moun- \ntain Course finally tar-sprayed and \nqualifying times in the Lightweight, \nJunior and Senior classes reduced to \n55,  50  and  45  minutes. AJS came \nwith a  500cc engine, firms like \nBOS Velocette, Norton and New Hudson \nadopted dry sump lubrication, and \na \nmore responsive engines encour- \naged the occasional use  of twist-grip \nthrottles. Wired-on tyres fitted to \nwell-base rims were in  general use \nand ever more technical advances \nwere incorporated in  the twenty- \nseven makes of machine entered for \nthe  five  TT  races of 1925. \nThe man who came roaring back \nto  form in  1925 was Howard Day- \nies, abetted by record-breaking \nperformances from Wal Handley, \nJimmy Simpson, Edwin Twemlow \nand, on  three-wheels, Len Parker. \nDavies’ previous TT  performances \nincluded second place in his first TT \nof 1914, plus first and second places \nin  1921. However, the  six  races in \nwhich he  rode between 1922 and \n1924 brought six  retirements. Tired of this, he set  to  after \nthe  1924 event to  build his  own idea of what a motorcycle \nshould be,  giving the  finished product his  initials, HRD. \nAimed at the higher end  of the  roadster market and priced \naccordingly, \nit \nwas \nno \nsurprise \nwhen \nhe \nbrought \nracing \nver- \nsions \nto \nthe \nisland, \nfor \nhimself \nand \nemployee \n‘Harry’ \nHarris \nto tackle the Junior and  Senior races. \nRegarded \nby \nthe  \npress \nas  \n‘a \ndark \nhorse’ \nwith \nhis  \nbrand \nnew \nblack-and-gold \nracers, \nDavies \nhad \nthe \nadvantage \nof \nbeing \nchosen \nby \ntuner \nBert \nLe \nVack \nto \nuse \nhis \nspecially \nprepared \npushrod \nJAP \nracing \nengines, \nand \nhe \nproved \na \nshrewd \nchoice. \nTaking \na \nfine \nsecond \nplace \nto \nWal \nHandley"

Howard’s left hand is resting on  the \nshoulder of tuner Bert Le Vack. \nin the Junior, where Handley lifted the  race average speed \nby almost 10mph to  65.02mph and raised the  lap record \nto  65.89mph, Davies shocked the established opposition in \nthe  Blue Riband Senior TT  by riding his  new machine to \nvictory at  a  race average speed of 66.13mph, leaving the \nspeedy Jimmy Simpson to  take the lap record at  68.97mph \nbut again fail  to  record a finish. \nHoward Davies raced in  some style, for  a  report of the \ntime told how at  his  pit stop he  ‘had a  hurried drink of \nchampagne and  went off again feeling quite refreshed’. \nThe 1925 TT  was run in  front of record crowds and \nproved a  triumph for  single-cylinder proprietary engines, \nwith only Len Parker’s sidecar-winning Douglas twin being \nfitted with the  maker’s own power unit. The HRD was \n‘typical of the  small concerns of the  time, having a  JAP \nengine, Burman gearbox, Binks carburettor, Webb forks \nand with hubs, rims, magneto, mudguards, chains, tyres, \nplugs and so  on  also supplied by others. In  the  case of the \nHRD, this  assembly of components was  backed by a  sound \nbasic design, resulting in a motorcycle that was  also attrac- \ntive to  the  eye, with its  early use  of the  saddle-type petrol \ntank rather than the  customary flat-tank mounted under \nthe top frame rail. \n1926: EVER FASTER \nCome \n1926, \nthe  \nSidecar \nTT  \nwas \ndropped \nfrom \nthe  \npro- \ngramme \nof \nraces \ndue, \nsome \nsay, \nto \nmanufacturers’ \nopposi- \ntion \nto  \nthe \ngymnastics \nperformed \nby \npassengers \nwhile \ncor- \nnering, \nwhich \nwas  \ntotally \nout  \nof \nstep \nwith \nhow \nthey \nwished \nsidecar \noutfits \nto  \nbe  \nportrayed \nto  \nthe  \nbuying \npublic. \nThe \nA  SPEEDY DECADE @  31 \nUltra Lightweights were also dropped, in  their case due to \nlack of entries and  thus lack of spectacle. This left  a  three- \nrace TT meeting, for  500cc Senior, 350cc Junior and  250cc \nLightweight machines. \nSince the  TT  restarted after the  First World War, it had \ntaken just five years for the  Senior lap record to  climb from \n55.62mph in  1920 to  68.97mph in  1925, an  increase of \nsome 25  per  cent. The Junior lap record had increased by \nnearly 30  per cent over the same period, and the Light- \nweights’ by 40  per cent. One effect of  those improved \nrace and lap times was to  narrow the  differential between \nclasses, with times set by the Juniors not  far behind the Sen- \niors. As people were no  longer protesting about 500s being \ntoo  fast for the course, it seemed clear that the speed of the \n350s had  been increasing at  a  greater rate than the  500s’, \nfor which estimated maximum speeds of 90mph were now \nbeing quoted. \nMany would conclude from these figures that motor- \ncycles were growing increasingly successful in  challeng- \ning the  TT  course, but  that would not  be the  view of half, \nand  sometimes two-thirds, of the  entry, who customarily \nfailed to  finish a race. The 1926 Senior TT  saw  twenty-two \nfinishers out of fifty-seven starters, which indicated that \nwhile there may have been progress in many directions, the \nMountain Course was  still a formidable adversary. So much \nso,  that there was opposition to  the decision to  increase the \nrace distance from six  to  seven laps for  all  classes in  1926 \n—  which amounted to  264'% racing miles. As well as  taxing \nthe  machines, the  extra lap meant another 30-plus minutes \nin the saddle for riders; on  the eve  of the  1926 TT the fastest \nlap time stood to Jimmy Simpson in  32 minutes 50 seconds, \nat  a  speed of 68.97mph. \nNO  ALCOHOL \nIn the  mid-1920s the world was  already beginning to  ques- \ntion where future supplies of petrol were to  come from, \nand alcohol was being spoken of as  a  potential substitute. \nIndeed, several countries of  the British Commonwealth \nwere identified as  able to  grow crops on  the  scale needed \nto  allow alcohol to  be  derived from them in  large quan- \ntities. Despite that, a  decision was taken to  ban the  use \nof alcohol-based fuels at  the 1926 TT, meaning that only \npetrol and  petrol/benzole mixtures were permitted. This \nmeant using lower compression ratios than with alcohol, \nand  works Nortons were running at  6.4:1. \nThe effect of the ban was  mixed. JAP engines were prob- \nably affected more than most, for  much of their develop- \nment was done at Brooklands, where the use  of alcohol was \ncommon, Certainly, the  JAP name was not  so  often seen \namong the  top  finishers in  subsequent TTs, although the"

As an  indication of the way that speeds were increas- \ning on  road and  track, HRD’s HD  90 model was  marketed \nas  a 90mph roadster. \nDuring the mid-1920s, several manufacturers found that \nthe combination of increased speeds and use  of larger brakes \ncreated front fork and  brake problems. This was typical of \nthe  lessons learnt from going TT  racing with ever faster \nmotorcycles. \n1927: COMMUNICATION \nThe world of the  late 1920s was very different from today \nwhen it came to publicizing and reporting on  the TT. Radio \nwas in  its  infancy, telephones were for  the  privileged and \nmost relied on  the  printed word, principally those in  the \nweekly magazines The  Motor Cycle and Motor Cycling. New \nat  the  1927 event was the  newspaper The  TT Special. Con- \ntaining full race reports and edited by 1922 Lightweight \nTT  winner Geoff Davison, it \nappeared for  sale on  the  island \nimmediately after each race \nand could be posted anywhere \nin  the  world. Later to  include \neditions covering each practice \nsession, it went on  to  become a \nTT  institution. \nThe mainstream national \npress largely ignored the TT \nunless they wished to  criticize \nit, and in  1927 occurred a trag- \nedy that they seized on.

He  was entitled to  his  view, but \nit was not  shared by riders who had  to  race for  seven laps. \nTop runners on  500cc machines were in the  saddle for just \nunder four strenuous hours. Lesser 500 riders took much \nlonger and  riders of 250s took longer still. \nThe roads of the TT course may have been tar-sprayed in \ntheir entirety, but  in  many cases this was done over exist- \ning surfaces with very basic foundations. While they were \ncertainly an  improvement over the  earlier unmade roads, \nthe wear caused by growth in ordinary traffic and  increase \nin  race speeds accentuated bumps, of which there were \nplenty. Oliver Langton rode to  seventh place in  the 1927 \nSenior race and told how course conditions were such that \nhe had to summon all his courage on  the very bumpy Cronk \ny Voddy straight, before taking a hand off the  handlebar to \noperate the  hand gearchange of his  New Hudson. On  such \nrigid-framed machines with basic girder front forks, it was \nstill a physical challenge to  ride ever faster over roads that \nwere nowhere near today’s standard in  width, finish and \nsmoothness. \nEASING THE PACE \nThere was an  influx of ohc  motors to  the  1927 TT  to  join \nthe forerunners of previous years, including examples from \nBlackburne, AJS and Norton. The new Walter Moore- \ndesigned 500cc CSI engine from Norton was allocated \nto  previous Senior TT  winners Alec Bennett and Stanley \nWoods to  race, while two ohv engines were used by the \nother Norton works entries, Joe  Craig and  Jimmy Shaw. \nThe 1927 Nortons also came with a  new cradle frame, \n8in-diameter brake drums front and  rear and  a new saddle \ntank. The new ohc engine was said  to  be capable of 95mph \nand, \nwhen \ntimed \non \nSulby \nStraight, \nStanley \nWoods \nclocked \n93.7mph. \nThe \ncustomary \nsetting \nof \nnew \nrecord \nrace \nand \nlap \nspeeds \ncontinued \nacross \nall \nclasses \nin  \n1927, \nbut  \nin  \nthe  \nJunior \nand \nSenior \nraces \nthe \npace \nof \nincrease \neased \nto \nabout \nImph, \nA  SPEEDY DECADE @  35 \nAlec Bennett rode his  new CS|-engined Norton to \nvictory in the 1927 Senior TT.

The new ohe  Norton delivered a \nwin in the  Senior, where Stanley Woods looked as  though \nhe was going to  walk away with victory on  the  new model \nuntil, with a lead of several minutes, he struck clutch trou- \nble  and saw first place go to  team mate Alec Bennett. This \nmade Bennett the  only man to  win Senior TT  races with \nsv,  ohv  and  ohc  engines. To  Woods went the  fastest lap of \n70.90mph, while second place went to  rising star Jimmy \nGuthrie on  a  New Hudson. \nFreddie Dixon took victory in  the Junior on  a  JAP- \npowered HRD. Working for  JAP at  the  time, there was \nno  doubt that Dixon hand-picked and prepared his  engine \nto  ensure that it was the best available. Lightweight victory \nwent to Wal Handley (Rex-Acme), and here the increase in \nrace average speed was greater, rising by some 5 per  cent \nfrom 60.20 to  63.30mph, with Luigi Archangeli (Moto \nGuzzi) finishing second. \nRacing motorcycles of this era  were not  fitted with rev \ncounters and riders had  to  estimate when to  change gear, \nor  wait for  valve-float, something which the  increasingly \ncommon ohc design helped to reduce with its better control \nof opening and  closing of valves. \n1928: ROADS CLOSED \nCome the 1928 TT, riders welcomed the  new closing of \nroads to  other traffic during practice periods, which were \nspread over twelve days.

Unusually, the  island was blessed with good \nweather for  the entire practice period. Not everything \nwas perfect, however, with riders reporting the  roads to \nbe bumpy. \nExperienced onlookers detected improved road-hold- \ning  as  a  feature of practice, particularly on  corners. No \ndoubt further attention had  been given to frame design and \nby now there was a  general adoption of saddle-tanks and \nlow seat height. Velocette experimented with rear-spring- \ning, said to  be  ‘built under Draper patents’ and involv- \ning exposed, inclined springs under the  seat giving some \n3  inches of  movement. They increased rear tyre size \nfrom 2.75 to  3.00 and also introduced a  positive-stop \nfoot gearchange, for  their four-speed gearbox. Similar \npositive-stop change mechanisms were adopted by most \nmanufacturers in  following years. As  well as  doing away \nwith the  need for  a  rider to  take his  hand off the  handle- \nbars while changing gear, they allowed a  quicker change \nand thus saved the  rider more seconds a lap. It really was \ndifficult to  keep track of  the many gradual machine \nimprovements, each one  contributing to  the  chipping away \nof lap times. \nA WET SENIOR RACE \nIn the  late 1920s TT  races were always run  to  their sched- \nuled times, whatever the  weather. There was no  question \nof delaying the  start by an  hour to  allow mist to  clear from \nthe  Mountain or  to  let the roads dry. When the customary \nmaroon was discharged at  the  start, no. 1 pushed off for \nsome four hours of racing, followed by the remainder of the \nfield at specified intervals. \nThere had been relatively few wet TT races, but the  1928 \nSenior was a  shocker, with rain for most of the  time. Vic- \ntory went to  Charlie Dodson (Sunbeam), even though he \nhad a major fall at  Keppel Gate on  lap six and split his crash \nhelmet from top to  bottom. That spill lost him the  lead to \nGraham Walker (Rudge), but  the  Rudge failed with less \nthan half a lap to go.  Dodson came home the winner, trail- \ning the rear stand broken in his crash. Two other new names \namongst the placemen were George Rowley (AJS) in second \nand  Tommy Hatch (Scott) in third. Almost inevitably, the \nfastest lap went to  Jimmy Simpson (AJS), but  race and  lap \nspeeds were well down from those set  in  dry conditions, \nThe Junior was  won by Alec Bennett on  a Velocette and  he \nbroke both race average and  lap records by a small amount, \nhis new race record being faster than that set in the previous \nyear’s Senior and  the  lap record going over 70mph, for the \nfirst time for  a  350. It was his  fifth TT  victory —  another \nrecord \nfor \nthe  \ntime. \nFrank \nLongman \nwon \nthe  \nLightweight \non  \nan  \nOK-Supreme \nat  \nslightly \nless \nthan \nthe  \nprevious \nyear’s \nrecord-breaking \nspeeds. \nSTRIP-DOWN \nAfter \neach \nrace, \nit  \nwas \na  \nrequirement \nfor  \nthe  \nengines \nof \nthe \nfirst \nthree \nfinishers \nto \nbe \nstripped \nand \nmeasured \nin \nthe \npresence \nof race \nofficials. \nThe \npress \nwere \nalso \ngiven \nan \nopportunity \nto \nview \nthe \ndismantled \nengines \nand \nthey \npublished \nthe \nresults \nof \nwhat \nthey \nsaw, \nmaking \ncomment \non \nvalve \nsprings, \npiston \nrings, \ncarbon \ndeposits \nand \npiston \ncolour, \nplus \nfurther \nobservations \nabout \nthe \nstate \nof chains, \nbrakes, \ntyres, \noil \ntightness \nand \nso \non. \nAfter \nthe \n1928 \nSenior, \nboth \nthe \nfirst \nand \nsecond \nplace \nSunbeams \nwere \nseen \nto have \nbroken \npiston \nrings. \nThe experienced AJS concern did  not  have to  submit \ntheir engines after the  Junior race, for, having made a \nlate  decision to  change the  make of valve springs, five  AJS \nmachines retired from the  race with broken springs. \nSPEED OR  TIME? \nWhile year on  year changes and improvements to  the \nMountain Course continued to  help reduce the  time taken \nto  complete a  lap, after the major road-surfacing prog- \nramme of  1923—5 it  was the better engines, improved \nhandling, stronger braking and  general machine improve- \nments that contributed most to  the  speed increases of the \nlate 1920s. \nThere was no  doubt that the  primary TT  interest of the \npress, spectators and post-race advertising was  in the speeds \nachieved. During the  1920s this information was conveyed \nby the  published lap speeds and race average speeds and it \nwas from those that the  public deduced what happened in \na race, using the figures to  fuel  their imaginations as  to  the \nskill and daring shown on track. For all the concentration on \nspeed, there was little hard information as  to  actual speed \nachieved at  specific locations, and  when speeds were men- \ntioned, they were usually estimated. As  an  example, most \npeople recognized that the drop from the Fifth Milestone to \nThe Highlander was one  of the  fastest parts of the  course, \nalthough in  1929 it was neither as  straight nor  as  smooth as \nit \nis \ntoday. \nA \nreport \nin \nMotor \nCycling \nat \nthe \ntime \nconcluded, \n‘generally speaking, of the  faster machines —  and many \nwere \ndoing \nabout \n95 \nto \n100mph \n— \nthe \nNortons \nseemed \nto \nbe \nthe \nsteadiest’. \nIt \nwent \non \nto \ndescribe \nStanley \nWoods’ \nand \nJimmy \nSimpson’s \ntreatment \nof \nthe \nbumps \nthere, \ntelling \nhow \nthey \n‘executed \nprodigal \naerial \nfeats’. \nThere \nwere \nstill \nplenty \nof \nlocations \non \nthe \ncourse \nwhere \nmachines \nbecame \nairborne \nand, \nover \nseven \nlaps, \neach \nlanding \ngave \na \nsevere \ntest \nto \nthe \nrigid-frames of the  day."

      "text": "Race and lap  speeds were still \nclimbing, but the really impor- \ntant information for riders came \nnot  from quoted speeds, but  from \ntheir lap times. What they wanted \nto  know after every practice lap or \nrace was  whether machine improve- \nments and their riding skills had \nreduced the time taken to  cover the \n37°% miles of the  Mountain Course. \nFor  them, lap time was the  bench- \nmark, not lap speed. At the approach \nto the  1929 TT, the fastest lap times \nstood to  Stanley Woods in the  Sen- \nior  class at  31  minutes 54  seconds \n(70.90mph) and  to  Alec Bennett in \nthe Junior at  32 minutes 13 seconds \n(70.28mph). In  the Lightweight it \nwas shared by Frank Longman and \nAlec Bennett at  35  minutes and 8 \nseconds (64.45mph). \n1929: END OF A DECADE \nAs practice opened for the  1929 TT, road conditions were \nsaid to  be  very good. Among the  machine developments \nwas a  general stiffening of construction, which, as  well as \napplying to  frames and  cycle parts, extended to  things like \nwebbing to  crankcases and bulking-up of engine compo- \nnents. Such alterations were said to  be  required to  cope \nwith increased power and speed, although it was acknowl- \nedged that they increased overall machine weight. \nAs  practice progressed, the  road-holding of the  works \nNorton, Sunbeam and Velocettes received praise, recorded \nlap speeds were high and accidents were few. It  was not \njust increases in maximum speeds that were bringing faster \nlap speeds, for positive-stop foot-change mechanisms were \nspreading and were reckoned to  save many seconds a lap. \nAlso, Norton had at  last moved from lever to  twist-grip \nthrottles and also claimed to  have improved their engine \npick-up, which saved further seconds when pulling away \nfrom tricky spots like  Ramsey Hairpin and the  Gooseneck. \nOn race day Charlie Dodson (Sunbeam) took his second \nSenior TT  win in  far  better weather than his  first win in \n1928 and  at  a race average speed 10mph faster. While that \nprovided a very real indication of how the weather can  play \nhavoc with race speeds, there must have been other fac= \ntors involved; Dodson lopped 1 minute 7 seconds off the \nprevious \nbest \nlap \ntime, \nwhich \nhad \nalso \nbeen \nset \nin \nthe \ndry \nin \n1927, \nraising \nthe \nspeed \nto \n73.55mph. \nSunbeam \nalso \ntook \nthe  team prize, for the  third year in succession. \nA  SPEEDY DECADE @  37 \nS. Jackson races through the narrow main street of Kirk Michael in  1929. \nIn only his second year at the TT, Freddie Hicks brought \nhis Velocette home first in the Junior, reducing the lap time \nby 18  seconds and increasing the  lap speed to  70.95mph. \nThe 350s had  narrowed the  speed margin between them- \nselves and  the  500s in  the  second half of the  1920s, but  it \nnow looked as  though the  500s were holding them at  bay, \nwith machines like the  Norton CS1 reputed to  give 28bhp \nand  almost 100mph. \nAfter a  TT  apprenticeship that started back in  1922, \nSyd Crabtree provided the  Excelsior marque with its  first \nTT  victory in  the  1929 Lightweight race. Still fitted with \nhand gearchange, the  Excelsior did  have four speeds and \n8in-diameter brake drums, which were noticeably large for \na  250. Pietro Ghersi led  the  race for  five laps on  his  rapid \nMoto Guzzi before retiring, and he  knocked 1 minute 10 \nseconds off the previous fastest lap time, setting a  new fig- \nure  of 66.63mph. \nSPEEDS \nBefore leaving the 1920s, a  look at  the  growth in  speeds \nachieved between 1920 and 1929 shows that it really justi- \nfied the title ofa speedy decade, for lap times increased every \nyear in  all  classes except when affected by wet weather. \nFastest lap speeds in the  Senior class went from 55.62mph \nto 73.55mph, representing growth of 32 per cent. That was \nto  be  the  highest percentage rate of growth in  TT  history \nfor the class, much of it deriving from the vast  improvement \nto  road surfaces in the  first half of the  decade."

Through \nthe  1920s many of the manufacturers who achieved a Senior \nTT  victory received a civic welcome and  celebration when \nthey returned to their home towns. There the Tourist Tro- \nphy, together with the  race-winning machines and  riders, \nwere publicly feted in  recognition of the  glory brought to \nthe  area by the  win. However, despite its  prestige, some \nHenry Tyrell-Smith fell  from his  Rudge at  Glen Helen when leading the 1929 Senior \nTT. After a delay, he  remounted and carried on  with three cracked ribs to  take third \nclaimed that not  all was well \nwith the event and in  the \naftermath of the  1929 races, \nthe respected and influen- \ntial  magazine The  Motor Cycle \nquestioned the  future of the \nTT, using headlines like ‘A \nCrisis in  the  History of the \nSport’ and  even asking ‘Will \nthere be another TT?’ \nLooking back, it  seems \nthat The Motor Cycle could not \ncome to  terms with the  fact \nthat the nature of the TT had \nchanged. No  longer was the \nprimary aim of  competing \nmanufacturers to develop \ntheir ‘ideal touring motorcy- \ncles’ from the machines they \nraced —  which is what the TT \nwas originally created for. \nInstead, they knew that the \nTT was by now a sporting \nspectacle of speed, for which \nthey had to  develop special- \nized racing models. Through \nthe 1920s it  had been seen \nthat success in  TT racing \nenhanced a  manufacturer’s name and brought increased \nsales of his  road-going machines. Such a  spin-off extended \nto more than just the winning marque, for a top ten  placing \nwas held in high regard and even entering the  TT  brought \nbenefits to  a manufacturer’s image. \nThere was still knowledge to  be gained from racing that \ncould be used to  the benefit of roadsters, but that was  now \nseen as  a  bonus, rather than the  primary purpose of com- \npeting. However, racing was an  expensive business, and at \nthe  end  of the  1920s the  world was feeling the  effect of an \neconomic recession, which even a  TT  win could not  over- \ncome with increased sales. Some manufacturers could no \nlonger afford to  develop special race machines and  perhaps \nit was those that The Motor Cycle had  in mind when it advo- \ncated that the  event be remodelled."

To  this \nend, in  1930 it belatedly offered financial support to  the \nevent, allocating a  sum of £5,000, of which £3,500 went \nto  attracting and  paying the  expenses of foreign riders and \n£1,500 to  supplement prize money. The latter was set  at \n£200 to the winning entrant and £50 to the winning rider, \nwith entry fees of £33. \nThere were eleven ‘foreign’ entries, plus thirteen ‘colo- \nnials’ in  1930. They were part of the  total entry of around \n135  across the  three races, to  be run  on  Monday, Wednes- \nday and Friday of race week. Almost all were riding British- \nbuilt machines, with many on  KTT Velocettes, which Bob \nHolliday described as  the  first ‘over-the-counter’ replicas \nof race-winning motorcycles to  be  marketed. The ‘Velo’ \nwas an  honest 350cc race bike of which Titch Allen wrote \n‘nothing was  added for effect or for sales appeal and nothing \nwas omitted for price cutting’. \nDespite the previous year’s suggestions by The Motor Cycle \nthat radical change was required for the  event, demand for \nrides in  1930 suggested that contestants were content with \nthe existing arrangements.

Norton had  been \nabsent from the podium places since Alec Bennett’s Senior \nwin in  1927, but  with a  much-modified ohc engine from \nArthur Carroll and Joe Craig, they were hoping to get back \nto winning ways. Velocette had a longer-stroke engine, AJS \nreturned with its  chain-driven ohc models in  both Senior \nand  Junior classes, while, in addition to  its  single-cylinder \nengines, JAP had a 500cc twin available, which was  used by \nthe  Excelsior, Cotton and OK Supreme concerns. \nMagnesium alloy was starting to  be used to  save weight. \nThere was also a  trend for  brake-drums to  be  ribbed to \naid  cooling, while the  customary copper pipes that con- \nducted oil and petrol around the outside of the engine were \nbeing replaced by armoured rubber versions to  aid reliabil- \nity.

Pre-TT rumours of the  appearance of supercharged \nengines in 1931 proved mostly unfounded, although Harold \nWillis did  take a  supercharged Velocette out  for a  lap dur- \ning practice. \nThe general growth in speeds meant that mid-race mend- \ning of punctures and other roadside repairs were largely a \nthing of the  past, particularly for  potential winners. Race \nbikes no  longer carried tool boxes, although some riders \nstill thrust a couple of spare sparking plugs in a pocket and \na plug spanner down a riding boot. \nWHERE’S THAT? \nThe \nnaming \nof \nparts \nof \nthe  \ncourse \nwas \nnot  \nas  \nclear \nas  \nit \nis  \ntoday \nand \nreports \nof \nthe  \ntime \nsaying \nthat \n‘Glen \nHelen \nhad \nbeen \neased \noff \nat  \nthe  \ntop’ \nand \n‘Creg \nWilley’s \nCorner \nmuch \nwidened’, \nwere \nboth \nprobably \nreferring \nto  \nworks \nat \nON lS \neS i RP \nSY ee \nfo  Mee \nCharlie Dodson takes Hillberry at  speed in  1932. \nwhat today is known as  Sarah’s Cottage. One ACU official \nthought that particular ‘easing’ would save riders two or \nthree seconds a lap, for  it also included widening of Creg \nWyllies. The stretch between Ballaugh and Sulby was said \nto  have been relaid, while that from the  Black Hut to  Creg \nny Baa  had  been resurfaced. At  Brandish, the  ditch on  the \noutside had been filled and the  road widened, and  riders \nclaimed they could now take it 8—10mph faster than before. \nThe last improvement contributed to  riders achieving \nincreased speed on  the  approach to  Hillberry, which Gra- \nham Walker and Alec Bennett said was  now 100mph, while \nHillberry itself was taken at  7Omph. Their opinions of \nspeeds at other locations in  1931 were: Bray Hill 100mph, \nQuarter Bridge 35mph, Braddan Bridge 45—50mph, Bal- \nlacraine 40mph, Ballaugh Bridge 50mph, Sulby Bridge \n45mph, the Bungalow 40mph, Windy Corner 50mph, \nKate’s Cottage (they still  called it Keppel Gate) 80mph and \nCreg ny Baa  40mph. \nPRACTICE \nRiders used the  early morning practice periods to  work \nup  to  race speed, but  attitudes to  practice varied.

Those with a more serious approach would put in as \nmany as  three laps each morning, perhaps four, often stop- \nping at the  pits between laps to  make adjustments. \nRaces were still run over seven laps and riders custom- \narily made two pit stops, meaning that one of their riding \nsessions during a race would be a non-stop three laps. Dur- \ning one practice session in  1931 Jimmy Simpson claimed \nto  have put in  four laps without stopping. This would have \nbeen of concern to  others, for Norton were already show- \ning good form in practice and  if they were able to  get away \nwith only one pit-stop during the  race, they would save \nanother 40—45 seconds. \nRACING \nJoe  Craig had  been working as  competitions manager of \nNorton for  almost two years, and his  efforts with much- \nmodified ohc  engines finally met with success at  the  1931 \nTT.

Rudge had  all but  swept the  board \nin  the  Senior and  Junior events of  1930 and  Norton cop- \nied their winning ways in  1931, leaving Rudge to  take one \nthird place in the Junior, although their 250s did  take first \nand second places in the Lightweight, with Graham Walker \nachieving his  first TT  win. But  it was young Percy ‘Tim’ \nHunt who rode his Model 30 (500cc) and Model 40 (350cc) \nNortons to record-breaking victories in the Senior and Jun- \nior  TTs, the  first time such a double had  been achieved. \nRiders had to  contend with the  vagaries of the  Manx \nweather during racing in  1931, for in the Junior race a gale \nblew \ndown \nthe \nMountain \nand \nin \nthe \nSenior \nit \nblew \nthem \nup. \nThis \nplayed \nhavoc \nwith \ntheir \nchoice \nof \ngearing, \nbut  \nthose \nwith \nfour-speed \ngearboxes \nwere \nlikely \nto  \nhave \nfared \nbetter \nthan \nthe  \nthree-speeders. \nNorton, \nhaving \npreviously \nrelied \non \nthree \nspeeds, \nnow \nreaped \nthe \nbenefit \nof \nhaving \na \nnew \nfour-speeder. \nIt was another year of substantial advancement in  both \nrace average and lap speeds, with machine development \nmaking the major contribution to the setting of new  records \nin  all  classes. Jimmy Simpson (Norton) became the  first \nto  break the  80mph barrier, when he  went round on  his \n500  at  80.82mph. ‘Tim’ Hunt lifted the  Junior record to \n75.27mph and Graham Walker put almost 5mph onto the \nLightweight lap record, lifting it from 66.86 to  71.73mph— \nan  astonishing achievement. It was also another year when \nthe  leader board was  monopolized by British machines and \nriders, with names like Guthrie, Woods, Nott, Mellors, \nTyrell-Smith and Handley taking the  podium places. The \nlast-named rider failed to  complete the  Senior, however, \nafter falling at  the  bend some half a mile past the  Eleventh \nMilestone, which now carries his  name. While foreign \nmachines and  riders were present, they made relatively lit- \ntle impression on  race results. \nThe BBC made time to  broadcast a  limited account of \nthe  Senior TT  in  1931, which provided good publicity for \nmanufacturers and  the  event. It was something the  corpo- \nration allocated more time to  in  the  years that followed, \neventually transmitting TT reports worldwide and helping \ndevelop what was becoming a global fan base. \n1932: TECHNICAL ADVANCES \nThe island welcomed the  TT  back in  1932 \nand works teams set  up  their temporary \nworkshops in  local premises belonging to \nhotels, garages, engineers and even under- \ntakers. Others with business at the TT, like \ntrade representatives, would base them- \nselves in hotels, where their contact details \nwould be  publicized in  local newspapers \nand the motorcycle magazines, The TT \nSpecial advised, for  example, that Reuben \nHarveyson was  at the Castle Mona Hotel on \nbehalf of Ferodo, while Sid  Burns, of the \nNorton riders like Stanley Woods \nbecame frequent visitors to the  winners \nenclosure during the 1930s.

This spurred \nother makers to work on  improving handling over the ensu- \ning winter but, as  ever in  the  racing game, Norton also \nworked to  stay ahead of the opposition on  the road-holding \nfront, coming to  the  1932 TT  with front forks fitted with \nextended links and new damper springs to  aid the previous \nsingle spring. They also made use  of new magnesium alloy \n(elektron) crankcases and other weight-saving measures, \nwhich resulted in  the  500 weighing in  at  312]b (142kg), \nwhile the 350 was said to  be  298lb (135kg). Both came \nwith larger-capacity petrol tanks and, like virtually eve- \nryone else, now used 14mm sparking plugs instead of the \nearlier 18mm type. \nBurman, Albion and  Sturmey-Archer could supply four- \nspeed gearboxes, while Velocette redesigned their own \nbox. Some firms were said to  be  experimenting with the \nuse  of plain bearing big-ends, others were modifying their \nlubrication systems, and  Rudge decided to  stick with its use \nof coupled brakes. Almost every rider now used a  twist- \ngrip-type throttle; returning Alec Bennett \nstill prefered the  old  lever type, but  set  to \nself-return. \nThere had  been a  considerable fall  in  sales \nof new motorcycles in  the early 1930s and \nmanufacturers who went to  the  expense of \nTT  racing were all  hoping for  good results. \nThese would bring favourable publicity and \nApproaching Sulby Crossroads, part-way \ndown the Sulby Straight, in the 1930s. \nFAST FOREIGNERS @  43 \nboost sales, for  motorcyclists of the  time were impressed \nby Isle  of Man performances and  enjoyed having the  name \nof a TT-winning bike on  the  tank. There were over twenty \nmakes competing, including a  first entry of Jawas in  the \nSenior, which were described as  workmanlike jobs in  red \nand  gold, but  on  the  heavy side. \nSULBY SPEED TRAP \nThe  TT Special newspaper made a point of timing riders dur- \ning practice. Sometimes it would be  from point to  point, \nsuch as  Ramsey to  the  Bungalow, or  even over the  short \nlength involved in  rounding and exiting the  dip at  Gover- \nnor’s Bridge, They also timed riders over a  1-mile stretch \nof the Sulby Straight and quoted the speeds attained. While \nthe  redone figures were keenly awaited by readers, they \ntended to ignore anumber of factors that affected the quoted \nspeeds. For example, due to  riders tackling the  preceding \nQuarry Bends with varying degrees of skill, not  everyone \nwas at  maximum speed when they entered the  mile. Also, \nsome 500s were applying their brakes for  Sulby Bridge \nbefore the  end of the  timed stretch. Clearly, it  was not  a \ntotally accurate affair, particularly as  there was no  guaran- \ntee  that timed riders were always at full throttle. Top riders \nwere also sometimes missing from the  published figures, \nperhaps because they had missed that particular practice \nsession. In addition, the  reports seldom mentioned if there \nwere favourable or  adverse wind conditions that could have \naffected the  speeds achieved. During one  timing session in \n1932, fastest 500 was Henry Tyrell-Smith on  a  Rudge at \nexactly 100mph, a similar speed being reached by the  fast- \nest  350, Harold Willis on  a  Velocette, while Wal Handley \nwas the  quickest Lightweight on  a  Rudge at  88.6mph. \nRiders acquainted themselves with the latest road \nimprovements during practice in  1932, the  most beneficial \nof which was widening at  Laurel Bank.

Stanley also set \na  new lap record in  the  Junior of 78.62mph, with Jimmy \nSimpson (Norton) recording a new fastest lap in the  Senior \nof 81.50mph. As  in  1931, Norton took first, second and \nthird in  the  Senior with Stanley Woods, Jimmy Guthrie \nand Jimmy Simpson; while in the Junior, it was  Rudge who \nfilled second and third places with Wal Handley and Henry \nTyrell-Smith. In the  Lightweight race, Leo  Davenport took \nfirst place at  record-breaking speed on  a  New Imperial, \nand Rudge were second and third with Graham Walker \nand Wal Handley, the  latter setting a  new record fastest \nlap of 74.08mph. To  put  the  rapidly increasing speeds in \nthe  Lightweight in  context, Handley’s lap record in  1932 \nwas faster than the  lap record of 73.55mph set  by Charlie \nDodson when winning the  1929 Senior TT. \nMotorcycle racing was  yet to have its own World Cham- \npionship, but  by now there was an  established circuit of \nContinental Grand Prix and other major races. Norton \ncarried their TT  form into such events, taking victory in \neleven of the  twelve major races they contested in  1932 \nand proudly advertising, “The machine that can success- \nfully stand up to the terrific strain of racing, is the machine \nthat will offer best service to  the  ordinary tourist’. \nEVER FASTER \nEveryone had become used to  TT lap  and race speeds \nincreasing year on  year, but  why was this? The topic was \nconsidered in  the  previous chapter and the  main reasons \nidentified. They were course improvements, increased \nengine power and improved braking and  handling, along \nwith input from star riders. Other contributory factors have \nbeen mentioned: the move from hand to foot change, four- \nspeed gearboxes, use  of lighter materials, more responsive \nengines, wider tyres, changes to race regulations and so  on, \nbut a growing contribution was  being made by the increase \nin mechanical reliability, which meant that machines could \nbe ridden harder for longer. Speaking of the  situation that \nexisted when he started TT  racing some ten  years before, \n1932 double winner Stanley Woods told how race machines \nof the  earlier time were relatively fragile, saying, in effect, \nthat anyone who went off fast  into the  lead at  a TT  would \nnot  be  expected to  win, or  even finish, for  despite being \nracing bikes, they had  to  be treated with care and  ‘nursed’ \nthrough such a long race. \nIn  1932 riders still started with cold engines, so  they may \nhave gone easy on  the  throttle for  the  first few  miles, but \nthereafter it was flat  out, if necessary, although they still \npreferred to ride with something in hand. Not that the reli- \nability problem had been completely solved, for Norton had \ntwo  works machines break down in  the  1932 Junior; they \nwere \nprobably \nbeing \nridden \nto  \ntheir \nlimits, \nfor \nwhen \nriders \nlike \nWoods, \nGuthrie, \nSimpson \nand  \nHunt \nwere \nstriving \nfor \nvictory, \nthe \ncompetition \nwas \nintense. \nNorton \ndid \nintroduce \na \nsystem \nof \nriding \nto  \nteam \norders, \naimed \nat \npreventing \nriders \nbreaking \ntheir \nmachines \nin \ncom- \npetition \nwith \neach \nother. \nAt \nthe \nTT \nthe \nagreement \nwas \nthat \nthey \nwould \nrace \nfor \nthe \nfirst \nthree \nlaps \nand \nthereafter \nmain- \ntain \ntheir \npositions \nto \nthe \nend. \nIt was \nnot \npopular \namongst \nsuch \na competitive \ngroup \nof riders \nand \nled \nto \nStanley \nWoods \nsetting \nup \nhis \nown \nsignalling \nsystem \nat Sulby \nto \nsupplement \nthe \ninformation \npassed \nto \nhim \nby \nNorton \nat the \npits. \nWhile increased reliability would have come mainly \nfrom the efforts of individual manufacturers, the long-term \nparticipation in  racing of suppliers of items like carburet- \ntors, tyres, chains, sparking plugs, petrol, oil  and so  on \nhad seen them improve the  quality of their products and \nmake a  material contribution to  overall reliability. Having \nsaid that, after a  post-race inspection of the  top-finishing \nmachines in  1932, The Motor Cycle told its readers that ‘many \nof the chains were in a disgraceful state ...  including broken \nrollers’. But  264 racing miles was  a long way for an  exposed \nchain to go without attention, for there was  no  lubrication, \nnor  was  there easy facility to  adjust them at pit stops. \nTHRILLS AND SPILLS \nMention has  been made of intense competition between \nriders, and Jimmy Simpson recalled the  times with the \nwords, ‘the race of the  moment was the one thing that \nmattered —  there was no  thought for  the  future, no  count \nof the  risk’. Most riders got  swept along by the  competi- \ntive atmosphere that prevailed, but  some were found out \nby the  demanding nature of the  Mountain Course. Spills \nwere frequent in the  early days, when riders would usually \npick themselves up,  kick the  bike into shape and carry on \nracing. But as  speeds increased, what were previously spills \nturned into what were more appropriately called crashes. \nThe consequences of such incidents on  such an  unforgiv- \ning course could be serious and  fatalities became more fre- \nquent. That was a high price to  pay  for what was primarily \na sporting event. \n1933: REDUCED ENTRY NUMBERS \nFrom a total entry of 153  across the three races in 1931, the \nfigure \nfell \nto \nninety-five \nin \n1932, \nthen \npicked \nup \nslightly \nto \nninety-eight \nin \n1933, \nwhich \nincluded \nforeign \nmachines \nsuch \nas \nJawa, \nMoto \nGuzzi \nand \nEysink. \nManufacturers \ncome \nand \ngo \nat \nthe \nTT \nfor \nvarious \nreasons, \nand \nin \n1933 \nRudge, \nwho \nhad \nhit \ntrading \ndifficulties, \ndid \nnot \nsubmit \nworks \nentries. \nFortunately, \nthey \ndid \nmake \ntheir \nrace \nbikes \navailable \nto \ntheir \nprevious \nteam \nriders, \nGraham \nWalker, \nHenry \nTyrell- \ni"

The \nresult was that conditions varied from year to  year and rid- \ners  were always keen to  know the  state of the  roads before \nsetting out  to  practise. After the  Highways Board had  fin- \nished its preparations for the  1933 TT, which included wid- \nening and easing at the Thirty-third Milestone, one  journal \nreported ‘there is now a surface on  the roads that will glad- \nden  the hearts of the  riders’. \nMention has already been made of the hazard created for \nriders by molten tar  and  it was  something they just had  to \nface up to.  Efforts were sometimes made to  lessen its effect \nby sprinkling the  worst areas with sand or  cement dust but \nthat really was a  mixed blessing for  racers to  cope with at \nspeed. \nThere has  been a  long-held view amongst some of those \nwho visit the  Isle of Man just for the  racing that any  altera- \nBraking \nhard \nbut \nwith \ncare \non  \nthe \napproach \nto  \nCreg \nny \nBaa. \nFAST FOREIGNERS Mf  45 \ntion carried out  to  the  Mountain Course is done primarily \nfor the  benefit of the  TT  races. That is not  so.  Outside the \nfour weeks of the  TT  and MGP periods they are  ordinary \nroads traversed by the  cars, lorries, buses and  motorcycles \nof the island’s residents. As traffic demands increase, safety \nmeasures like the  easing of blind bends, the  need for  road \nwidening and  other highway engineering requirements, all \nbring about change. This has  been going on  for over a  cen- \ntury, for  the  benefit of Manx road users. Those improve- \nments have undoubtedly played a major part in making the \ncourse faster for riders and thus have increased race speeds, \nbut  a  truer description of the  official attitude to  highway \nimprovements is  that the authorities have regard to  the \nimpact of their works on  the  racing and try  to  avoid any \nadverse effects. \nBy 1933 the  Highways Board was talking proudly of its \n‘non-skid’ road surfacing, but it was still a hand-spread tar- \nmacadam mix, finished by rolling and, after a  year or  so, \nsurface dressed with tar  and  chippings to  extend its  life. \nOne good thing about improved surfacing and course \nimprovements was  that it did allow riders to  make the most \nof  the extra power and speed that manufacturers were \nbuilding into their race machines. As ever, it was  top riders \nwho could extract the  greatest benefit and their services \nwere in  high demand. With the  natural tendency of such \ntop  riders to  be  offered the  fastest machines, it increased \nthe performance gap between them and  ordinary riders on \nlesser machinery. \nTop riders also sought to  maximize their earnings by \nmoving between manufacturers and sometimes riding for \nmore than one make. In  1933, fast  man Wal Handley was \nentered on  an  OK-Supreme in the  Senior, Velocette in the \nJunior and  Excelsior in the Lightweight. Messrs Burney and \nBlackburne provided a  new 250cc engine for  the Excel- \nsior, which became known as  the  Mechanical Marvel. It \nhad  a radial 4-valve head, two splayed inlet ports and  twin \nexhaust ports. \nWEIGHT SAVING \nAs  mentioned earlier, growth in  performance brought the \nrequirement for  racing motorcycles to  be  strengthened in \nall areas, with bulked-up components in engines, plus stur- \ndier frames and associated parts, wider tyres and larger fuel \ntanks. The result of this was to  increase machine weights \nthrough the late 1920s and  early 1930s. While the  need to \nretain overall strength remained, manufacturers attempted \nto  compensate for  increased weight by making more use \nof light alloys in  areas like  crankcases, gearbox shells, cyl- \ninder heads, cylinder finning, hubs, mudguards, engine \nplates, brake plates, handlebars and  anywhere else where"

There were also experimental light-alloy wheel rims \navailable. \nCHANGES \nAmong some obvious changes to  machinery in  1933 was \nheel and  toe  form of gearchange lever, commonly seen on \nContinental machines and now adopted by a  few British \nriders. Sunbeam had used hairpin valve springs for  some \ntime, and  they could now also be  seen on  Velocettes and \nJawas, for most valve gear was  still  partially exposed. Nor- \nton  used aluminium-bronze cylinder heads, and  the  use  of \nbronze to  aid  thermal conductivity was adopted by other \nmanufacturers over the  next few years, sometimes just as \na  ‘skull’ for the  combustion chamber. The only two-stroke \nentry was  that of a  Scott going under the name of the  Rey- \nnolds Special, entered by Liverpool motorcycle dealer A.E. \nReynolds. \nRace regulations had previously required exhaust pipes \nto extend back as  far as  the centre of the rear wheel spindle, \nbut  growing knowledge of the  important effect of exhaust \npipe length on  performance saw  that requirement dropped. \nForeign machines were still trying to make an  impression \nand Jawa brought a  350cc single to join its  500, which had \ngained a little speed to  go with its  reliability. The 500 had \na sheet metal frame, unit construction of engine and  gear- \nbox, and  coupled brakes. Husqvarna also made an  appear- \nance, with a motorcycle that was  rated as  fast but heavy and \nwith poor handling. In  1933 foreign machines and riders \nhad yet to  make an  impact on  Island racing, while all  the \nwinning was being done by single-cylinder machines. \nNORTON DOMINATE \nThe history books show that Norton swept the board at the \n1933 TT. In  the  Senior, Stanley Woods led  home Jimmy \nSimpson and Tim Hunt at record-breaking race average and \nlap speeds and he did the same in the Junior from Hunt and \nJimmy Guthrie. It was a  comprehensive demolition of the \nopposition, on  a  scale not  previously seen, with reports of \nthe  time claiming that Norton’s 500 gave just over 30bhp \nat  5,500rpm, on  a compression ratio of 7.1:1. \nWith his  double victory in  1933 following his  similar \ndouble in  1932, Stanley Woods now had six TT wins and, at \njust over thirty years of age, stood at the pinnacle of motor- \ncycle racing. Importantly, he had  reached the  top with the \nreputation of invariably bringing his  machine to  the  fin- \nish.  Woods gave a few  insights into his riding style, telling \nthat achieving the  greatest possible speeds on  the  fastest \nbends was  of prime importance, rather than trying too hard \non  the  slower ones; and that taking a  line that missed the \nworst \nbumps \nwas \noften \nbetter \nthan \nusing \nwhat \nlooked \nlike \nthe \nobvious \nbut \nbumpy \none. \nIt \nwas \nstill \na \nlittle \nbefore \nthe \nuse \nof \nrev \ncounters, \nso \nhe \ndrove \nthe \nengine \nby \near, \nalways \nclosing \nthe \nthrottle \non \nupward \nchanges \nand \neasing \nit over \njumps, \nin \nboth \ninstances \naiming \nto \navoid \nover-revving. \nHe \nindulged \nin \nminimal \nslipping \nof \nthe \nclutch \nand \nused \nboth \nbrakes \ntogether, \nthe \nfront \nharder \nthan \nthe \nrear. \nHe \nstopped \nonly \nonce \nfor \nfuel \nin \nthe \nseven-lap \nSenior \nrace, \nwhen \nhe \ntook \non \nthe \npetrol/benzole \nmix \nused \nby \nmost \nteams. \nWith such a  commanding performance in  the Senior \nand Junior races, Norton rather took the  attention away \nfrom Syd Gleave’s record-breaking ride to  victory on  his \nnew Excelsior ‘Mechanical Marvel’ in the Lightweight. But \nwhile Norton received much praise for their performance, \nthey also came in  for  criticism, with some suggesting that \nsuch total dominance was bad for  the  future of the  TT. \nThe chance to  complain about the event also brought to the \nfore the  old  chestnut about it not  aiding the  development \nof road machines. This seemed to  be  the  excuse to  start \ntalking about its  future, with ideas ranging from having a \nmassed start to  having a  standard touring lira running it \non a short circuit. It was understandable that manufactur- \ners  putting money into the  event looked to  get something \npositive out  of it, but most people saw  the  TT  as  a sporting \nspectacle of speed, and  that is all they wanted of the  event. \n1934: MOUNTAIN ROAD \nThe long-standing problem of sheep wandering onto the \nMountain Road and into the  path of racing motorcyclists, \nwas largely cured for  the 1934 TT  after the  whole length \nwas fenced.

New to  the  event \nwas  the Vincent HRD Company with three entries on  JAP- \npowered 500s. It was a  brave venture by a  small concern, \nwhose total production in  1933 had been just under one \nhundred road-going motorcycles. Unusually for race bikes \nof the  time, they came fitted with rear suspension, some- \nthing which Philip Vincent had  utilized on  all his  motorcy- \ncles after taking over the  double TT-winning HRD name in \n19273. \nFOREIGN CHALLENGE \nThe early 1930s had seen British machines taking all  the \npodium places in  the  Senior, Junior and  Lightweight TTs \nand having little trouble in  repelling the  challenge of the \nfew foreign makes entered. However, top  man in  Island \nracing, Stanley Woods, a professional motorcycle racer out \nto  make the  best possible living, decided that he  had  had \nenough of Norton’s financially constricting team orders and \nlooked elsewhere for a  source of racing bikes for the  1934 \nseason. Bankrolled by a substantial retainer of £1,500 from \nthe  parent company of Mobiloil, he  came to  the  1934 TT \nwith entries on  a Husqvarna for the Senior, AJS for the Jun- \nior and  Moto Guzzi for the  Lightweight. \nWoods was an  astute man who left  nothing to  chance. \nMaking early visits to  the  three supplying factories, he \nworked with them to  improve the  bikes he  was planning \nto  race. Pre-TT testing left  him optimistic of putting up \na  good showing with the twin-cylinder Husqvarna and \nsingle-cylinder Moto Guzzi, but he rejected the  AJS as  not \ngood \nenough. \nOn \nthe \nrun-up \nto \nthe \nTT, \nhis \nplans \ngenerated \npremature \nheadlines \nlike \n‘British \nroad \nracing \nsupremacy \nin \njeopardy’. \nHusqvarna \nalso \nbrought \n500s \nfor \nErnie \nNott \nand \nGunar \nKalen, \nplus \na \n350 \nfor \nNott \nto \nride \nin \nthe \nJunior \nrace. \nJimmy Simpson copes with the bumps of the railway \nbridge at  Union Mills in  1934. \nNORTON AGAIN \nAfter all the  pre-event talk of the  foreign challenge, when \nit came to  the 1934 TT, Norton continued their winning \nways. With much modified, lightened and faster bikes, \nthey showed good form in  practice, with Jimmy Simpson \nrecorded on  the Sulby Straight at  106.5mph. They took \nthe  first two places in the  Senior race with Jimmy Guthrie \nand Jimmy Simpson, while Walter Rusk came third on \na  Velocette. It was  a  similar situation in  the  Junior, with \nGuthrie again winning from Simpson after a  neck-and- \nneck duel, and Ernie Nott bringing his  Husqvarna home \nin third. \nFollowing a  troublesome practice period, the  relatively \nnew to  the TT  ‘Husky’ of Stanley Woods held second place \nin the  wet Senior race until running out  of fuel on  the  last \nlap, just 10  miles from the  finish. It was a  good showing, \nand consolation for  Woods came in  the  form of the  fastest \nlap at  80.49mph, somewhat down on  the  lap record due  to \nthe poor conditions. \nThe Husqvarna performance was  considered a promising \none, for  having shed much weight and improved the  han- \ndling from 1933, the  bikes carried the  requisite speed and \nlooked a threat for the future. In addition they showed that \ntwin-cylinder machines could once again mount a serious \nchallenge to  the  singles, something that had  not  happened \nat the TT  for many years. \nIn  the  Lightweight class it was another convincing vic- \ntory for  the  speedy little Rudge singles, which were said \nto  develop 24bhp and were fast  enough to  claim the  first \nthree places with Jimmy Simpson, Ernie Nott and  Graham \nWalker. It gave a long-awaited TT win  to Jimmy at record- \nbreaking speed. \nRudge had fully expected to  be  challenged by Moto \nGuzzi in  the  Lightweight race, for  Stanley Woods unof- \nficially broke the  lap record by a big margin on  his first lap"

However, a  mistake during preparation in the \nGuzzi camp saw  Woods’ bike seize its engine on  the first lap \nof the  race, and  although he was  able to  continue, the  edge \nhad  gone off its  performance and  he finished fourth. As  in \nthe  Senior race, he  had done enough, however, to  show \nthat the  250  Italian Moto Guzzi could be a threat to  British \nmanufacturers in future years. \nThat 1934 Lightweight race was  blighted by the death of \nprevious winner, the  experienced Syd Crabtree, who fell \nfrom his Excelsior on  the Mountain. No one  saw  Crabtree’s \naccident in  the  misty conditions that prevailed and it was \nsometime before the organizers realized he was  missing and \norganized a  search party. It drew attention to  the  paucity \nof marshals on  the  Mountain section of the  course and  led \nto  the  creation of the  travelling marshals service the  fol- \nlowing year. \n1935: DEVELOPMENTS \nThe TT  was a year-long topic of discussion for the sporting \nmotorcyclist and  the motorcycle press. Early in  1935 came \na  rumour that the  4-cylinder, water-cooled and super- \ncharged Italian Rondine would come to  the  Island in June, \nbut that did not happen. Mention of such multi-cylinder for- \neign exotica had commentators on  the racing scene writing \nthat “British manufacturers are  literally clinging to  the  sin- \ngle although by rights its  day has  passed’. The Norton sin- \ngles had been further developed, with compression ratios \nlifted, power output of the  500 up to  34bhp, larger petrol \nand oil tanks, a  ‘new’ gearbox, a degree of enclosure to the \nrocker box and  a claimed maximum speed of 110mph. \nAn  early alloy rim, plated and riveted at the  join. \nMoto \nGuzzi, \nOEC \nand \nVincent \nHRD \nwere \nthe \nonly \nentries \nwith \nrear \nsuspension \nin \n1935, \na \nfeature \nmany \nconsid- \nered \nwas \nlong \noverdue \nfor \ngeneral \nuse \nin \nracing. \nMeanwhile, \never \nmore \nfirms \nwere \nusing \nlight \nalloys, \nwith \nincreasing \nuse \nin \nwheel \nrims, \neven \nthough \nsome \nfelt \nit necessary \nto \nrivet \na \nplate \nat the \njoin \nin \nconstruction. \nFirms were beginning to  experiment with megaphone \nexhausts to  boost top-end performance, Velocette and \nNorton among them, and  JAP offered a  twin-carburettor \narrangement on  their single-cylinder engines, via  two \ninduction pipes to  a  single inlet port. Cross rotary-valve \nengines were tried by Cotton and Rudge, while Excelsior \nappeared with a  new 250 ohc engine. Rev counters also \nmade an  appearance. They were a help in gaining optimum \nperformance and an  aid  to  reliability, and would come to \nbe universally adopted in the next few years. \nJoining the  foreign entries from NSU, Jawa and  Terrot \nwas the  German firm of DKW, with its  technically inter- \nesting 250cc split-single two-strokes, which were said to \ngive some 25bhp at  approaching 5,000rpm. They were \nwater-cooled, with a  piston-pump form of supercharging, \nand used rubber to  control movement of the  front forks \nrather than springs. Particularly noisy, with a  high fuel \nconsumption, they needed large petrol tanks. With the \nprestige of  a  TT  victory well recognized abroad, foreign \nmachines amounted to  some 20  per  cent of the  total 107 \nentries. \nStanley Woods returned in  1935 with Moto Guzzi \nrides in the  Lightweight and  Senior races, accompanied by \nOmobono Tenni. The 250  was  a development of the model \nhe had  used in  1934 and  the  500 was a  120  degree V-twin \nthat had been campaigned on  the Continent, but which \ncame to  the  island with a  new sprung frame, the  action of \nwhich was controlled by friction adjusters. Top speed was \nsaid  to  be  112mph. \nOn the organizational side, the requirement that \nmachines start a  race with cold engines was dropped and \na  warming-up period was given, in  which machines were \nridden up and down the  Glencrutchery Road, witha line of \nmetal dustbins keeping them apart. It was a  characteristic \nof the  Velocette racers that they did  not  deliver their full \nperformance \nuntil \nthoroughly \nwarm. \nSeemingly \nthat \ncould \ntake \na \nfull \nlap, \nperhaps \ndue \nto \nthem \ncarrying \na \ngallon \nof \nengine oil. \nJimmy \nSimpson \nhad  \nretired \nfrom \nracing \nat  \nthe  \nend \nof \n1934 \nand \nwas \nemployed \nin \nthe \ncompetition \ndepartment \nof \nShell \nOils. \nHe \nwas \npresent \nat \nthe \n1935 \nraces \nand, \nhav- \ning \nassessed \nthe \nlatest \nroad \nimprovements \nand \nresurfacing, \nexpressed \nthe \nview \nthat \nthey \nwere \nworth \n10 \nseconds \na \nlap \nto \ntop \nriders."

Number II  looks a little more determined than number 10. \nESCAPISM \nEnthusiasm for  TT  racing could offer a  way of escaping \nthe  burden of wordly affairs. The  Motor Cycle put  it nicely \nin  1935, writing “Who cares what Hitler says, or  whether \nthere has  been another coup in the  Balkans? This week we \ndon’t read the  national papers —  we  live, dream and read \nmotorcycles.’ \nPROGRAMME \nThe  programme of racing for  1935 opened with the Junior \non  Monday of race week. In  less  than perfect conditions, \nthe stylish Jimmy Guthrie led team mates Walter Rusk and \nJohn ‘Crasher’ White to  victory at a new record race aver- \nage  speed of 79.14mph, with the  fastest lap going to  Rusk, \nwho was  just 3 seconds short of the lap record. It was Nor- \nton’s fifth consecutive Junior victory. \nWeather conditions were poor for  Wednesday’s Light- \nweight race, where, nevertheless, Stanley Woods (Moto \nGuzzi) rode to  an  emphatic 3-minute victory over the \nRudges of Henry Tyrell-Smith and  Ernie Nott, setting new \nrace average and lap records for the  264'%-mile race. That \nwas a long way for a  250  that was  revved to  over 7,500rpm \nand the  little Moto Guzzi’s engine suffered valve gear fail- \nure  just as  Stanley shut off at the  finishing line. \nCelebrations of victory in  the  Lightweight were over- \nshadowed by the  death in the  race of Doug Pirie in a crash \nat  the Thirty-third Milestone. The inquest into Pirie’s \ndeath was held the  following day and the  coroner recom- \nmended to  the  ACU’s representative that the  organizers \nshould stop any  race in  which bad  weather prevailed. The \nnext day was scheduled for the  Senior race, but with travel- \nling marshals reporting that visibility on  the  Mountain was \ndown to  20 yards and  with the  Coroner’s recommendation \nringing in  their ears, the  organizers postponed the  race \nuntil Saturday. A degree of chaos ensued for riders, organ- \nizers, marshals and those spectators who were booked to \nleave the island on  the Saturday —  and for the  12,000 specta- \ntors who had been shipped in overnight just to  see  Friday’s \nSenior. \nA RACETO REMEMBER \nThere had been many close-fought duels in  the almost \ntwenty-five years’ use  of the  Mountain Course, but  with \nthis book’s concentration on  detailing the  ever-increasing \nspeed aspect of the  TT, it has not  been possible to  give full \naccounts of  earlier races. However, the  record-breaking \n1935 Senior TT  merits a proper description. \nA  TT  race is  a  form of time trial where riders set  off \nat  intervals. In  the 1930s the previous year’s winner was \nalways offered number 1 in  the  following year’s race, but \nthe  remaining start numbers were determined by ballot. \nThis meant that principal rivals might not  see  each other \nduring a  race, so  they rode against the  clock. Each rider \nhad his own strategy, some going fast from the outset, while \nothers held something in  reserve. Their riding could well \nbe affected by the  in-race information they received about \nhow their rivals were doing, and the  need to  stop for  fuel \ncould often change the  shape of a race."

      "text": "50  M  FAST FOREIGNERS \nPractice for the  1935 Senior had  shown that it would be \na  contest between the  combined strength of the  Norton \nteam of Guthrie, Rusk and  White and  the  lone effort of \nStanley Woods on  his  Moto Guzzi, though nothing could \nbe  taken for  granted over a  race distance of 264% miles \nand  there were certainly others capable of challenging for \na win. Come the  race, it soon turned into a two-man duel \nbetween Jimmy Guthrie, who started at  number 1, and \nStanley Woods, who started 14’ minutes later at number \n30.  Almost half a minute behind Guthrie on  corrected time \nat the end of the first lap, Woods was  a concerned man, for \nhis  500cc bike shared the  same valve gear components as \nthose that had  failed as  he crossed the  finishing line on  his \n250 a  few days before. Falling further behind, it was not \nuntil his  stop for  fuel at  the  end of the  third lap that the \nGuzzi rider began to  claw back some of Jimmy’s lead. \nNorton were convinced that the  thirsty twin-cylinder \nMoto Guzzi would have to  make two stops for  fuel and \nplanned their race accordingly. However, they had failed to \nnotice in the final practice session that, in a classic act  of  TT \nsubterfuge, Woods had  used a slightly bigger petrol tank, \nwhich he retained for the  race. Activity in the  Moto Guzzi \npit as  Woods neared the  end of his  sixth lap led  Norton \nto  believe their assumption about refuelling to  be correct, \nfor the  Guzzi mechanics gave every indication of preparing \nfor  another stop. But  Woods went straight through, albeit \na  substantial 26  seconds behind Guthrie, who had already \nbeen given signals telling him he  was comfortably in  the \nlead. \nPutting aside concerns about the  durability of his  valve \ngear, Woods brought all his racing skills to that last lap. He \nused the  Moto Guzzi’s sprung-frame handling to  its  full, \nand in the final stages his new-for-1935 rev  counter showed \nthat he was  taking the engine to well over 8,000rpm on  the \ndrop from the  Mountain. But  would it last and  would it be \nenough to  snatch victory? \nIt was clear at  the  finish that the  race organizers, the \npublic address announcers and the  Norton camp did  not \nthink so,  for Jimmy Guthrie sat  on  his Norton and received \ncelebratory handshakes, pictures were taken and he  was \ngenerally féted as  the  winner. Then, some quarter of an \nhour after Guthrie had  taken the chequered flag, came the \nunexpected announcement that Stanley Woods had clawed \nback the  time deficit on  the  last  lap and  stolen victory by 4 \nseconds. In doing so  he set  a new lap record of 86. 53mph, \ntaking 1 minute and 12 seconds off his own previous fastest \nlap from 1933 in  the  process and  thus lifting it by almost \n4mph. It was  a truly outstanding performance, which made \nhim an  eight-times TT  winner. \nMoto Guzzi had  been contesting the  TT  since 1926 and \nby \ntaking \nthe  \ncoveted \nBlue \nRiband \nSenior \nand \nthe  \nLight- \nweight \nrace \nin \n1935, \nthe \nItalian \nfirm \nshowed \nthat \nthe \nfor- \neign \nchallenge \nwas \nnow \ntruly \na force \nto \nbe \nreckoned \nwith \nin \nIsland \nracing. \nRusk \nand \nDuncan \nhad \nfollowed \nGuthrie \nhome \non \nNortons, \nbut \nin \nfifth \nand \nsixth \nplaces \nthere \nwas \nmore \nforeign \nmachinery, \nwith \nOskar \nSteinbach \nand \nTed \nMellors \non \nGerman \nNSUs. \n1936: RUMBLINGS \nThe interruptions to  racing caused by the  poor weather in \n1935 led  some to  question the  suitability of the  Mountain \nCourse for such an  important race as  the TT, particularly as \nmachines were getting ever faster. Suggestions were made \nabout finding an  alternative course on  the  Island that kept \nto  the  low ground and  would thus be less  affected by mist. \nThere was  no  immediate action, but the topic continued to \nrumble in the background for the  next few years. \nIncreased speeds put  ever more demands on  riders. At \n100mph plus, racing bikes were an  uncomfortable ride, \nwith their vibration, noise and lack of suspension. Add to \nthis  the need to  fight the wind in bulky two-piece leathers, \ntopped by a  draughty pudding-basin helmet and goggles, \nand  it meant that spending well over 3 hours in the  saddle \nfor the  264 miles of  a TT  race was a wearing business. \nA  total entry of only eighty-six across the  three races \nin  1936 was cause for  concern, but  firms like Norton and \nVelocette, who openly stated that they went racing for \nthe  worldwide publicity it  could earn them, were there. \nIndeed, the  small Velocette company attributed its  sur- \nvival in the  difficult trading days of the  early 1930s to  the \nfact that 50 per  cent of its production went for export, the \norders for which had  largely been gained through the  pub- \nlicity achieved from racing. \nThe Moto Guzzi marque was absent, as  Italy was at war \nin Abyssinia. \nCOURSE IMPROVEMENTS \nBray Hill had  been resurfaced and  was now rated as  faster, \nalthough the  humps where side roads joined the  hill  still \ncaused the  fastest riders to  leap considerable distances. \nFive miles further on,  at an  improved Greeba Castle, the \neasing of bends helped increase speeds, because, as  Graham \nWalker explained, riders now took it in third gear and  ‘you \ndidn’t \ndrop \nbelow \nninety’. \nJust \nafter \nthe \nEighth \nMilestone \nat \nBallig \nBridge, \nthe \nnotorious \nhump \nhad \nbeen \nlevelled \nand \nthe \nreconstructed \nbridge \nwas \nwidened \nand \nrealigned \nto \ngive \na \nstraighter \nrun. \nIn \nthe \nopinion \nof \nleading \nriders, \nthe \nworks \nthere \nsaved \nthem \n3—5 \nseconds \na \nlap, \nwhile \nother \nchanges \nfor \n1936 \nwere \nestimated \nto \ncontribute \nto \nan \noverall \nreduction \nin lap time of 10-15 seconds."

Moto Guzzi \nhad used a  system with scissor-action struts controlled by \nadjustable friction discs, whilst Vincent HRD used inclined \nunder-saddle springs that were enclosed and fitted with \nfriction band adjusters. Norton’s effort was of simple verti- \ncal  plunger style, incorporating springs but  no  damping, \nwhile Velocette’s was  of vertically mounted hydraulic units, \nwith no  springs, but  assisted by compressed air.

Vincent HRD also brought a supercharged \nsingle for the  Senior, but  it proved temperamental in prac- \ntice  so  was  not  raced. \nSince their TT victories of the late 1920s, Velocette had \nbeen ever-present at the Island races. Sometimes only frac- \ntionally off race-winning pace and with their 350s usually \nmore competitive than their 500s, they were always ready \nto  snap up  a  podium position when the  mighty Nortons \nfailed. In  1936 they returned with modified frames, altera- \ntions to  gearing and minor engine developments that kept \ntheir KTT models competitive. They also realized that to \nwin they had to pay for a top rider, so  they went right to the \nvery top and  hired Stanley Woods, who would also ride a \nDKW in the  Lightweight race. \nNORTON STILL DOMINATE \nAs well as  benefiting from plunger rear suspension in  1936, \nback at  the  Bracebridge Street factory the  Norton racers \nunderwent their customary engine development over the \nwinter and came with slightly revised bore and stroke, plus \nextra finning areas to  heads and  barrels. Every manufac- \nturer who had ideas of TT  glory would have gone down \na  similar road, for  those who stood still were swiftly left \nbehind. \nJimmy Guthrie went on  to  race his Norton to  victory in \nthe  1936 Senior at record-breaking speed, although second- \nplaced Stanley Woods (Velocette) set the fastest and record \nlap at  86.98mph. Confirming the  constant year-on-year \nprogress made at  the  TT  races, Stanley’s 1936 record lap \nwas  even faster than his victory-grabbing last lap of 1935 on \nthe Moto Guzzi. Walter Rusk (Norton) wasa close third. In \nthe Junior it was  newcomer to the TT, former MGP winner \nFreddie Frith, who took first place on  his Norton, breaking \nrace and lap records and finishing ahead of ‘Crasher’ White \n(Norton) and  Ted  Mellors (Velocette). \nThose who had  ridden with rear suspension expressed \nthemselves as  generally satisfied with the new fitting, \nclaiming it  allowed higher corner speeds, reduced tyre \nwear, permitted harder rear-wheel braking and gave overall \nbetter control. In addition, increased comfort meant their \nbikes were less fatiguing to ride, a factor that could well be \na time-saver towards the  end  of a long race. \nIn  \nthe \nLightweight \nrace, \nBob \nFoster \nfended \noff  \nthe \nDKW \nchallenge \nand \nrode \nhis \nunit \nconstruction, \npushrod- \nengined \nNew \nImperial \nto  \nfirst \nplace \nat  \na  \nnew \nrace \naverage \nrecord \nspeed, \nwith \nHenry \nTyrell-Smith \nsecond \non \na 4-valve \nExcelsior \nand \nArthur \nGeiss \nthird \non \nhis \ntwo-stroke \nDKW. \nStanley \nWoods \n(DKW) \nlost \ntime \nto \nan \nearly \nplug \nchange. \nThereafter \nhe \nwas \nchallenging \nFoster \nfor \nthe \nlead \nand \nset \na \nnew \nrecord \nlap \nof \n76.20mph, \nbefore \nretiring \non \nlap \nsix. \nIn  \ntuning \nmachines \nfor \nTT  \nracing, \nthere \nis \na  \ntricky \nline \nto \nbe \nmaintained \nbetween \nperformance \nand \nreliability. \nThe \ntemptation \nhas  \nalways \nbeen \nto  \ngo  \nfor  \nperformance \nand \nso \nretirement \nrates \nranged \nfrom \n22 \nto \n60 \nper \ncent \nin \n1936. \nSuch \nfigures \nwere \nnot \nout \nof \nthe \nordinary, \nbut \nthere \nwas \nlittle \nconsistency \nand \nthe \npercentage \nfigures \nfor \neach \nrace \nvaried year on  year. \n1937: MEGAPHONES \nThe benefit to  top-end performance gained by the  use  of \nmegaphone exhausts was increasingly recognized and they \nwere being widely adopted.

They also had  increased \ncompression ratios and  carried rev  counters. \nIn  1937 almost every rider still rode his  racing motor- \ncycle from his garage/lodgings to  the  start area, prior to  a \npractice or  race.

Once there, they \nneeded to be warmed up for some 10 minutes prior to going \nout  for practice. \nThe press published some speedy claims on  the run-up to \nthe  1937 event, writing that the  500cc Moto Guzzis would \nreach 126mph and the  new entry 500cc BMW was good \nfor  132mph. However, as  will be  seen, that did  not  hap- \npen at  the  TT. It  was a  year when there had been little \nchange to  the course, apart from some improvements over \nthe  Mountain. \nMORE FOREIGN ENTRIES \nDown to  ride the  sole BMW factory entry in  1937 was \nthe experienced Jock West. His German mount was a \n180-degree flat-twin, with supercharging, dohc, four- \nspeed gearbox and single-plate clutch matched to  shaft \ndrive. Suspension was by plunger at the  rear and hydrauli- \ncally damped telescopic forks at  the  front. Much use  was \nmade of magnesium and the  bike’s overall lightness, com- \nbined with speed, suggested that it would be a  formidable \nthreat, particularly as  it had  already been raced with suc- \ncess on  the  Continent. The BMW represented an  advance \nin  motorcycle engineering and offered a  distinct increase \nin  performance, but  could it  deliver and use  that higher \nperformance over the  roads of the  Mountain Course at the \nlevel it  did  on  race circuits abroad? Some pointed to  the \nhorizontal cylinders and shaft drive as  being two factors \nthat might make that difficult. \nThe talented Omobono Tenni was entered on  Moto \nGuzzis in  the Senior and Lightweight races, along with \nStanley Woods in the  Lightweight. Then there were NSUs \npresent in the  Senior and Junior races, DK W in the  Light- \nweight and names like  Terrot, Sarolea and  Husqvarna add- \ning spice to  the  entry of foreign machines and  riders. \nOne new feature for  the  1937 TT  was the  introduction \nof a single evening practice session. It was  well received, for \neveryone knew that race engines were sensitive to  atmos- \npheric \nconditions \nand \nperformed \nslightly \ndifferently \nduring \nThe all-action style of Omobono Tenni \n(Moto Guzzi) at Windy Corner during \npractice for the 1937 Lightweight TT. \nFAST FOREIGNERS #53 \nearly-morning practice sessions from how they would dur- \ning a race held later in the  day. \nA SPEEDY YEAR \nPractice lap times and speed measurements on  the  Sulby \nStraight suggested that spectators were in  for  fast  racing \nin  1937, and  that is how it turned out. The Sulby figures \ntaken in  practice showed that speeds had increased from \nprevious years, with Freddie Frith fastest Senior runner \non  his  Norton at  120.60mph, followed by the  Nortons of \nWhite and Guthrie at  116mph. It was a  year in  which The \nTT Special actually timed riders during the  Senior race; the \nfigures obtained showed Nortons out  front, with Guthrie \nhitting 117.66mph, White 114.67mph, Frith 114.67mph, \nTenni (Moto Guzzi) 113.94mph and Mellors (Velocette) \n113.21mph. Given that the  race turned into a titanic battle \nbetween Freddie Frith and  Stanley Woods (Velocette), one \nwonders why no  speed was  quoted for Woods, for at the end \nof a  race in which Frith lifted the  lap record by over 3mph \nto  record the  first over-90mph lap at  90.27mph, Woods \nwas  just 15 seconds behind him at the finish. Both had been \nriding to  their limit, with Woods experiencing a  massive \nslide just after Ballig Bridge. White was  third, while Jock \nWest brought his BMW home in sixth place with a  leaking \nfuel tank and  Tenni retired his Moto Guzzi. \nIn  the Junior race, Nortons swept the board with \nGuthrie, Frith and White taking the first three places. \nAgain, records were smashed, with Frith and Guthrie set- \nting an  equal fastest lap of  85.18mph. As  in  the  Senior, \nthis was over 3mph faster than the  previous year. Such an \nadvancement, which in  1937 was largely down to  machine \ndevelopment, was a huge compliment to  the  British manu- \nfacturers who had earlier been described as  ‘clinging on’ \nwith their single-cylinder racers. Speed trap figures showed \nthe  350 Nortons reached just over 105mph."

With the  easing and widen- \ning of many bends and improvements in  road-holding, TT \nmachines now ran  at wider throttle openings for longer and \nput ever more demands on  their many components. \nRenowned Australian engineer Phil Irving summarized \nthe  task of valves as  ‘admitting and  liberating gas from the \ncylinder at  appropriate moments’. It  was a  tough job at \n7,000rpm and manufacturers experimented with various \nmetals, usually using different ones for  inlet and exhaust \nvalves. The associated valve guides and springs were subject \nto  similar experimentation. Aiding their efficient opera- \ntion were developments in lubrication, with 1938 being the \nyear of new, thinner oils. Advertisements from Castrol and \nMobiloil claimed they would ‘lubricate without oil-drag’ \nand ‘are  necessary for high speed and  maximum power’. \nClutches had a hard life  and were usually of multi-plate \ndesign, using cork or  woven asbestos lining material, with \nmost still exposed to  air  to  aid  cooling. Carburettors were \nan  important feature in maximizing performance and there \nwas a  move towards remote float chambers with flexible \nmountings to  ensure a  constant flow of fuel. More manu- \nfacturers were trying rear suspension, with some private \nrunners grafting on  their own systems. \nWhile tyres were important, they were largely taken \nfor  granted. Troubles were few and durability was not  a \nproblem, most riders using one set  for  practising and a \nnew, lightly scrubbed set,  for  the  race. There were fewer \ntyre suppliers supporting the TT  than in its early days, the \nprincipal ones of the  1930s being Dunlop, Avon and  John \nBull. Riders used ribbed front tyres and  treaded rear, with \nsizes varying from 2.75 front and  3.00 rear on  some Light- \nweights to  3.00/3.25 front and  3.25/3.50 rear on  Junior \nand  Senior models. \nTT frontrunners, Norton, followed the example of \nBMW and came to  the 1938 event with telescopic front \nforks, but  they were merely spring-controlled with no \nhydraulic element and gave just 2in  of travel. However, \nthey did  improve stability by reducing front wheel judder \nunder braking. Meanwhile, manufacturers of  traditional \ngirder \nfront \nforks, \nlike \nWebbs, \nwere \nstill \nexperimenting \nto  \nimprove \ntheir \nproducts. \nThe \nNorton \nfactory’s \natten- \ntion \nwas \nbeing \ndiverted \nfrom \nracing \nby \nthe \nneed \nto \nfulfill \ncontracts \nfor \nthe \narmy, \nbut \nJoe \nCraig \nknew \nthey \ncould \nnot \nstand \nstill \nand \nworked \nto \nachieve \na little \nmore \npower \nfrom \nchanged \nengine \nbore \nand \nstroke \ndimensions, \nan \nincrease \nin \ncompression \nratios \nto \n8.3:1 \n(500cc) \nand \n8.6:1 \n(350cc), \nplus \nincreased \nfinning \nto \nhead \nand \nbarrel. \nThe \ncompany \ncustom- \narily \nused \nearly-season \nIrish \nroad \nraces, \nlike \nthe \nLeinster \n200 \nand \nNorth \nWest \n200, \nto \ntry \nnew \nideas \nbefore \nthe \nTT. \nVelocette was another company running models with a \nlong ancestry that received year-on-year development. By \n1938 they had reached the KTT Mk VII versions, with their \nover-the-counter 350 giving 27bhp at  6,500rpm and the \n500  yielding 34bhp at 7,000rpm. More was available from \ntheir works development models. \nBMW returned in  1938 with a  three-man team of Jock \nWest, Georg Meier and Karl Gall, with ‘Kompressor’ \nmachines that were said to have had engine heights raised to \nreduce the risk of grounding their projecting cylinder heads \nwhile cornering. As  an  indication of its  serious approach, \nthe BMW team spent two weeks on  the Isle of Man in early \nApril, learning the course on  roadster machines. Team \nmembers were accompanied by a physical trainer, who also \noversaw their diets with what was described as  ‘typical \nTeutonic thoroughness’. Much has  been written about the \npolitical aspect of BMW’s racing effort on  Nazi Germany’s \nbehalf in  the  late 1930s, and  at  the  1938 TT  the  threat of \nwar was in the  air. \nThe course was described prior to  the 1938 races as \n‘better than ever’, with the biggest improvement being the \nreconstruction of about 1%  miles of the  Mountain Road \nfrom just above The Cutting —  now known as  Guthrie’s \nMemorial. Experts reckoned that improvement would be \nworth 5 seconds a lap. There was  also road widening on  the \nLezayre stretch approaching Ramsey and further improve- \nments at  Greeba Castle. \nGLAMOUR \nDuring the 1930s the TT organizers worked to  incor- \nporate some glamour into the  event, with the  start area \nbedecked with flags and  bunting, warming-up procedures \nheld in  sight of the  crowded Grandstand, freshly painted \nscoreboards, \npublic \naddress \nsystem \ngiving \nout \ninformation, \nadvertising \nbanners, \nand \nuniformed \nscouts \nbearing \nthe \nflags \nof \ncompeting \nnations \nto \nthe \nstart \nline. \nThe \nIsland’s \nLieutenant \nGovernor \nwas \ndriven \nalong \nthe \nGlencrutchery \nRoad \nand \ntook \nhis \nseat \nin \nthe \nGrandstand \njust \nbefore \nthe \nstart \nof \neach \nrace \nand \nthe \nstarts \nwere \nsignalled \nby \nthe \nfir- \ning \nof \na \nmaroon \nand \nthe \ndropping \nof \nthe \ntimekeeper’s \nflag."

      "text": "Ewald Kluge and his  DKW in \n1938. \nBut  there was a serious side to  this \nsporting event, for one magazine \nwrote: ‘Behind the  glamour of TT \nweek lies a  battle for  world busi- \nness, watched by every potential \npurchasing country with the  keen- \nest  interest’, with another saying, \n‘Successes scored on  the lengthy \nand demanding TT  course have a \nvalue all  of their own’. For  all  the \npotential monetary gains from, 11, \nsuccess, some were still in it purely \nfor the  prestige of a win. In Stanley \nWoods —  The World’s First Motorcycle \nSuperstar, David Crawford tells how \nMoto Guzzi had been contesting the  TT  since 1926, but \n‘As  they were a  small company with no  business interests \nin  Britain it was more a  personal ambition of its  directors \nthan a sales effort.’ \nAnother aspect of ‘glamour’ at the TT came from the high \nspeeds recorded, and 1938 saw  another lift.  Fastest 500  on \nthe Sulby Straight was Jock West at animpressive 130.4mph, \nfollowed by team mate Georg Meier at  121.6mph, a figure \nmatched by the fastest single of ‘Crasher’ White (Norton), \nwith his  team mates Frith and Daniell very close behind. \nOf the  350s, Stanley Woods hit  112.5mph on  his Velocette, \nwell clear of his  team mate Mellors at  107.1mph. Fastest \n250s were the DK Ws, with Ewald Kluge at  107.8mph and \nSiegfried Wunsche at  104mph. Those figures were set  in \npractice, during which BMW teamster Karl Gall crashed \nand  put himself out  of the  race. \nNORTON’S RUN ENDS \nAny thoughts that BMW’s ‘Teutonic thoroughness’ in \npreparation would be carried over to  the  Senior race were \ndashed by mechanical problems, which brought about Mei- \ner’s  retirement at  Quarter Bridge on  the  first lap, although \nJock West did  bring his  BMW home in  fifth place. It was \nthe less powerful but better-handling Norton and Velocette \nmachinery \nthat \ncontested \nthe \npodium \nplaces, \nwith \nvictory \ngoing \nto \nHarold \nDaniell \n(Norton), \nwho \nset \nnew \nrace \naverage \nand \nlap \nrecords, \nwith \nhis \nfastest \nbeing \nin \na \ntime \nof \n24 \nmin- \nutes \n52.6 \nseconds, \na \nspeed \nof \n91.00mph. \nIt \nwas \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nFAST FOREIGNERS Mf  55 \nthat the  25-minute barrier had  been broken. As  in  1937, \nStanley Woods (Velocette) was  just 15  seconds behind the \nwinner, with Freddie Frith (Norton) a  close third. \nAsked after the  race to  describe his  record lap, Daniell \ngave a  few  insights into the  bravery required to  lap at  over \n90mph. Speaking of the  sweeping downhill curves at  the \nEleventh Milestone, he told how he took them flat  in  top, \nusing every inch of the  road, adding ‘the procedure is not \nrecommended for beginners’. Of the  series of bends at Bir- \nkins he said ‘I have done it flat, but don’t like  to’, while the \nThirty-third Milestone was ‘nearly flat out’. \nIn  the  Junior race, Stanley Woods and his  Velocette \nended Norton’s seven years’ winning run in  the  class. He \nwas not  unduly pressed and rode a  controlled race at  just \nunder record speed, although he did  set  a new lap record of \n85.30mph. Firms like  Mobiloil, Dunlop, Ferodo and  Amal \nwere amongst those sponsoring Stanley and all were pleased \nto advertise his success. Mellors (Velocette) was  second and \nFrith (Norton) third. One possible reason that Norton did \nnot  really challenge for the win  was  that Joe Craig is said to \nhave geared all his  bikes for totally calm conditions, while \nthe  race was run  in blustery winds. \nDKW at  last  matched speed to  reliability with victory \nin  the  Lightweight, Ewald Kluge romping home some 11 \nminutes ahead of ‘Ginger’ Wood and  his  Excelsior.

After \nmany years of domination, Norton were not there with new \nworks bikes, because pressure to meet military contracts at \nthe factory meant that their riders had to make do with 1938 \nmachinery. They had also lost their Competitions Manager, \nJoe Craig, who moved to  BSA. By contrast, BMW were \npresent with a three-man team on  their latest supercharged \nmodels. Germany was also represented by works entries \nfrom NSU and  DKW. \nThe ever-present Velocette factory had announced its \nKTT Mk VIII model at  the 1938 Motorcycle Show and \nhad  works versions of the  single-cylinder racer for  Stanley \nWoods and Ted Mellors. It  also brought its  new super- \ncharged twin-cylinder ‘Roarer’ to the  Island, although it \nhad  only one  exploratory run  before being put to  one  side. \nAJS were present, having added water-cooling and  weight \nto  their supercharged fours to  be  ridden by Walter Rusk \nand  Bob Foster, but  Excelsior were absent. They issued an \nadvertisement that explained that the  fulfilment of mili- \ntary contracts took precedence over racing. They had no \nchoice in  the  matter, having received government direc- \ntives to switch production, although the former works bikes \ndid  appear at  the  1939 TT  as  private entries, including an \nexperimental 500. \nWar was  looming and  everyone knew it, but racing was \ndue  to  go ahead, albeit in a strained atmosphere. \nRACE WEEK \nPractice \nnow \nincluded \nthree \nevening \nsessions \nand \nracing \nfollowed \nthe \ncustomary \nTT \nprogramme: \nMonday \nwas \nJun- \nior \nrace \nday, \nWednesday \nwas \nfor \nthe \nLightweights \nand \nFri- \nday for the  Senior race.

Nevertheless, the  early laps turned \ninto a  close battle between Stanley Woods (Velocette), \nFreddie Frith (Norton) and  Heiner Fleischmann (DKW), \nwith Harold Daniell (Norton) and  Les  Archer (Velocette) \nnot  far behind. The lead chopped and changed, before Frith \nretired at  Ballaugh and Daniell recovered from sliding off \nin  Parliament Square to  challenge Woods at  the  head of \nthe  field. At the  finish it was Stanley Woods who took his \ntenth TT  victory, followed closely by Harold Daniell, with \nHeiner Fleischmann third.

      "text": "CHAP PERSFOUR \nPOST-WAR \nPROGRESS \nIn the years immediately following the  Second World War, \nBritain was  a  land of austerity, but  even such major obsta- \ncles to  motorcycle racing as  petrol rationing and an  absence \nof new machines could not  hold back over six years of pent- \nup  enthusiasm for  the  sport. Meetings started to  be  run \non  former airfields in  1946 and the  MGP brought racing \nback to  the  Isle  of Man later the  same year. In  1947 the TT \nreturned, bringing a mix of experienced pre-war riders and \nmany who were new to  the Mountain Course. It also came \nwith an  additional event called the  Clubmans TT, which \nwas  open to those without international racing experience, \nriding standard production motorcycles. \n1947: MACHINERY \nThe 1947 TT  attracted 109 entries in  the  International \nraces and sixty-four in  the  Clubmans. It was an  excellent \nturn-out of riders, but  where were all  the  bikes to  come \nfrom? Most dug out  pre-war models, including the  Norton \nfactory, which brought a  four-man team to  ride its  1938 \nrace bikes. Former competitions manager Joe  Craig had \nreturned to  Norton and  he uprated the pre-war bikes with \nnew hydraulically damped front forks and modified plung- \nA \nfactory-fresh \nVelocette \n350cc \nKTT \nMk  \nVIII \nin  \n1947. \ners  at the rear of its  ‘garden-gate’ frame. The company also \nstarted production of a racer for sale to  the  general public. \nCalled the  Manx and  priced at  £298, it was based on  the \npre-war single ohc engine of c1936. Made in 350 and  500cc \nform, it was  in short supply. \nVelocette returned with a  mixture of old  and new for \ntheir riders, and  of the  works bikes it was said ‘the major- \nity of the bottom-end parts were pre-war stuff’. They were \nmaking new racers, but  with only three men in  their race \nshop, each taking several weeks to  produce a KTT model \nfrom scratch, they had few  bikes for sale. \nMeanwhile, the  enthusiastic Moto Guzzi concern sup- \nplied a retired-from-racing Stanley Woods with a new 250 \nand  a  500, on  which he entered Manliffe Barrington in the \nLightweight and Freddie Frith in the  Senior. \nAJS had been busy and brought a  brand-new model for \nexperienced riders Les Graham and Jock West to ride. Built \npurely as  a  factory racer, it gained the  nickname ‘Porcu- \npine’ due to  its  spiked cooling fins. It  was an  air-cooled \n500cc laid-down twin of unit construction, with geared \nprimary drive and  gear driven twin ohc. Housed in an  all- \nwelded frame and with telescopic front forks and swinging- \narm rear suspension, its  claimed dry \nweight was  310Ib (141kg). \nThe Triumph name was repre- \nsented by several private owners on \ntwins. Perhaps they had been encour- \naged by Ernie Lyons’ victory in  the \n1946 MGP, on  a  Triumph whose \nengine used components from a  war- \ntime generator. \nRiders in the  new Clubmans event \nfaced similar difficulties in  obtaining \nmachines to  race. Dealers had to  be \ncajoled into supplying bikes from their \nlimited allocations of new models and \nsome were provided on  condition that \nthey went straight back to  the supply- \ning \ndealer \nafter \nthe \nrace, \nfor \nresale \nto \na hungry retail market."

This was an  unbranded petrol derived from the \npooled products of various suppliers. It was unreliable in \nquality and  thus lacked the  consistency that was so  impor- \ntant to  tuners setting up racing engines. It also necessitated \nlowering compression ratios from pre-war figures of close \nto  10:1 to  something like 7.5:1, plus changes to  carbura- \ntion. The overall effect was said to  reduce the  output of a \n500cc engine by some 8bhp. \nAt the end of 1946 the sport’s ruling body banned super- \ncharging, thus creating a level playing field on  the induction \nfront. \nSPEEDS \nThe speed-starved spectators who thronged the  roadside \nbanks at  the 1947 TT hardly noticed the difference in \nriders’ performance from pre-war years, but the speed \ntrap figures from Sulby Straight revealed the expected \nreduction in  maximum figures. The very best pre-war \nspeeds from 500 singles ridden by top riders were just \nover 120mph. Fastest in  1947 was Bob Foster on  his works \nVelocette at  114.68mph, with the  next fastest grouped at \n109mph. \nIt wasa similar story for the 350s, where the pre-war best \nwas 112.5mph and post-war 107.81mph. There was a  big- \nger  differential among the  Lightweights, with the  pre-war \nfastest being 107.80mph and post-war 92.31mph. How- \never, that was not  a like-with-like comparison, for the fast- \nest  bikes pre-war were the  particularly speedy two-stroke \nDKWs, while in  1947 it was  the four-stroke Moto Guzzi of \nManliffe Barrington. A better comparison was  with Stanley \nWoods 1939 speed of just on  100mph, achieved on  a similar \nMoto Guzzi. \nIn the new Clubmans classes, the highest speeds achieved \nat  Sulby were: \nSenior: Eric Briggs (Norton) —  98.92mph \nJunior: Dennis Parkinson (Norton) —  93.28mph \nLightweight: Bill Jenness (Excelsior) —  74.09mph \nBoth \nBriggs \nand \nParkinson \nrode \n1939 \nInternational \nmod- \nels \nwith \ngirder \nforks, \nand \nthe \nExcelsior \nwas \nalso \na \npre-war \nmachine. \nThere \nwere \nno  \nmajor \nchanges \nto \nthe \ncourse \nfor  \n1947, \nbut \nsome \neasing \nof \nthe  \nThirty-third \nMilestone \ndid  \nhelp \nrider \nprogress, \neven \nif, \nas \nErnie \nLyons \nsaid, \nthis \nhad \n‘taken \nall \nthe \nfun \nout \nof \nit’. \nPOST-WAR PROGRESS #59 \nCome the  racing in  1947, while it was keen and closely \ncontested, both race average and fastest lap speeds were \ndown in  all  classes. In  the  Senior it was by almost 7mph, \nin  the  Junior by about 4mph and in  the  Lightweight by \n5mph. The three winners were Harold Daniell (Norton) \nin  the  Senior; Bob Foster (Velocette) in  the  Junior; and \nManliffe Barrington (Moto Guzzi) in  the  Lightweight. All \nwere experienced pre-war TT  riders, so  newcomer Artie \nBell’s second place in the  Senior on  a Norton was  seen as  a \nparticularly good effort. \n1948: STEADY PROGRESS \nThere were several course improvements over the  winter \nthat helped rider speed, including cutting back the bank on \nthe apex at Hillberry —  which was  now taken at 90—100mph \n—  widening at  Cronk ny Mona and the  eradication of sev- \neral adverse cambers in  Ramsey. However, the  restraining \neffect of ‘Pool’ petrol continued to  be felt, and while race \nspeeds were slightly up on  1947, they were still well under \nrecord pace. \nManufacturers continued to make progress with machine \ndevelopment. Moto Guzzi fitted telescopic front forks to its \n500 and the  brave Omobono Tenni found these to  his  lik- \ning, being much the fastest man down Bray Hill in practice \nat  120mph, with other fast  men around 112mph. Norton \nwere still racing their modified 1938 TT  models, while \nearly in the  year Triumph launched a  500cc twin-cylinder \n‘Grand Prix’ model for  racing. It came with components \nfrom the generator-based engine and  with sprung-hub rear \nsuspension, Seven were entered for  the  Senior race, but \nnone finished. Velocette still used girder front forks, and \nalthough Freddie Frith did  try  a  pair of Dowty telescopic \nones during practice, his opinion was that just bolting on  a \npair of ‘teles’ was not  enough and  that the frame needed to \nbe redesigned to  suit. \nIt  fell to  AJS to  introduce the only really new race \nmachine in  1948. Designed as  an  over-the-counter racer \nfor sale to the general public, the new model was  called the \n7R  and  was to  remain in production for many years. It was \na  350cc single with chain-driven ohc engine, 74mm bore 1 \nand  81mm stroke, said  to give 29bhp at  6,800rpm. Engine ~ \ncastings were in magnesium, finished in a distinctive corro- \nsion-inhibiting gold paint. It had  a cradle-type frame, front \nand rear suspension, the  usual four-speed gearbox with \nexposed primary drive and, in  a  move being tried by oth- \ners, a twin leading-shoe front brake. \nThe 7R  came with narrow section tyres of 3.00 X  21 \nfront and 3.25 X  20 rear. During practice the  factory even \ntried a  3.00 rear in the  quest for speed, for it was  not  quite \nas  quick as  the  Velocette KTTs and Manx Nortons."

The first \nthree places went to Norton men Artie Bell, Bill Doran and \nJock Weddell, with Bell’s race aver- \nage speed being 84.97mph and Tenni \nsetting the  fastest lap at  88.06mph, \nalmost 3mph below Harold Daniell’s \n1938 record of  91.00mph.

He  also \nachieved the  fastest lap at 76.72mph, \nfinishing well clear of the string of \npre-war British bikes that followed \nhim home. \nIn  the  Junior, it  was Velocette \nwho showed their class with a  win \nand fastest lap for  Freddie Frith at \n82.45mph, with similarly mounted \nBob Foster some 4 minutes behind. \nThe new  AJS 7Rs put up a good show- \ning, although no  one  could match the \ncheeky fourth place that Geoff Mur- \ndoch achieved when he  rode one in \nthe  Senior race later in  the  week. It \nwas a  time when riders who had to \nwatch the  cost of racing often chose \nto  buy a  350, as  they could usually \nenter 500cc races on  the  same bike, \nso  getting twice the number of rides. \nThe Senior Clubmans TT was \nfor  machines up  to  1,000cc.

Freddie \nFrith finished the  year as  350cc champion on  his Velocette \nand  Les  Graham as  500cc champion on  his AJS Porcupine. \nSpeaking in  later years, Frith said, “The TT  was the  Blue \nRiband of racing then, worth more than a World Champi- \nonship to  people in the  sport’. \nIn the Clubmans TT, the Junior, Senior and new 1,000cc \nraces of  1949 were reduced from four laps to  three and \nrefuelling was banned. This turned the  race for the  thirst- \nier  1,000cc machines into an  economy run won by Dennis \nLashmar \n(Vincent) \nat \n76.30mph. \nThe \nfastest \n1,000cc \nlap \n— \n85.57mph by Chris Horn —  gave a much better indication of \nVincent performance, but he, and other quick Vincent run- \nners like George Brown, ran  out  of fuel.

Having availed himself of a \npiece of string for  a  belt, Phil trudged to  the  nearest rail \nhalt and took the  local narrow-gauge steam train to  Peel, \nsitting in a compartment with several ladies and their shop- \nping baskets, off to  do nothing more exciting than a  bit of \nshopping.

Others were taken in  and served \ntea  and cakes by local homeowners, whilst many made it to \nthe local pub and  were generally plied with free drinks, so \nhelping them overcome the  disappointment of their break- \ndowns. \nINTO A NEW DECADE \nAs  the  TT  moved into the  1950s, the  early years of the \ndecade would later be seen as  a period of transition. It was \na  time when the  Norton marque extended its  competitive \nracing life  with a  new frame, Velocette began to  fade and \nAJS maintained a strong challenge, as  did  the  enthusiastic \nMoto Guzzi concern. Other Italian manufacturers were \nalso interested in the  TT. Benelli already had provenance \nat  the  event, Mondial would mount a successful challenge \nwith Lightweights, MV Agusta were on  their way with \nLightweights and  4-cylinder 500s, and  they would be  fol- \nlowed by the  similarly equipped Gilera concern. Most of \nthe  Italian firms were already contesting and winning at \nContinental GP  level and  there was the  likelihood of Ger- \nman marques such as  BMW and NSU being \nreadmitted to  racing. \n1950: THE  ‘FEATHERBED’ \nHarold Daniell had raced Norton motorcycles \naround the  Mountain Course since 1930, using \nrigid, plunger and  plunger/tele frames. He  was \nin  a  good position to  judge the  new frame that \nNorton introduced in  1950 and was sufficiently \nimpressed to  call it  the ‘Featherbed’. As  lap \nrecord holder on  the  Mountain Course, Dan- \niell  knew in those early post-war years that his \nbasic plunger rear suspension was a  limiting \nfactor in  determining how fast he  could go. \nIt  was the old story of  matching power to \nhandling, for by now Norton had  some 40-plus \nbhp on  tap  but without the road-holding to \nmatch. \nDesigned \nby \nRex \nMcCandless, \nNorton’s \nnew \ndouble- \nloop \ncradle \nframe \nwas \na \nbrazed \nstructure \nof \nthin-walled \ntube, \nwhich \nproved \nsuperior \nto \nthe \nold \ngarden-gate \nstyle \nin \npre-season \ntesting. \nComing \nwith \na \ncontoured \npetrol \ntank, \nrear-set \nfootrests \nand \nlowered \nbars, \nit encouraged \nriders \nto \nadopt \na more \ncrouched \nstyle \nin \nthe \nsearch \nfor \nmaximum \nspeed. \nThe adoption of the featherbed frame extended the com- \npetitive life  of Norton’s ageing single when, although con- \ntemplating a  new multi-cylinder engine, the  Bracebridge \nStreet concern did  not  proceed with it.  However, they did \ncontinue to  improve their single-cylinder engines. These \ncame with new heads that dropped the  bronze inner skull \nand were all  aluminium. They also had the  bevel hous- \ning for  the  ohc drive cast integrally, changes to  finning, \nsteel valve seats and so  on.  It was typical of the  step-by- \nstep modifications that had  been a  trademark of Joe Craig \nand  Norton for  so  many years and  which kept other firms \nbusy trying to  match them. There was a  trend to  smaller \nwheels, and  a  new Amal carburettor, later to  become the \nGP, was  in selective use  by the Norton and AJS camps. Also \non  the  topic of carburation, Motor Cycling wrote: ‘methods \nof mounting remote float chambers with a view to  stabiliz- \ning levels and insulation from heat, were, incidentally, as \nvaried as  the  stars in the heavens’. \nPre-war sit-up riding styles were changing, aided by \nrear-set footrests, longer seats and  fuel tanks styled to  give \nsome support to  a rider adopting a leaning forward style. \nEXPECTATIONS \nPetrol rationing ended in  Britain and this boosted TT \ncrowds in  1950, when the  well-subscribed International \nAt  \na \ntime \nwhen \nthe \ntrend \nwas \nto  \nreduce \nwheel \nsize, \nthe \nolder \nstyle \n2lin \nfront \nand \n20in \nrear \nof \nthe \nVincent \nGrey \nFlash \nare \nvery \napparent \nas \nKen \nBills \ntackles \nCronk \nny \nMona."

Sub- \nsequent performances in  practice showed that, come race \ntime, existing records would be under threat. \nRECORDS BROKEN \nRace week in  1950 started with the Junior 350cc machines. \nIt was a  race in  which Artie Bell led  a  trio of Nortons to \nrecord-breaking victory, leaving the lap record at 86.33mph \nand beating Stanley Woods record of 85.30mph, set  back in \n1938.

A close tussle followed between Benelli-mounted \nDario Ambrosini and Maurice Cann on  a home-engineered \nMoto Guzzi. Cann led for most of the race, but Ambrosini \nsnatched victory by one-fifth of a second, setting a new lap \nrecord of 80.91mph, some 12  seconds faster than Ewald \nKluge’s record from 1938 on  a DKW. \nWednesday of race week was Clubmans day and races \nwere back to  four laps, with refuelling allowed. In another \njuggle with the regulations, riders had  to  perform the  nor- \nmal kick start but  with cold engines. It was a  change that \nwas to  cause problems, as  did  the  slightly damp and misty \nconditions that kept speeds slightly below those set in 1949. \nTHE  OBJECT? \nWatching crowds had  been thrilled by the  high-speed rac- \ning of 1950, in both International and Clubmans events. But \nwhatever they got from watching their chosen sport, Motor \nCycling magazine was of the  opinion that for  British manu- \nfacturers ‘the true object of the  TT  was to  develop and \nin  the \nhope that they will demonstrate the  supremacy of British \ndemonstrate the  high-performance motorcycle ... \nmachines’.

It  ran  over \ntwo laps, while the  250cc Lightweights had  their race dis- \ntance reduced from seven to  four laps. Junior and Senior \nraces continued to  be  run over seven laps, a  distance of \n2641 miles. That was a long way to  maintain 100  per cent \nconcentration and apply consistent riding skill. Indeed, one \nmissed gearchange could ruin an  engine and all the  weeks \nof effort invested in a TT  appearance. \nEntry numbers continued to  increase, with ninety-eight \nSeniors comprising nine makes, 100 Juniors and five makes, \nforty Lightweights with sixteen makes and thirty-one Ultra \nLightweights with seventeen makes. In  addition, although \nthe Lightweight and 1000cc Clubmans classes had been \ndropped due to  lack of entries, there were 169  Clubman \nentries across the  remaining 350 and 500cc races. \nThe average British race fan  was most interested in  the \nJunior and Senior International classes, but was still keen to \nsee  what the  four-stroke Italian Mondials and  MV Agustas \nwould do  in  the Ultra Lightweight class, along with the \nSpanish Montesa two-strokes. The latter ran  on  a  10:1 pet- \nrol/oil ratio and carried a  reserve oil  tank controlled by a \ntap, which the rider operated to  provide an  extra drip-feed \nof oil  on  the  Mountain climb. Outputs of some 13bhp at \n10,000rpm were spoken of for the  Mondials, with 11/2bhp \nat  9,500rpm for  the  Montesas. That was well above the \npower produced by the  remainder of the  field, made up by \nBritish DOTs, DMW, BSA, Sun and several home-brewed \nmachines. \nThat the  Mountain Course was going to  be a stern chal- \nlenge for  contestants in  the  new 125cc TT  was revealed \nearly in  practice, after only nine machines lapped within \nthe 40-minute qualifying time. Following a meeting of the \nrace stewards, the qualifying time was  lifted to 45 minutes, \nbut still only eighteen starters came to  the  line. \nAs  ever, there was plenty to  catch the  interest in  the \nlarger classes. AJS had shorn the  Porcupine of its  spiked \nfins, worked on  its carburation, shortened the wheelbase by \nan  inch and  reduced wheel sizes to  19in. Their 7R also had \nreduced wheelbase and wheel size, revised front forks and a \ncompression ratio lifted to  9.4:1. Race teams were in their \nsecond year of working with 80  octane fuel, which was \nnow to  Air Ministry specification and consistent in quality. \nAfter \nearlier \nexperimentation \nby  \nVelocette, \nNorton \njoined \nthem \nin  \nadding \na \nreverse \ncone \non  \nthe  \nend \nof \ntheir \nmegaphones. \nThis \nwas \nbeneficial \nin  \naiding \nclean \nengine \npick-up \nand \nacceleration \nin \nthe \nlower \nrev \nrange, \nmore \nso \non \nthe \n350 \nthan \nthe \n500. \nIn \naddition, \nNorton \nwere \nnow \nsell- \nThis is the 500cc MV  Agusta with Les Graham (right), \nready to  weigh in at the 1953 TT.

Several makes showed slight \nenclosure of the  rear of the  seat and  tail  of the  mudguard. \nVelocette reduced their efforts in the  larger classes, but \ndid  produce several works 250s, although gearbox prob- \nlems put them out  of contention. \nOne big attraction in  the  Senior entry list was Les  Gra- \nham ona 4-cylinder MV Agusta. It proved fast and noisy in \npractice, but had  questionable handling. It was not  fancied \nfor  a  win and was described by journalist Charlie Rous as \n‘an ugly brute which certainly did not  look inviting to ride’. \nNORTON YET AGAIN \nThe Norton effort at the  1951 TT  was almost as  good as  in \n1950, with Geoff Duke being a double winner of Junior and \nSenior classes, during which he set new race average and lap \nrecords. He left the Senior figure at 95.22mph and the Jun- \nior  91.38mph.

The \nMondials were followed by two Mon- \ntesas, before Eric Hardy’s DOT led \nhome the  rest of the field. \nIn  the  two Clubmans races, there \nwere speed gains on  the previous year \nbut the overall lap record remained \nintact. Best times on the Sulby Straight \nfor  them were 109.77mph (Senior) \nand  104.07mph (Junior). \n1952: FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS \nRiders and manufacturers left  the  Island in  1951 to  spend \nthe  rest of the  summer contesting the  World Champion- \nships and  the  winter on  machine development, the  results \nof the latter being brought to the  1952 TT. Stories of winter \nactivities always leaked out  ahead of the  races, one  telling, \n‘From Monza ...  comes a report that ramps have been built \nthere to  enable an  Anglo-Italian race team to  test  the reac- \ntion of their latest frame to  high-speed hump-jumping’. It \ncould only have been Les  Graham and MV Agusta. Maybe \nit was  an  attempt to recreate Ballaugh Bridge. Handling had \nbeen a problem for the big MV in  1951 and would continue \nto  be the  subject of experimentation. The factory entered \nthree 500s in  1952, but only Graham turned up to ride. He \nwas also entered on  one  of the  company’s 125s, along with \nCecil Sandford. \nNorton had been busy and brought ‘square’ engines of \n85.93 X  86.00mm for  its  500s, which were said to  per- \nmit higher revs and give a 5—7mph increase in speed. Their \ncylinder finning now enclosed the cam drive, they had new \nmagnetos, rear suspension units had been given a slight \nforward lean, tyres were 3.50 X  18  rear for  the  350  Jun- \nior  machine and ‘outsize’ 4.00 X  16  versions for  the  500 \nSenior. \nAJS \nwere \nstill \nstriving \nfor \na \npost-war \nTT \nvictory \nand \nhad \nmuch \nmodified \nthe \nPorcupine, \nnow \ncalled \nthe \nE95 \nmodel, \nwith \n45 -degree \ncylinders \nand \nanew \nframe, \nwhile \nthe \nworks \n7R \nwas \nnow \nthe  \n3-valve \n7R3, \nwith \ntwo \nexhaust \nvalves \nand \nports. \nThey \nhad \nalso \nbuilt \na  \ntwin-cylinder \nracer \nbased \non \nA Matchless G45 twin-cylinder racer in action. \nthe  500cc Matchless Super Clubmans roadster engine in \na  7R  frame, which would go  on  sale to  the  public as  the \nMatchless G45. \nVelocette limited their works entries to  350 and 250 \ndohe models for  Les  Graham, which came with hydrauli- \ncally damped girder front forks, five-speed gearboxes and \ntwin leading-shoe front brake. \nMoto Guzzi concentrated their efforts on  the Light- \nweight class and, although they brought 4-valve head ver- \nsions, they stuck to  two valves for their three-man team at \nthe TT. Meanwhile, there were private entries on  Mondials \nin the  Ultra Lightweight class. \nCOURSE CONDITIONS \nThe Mountain Course was reported to  be in excellent con- \ndition, but  it was still a very rough-textured surface com- \npared to  that ridden over today. Road maintenance was in \nthe  era  of spread a layer of tar,  apply granite chippings, \nusually by hand, run  a  steam roller over them and  leave it \nto  everyday traffic to  do the rest. There was some attempt \nto mechanize the spreading of chippings, but it usually cre- \nated a lined surface, which was  not welcome when cranking \nover for a bend. Bare patches of tar  soon appeared and  the \nexposed tar  would melt under hot conditions. \nJournalist and racer Vic  Willoughby was  not  happy with \nroad conditions and  wrote of ‘ghastly undulations between \nKeppel Gate and Kate’s Cottage’, which upset the handling. \nThe organizers took a positive step to improve safety by set- \nting back the  concrete fence posts on  several of the  Moun- \ntain bends."

Some do  actually burst \nonto the  scene with a  podium finish, but most serve an \napprenticeship over several years. In  addition to  the  estab- \nlished stars, the early 1950s brought developing TT careers \nfor men like  Bill  Lomas, Rod Coleman, Ken Kavanagh, Ray \nAmm, Cecil Sandford, Reg Armstrong, Bob McIntyre, \nJohn Surtees and several foreign riders. \nTHE RACING \nWinter machine developments often received early-season \ntry-outs on  short circuits, but the real test came in  June \nwhen ridden over the  Mountain Course. AJS had  cause for \noptimism in  1952 when they finished practice for the Junior \nrace with the three fastest times. However, come race day, \nGeoff Duke (Norton) took an  early lead, rode to signals that \ncontrolled his pace, broke the  Junior race average (but not \nthe  lap record), and  won by 1’  minutes from team mate \nReg Armstrong. AJS had  to  settle for third place with Kiwi \nRod Coleman. \nThe Senior looked as  though it might go the  same way, \nwith Duke in the lead on  the  fifth lap, when clutch trouble \nforced his  retirement. This left Reg Armstrong to  catch \nand  then hold off the  strong challenge of Les  Graham (MV \nAgusta), to win  at a race average speed of 92.97mph— about \nImph slower than the  previous year. Ray Amm (Norton) \nwas third and Rod Coleman brought the  new Porcupine \ninto fourth. Perhaps it was ‘the luck of the  Irish’, but  just \nas  Reg Armstrong crossed the  line to  win the  Senior, his \nprimary chain snapped and  he lost  all drive \nThe \nLightweight \nrace \nturned \ninto \nthe \nexpected \nfight \namongst \nMoto \nGuzzi \nriders \nand \nwent \nto \nveteran \nFergus \nAnderson \nfrom \nEnrico \nLorenzetti, \nat a \nrecord \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nof \n8 3.82mph, \nwith \nBruno \nRuffo \nsetting \nthe \nfastest \nlap \nat \na \nnew \nrecord \nspeed \nof \n84.82mph. \nPerhaps \nindicative \nof \nthe \npassion \nthat \nMoto \nGuzzi \nput \ninto \ntheir \nracing, \nFergus \nreceived \na \ncongratulatory \ntelegram \nfrom \nthe \npresteene \nof \nMoto \nGuzzi, \nGiorgio \nParodi, \nworded \n‘Bravo, \nBravissimo. \nI \nkiss \nyou’, \nThe Ultra Lightweight race distance was increased from \ntwo to  three laps and  Cecil Sandford gave MV Agusta their \nfirst TT  victory at  record race and  lap speeds, ahead of the \nMondials of Carlo Ubbiali and Len Parry. \nIn winning the Senior Clubmans race ona Triumph twin \nat  over 80mph, Bernard Hargreaves still fell  slightly short \nof the  race and lap times set  by Geoff Duke back in  1949. \nThe Junior Clubmans did see  a  new race average speed \nrecord for winner Eric Housely (BSA) and  a  record fastest \nlap for  Bob McIntyre (BSA). It was the  fourth consecutive \nJunior victory for BSA. \nA magazine of the  day summed up  the 1952 TT  by say- \ning, ‘it was richly rewarding, whether viewed through the \neyes of the  spectator in  search of thrills or  those of the \ntechnician in search of data’. \n1953: A RECORD YEAR \nWherever one looked at  the 1953 TT  there were record- \nbreaking statistics. Entries for the  International races were \nthe  highest ever, foreign machines and riders were there \nin the  greatest mune yet seen and records were broken \nin  most of the  racing. It was only in  the  Clubmans classes \nwhere numbers were down. \nBy March the returning BMW \nmarque had its  sole representative, \nWalter Zeller, spending three weeks \non  the Island learning the course on \nan  R68 road bike. He  was followed by \nNSU teamsters Bill  Lomas and Werner \nHaas. Norton tried to fit ina quiet visit, \nbut  as  they brought their experimental \n350cc ‘kneeler’ streamlined model, \nthey became the  centre of attention. \nThere were fifty-one finishers in \nthe 1952 Junior TT -  twenty-three \nrode AJS 7R  models like this one, \nseventeen were on  Nortons and \neleven on  Velocettes. \nSN \nSSS SS"

It certainly \nseemed to  assist those riding bikes of more than one  cylin- \nder, for fastest was  Les Graham (MV Agusta) at  137.43mph, \nfollowed by Dickie Dale (Gilera) 135.38mph, Bill  Doran \n(AJS) 135.38mph, Geoff Duke (Gilera) 135.30mph, then \nReg Armstrong (Gilera) and Rod Coleman (AjS) before, \nin seventh place came the fastest single, that of Ken Kavan- \nagh (Norton) at  131.43mph. However, Sulby Straight was \nnot  regarded by many as  the  fastest place on  the  course \nand  speeds quoted in  the  1950s were average ones over a \ndistance of a  mile, rather than a  flash reading taken at  the \nfastest point. This meant that talk of  140mph maximum \nspeed from the  fours was clearly credible, and rumour \nsaid the  Gilera was  capable of nearer 150mph. This was all \nheady stuff on  unstreamlined motorcycles, but while speed \nalone may have been enough to  bring victory on  some con- \ntinental circuits, everyone knew that the Mountain Course \nrequired handling and  stamina to  match. \nJack Brett (Norton) was  the fastest Junior at  124.14mph, \nBill Lomas (NSU) fastest Lightweight at  an  incredible \n118.45mph, and  Cecil Sandford (MV Agusta) fastest Ultra \nLightweight at  100.57mph. \nWith such high speed-trap figures allied to  fast  practice \nlap times, it came as  little surprise when race average and \nlap records were broken in  the  Ultra Lightweight race by \nwinner Les  Graham (MV Agusta), in  the  Lightweight by \nFergus Anderson (Moto Guzzi), in the Junior by Ray Amm \n(Norton) and  in both Junior and  Senior Clubmans races. \nCome the  Friday of race week, everyone was  ready for a \nrecord-breaking battle of the  500s —  fours, twins and sin- \ngles.

Under pressure \nfrom Italy, possible power or  capacity restrictions were the \nsubject of an  agenda item at  the  FIM Autumn Congress, \nalong with thoughts of Formula racing. The latter would \nprobably fall  somewhere between the Clubmans TT  and \nthe  racing of sports motorcycles, which was \npopular in Italy. \nThe proposals to  the FIM were aimed \ndirectly at  improving the  safety of riders.

And for  a  short while \nthey did. \n1954: SIDECARS RETURN \nEarly news for  1954 was of the  reintroduc- \ntion of a  Sidecar TT race for  machines of \n500cc. As  the available practice time over \nthe Mountain Course was limited, a  new \ncourse was found for  the  ‘chairs’, called the \nClypse Circuit. Approximately 11  miles in \nlength, it travelled the  reverse direction of \nthe  Mountain Course from Cronk ny Mona \nto  Creg ny Baa and then went eastwards over \ncountry roads, to  return via  Onchan to  the \nGrandstand.

One of the best \nplaces to  do  this was on  the  Sulby Straight. At  full  throt- \ntle  the  rider would pull in  the  clutch, cut  the  engine and \nbrake to  a standstill at the end  of the  straight.

Amongst those admir- \ning  the 1954 NSUs, and taking many photographs, was \nSoichiro Honda. The head of the  Japanese firm was on  a \nfact-finding mission, with a view to building race machines \nto  contest the  World Championships. \n1955: BIG-NAME DEPARTURES \nEarly in  1955, ashock announcement from Norton revealed \nthat they were withdrawing from the World Champion- \nships and, in their words, ‘reverting to  a  policy of racing a \ntype of machine which can  be sold to  private owners’. That \nmeant over-the-counter racers. However, they did  intend \nto  send works machines to  contest the  TT, ridden by two \n21-year-old riders, John Surtees and  John Hartle, adding \nthat their machines ‘would probably incorporate features \nthat would be  included in  next season’s production mod- \nels’. Norton partly explained their action by decrying the \nspecialist nature of 4-cylinder race machines, the  move \nfrom road circuits to  purpose-built tracks and the  use  of \nstreamlining. \nA week later, AJS and  Matchless announced they were \nto  follow the  same route as  Norton. Their decision marked \nthe  end for the  factory Porcupine and  left  the  AJS 7R  and \nMatchless G45 being manufactured for sale to  the  public. \nNorton, Matchless and  AJS were three marques whose \nnames went back to the early days of the TT and their works \nentries would be  missed in  the bigger classes of champi-"

Amongst the  Lightweights, the  highly suc- \ncessful NSU concern also decided to  withdraw its  125 \nand 250cc works bikes, although it did  go  on  to  produce \nthe  250cc Sportmax production racer. With an  output of \n30bhp, it proved a competitive machine. \nOn  more general issues, the  fuel to  be  used at  the  TT \nwas still 80 octane, there was a straightening of the  road at \nthe pits, resurfacing elsewhere and  several minor improve- \nments. The Clubmans was  moved to  the  Clypse, where all \nraces were reduced to  nine laps. \nTyres gave little trouble at the TT, but Dunlop brought a \nnew directional rear, which included knife cuts across the \nblocks and  on  the  sides to  improve grip under wet condi- \ntions.

While hoping to  supply plenty of \ntyres for  racing, Dunlop also supported riders by fitting \ntheir tyres and by providing tubes, rim tapes, security \nbolts, balance weights, stout rubber bands, French chalk \nfor  handlebar grips, and by checking pressures and tem- \nperatures before and  after a race. \nStreamlining was now in  common use in  continental \nraces, but  some riders were concerned about the  effect of \ncross-winds on  the  Mountain Course. Accordingly, a  mix- \nture of streamlined and  unstreamlined bikes were out  dur- \ning practice sessions. It was still early days for this form of \nwind-cheating, but  it was said to  give a  gain equivalent to \n4bhp, usually allowed a raising of gearing and  reduced fuel \nconsumption, but put more demands upon the  brakes. \nGeoff \nDuke \nrides \nhis  \nGilera \nto  \nvictory \nin \nthe \n1955 \nSenior \nTT, \ntaking \nthe  \nbridge \nat \nUnion \nMills \nwith \nboth \nwheels \noff \nthe \nground \nwhile \ncranked \nover. \nThe \nfirst \nthree \nfinishers \nin \nthe \nJunior \nrace \nwere \non  \nfully \nfaired \nmodels \n—  \nBill  \nLomas \n(Moto \nGuzzi), \nBob \nMcIntyre \n(Norton) \nand  \nCecil \nSandford \n(Moto \nGuzzi). \nLomas \nlifted \nthe \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nrecord \nby \nalmost \nImph \nin \nhis \nnon- \nstop \nrun, \nbut \nthe \nlap \nrecord \nstayed \nintact, \nwhile \nsecond- \nplace \nMcIntyre \nreported \nstreamline-induced \nhandling \ndif- \nficulties \nin \nsome \nof the \nwindy \nlocations. \nIt \nwas \na \nrace \nin \nwhich \nflies \ngave \ntrouble, \nas \nthey \nplastered \nfairings, \nscreens \nand \ngoggles, \ninterfering \nwith \nriders’ \nvision. \nThirty \nyears \nearlier, \nGraham \nWalker \nhad \ngiven \nhis \npersonal \nremedy \nfor \nthat \nproblem: \n‘a sucked \nglove \nfinger \nquickly \napplied \n[to \nthe \ngoggles] \non \na \nfine \nday \nwill \nremove \nsquashed \nflies \nbefore \nthey \ncongeal’, \nMORE DISAPPOINTMENT \nCome Friday’s Senior race of  1955, the 100mph lap was \nagain on  peoples’ minds. Geoff Duke (Gilera) broke the \nexisting lap record from a  standing start and thereafter \npulled away from his  team mate Reg Armstrong, further \nupping the  lap record as  he went. Upon completion of his \nthird circuit it  was announced that he  had achieved the \n100mph lap and there was  cheering in the crowded Grand- \nstand. Shortly after, it  was announced that he  had actu- \nally just missed the  100mph lap, recording 99.97mph, less \nthan a second short of the elusive ‘ton’. Grandstand crowds \nbooed in  disappointment, but  Duke rode on  unaware and \nintent only on  taking victory. In this he was successful, and \nafter his seven laps he finished 2 minutes ahead of Reg Arm- \nstrong, setting new race average \nand lap records. Both Gileras had \nmodest handlebar fairings, although \nit was said that fully faired versions \nwere some 20 seconds a lap faster in \ncalm weather. \nWith works teams from only \nGilera, Moto Guzzi, Norton and \nMatchless contesting the Senior \nrace it was left  to  British over-the- \ncounter racers to  make up  most of \nthe  field of seventy-seven starters. \nAmong them were some forty- \nfive Manx Nortons and nineteen \nMatchless G45s. The latter model \nhad  become popular, and one gave \nDerek Ennett a  sixth-place finish. \nA report of the  time told that G45 \nengines had to  show a  minimum \nof 48bhp on  the  factory test bench \nbefore being installed in  a  new \nmachine."

Sixteen \nothers, including Reg Armstrong, were also suspended for \nperiods of four to  six  months. As  their suspension periods \nran  from 1 January 1956, it put some of them out  of the TT. \n1956: FEWER VISITORS \nThe 1956 TT  saw a fall  in visitor numbers, and  most com- \nmentators felt  that this was due to  the  absence of Geoff \nDuke. Of  course, the  remaining riders were capable of \nputting on  excellent racing, but the glamour associated \nwith the  top  man was missing and  people stayed away. It \nwas another lesson for  the  organizing ACU, who some \nfelt  could have done more to  support Geoff at  FIM level, \nalthough they had worries at the time about the  attitude of \nsome factions within the FIM towards the TT and its World \nChampionship status. \nMORE RIDERS \nDespite the decrease in spectator interest, the TT  still held \nits  magic attraction for  riders, with increased entries in \n1956. There had been the usual off-season turnover as riders \nswapped race teams, and one  was  John Surtees, who moved \nto MV Agusta. John was  no  doubt attracted by the news that \nthe 500-4 was  said to be yielding 70bhp at  10,500rpm, giv- \ning a top speed of 150mph. In contrast, Moto Guzzi works \nrunner, Bill Lomas, told how their 500cc single-cylinder \ngave only 45bhp. However, being light, streamlined, of low \nbuild and  with good handling, the  single could still harass \nthe fours, except on  pure power circuits. For  1956, the fac= \ntory dropped its tubular space frame and reverted to  using \na large-diameter top-tube version. \nDuring practice in 1956, a limited number of riders were \ntimed on  Sulby Straight and John Surtees was  the fastest 500 \nat  135.38mph, with Ken Kavanagh’s Moto Guzzi coming in \nat  133.33mph. On that very limited evidence it seemed that \nMoto \nGuzzi \nwere \nstill \non \nthe \npace, \nbut \nthey \nfelt \nthey \nwere \nbeginning to  be outrun and  were working on  both 4-  and \n8-cylinder racers. \nGilera \ntried \nto  \nrecruit \nBob \nMcIntyre \nto  \nride \ntheir \n500 \nat \nthe \n1956 \nTT \nin \nplace \nof \nthe \nsuspended \nGeoff \nDuke, \nbut \nMcIntyre \ndecided \nto \nstay \nwith \nhis \nsponsor, \nJoe \nPotts. \nNor- \nPOST-WAR PROGRESS Hb  73 \nTravelling marshal Colin Broughton takes his  radio- \nequipped Triumph through the approach to  Whitegates \nat  the 1956 TT. \nton  brought a  three-man team of John Hartle, Jack Brett \nand Alan Trow, but former manager Joe Craig was no \nlonger with them. AMC were represented by Frank Perris, \nDerek Ennett and Gavin Dunlop. \nHelping to  look after rider interests out  on  the  course \nwas a team of Triumph-mounted travelling marshals. Their \nbikes were equipped with experimental radios as  an  aid  to \ncommunications, but  with technology that still used glass \nvalves and the like, the radios did not take well to  the \npounding received over the  Mountain Course. \nMOUNTAIN COURSE \nApart from a little cutting back of the  bank at  Rhencul- \nlen  to  improve sightlines and easing of the  testing right- \nhander at  Ballagarey, the  course was relatively unchanged \nfor  1956. The latter bend was situated at  the  top of the  hill \nafter Union Mills. Some called it Glen Vine. Its importance \nwas recognized by John Surtees, who said: ‘If you  did  it all \nright, and went through absolutely on  the  limit, not  only \nwas it one of the  most satisfying things on  earth, but  you \nalso got a good run  at the hill  up into Crosby and down past \nThe Highlander.’ Surtees was a  thinking rider and knew \nthat maximum effort at  Ballagarey would pay  dividends in \nterms of increased mph over the  reasonably straight and \nundulating stretch that followed to  Greeba Castle. Those \nnot  prepared to  put in the commitment at Ballagarey would \nbe  slower over those following miles. It was a  classic TT \nsituation that was repeated at  other points on  the  course."

      "text": "74  M@  POST-WAR PROGRESS \nThe Junior and  Senior TT  were the  only International \nraces held over the Mountain Course in  1956 and it was  the \nMoto Guzzi of Ken Kavanagh that hounded John Surtees’ \nMV Agusta throughout the  Junior until Surtees ran  out  of \nfuel on  the Mountain on  his last lap. This allowed Kavanagh \nto  win, although no  records were broken. \nOn a bright and  dry Senior race day, when gusty winds \ntook the  edge off top  speeds, John Surtees took his  nose- \ncone faired MV  Agusta to  his  first TT  victory, with a  fast- \nest  lap of 97.79mph. Bill  Lomas (Moto Guzzi) held second \nuntil the last lap, when he slowed and finished fifth. Second \nand third finishers were John Hartle and Jack Brett on  their \nNortons. It was a  race in  which the  first six  places were \noccupied by five different makes: MV Agusta, Norton, \nMoto Guzzi, BMW and  Matchless. \nIn  a  strange move, the  National-status Clubmans races \ntook place over the Mountain Course, but on  the Thursday \nand Saturday of the  week after TT. They yielded a  dou- \nble  win for  Bernard Codd on  BSA Gold Stars, but  turned \nout  to  be  the  final fling for  the  event, which was then \ndropped. Codd left the  fastest lap speeds for the  Clubmans \nat 82.33mph in the Junior and  86.52mph in the  Senior. \nCLYPSE CIRCUIT \nThe two Lightweight classes and the  Sidecars continued \nto  have their massed-start races over the  Clypse, where \nwinning race average speeds had hovered around 70mph \nsince their first running. Sidecars speeds matched those of \nthe  125cc solos and  the  variation in  lap times between the \nLightweight and Ultra Lightweights was only about about \n2—3mph. MV Agusta won both solo classes on  the  Clypse \nin  1956 with their top  rider, Carlo Ubbiali. Second and \nBill  Webster pushes a  I125cc MV  Agusta with full \nstreamlining. \nthird \nplaces \nin  \nthe  \nUltra \nLightweight \nrace \nwent \nto  \nSpanish \nMontesa \ntwo-strokes \nand \nthey \nwere \nfitted \nwith \nsix-speed \ngearboxes. \nStreamlining \nwas \nparticularly \nextensive \non   \nfactory \nmachines \nin \nthe \nLightweight \nclasses, \nsometimes \nextending \nto \nenclosing \nthe \nrear \nwheel. \nAmong the  Sidecars, BMW were gaining the  edge over \nNortons and this was reflected in  the  result of the 1956 \nrace, when Fritz Hillebrand brought his  BMW twin home \nahead of the  Norton singles of  Pip Harris and Bill Bod- \ndice. British sidecar racers usually had the  sidecar on  the \nleft, while continentals favoured the  right. This sometimes \nresulted in  them taking differing lines through bends on \nthe  narrow Clypse circuit. The three-wheelers were also \nexperimenting with streamlining. \n1957: FURTHER WITHDRAWAL \nNorton, Matchless and  AJS  ceased to  compete at  World \nChampionship level with works machinery in   1955, \nalthough they did  contest a  few other events. In  Novem- \nber  1956 they announced a further withdrawal, saying that \nthey would ‘not enter an  official works team in  [any of] \nnext season’s racing events’. A  statement from AMC said \nthat it was due  to  ‘current circumstances’, which required \n‘that all available technical skill and facilities are  devoted to \nto  the  development of standard products’. It was not  good \nnews, for without development their over-the-counter rac- \ners  would swiftly become obsolete. It also began a period of \nunofficial works support that left  race followers confused, \ngenerally muddied the  waters and did  nothing to  enhance \nAMC’s reputation. \nBy February 1957 it was  known that an  unofficial Norton \nteam would contest the  TT  on  what, it was said, were to \nbe  1957 Manx models. Riders were John Hartle, Jack Brett \nand Alan Trow and they were free to  use streamlining. \nThen, come April, race fans were reading of a  three-man \nteam who would be  using 1956 AJS  and  Matchless works \nmounts at the  TT. \nAccording to  output curves supplied to  the  press, in \nstandard form the 1957 Manx 500cc 30M gave about \n47bhp \nand \nthe \n350cc \n40M \nshowed \n35bhp, \nat \na \nlittle \nover \n7,000rpm. \nFor \nthe \nstandard \n7R, \noutput \nwas \ngiven \nas \n37.5bhp \nat \n7,500rpm \nand \nfor \nthe \nG45 \nit \nwas \n50.5bhp \nat \n7,200. \nWhether \nthe \nbhp \nfigures \nquoted \nby \nthe \nmanufac- \nturers \nof \nracing \nmotorcycles \nwere \ndirectly \ncomparable \ndepended \non \ntechnical \naspects \nlike \nthe \nform \nof \nbrake \nused, \nwhether \nthe \nmeasurement \nwas \ntaken \nat \nthe \ncrank \nor \nthe \nrear-wheel, \nplus \nthe \nless \neasy \nto \npin \ndown \nissue \nof \nwhat \nmessage \nthey \nwere \ntrying \nto \nput \nacross. \nThe \nfigures \nwere \nbest \ntreated \nas \na \nguide, \nfor \njust \na \nfew \nmonths \nlater, \nGeoff"

There was  plenty of general publicity on  the run-up \nto  the  Golden Jubilee event, plus specific news that Gilera \nhad  a  50bhp 350-4 to  go with its  500 and  that Moto Guzzi \nwould trump them all by bringing its V8  to  the  Island. Ital- \nian manufacturers were also busy with new and  developing \nmodels in the  Lightweight classes. \nEntry numbers increased and many of  the entries \nwere made by dealers. Without their support, supplying \nmachines, paying entry fees and often contributing towards \ncompetitors’ travel and living expenses, many talented rid- \ners  would not  have been able to  contest the TT. Most deal- \ners  were in  it for  the  sport, while also hoping for a little \nincreased business. \nThere were worries that a  period of petrol rationing \non  the  run-up to  the  TT  might affect attendances, but  the \nrestrictions were lifted just before the event. Good news for \nthe  racers was that fuel would be  of 100  octane. This was \nsupplied free of charge by firms like Shell and  Esso to riders \nwho were contracted to them. Top riders received generous \nretainers from the  petrol and oil  companies, with manu- \nfacturers, tuners and dealers also contracting themselves \nto particular suppliers. Such arrangements certainly helped \noil  the  wheels of motorcycle racing, but  could sometimes \nprove restrictive and  prevent riders from moving teams. \nPerhaps trying to  introduce some novelty to  proceed- \nings, the organizers considered sending riders off in batches \nof six, but  decided against it.  One change they did  make \nwas to  extend the 1957 Golden Jubilee Senior race to \neight laps, making it 302  miles. They also  reduced qualify- \ning times for Senior and Junior runners to  32 and  34 min- \nutes. Over on  the  Clypse Circuit, Lightweight and  Sidecar \nclasses reverted to  ten  laps, giving them each 107% miles \nof racing. \nVARIATIONS ON A THEME \nStreamlining \nwas  \nstill \na \nfree \nfor \nall \nand  \nvarious \nforms \ncould \nbe \nseen. \nIn \nthe  \nbigger \nclasses, \nMV \nAgusta \nused \njust \na \nnose \ncone, \nGilera \ninitially \nused \na \nnose \ncone \nbut \nmoved \nto \na \nfull \nPOST-WAR PROGRESS HE  75 \nfront-wheel-enclosing ‘dustbin’, while the  V8  Moto Guzzi \nused a  dolphin shape that left  the  front wheel exposed, \nalthough their singles used ‘dustbins’.

On  the  Isle \not Man, the  Peel Engineering Company was working with \nfibreglass to  produce streamlining for several competitors. \nIt  would later manufacture the “Mountain Mile’ dolphin \nfairing, which became standard wear for  British machines. \nGeoff Duke with an  experimental version of the Peel \nMountain Mile fairing. \nrace weigh-in by his  mechanic."

In  contrast, the  350 and 500cc single-cylinder Moto \nGuzzis were scaled-up 250s. Geoff Duke told that after the \nMoto Guzzi factory had spent a winter ‘adding lightness’ to \nits  350, it came to  the  1957 TT  witha dry weight of 210Ib \n(95kg). He  felt that they had gone too  far with weight-sav- \ning and  that it could be too  ‘gazelle-like’ for the  Mountain \nCourse. Duke was a  non-starter at  the 1957 TT, due to  a \nshoulder injury sustained in  a  spill at  Imola. His  place was \ntaken by Australian Bob Brown, who joined Bob McIntyre \nin the  Gilera team. \nTHE MAGIC ‘TON’ LAP \nThe high quality of machines and riders entered for the  1957 \nraces made it difficult for  armchair pundits to  predict the \nwinners. On  the  Mountain Course, Bob McIntyre’s Senior \n(Gilera) was now giving 7Obhp and  he  set  the  pace dur- \ning practice for the Junior and  Senior classes, while on  the \nClypse Circuit, all-Italian Lightweight machinery scrapped \nfor the fastest solo times, piloted by riders of several nation- \nalities.

Challenged in  the  early stages, McIntyre rode away \nfrom the  MV Agusta, BMW and Moto Guzzi opposition \non  his  big Gilera, breaking the  long-standing 100mph lap \nbarrier four times and leaving it at  101.12mph on  his way to \nthe  chequered flag and a popular victory.

Their twin passions for engineer- \ning and  racing would be badly missed. \nOne Italian firm who did not  withdraw was MV  ‘Agusta. \nThe race activities of the  Gallarate concern were a  per- \nsonal hobby of Count Agusta, his  principal business being \nthe manufacture of helicopters. The next few years were to \nprovide the  Count with an  enjoyable and  successful hobby, \nacross all  solo classes, even though his  number one rider, \nJohn Surtees, told that he had to pester the  Count to main- \ntain development of the big MVs. \nBACKGROUND \nTT  racing in  1958 felt  the  effect of several changes. First, \nof course, was the  absence of some of the  foremost Italian \nmanufacturers, although one ‘new’ Italian firm to  take up \nthe \nchallenge \nin \nthe \nUltra \nLightweight \nclass \nwas \nDucati, \nwith its  little four-stroke engines sporting desmodromic \nvalve \ngear \nand \nputting \nout \n18bhp \nat \n12,500rpm. \nThe \nclass \nalso \nsaw \nthe \nappearance \nof \nthe \nEast \nGerman \nMZs, \nwho \nwere \nsaid \nto \nalmost \nmatch \nthat \noutput \nwith \ntheir \npioncer- \ning developments in two-stroke technology. \nAfter \nconsidering \nthe  \nissue \nof \nmachine \nenclosure, \nthe \nFIM \nintroduced \na \nruling \nrestricting \nstreamlining \nto \nthe \ndol- \nphin \ntype, \nwhich \nleft \nthe \nfront \nwheel \nexposed. \nThus \n‘dust- \nbins’ \nand \nrear \nenclosure \nwere \nno  \nmore. \nThe \nsame \nbody \nwas \nPOST-WAR PROGRESS #  77 \nstill talking of dropping the  500cc class, perhaps in  1960, \nand there continued to  be  mutterings about the  introduc- \ntion of Formula classes. \nTyre manufacturers were using racing to  develop their \nproducts, with nylon carcasses replacing rayon and  cotton. \nNylon was reckoned to  be lighter, while still being robust, \nflexible and offering cooler running. It  was a  significant \nchange in construction by both the  Avon and  Dunlop con- \ncerns, which would soon spread to  roadster tyres and, like \nother features that first appear in racing, would be adopted \nby other firms, even those who did  not  race. \nAmong some of the  top riders who lost  their seats after \nItalian manufacturers dropped out, Geoff Duke was  now on \na works BMW for the  Senior and  Dickie Dale was  similarly \nmounted. Duke was also the  recipient of a  special 350cc \nengine from Norton at  the  TT, plus a  five-speed gearbox. \nOthers to  receive special engines that were claimed to  be \n‘squarer’ were Keith Campbell, Alan Holmes and sidecar \nman ‘Pip’ Harris, while Bob Brown was given a  complete \n500cc machine. Meanwhile, Matchless had  been develop- \ning a  500cc version of the  7R, and a  prototype was to  be \nridden at  the  1958 TT  by Jack Ahearn. It would be  called \nthe  G50 and  soon go on  general sale. \nWEIGHT \nHidden among the  race regulations was one that had been \nlargely ignored in  previous years. It prescribed that riders \nmust weigh a minimum of 9 stone 6 pounds in leathers. The \nsurprise production of a pair of scales in  1958 saw some of \nthe  lighter-looking riders asked to  step on  them. Among \nthose not reaching the appointed weight were Romolo \nFerri, Carlo Ubbiali and Luigi Taveri. The last  was 21lb \n(10kg) underweight, while the  diminutive Gary Dickinson \nwas even lighter. They were all  required to  add ballast to \ntheir machines to  reach the  required weight. \nSPEEDS \nJohn Surtees and  John Hartle were the  MV Agusta works \nriders and  they set  the  pace in practice in  1958, on  models \nnow fitted with dolphin fairings. On one  chilly early-morn- \ning session, as  it was struggling to  get light, Surtees put in \nhis  fastest ever lap, averaging 99.06mph from a  standing \nstart. While he was  not  openly critical of the  MVs, he felt \nthat they were still too  tall  and heavy. But with the  350 \nrevving to  10,800 and  the  500 to  10,400, perhaps he  was \nconsoled by the power output, which gave him considerable \nadvantage over the  British machines in  the  field of eighty- \ntwo, most of them being Nortons. \nTimed on  Sulby Straight under perfect conditions, John’s \nwas the fastest 500 at  139.56mph, with the Norton of Alan"

Pursued home by Dave \nChadwick and Geoff Tanner on  Nortons, Surtees had no \nneed to  try  for records. \nWednesday saw action on  the Clypse, and Tarquinio \nProvini had to break race average and lap records on  his MV \nAgusta to  fight off team mate Carlo Ubbiali, who finished \na  few  seconds behind.

It was the year that NSU dominated \nthe Lightweight and Ultra Lightweight classes at  the  TT \nand  in the  wider world of racing, so  when Honda made its \nfirst TT entries in  1959, it was  probably no  coincidence that \nthe bikes from Japan had  more than a passing resemblance \nto  the  earlier NSU 125cc Rennmax models. However, no \none should underestimate the  enterprise shown by Honda \nNaomi \nTaniguchi \nand \nhis  \n125cc \nHonda \non  \nthe \nClypse \nCourse \nin \n1959. \nalmost sixty years ago and no  one  can  be in any doubt today \nof the  impact they have had  on  the  world of racing. \nBased at  the  Nursery Hotel in  Onchan, the  company \nhad  five  entries in the  125cc Ultra Lightweight TT  in  1959. \nFour machines were to  be  ridden by Japanese riders and \nthe fifth by American Bill  Hunt. During their stay they had \nmany visits from the curious and also from the more knowl- \nedgeable, including several riders. All  were keen to  get  a \nclose-up view of machines that one journalist described as \n‘neatly made and technically brilliant’. \n1959: FORMULA I \nAnother new arrival on  the  TT  scene in  1959 was Formula \nI racing. This was for  production racing motorcycles of \nwhich at  least twenty-five must have been sold. Two races, \nfor  350cc and  500cc machines, were run  concurrently over \nthree laps on  the  Saturday evening prior to  race week, but \nwith a  combined entry of just twenty-nine riders on  Nor- \nton, Matchless, AJS aad BMW, they were thinly spread \naround the Mountain Course. It was Bob McIntyre (Nor- \nton) who took the  500cc win  at an  impressive race average \nof 97.77mph, while his  close friend, Alastair King (AJS), \nwas first 350  home at  94.66mph. Mclntyre’s fastest lap on \nhis  ‘standard production’ Manx Norton in  that Formula I \nrace was 98.35mph, which compared well with his  best- \never Norton lap on  his  specially prepared Joe Potts race \nbike of 99.98mph, set  in  1958. King was also fast  and  his \npace matched the Junior TT winning speeds of the previous \ntwo years, set  by Gilera and MV Agusta. \nApart from knowing that works exotica were excluded, \nfew understood the  purpose of Formula I and, according \nto  The  Motor Cycle, the  1959 event ‘was not  true Formula I \nracing, for such machines as  the  Manx Norton and  7R  AJS \nhave yet to be entered on  the FIM register’. This was  despite \nthe  fact that the  event had been virtually forced upon the \nTT  by the  FIM. \nDEVELOPMENTS \nWith patient development, most recently by Doug Hele at \nNorton and  Jack Williams at  AMC, the  traditional British"

When launched \nin  1948, the  AJS 7R  produced 29bhp at  6,800rpm, but  in \n1959 it gave 40.5bhp at  7,800rpm and  was reckoned to  be \nfaster than a  standard 350 Manx Norton. A desmodromic \nversion of Norton’s Manx engine was  brought to  the  Island \nfor  evaluation purposes in  1959 and Terry Shepherd used \nit in practice, \nThe Lightweight and Ultra Lightweight classes saw \ntechnically interesting machines entered by MV Agusta, \nDucati, MZ, EMC, Honda and  others. A range of singles, \ntwins, four-strokes and two-strokes filled what was  a buoy- \nant  class. Whether it was due to  the  talk of dropping the \nbigger classes from GP  racing is unclear, but  in contrast to \nmodest development of their fours, MV Agusta put much \neffort into improving their Lightweights, the  250 coming \nwith a new frame and  said to be capable of topping 130mph \n—almost matching their 350 four. \nStreamlining was now widely used in  its  regulation \ndolphin form, but  despite obvious benefits, it also created \nproblems. Some users met with general engine-cooling dif- \nficulties, others found a need to  provide ducting to  take air \nto  carburettor inlet areas, while those prone to  sparking- \nplug problems fitted air  deflectors to  help cool them. Each \npractice session provided examples of ‘panic engineering’ \napplied to  deal with such issues, for they were mostly ones \nthat had  not  revealed themselves on  short circuits. \nGary \nHocking \nin \nthe  \nmiddle \nof \nthe  \ntraditional \nrun  \nand \nbump \nstart \nused \nin \nracing \nin \nthe \n1950s. \nPRACTICE \nRunning to form in the big classes, the MV  Agustas of John \nSurtees and John Hartle were fastest in practice in 1959, but \namong the  Lightweights prospective winners were harder \nto pick. Riders of MV  Agusta, Ducati and MZ  machines all \nvied for the  fastest times. \nOver the  2-mile run  to The Highlander on  the Mountain \nCourse, John Hartle clocked the  fastest Senior time at  an \naverage speed of 131 .42mph and John Surtees 128.57mph. \nBest single was Alan Shepherd on  his  G50 Matchless at \n123.31mph. In later years a speed trap was  located near The \nHighlander that gave ‘flash’ readings at  close to  maximum \nspeeds, but in  1959 the  average speeds quoted over 2 miles \nwere usually about 10mph down on  maximum. \nA newcomer enlivening the  racing scene before the  TT \nwas Gary Hocking, and  he  showed well on  Reg Dearden \nNortons during practice. Reg was often the conduit by \nwhich Norton released their special engines at  TT  time, \nwith Tom Arter being used by AMC. \nMike Hailwood had a stable of eight machines in  the \ngarage of Geoff Duke’s Arragon Hotel at  Santon, with vet- \neran tuner Bill  Lacey coaxed out  of retirement to help tune \nthem. \nMV AGUSTA AGAIN \nMV faced serious opposition in  all  four solo International \nTT  classes in  1959 but, as  in  1958, they \nfinished the  week with four victories, \nincreasing their speeds in  all  classes. \nTarquinio Provini rode the 125 and \n250 MVs to  new race average winning \nspeeds and  also set  the  fastest 250cc lap. \nIn doing so  he became the first to  lap the \nClypse Circuit at  80mph, while a  new \nlap record for a  125  went to  Luigi Taveri \n(MZ) at  74.99mph. \nEveryone was interested in  how the \nnew Hondas would perform in  the 125 \nUltra Lightweight class and  they did  not \ndisappoint. With four finishers from five \nstarters, they took sixth, seventh, eighth \nand  eleventh positions in a field that had \neighteen finishers. They did not  have the \nspeed of the  winning MV Agustas, but \nit was  a  performance that earned them \nthe  Manufacturers team prize and their \nsixth-place finisher, Naomi Taniguchi, \nrode fast enough to  win a Silver Replica. \nRaces \non  \nthe \nClypse \ncontinued \nto \nhave \nmass \nstarts, \nwhereas \non \nthe \nMountain"

While competitors in  that Junior race \nwere troubled by molten tar,  the  Senior TT had  to  be post- \nponed from Friday to  Saturday due  to  inclement weather. \nWhen Surtees got away from the start of the Senior just after \n10.30am, he rocketed into the  lead over dry roads, setting \na new lap record of 101.18mph from a standing start. Then \nthe  heavens opened with heavy rain, hail, mountain mist \nand strong winds.

Other changes saw Junior and Senior race dis- \ntances reduced from seven to  six  laps, giving each a  race \ndistance of 226’ miles, while the  Lightweight class cov- \nered five laps and 188% miles. The Ultra Lightweight and \nSidecars ran  over three laps and 113% miles. All races now \nused interval starts. There was no  Formula! race. \nFINE DISPLAY \nThe TT races attract visitors for many varied reasons, and in \n1960 renowned Australian engineer Phil Irving was there \nto  view the  technical developments on  show. In his words, \nthe  TT  was  responsible for  ‘assembling, at  the  same time, \nthe finest and most varied collection of racing machinery it \nis possible to  see  anywhere in the world’. \nFollowing Honda’s lead, and with huge support from \nShell in Japan and  Britain, Suzuki came from Japan to  con- \ntest  the  Ultra Lightweight race with twin-cylinder Colleda \nRT60 \nmodels. \nThey \nhad \nbasic \npiston-controlled \ninduction, \nseparate \nalloy \nbarrels \nand \nran \non \na \npetroil \nmix. \nWith \nsix- \nspeed \ngearboxes, \nthey \nwere \nsaid \nto \nbe \ngood \nfor \n94mph. \nArriving \nwell \nbefore \nthe \nstart \nof \nofficial \npractice, \nthe \nthree \nEAST vs  WEST @  81 \nJohn Surtees holds a tight line through Hillberry in the \nwet Senior TT  of  1959. \nSuzuki riders put  in  many learning laps of the  course on \nroad bikes. \nIn  the Lightweight class Honda brought new 4-cylin- \nder RC161 models with over-square engines revving to \n13,500rpm and  giving 36bhp (some say  more), while MZ \nwere claiming 42bhp at  11,000rpm from their twins. As \nusual, this class had  a smattering of cut-down singles from \nNorton, BSA and  Velocette. \nThe Junior class saw entries of enlarged Lightweights \nfrom Morini, Bianchi, Ducati and  MV Agusta, while Eddie \nCrooks was out  on  an  experimental ‘Lowboy’ 350  Norton. \nNot all the  experimental models entered made it to  racing \nor  even practice, however. \nWith the  big MV Agustas now generally reliable, it was \nthe  overtuned singles that were more likely to  fail  in  the \nJunior and Senior races. Thus the latter probably welcomed \nthe  reduction of race distance to  six  laps, particularly as \nthose who went for pannier fuel tanks might be able to runa \nnon-stop race, an  option not  open to  the  22mpg MVs with- \nout making them unmanageable in  the  handling depart- \nment. \nMost sidecars were still ridden in sit-up style, but  some \nwere positioning fuel tanks in  the  sidecar and their rid-"

Indeed, it  was Mike Hailwood (Norton), \non  the  best single-cylinder machinery that money could \nbuy, who equalled the fastest MV speed in  1960, match- \ning John Hartle’s figure of 138.46mph. \nexceptional figure, for next best single was Dickie Dale on \nHailwood’s was an \na  Norton at  128.57mph, although previous years had seen \nother singles over 130mph. \nJohn Surtees’ MV was fastest Junior at  125.91mph, with \nBob  McIntyre (AJS) next at  120mph. In a sign of the  times, \nTarquinio Provini (Morini) equalled Surtees’ Junior speed \nwith the fastest Lightweight at  125.91mph, as  did Bob \nAnderson on  his MZ. Moto Kitano was  the fastest Honda at \n117.68mph, indicating that the  Japanese company’s 250cc \nfours were still down on  speed. \nIn  the Ultra Lightweight, Carlo Ubbiali hit  109.77mph \non  his  little MV Agusta, followed by team mates Gary \nHocking (107.81lmph) and  Luigi Taveri (105.88mph). Side- \ncars were not  timed at  Sulby, but  on  the  2-mile stretch to \nThe Highlander the  fastest average speed was set  by Flo- \nrian Camathias (BMW) at  111.8 82mph, followed by Fritz \nScheidegger (BMW) with 111.14mph and Bill Beevers \n(BMW) with 105.88mph.

They liked the  new \nsmoother surface for  allowing them to  keep the  throttle \nwide open for longer. They also liked its grip quality in the \ndry, although some had reservations about the  feel in  the \nWet, W here: they felt  it could suddenly ‘let go’. \nAmong stretches to  benefit from the new surfacing was \nBray Hill. which, now being smoother, allowed John Sur- \ntees to  take it flat  in  top  on  his  big MV, even though the \nextra speed did  induce some tail-weaving after the  dip at \nthe bottom.

Hailwood’s Norton \nhad been bench-tested at  53.5bhp just \nbefore the TT, but he had kept Hocking’s \n70bhp MV Agusta in  sight and finished \nwith a race average speed of 100.60mph \nand a fastest lap  of  101.31mph. Fast- \nest  lap of the  race went to  Hocking at \n102.62mph. Both Bob McIntyre and \nTom Phillis achieved 100mph laps, with \nthe  latter’s being on  the  ‘Domiracer’, an \nexperimental twin-cylinder, pushrod \nmodel based on  the Norton ‘Domina- \ntor’ roadster. \nIn  becoming the first rider to  take \nthree TT wins in  a  week, Mike Hail- \nwood justifiably earned the unofficial \naccolade of ‘Man of the  Meeting’ at  the \n1961 TT. Norton must also have been \nproud to  achieve another double victory \nae \nin Junior and Senior races. \n1962: WORKS RIDES \nJapanese factory representation at the  1962 TT meant there \nwas fierce competition for  a  coveted and lucrative works \nride with Honda and  Suzuki, plus the limited seats available \nwith European manufacturers. Yamaha did  not  contest the \nevent, staying at home to  catch their financial breath and to \ndesign more competitive machines. \nAs  yet, Japanese riders had not  been able to  ride at  the \nsame winning level as  the  top  racers from European and \nCommonwealth countries, who, because of  their riding \nskills, were given some of the  Honda and Suzuki factory \nrides. However, there were more potential stars than sad- \ndles available, so  the  next few years would see  top  riders \ngiving their all to  capture a  select works contract. Among \nmen who came to the fore  in the early 1960s were Jim Red- \nman, Tommy Robb, Hugh Anderson, Mike Duff, Bill  Ivy \nand Ralph Bryans. They joined established stars like  Mike \nHailwood, Bob McIntyre, Phil Read, Tom Phillis, Ernst \nDegner and Luigi Taveri, with the  diminutive Kunimitsu \nTakahashi probably the  fastest Japanese rider of the  time. \nThere were future world champions amongst those names, \nmen who would show their worth across the most demand- \ning  tracks in  Europe. By their efforts they would prove \nthemselves to  be  the  best —  and  all  would have the  Isle  of \nMan on  their racing agendas. \nLooking \nback, \nit  \nis  \nreally \nno  \nsurprise \nthat \nfactors \nlike \nimproved \nroad \nsurfaces, \nadvances \nin  \ntyre \nand \nsuspension \nperformance, \ntogether \nwith \nhungry \nriders \nand \nfactories \nEAST vs  WEST @  85 \niige i> \n/   a — v \nPost-race congratulations are exchanged between Tom Phillis (left), Mike \nHailwood (centre) and Bob McIntyre after the 1961 Senior TT. \ndemanding success from their ever more advanced motor- \ncycles, all  combined to  bring increased speeds to  the  TT \nthrough the 1960s. \nTIDDLERS \nAfter the  reintroduction of the  Ultra Lightweight class to \nthe  Mountain Course in  1960, riders had shown that 125s \ncould cope with its  demands and  the  lap record stood to \nLuigi Taveri (Honda) at  a healthy 88.45mph. For  1962 the \norganizers included a race for  50cc machines over two laps, \na  class recently introduced to  the  World Championships. \nThe 50s  would run  on  the  Friday of race-week, just before \nthe  Senior TT. \nIn  every TT  race of the  day, the  field was made up  of \nan  elite group on  works machines, fast  runners on  dealer- \nsponsored bikes, good privateers giving their all and  a  few \nat the rear of the field who were simply realizing their ambi- \ntion to  ride over the TT course. This brought a wide varia- \ntion in machine speed and  rider performance in the  estab- \nlished classes, something that was to  be  very noticeable in \nthe  case of the  50s, where the  sophisticated works bikes \nof Honda, Suzuki and Kreidler, with top speeds of over \n90mph, were in the  same field as  Itoms, ten  of which were \nclocked at  less  than 60mph on  Sulby Straight. The latter \nwere very much private efforts, for the Itom factory showed \nlittle interest in  the  racers derived from their roadsters. \nAmong the  50cc runners was  the  first woman to  contest a \nsolo TT, Itom-mounted Beryl Swain."

Tyre suppliers Dunlop and Avon were present, \nwith Dunlop talking of using its  latest rubber compounds \nand introducing a  new triangular-section rear tyre, which \nthey called the  RMT1. Designed with a radical new profile \nthat offered more tread to  the  road when a  machine was \nleaned over, the  TT  meeting would offer the  new tyre a \ndemanding test under race conditions. \nGirling were present with experimental upside-down, \ngas-assisted rear suspension units, which were said to \nimprove damping, reduce oil  aeration and maintain con- \nstant temperature, so  giving more consistent performance \nthroughout a long race. They also offered a saving in weight. \nA  few privately made five-speed gearbox conversions \nwere fitted to  British singles, but  while Norton and AMC \nhad  experimental examples of their own, they did not  offer \nthem to customers. It was something riders could have used \nto  advantage over the  Mountain Course. \nThe organizers increased the  Lightweight 250 race dis- \ntance from from five to  six  laps and shuffled the  order of \nthe  races. \nGary Hocking was joined by Mike Hailwood in  riding \n350 and 500cc MV Agustas in  1962, operating under the \nsame ‘Privat’ label. However, things went wrong for  Hock- \ning early in  practice, when he  tangled with Graham Smith \nat Ballacrye. Both riders were thrown down the road at high \nspeed and the MV  burnt out. Despite the  severity of his fall, \nHocking was soon out again, swapping 100mph practice laps \nwith Mike Hailwood. The latter was also to  ride a Benelli in \nthe  Lightweight class and  an  Ultra Lightweight EMC. \nBob McIntyre and Tom Phillis had entries on  285cc \nHonda fours in  the  Junior race and  practice times showed \nthey could be  a  threat to  the  350cc MVs. There was even \ntalk of ‘Bob Mac’ riding one of the 285s in the  Senior race. \nAn  8-gallon tank had  been made to  allow a  non-stop race, \nalthough \nMcIntyre \nwas \nknown \nto \nprefer \nthe \nidea \nofa \nslick \npit stop rather than carry that extra weight of fuel. \nOne \nman \nwho \nfeatured \nas  \na  \nfast  \nprivateer \nat  \nthe  \nTT  \nfor \nmany \nyears \nwas \nArthur \nWheeler. \nHe \nfavoured \nMoto \nGuzzis \nand \nhad \nprivately \nentered \nexamples \nin \nthe \n250, \n350 \nand \n500cc races. \nRACING \nThe \nSidecar \nrace \nopened \nthe  \nrevised \nrace \nprogramme, \nand \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nin \neight \nyears \nthe \nwin \ndid \nnot \ngo \ntoa"

Of course, BM Ws \nwere there in the mix, Otto Kolle tak- \ning second place and  Max Deubel rais- \ning the  lap record to  90.70mph. \nLightweight and Ultra Lightweight \nraces provided another clean sweep of \npodium places for  Honda, with new \nrace and lap  records going to  Luigi \nTaveri on  his  125, while Bob McIntyre \nlooked like setting new records on  his \n250. However, after a  fast 99.06mph \nlap, McIntyre retired and left  Derek \nMinter and Jim Redman scrapping at a \nslightly slower pace, with Minter tak- \ning the  win. Suzuki scrubbed their 250cc entries as  their \nbikes were too  prone to  seizure. \nHonda had to  give best to  Suzuki in  the  new 50cc race, \nbut took second and  third places.

A different link with MZ by Dr  Joe \nErlich —  some say it involved a trade of Norton forks, which \nwere not  obtainable behind the  Iron Curtain —  saw  his new \ntwo-stroke EMC put up a spirited performance in the  Ultra \nLightweight race, with Mike Hailwood holding second until \nforced to  retire and Rex Avery coming home sixth. \nJunior and Senior victories were shared by MV-mounted \nMike Hailwood and Gary Hocking. Hailwood took the Jun- \nior with new race average and lap record speeds, lifting the \nlatter to  101.58mph, while Hocking broke John Surtees’ \nrecords to  win the  Senior, his fastest lap being 105.75mph. \nRace fans expected to  witness record speeds and  Honda \ncertainly brought new levels of engineering excellence to \nthe  TT.

Still air-cooled, the 125 was a  single with disc \nvalve, six  speeds and said to  give 25bhp. The 250 was a \nparallel twin, had  seven speeds and  was said to  give over \n40bhp at  11,000rpm, albeit with a  narrow power band. \nThe company had limited track testing facilities, but  felt \nthat it had  eliminated some of its  earlier problems of plug- \noiling, vibration and  carburation, as  well as  lack of power \nand durability. Riders were to be Fumio Ito, Hiroshi Haseg- \nawa, Yoshikaza Sunako and Tony Godfrey. In  contrast to \nYamaha, Honda’s only Japanese rider was Kunimitsu Taka- \nhashi and  the  company did  not  enter the  50cc race. \nSuzuki concentrated on  the  50cc and 125cc classes. In \nthe former they entered an  uprated version with nine gears \nand a  top  speed of 93mph. There was more change with \ntheir air-cooled, twin-cylinder 125  machine, said to  give \n26bhp and 114mph. \nJoining battle with the  Japanese two-strokes were six \nprivate entries on  Greeves ‘Silverstone’ machines. Designed \nfor, and successful at,  short circuits, their entry into the far \nmore demanding Lightweight TT  was a  worry to  factory \nboss Bert Greeves and he took the  unusual step of writing \nto  \neach \nrider, \nasking \nthem \nto  \nride \n‘with \nskilled \njudgement \nand \nrestraint’. \nTT prize money had remained unchanged for over thirty \nyears, but  in  1963 the  ACU finally agreed to  pay riders \na  contribution towards their expenses. However, £10 for \nSOcc runners, £15 for  other solos and £25 for  sidecars \nwould not  go far towards paying for two weeks of racing. \nMarshalling the  37%4-mile Mountain Course had  always \nproved a headache for the organizers and, due to  accessibil- \nity problems, there were often long delays in getting injured \nriders to  hospital. In  a  major contribution to  rider well- \nbeing, a  helicopter rescue service was introduced for  race \ndays at  the  1963 TT. \nDunlop and  Avon’s development of tyres to  provide rid- \ners  with better road-holding did not pursue the same direc- \ntion. Of Avon’s latest rear tyre it was  said it ‘looks more like \na  trials tyre. There are  no  ribs at  all  on  the  sidewalls, the \nstuds extending right across and they look quite knobbly \nones too’. By contrast, Dunlop’s triangular racing tyres for \nsolos were gaining ribs and zig-zag tread on  the  sidewalls. \nHOT PACE \nStill riding ‘Privat’ machines for MV Agusta, during prac- \ntice for  the  1963 TT, Mike Hailwood gave the  returning \nGileras a  clear idea of the  challenge they faced. In  Mike’s \nwords: ‘I deliberately set out  to demoral- \nize  them by covering every lap of prac- \ntice at  over 100mph’. Come the  Senior \nrace and Hailwood continued his  hot \npace, riding to  victory at  a  new race \naverage speed of 104.64mph and  setting \na  new lap  record of  106.41mph. John \nHartle and Phil Read were second and \nthird on  their Gileras, with Hartle set- \nting a  race average of  103.67mph. That \nwas good going for  a  machine that had \nreceived no  development since 1957, \nwhen Bob McIntyre took one  to  victory \nat  98.99mph. While it is  always a  mis- \ntake to  make direct year-on-year com- \nparisons of TT  races without fully assess- \ning  riders, race conditions, machinery \nand so  on,  there had to be a reason for an \nMitsuo Itoh rounds Governor’s Bridge \nto  take victory on  his  50cc Suzuki in \n1963 and become the first Japanese \nrider to  wina TT  race."

This left John Hartle (Gil- \nera) to  take second and  Frantna Stastny (Jawa) third. \nUnder better conditions, apart from melting tar in places, \nJim Redman rode his  Honda to  victory in the  Lightweight \nrace, with a  speedy Fumio Ito  (Yamaha) some 30  seconds \nbehind. The early stages had been enlivened by Yamaha’s Ito \nand Tony Godfrey leading Honda men Redman and Taveri. \nThe Yamaha two-strokes were clocked at  141mph past The \nHighlander but, after a stop for adjustments, Godfrey later \nfell  at Milntown and  became the  first casualty to  be recov- \nered by the new helicopter service.

It was a  victory that Suzuki repeated in the \n50cc race, but  this time it was Mitsuo Itoh who took the \nwin on  his nine-speed ‘tiddler’ at  a new race average speed. \nIt was  a first win for a Japanese rider at the TT, ina  race  that \nhad  been increased to  three laps and  where Ernst Degner \nset  a new lap record of 79.10mph. \nSidecars ran  their three-lap race in excellent conditions, \nwith a  comfortable win going to  Florian Camathias on  his \nBMW-based FCS, followed by Fritz Scheidegger (BMW). \nCamathias increased the  race average speed to  88.38mph \nbut fell just short of the  lap record. \n1964: THE PACE STEADIES \nThere was  a temporary lull in the upward growth in speeds \nin  some of the  classes at  the  1964 TT, although there was \nno  shortage of class machinery and  riders. Mike Hailwood \nwas \non \nMV \nAgustas \nand \nJim \nRedman \non \nHonda’s \nfull \n350 \nfour. \nHonda \nalso \nhad \na \n125 \nfour \nand \na \n50cc \ntwin, \nwhich \nwas \nsaid \nto \nrev \nto \n20,000rpm, \nwith \nsome \nreports \nsaying \n22,000rpm. \nTarquinio \nProvini \nreturned \non \na \nBenelli \n250, \nAlan \nShepherd \nwas \non \nfurther-developed \nMZs, \nSuzuki \nhad \nunreliable \nwater-cooled \n250 \nfours \nand \nEMC \ncame \nwith \nEAST vs  WEST @  89 \nredesigned frames and an  experimental form of  transis- \ntorized ignition, when most were still relying on  magneto \nor  coil for  their sparks. Yamaha sought to  build upon the \nproven speed of their machinery by employing Mike Duff \nand TT winner Phil Read, who would ride improved 250cc \ntwin-cylinder RD56 models. They also made a late appoint- \nment of Tommy Robb to  their team. Not unusual for  the \nday was that works riders Duff and Read would both ride a \nMatchless G50 in  the  Senior and an  AJS 7R  in  the  Junior. \nDevelopment of the  7R  had not  ceased, being pushed by \nenthusiastic entrants like Tom Kirby, who claimed to  be \ngetting 45bhp at  8,600rpm from his  special short-stroke \nengine. \nAdding interest to  the  event, British companies Royal \nEnfield and Cotton fielded entries in  the Lightweight \nrace, while Florian Camathias was present with his sidecar \nhitched to  a  Gilera 4. \nThe 1964 Lightweight 250 race promised much, but  in \nwords of the  time ‘turned out  to  be  a  wholesale exercise \nin  machine mortality’. An  impressive entry of ninety-five \nwas  reduced by some failing to  appear, others having major \nproblems in practice and a few not  qualifying, meaning that \nsixty-four riders came to  the  line. A close tussle between \nJim Redman (Honda) and  Phil Read (Yamaha) ended with \nRead’s retirement on  the fifth lap after a spate of plug trou- \nbles, leaving Redman to  win from Alan Shepherd (MZ) \nwithout setting any  records.

With competition fierce between \nteam mates Jim Redman, Luigi Taveri and Ralph Bryans, \nspeeds were lifted by over 2mph as  Taveri took victory by \njust 3 seconds from Redman and Bryans. There was also a \nhard-fought battle amongst the  50cc machines, resulting in \nboth race average and lap record speeds being left  at  over \n80mph by Hugh Anderson (Suzuki), as  he led home Ralph \nBryans (Honda) and  Isao Morishita (Suzuki). \nOn  the  entry list  of ninety riders for  the 1964 Senior \nrace, Mike Hailwood’s name was the  only one to  have an \nasterisk beside it to  indicate that he was a previous winner. \nThat was  very different from the  1930s, when the same list, \nwith about half the number of entries, would show three.or \nfour past winners, all  of whom would be contesting the race \non  similar machinery. While not fully recovered, Hailwood \nwas fit enough to  race his  ‘Privat’ MV Agusta in  Friday’s \nSenior and, provided he kept going, was  assured of victory. \nThat is how it worked out, comfortably, at some 4mph less \nthan record pace. \nLiving rather on  past glories, Norton Motors advertised \nat  TT  time, ‘Norton have won more admiration and TT races \nthan any other machine’. Derek Minter was  the only podium \nfinisher on  a Norton, with second place in the  Senior. \n1965:TWO vs  FOUR \nBy  1965 the  TT  was well into an  era  of two-stroke ver- \nsus  four-stroke in  the  three smaller solo classes, 250, 125 \nPlugs \nby \nthe  \nhundred \n—a   \nscene \nin \nthe  \nYamaha \ncamp. \nand  \n50cc, \nwith \nthe \nproducts \nof \nHonda, \nSuzuki \nand \nYamaha \nthe \nmain \nprotagonists \nand \nquite \nevenly \nmatched, \nalthough \nthe \ntwo-strokes \ndid \nlose \nout \non \nreliability. \nMuch \nof \nthat \nstemmed \nfrom \n‘plug \ntrouble’. \nSo \nnotorious \ndid \nthe \ntwo- \nstrokes \nbecome \nfor \nthe \nproblem \nthat, \neven \nif \nthere \nwas \na \nmore \nserious \nissue, \nit \nwas \noften \nblamed \non \nthe \nsparking \nplugs, \na \nreason \nthat \nno \none \nquestioned. \nFor  many years, riders of big four-strokes would carry \na  couple of spare plugs in  a  pocket in  their leathers and a \nplug spanner stuck down a riding boot. That era  had largely \ngone, but two-strokes had never rid themselves of tempera- \nment towards sparking plugs and their riders usually car- \nried spare ones and  a  spanner, sometimes in a  small pouch \nfitted inside the streamlining. Tommy Robb joined Yamaha \nin  1964 and  after using all his spare plugs during one  early \nmorning practice, he actually resorted to  ‘borrowing’ one \nfrom a tractor in  a  field by the  course. It got him back to \nthe  start. \nAnother unpleasant trait of two-strokes was their ten- \ndency to  seize if carburation was not  spot on.  Suzuki had \nredesigned their 250-4 for  1965, but works rider Jack \nAhearn nicknamed his bike ‘Whispering Death’ and riders \nof two-strokes usually rode with at  least one finger of the \nleft hand resting on  the  clutch lever. This was while trying \nto  watch the  road, the  rev  counter, the  temperature gauge \nand fight its  poor handling. Ahearn’s Suzuki was timed at \n139mph, but a spill in the  last practice session put him out \nof the race. With team mate Hugh Anderson not  willing to \nride the  250, it was  left to  Frank Perris to ride the  seizure- \nprone four. Frank described how he rode with four fingers \non  the  clutch lever to  enable him to  catch piston seizures, \nbut  even that was not  enough if the  disc valve seized, for \nthat would lock the engine solid. Just as  they seemed to be \nmaking progress, Suzuki pulled the four from competition \nlater in  1965. In  the  words of Mike Nicks, it  was a  bike \nthat ‘stretched design talents and  rider courage to  the  very \nlimit’. \nThe top Japanese manufacturers were seeing huge \ngrowth in their motorcycle sales as  they took over existing \nmarkets and established new ones. Racing their products \nwas a  valuable means of gaining worldwide publicity and \nthey poured money into it.  Phil Read was one  to  benefit, \nwriting \nof \nthe \ntime, \n‘We \nswept \nthrough \na \nshow-piece \nof \nclassic \nracing \ncompetition \nthat \nwas \nboosted \nby \nan \nopen \nchequebook, \nthe \nlike \nof \nwhich \nwe \nmay \nnever \nsee \nagain’. \nHe \nalso \nexplained \nwhy \nhe \nwas \nracing \nonly \nYamahas \nin \n1965: \n‘aiming \nto \nreach \nthe \ntop, \nwhat \ndo \nyou \nneed \n— \nno \nmatter \nhow \ngood \na \nrider \nyou \nare, \nthe \nanswer \nis \nspeed’. \nRead \neven \ntitled \nhis \nfirst \nautobiography \nPrince \nof \nSpeed. \nBill \nIvy \njoined \nthe \nYamaha \nteam \nand \n1965 \nwas \nhis \nfirst \nTT \nas \na \nworks \nrider."

The 250 TD1A had various problems, \nnot  least of which was an  appetite for  crankshafts caused, \nmany said, by having the  clutch mounted on  the  end  of the \ncrankshaft. It had now reached the  c35bhp TD1B stage, \nafter several years’ upgrading of cylinders, pistons, heads \nand exhausts, plus improved suspension, weight-saving and \nsome increase in reliability. Costing £520 in Britain, it was \nraced worldwide and attracted a  host of tuners offering \ntheir own improvements to the standard product. This was \nnot  just to  the  engine, but  to  exhausts, gear ratios, clutch, \nframe and suspension. Despite shortcomings, the TD1B \nwas a  successful production racer. Many over-bored them \nby a  few  cc  and  used them in  350cc races, but  a  few  years \nlater Yamaha marketed the  successful 350cc TR2 model, \nwhile private owners converted 125cc roadsters into rac- \ners. Such popularity meant that the  sight, sound and  smell \nof two-strokes was everywhere in racing. \nSeveral British manufacturers attempted to benefit from \nthe burgeoning 250cc race scene, and the products of \nGreeves, Cotton and  Royal Enfield enjoyed success on  the \nshort circuits. However, finding TT  racing more demand- \ning of speed and reliability, they did not really feature in the \nresults, although Greeves did achieve success at the MGP. \nSPEEDS \nThe  \nTT \nSpecial \ndid  \nnot  \ntime \nriders \nat  \nthe  \nsame \nplace \nevery \nyear. \nIn  \n1965 \nit \ntook \nspeeds \nover \nthe  \n2-mile \nstretch \nto  \nThe \nHighlander, \nshowing \nMike \nHailwood \nto \nbe \nthe \nfastest \n500 \nEAST vs  WEST @  91 \nat  an  average of 150mph, with the  best single being Derek \nMinter on  a Norton at  136.4mph. The MV’s average speed \nwas  up on  previous years, for all the course smoothing with \nmodern tarmac-laying techniques meant that the fours \ncould use  maximum power for more of the  time. Unfortu- \nnately for the  singles, this  served to  take away some of the \nhandling advantage they had previously enjoyed and, allied \nto their deficiency of 20bhp compared to the fours, it meant \never less  of a contest. \nIn  the  Junior class MV Agusta had a  much harder bat- \ntle  on  their hands and brought a  new 3-cylinder model in \n1965. Phil Read was timed as  fastest Junior on  an  over- \nbored Yamaha RD56 at an  average of 134.35mph, followed \nby Gustav Havel ona Jawa at  131.42mph. Jim Redman was \nfastest Lightweight on  his  Honda, averaging 133.33mph, a \nspeed equalled by Bill  Ivy’s Yamaha. Ernst Degner’s Suzuki \nwas fastest Ultra Lightweight at  122.48mph, clear of his \nteam mate Hugh Anderson at  118.45mph. Both Suzuki rid- \ners  were on  the  company’s new RT65 water-cooled twins. \nAs riders were only timed over one practice session, there \nwere always frustrating gaps in  the  published figures; for \nexample, how the  new MV three compared to  the  latest \nJunior Honda was  not  revealed, because Hailwood was  out \non  the  500 and Redman on  a  250. \nAs  well as  The  TT  Special occasionally recording riders’ \naverage speed over a  2-mile stretch to  The Highlander, \nanother magazine had  taken to  recording flash readings on \nthe  descent to  The Highlander, which gave higher figures. \nOne man with top-quality machines in four solo classes in \n1965 was Mike Duff. It is interesting to  compare his High- \nlander speeds across the classes: 125cc Yamaha— 125.1mph, \n250cc Yamaha —  143.4mph, 350cc AJS 7R  —  122.9mph, \n500cc Matchless G50 —  137.1mph. \nNEWCOMERS \nEvery TT had its  share of  newcomers to  the Mountain \nCourse and for some years there had been an  unofficial pre- \npractice coach tour of the  course for  any  who wished to \navail themselves. In  1965 this was  made obligatory for new- \ncomers, since when many experienced riders and travelling \nmarshals have conducted riders on  such a lap, often stopping \nat particularly tricky spots and generally imparting wisdom. \nOne man on  the  coach in  1965 who was to  go on  and write \nhis name into TT  history was Italian Giacomo Agostini. He \nwas  MV Agusta-mounted, as  team mate to  Mike Hailwood. \nSTILL FASTER \nMore records were broken in  1965, with the  most closely \ncontested races showing the greatest increases.

An \nunscheduled pit stop on  the  fifth lap meant they got closer, \nbut he held them off to  the  finish, taking victory from Joe \nDunphy (Norton) and  Mike Duff (Matchless).

On  his  first lap he  crashed \nheavily at May Hill, Ramsey, and although he did not  appear \nto  be  seriously hurt, he  died later that evening.’ Bridge- \nstone was another Japanese manufacturer due to  make its \ndebut at  the  TT, but  after poor early-season performances \nin Europe, they did  not  appear on  the Island. \nBenelli were present with veteran Italian star Tarquinio \nProvini, but he crashed on  the approach to Ballaugh in prac- \ntice and was seriously injured. Initial thoughts were that \nhe  was blinded by the  low sun, but  a  respected magazine \nlater related that his bike had  been subject to  a mechanical \n‘bodge’ that caused the  engine to  lock. Gilera also made \nanother return with Derek Minter, but he fell at Brandish, \nsuffering an  arm injury that prevented him from racing. \nFierce competition in  the  Lightweight class in  the  early \n1960s had seen Yamaha and Suzuki air-cooled twins become \nwater-cooled fours and Honda upping its  four cylinders to \nsix,  accompanied by claims of an  output of 53bhp. Those \nwho heard the six at close quarters had little reason to doubt \nthe  claim, while talk was of Yamaha’s water-cooled and \neight-speed 250  giving between 50 and  60bhp, depending \nwho you  listened to.  However, Suzuki still could not  get \ntheir 250-4 to  run reliably and did  not  bring it to  the  TT. \nHandling was not  the  strongest feature of any  of the  ‘big \nthree’ Japanese 250s, but riders were paid to get results, so \nthey rode them to  their limits —  there was always someone \nwaiting to  take over a  coveted works seat from any rider \nwho underperformed. \nPractice times did not  always tell the full  story of a rider \nand  machine’s performance potential at  the  TT, but  it was \nas  good a  pointer to  race week as  race fans were going to \nget. Having moved from MV Agusta to  Honda for  1966, \nMike Hailwood’s practice performances showed that he \nwould again be the man that the others would have to beat. \nSIDECARS \nBMW was  the dominant marque in sidecar racing, with the \nlimited production RS54 model the  one to  have.

The company did \nnot  produce racing motorcycles with good handling and \nin  1966 the  worst handler was to  be  their most powerful \nmachine, the new 500-4, which was  said to  develop 85bhp \nat  12,500rpm. Any doubts as  to  who was to  be  the  main \nman in the  Honda team at  the  TT  —  Jim Redman or  Mike \nHailwood —  were resolved when Redman suffered an  arm \ninjury that kept him out  of the  event. Honda brought in \nStuart Graham, son  of TT  legend Les, in his place. \nIn the  first solo race at the  1966 TT, the  combination of \nHailwood and Honda’s 6-cylinder 250 proved unbeatable in \nthe  Lightweight class. Hailwood blasted off from the  start \nto  set  a new lap record of 104.29mph on  his first lap. That \nwas more than 4mph faster than the  existing record and \nhighlighted the  fantastic combination of bike and  rider. He \neased off after the  first lap but  still finished several min- \nutes clear of Stuart Graham on a similar six. In fairness to \nGraham, he was  new to the bike and had a lengthy pit stop. \nWorks Yamahas and  MZs retired from the  race. \nThe middle of  race week was reserved for  the Ultra \nLightweight 125  and  Junior 350cc races. In  the  125  race, \nthe  exotic 5-cylinder works Honda four-strokes were no \nmatch for the speed of the two-stroke Yamahas and Suzukis. \nBill  Ivy and Phil Read were on  their twin-cylinder Yama- \nhas  and Ivy rode to  victory at  a  new race average speed of \n97.66mph, setting a new lap record of 98.55mph. Both fig- \nures were substantially up on  the previous record times and \nthe  little Yamahas showed reliability that had been missing \nwith the company’s 250s. Mike Duff came in fourth to help \nYamaha clinch the  Manufacturers’ Team Prize, an  award \nthat makers held in high regard. \nGiacomo Agostini was riding the only MV Agusta entry \nin the Junior race. It was  his  63bhp, 3-cylinder model and \nit was expected that he  would battle with Mike Hailwood \non \nhis \n4-cylinder \nHonda. \nHowever, \nspectators \nwere \ndisap- \npointed \nwhen \nthe \nlatter \ndropped \nout \non \nthe \nfirst \nlap. \nPerhaps \nAgostini \nwas \nalso \nsorry \nnot \nto \nbe \nable \nto \npit \nhis \ndeveloping \nTT \nriding \nskills \nagainst \nHailwood, \nfor \nalthough \nrelatively \nunchallenged, \nhe \nbroke \nboth \nrace \naverage \nand \nlap \nrecords, \nfinishing \n10 \nminutes \nahead \nof \nsecond-placed \nPeter \nWilliams \n(AJS). \nOf \nthe \nseventy-one \nstarters, \nfifty-eight \nwere \nstill \nrid- \ning \nBritish \nsingles \nfrom \nNorton \nand \nAJS."

Anyone with a  standard machine could equip it \nin  similar fashion from the  many suppliers of aftermarket \nextras, many of whom had  sprung up to  meet the  demand \nfor the popular café-racer style machines of the  day. \nRacing of catalogued production sports machines was \na  familiar sight on  British short circuits in the  mid-1960s, \nand for  1967 the  ACU introduced such a  Production race \nto  what was  the  Diamond Jubilee TT  meeting. Run on  the \nSaturday before the  main race week, it catered for  three \nclasses, 250cc, 500ce and 750cc. It had a  Le  Mans-type \nstart, setting riders off  in  three capacity waves and was \nscheduled for  three laps. While welcoming its  introduc- \ntion, those who had seen the handling problems created for \nproduction sports machines by comparatively smooth-sur- \nfaced mainland circuits expressed serious concerns about \nhow they would fare when ridden to  their limits over the \nordinary public roads of the  Mountain Course. \nROADS \nThe modern equipment used for surfacing the Island’s roads \nhad  improved them for racing through the  1960s and  con- \ntributed to  faster lap times. However, the  TT  course was \nnot  up to race-track standards and it was  subject to the wear \nand tear of daily traffic outside race periods. This meant \nthat \nwithin \na \nyear \nor \nso \nof \na \nnew \nsmooth \nsurface \nbeing \nlaid, \nit \nwould \nreceive \na \ncoat \nof \ntar \nand \nchippings \nto \nprolong \nits \nlife. \nFortunately, \nthe \nmethods \nused \nin \nthat \ntreatment \nhad \nalso \nimproved, \nwith \nchippings \nbeing \nsmaller \nand \nmore \nevenly \nspread, \nso \ngenerally \navoiding \nthe \nnasty \n‘tramline’ \neffects \nof \nearlier \ndays. \nBut \nsurface \nwear \nwas \nnot \neven \nand \nalthough \nthe \ntar \nretained \nthe \nchippings \nbetter \nthan \nbefore, \nin \nheavily \ntrafficked \nareas \nthey \ncould \nbe \nscuffed \noff, \nleaving \nthe  tar  exposed. On  hot  days that could melt, creating a \nserious hazard for  racers. Regrettably, there was little the \norganizers could do about it, given the nature of this public \nroads course. \nBeing ordinary roads, the course also incorporated cam- \nbers not  designed to  suit  the  racing line. It was edged with \nconcrete kerbs, had sundry steel manhole covers embedded \nin the surface and was  regularly dug up to repair burst water \nmains and the  like. All  along it were solid roadside banks, \nThe logo of the Diamond Jubilee TT  meeting in  1967."

For most riders that was the  attraction, but \nfor  a  few  it was a  cause for  complaint and, unfortunately, \ntheir voices would become increasingly strident in years to \ncome. \n1967: THE MACHINES \nHonda dropped their support of the  50  and 125cc racing \nclasses for  1967, but continued to  develop their bigger \nrace bikes. The 250-6 came with increased power to  try \nto  counter the  speed of Yamaha’s fours, plus a  new frame \nto  improve handling. The 350  was redesigned with six  cyl- \ninders giving 70bhp and also had a  new frame. In  typical \nHonda fashion, the  500 also received more power, when \nwhat it really needed was  improved handling. The man due \nto  ride all  the  above, a  frustrated Mike Hailwood, com- \nmissioned his  own frame for  the  500, but  Honda would \nnot  risk ‘losing face’ by letting him use  it.  They contented \nthemselves with a little additional strutting of the rear sub- \nframe. \nMV Agusta and Giacomo Agostini continued with devel- \nopment of their 3-cylinder models but  early-season events \nshowed that the  350  was now down on  speed compared to \nHonda’s new 350-6. \nPhil Read and Bill Ivy  were Yamaha’s works riders, \ntogether with newcomer Akiyasu Motohashi. They would \nuse  the 4-cylinder 125  in  1967. It was said to  give 41bhp at \n17,000rpm, had  ten  gears and could reach 130mph, with \nthe  company’s 250-4 being some 20mph faster. The devel- \nopment of Yamaha’s earliest models into these potent racers \nhad  been a step-by-step process through the  1960s for the \nengineers making up its race department in Japan. \nSuzuki were present with 50  and 125cc machines and  a \nnew batch of riders, although their new V4  125  was  not  yet \nready to race, while Dave Simmonds rode the nearest thing \nto  a works bike from Kawasaki. \nRenzo Pasolini was flying the  flag for  Benelli on  their \n350 and  500cc 4-cylinder models, and while his all-action, \nlean-out riding style endeared him to  the  crowds, there \nwere questions about Benelli reliability. \nApart \nfrom \nthe  \nabove \nand  \nentries \nfrom \nMZ \nwith \nHeinz \nRosner \nand \nDerek \nWoodman, \nthe  \nfield \nin  \nall  \nclasses \nwas \nmade \nup \nof \nproduction \nrace \nmachines \n—  \nnot  \nto \nbe \nconfused \nwith \nproduction \nsports \nbikes \n—  \nfrom \nthe  \nlikes \nof \nHonda, \nYamaha, \nSuzuki, \nBultaco, \nAermacchi \nand, \nstill, \na \nmulti- \ntude \nof \nBritish \nsingles. \nIf \nany \nrecords \nwere \nto \nbe \nbroken \nin \nthe \nsolo \nclasses, \nhowever, \neveryone \nknew \nthey \nwould \ncome \nfrom \nthe \nworks \nentries. \nMotor \nCycling’s \nspeed \ntrap \nshowed \nBill \nIvy \nhitting \n153.8mph \non \nhis \n250 \nYamaha, \nwith \nheavier \nteam \nmate \nPhil \nRead \nat \n148.8mph, \nwhile \nin the \n500cc \nclass, \nMike \nHail- \nwood \n(Honda) \nmanaged \n154.5mph, \nwith \nGiacomo \nAgos- \ntini \n(MV \nAgusta) \nclocked \nat \n152.5mph. \nThe \n500s \nwere \nstill \nrunning \non \nnarrow \n3.50 \nrear \ntyres \nand \nthe \n80bhp \nbeing \nput \nthrough \nthem \nwas \nbeginning \nto \ncreate \nconcern \nabout \nwear \nrates \nover \na \nsix-lap \nrace. \nDISC BRAKES \nA few  competitors experimented with disc brakes, but  all \nthe top runners still relied on  drum brakes. They were usu- \nally twin-leading shoe on  the  front and  single rear, having \ngrown in size  down the years, to  cope with the extra work \nneeded to  stop faster race bikes in shorter distances. Some \ndrum brakes almost filled the wheel, and others came with \nsubstantial cooling fins and air-scoops, to  help shed heat. \nFerodo contributed to  the  growth in  stopping power, by \ndeveloping special racing linings. \nRather like the introduction of  streamlining in  the \n1950s, the  fitting of disc brakes did  not  guarantee instant \nreward, for  it could create problems just as  easily as  solve \nthem. The potential for extra bulk and  their fiercer action \nincreased weight transfer to  the  front wheel, resulting in \nheavier loading of forks and tyres that were not  designed for \nthem. There could also be a  problem with the  rear wheel \ngoing light under heavy braking, thus upsetting the balance \nof the  bike. Nevertheless, people could see  the  potential \nof disc brakes and  there was a feeling that their day would \ncome. \nBATTLES CONTINUE \nThe TT  was a  round of the  World Championship and  rid- \ners  came to  the  Island for the  1967 Diamond Jubilee event \nhaving already been in  competition with each other on \nEuropean circuits. After the  customary practice sessions, \nthey were ready to  renew battle over the  unique Moun- \ntain Course, where a win still  meant so  much to  riders and \nmanufacturers. \nMike Hailwood had been a major force at the TT almost \nsince his debut in  1958, and 1967 was  to bea year in which \nhe  dominated the  major classes riding Hondas. In  the \nLightweight race he  set  new record race average and lap \nspeeds ahead of Phil  Read (Yamaha).

Hailwood knew he  had a fight \non  his  hands but  he was up  for  it, swapping the  lead with \n‘Ago’, as  he was increasingly being known, over the  open- \ning laps at record-breaking speeds. At his refuelling stop at \nthe  end  of the third lap, Hailwood lost  valuable time ham- \nmering a  loose twist-grip back in place, then rejoined the \nfray. With only seconds between them, the outcome was  in \ndoubt until nearing the  end  of the  fifth lap, when the  Ital- \nian’s chain snapped at Windy Corner and he was out  of the \nrace. Still troubled by his loose twist-grip, Hailwood rode \non  to  win  from Peter Williams (Arter Matchless), leaving \nthe race average speed at a new record figure of 105.62mph \nand  also setting a record fastest lap at  108.77mph. \nAfter the race, Mike Hailwood generously expressed the \nview that Ago might well have won for  he  also lapped at \n108mph, but  those who knew the  Honda man felt  that he \nwould not  really have let that happen. A true master of the \nMountain Course, he now had  twelve TT  victories to  his \nname, more than any other rider at that time. \nSpeeds in the  Ultra Lightweight 125  race matched those \nof the  previous year and  Phil  Read (Yamaha) took victory \nby a  little over 3 seconds from Stuart Graham (Suzuki). \nIn  the  50cc race, speeds were slightly down on  the  previ- \nous  year, and  Suzuki achieved a  one-two-three finish with \nStuart Graham, Hans-Georg Anscheidt and Tommy Robb. \nBMW riders continued to  battle for  supremacy in  the \nSidecar class, where Siegfried Schauzu led home Klaus End- \ners  and Colin Secley, taking 10  seconds off  the  previous \nfastest race time. \nIn  the  new Production race, the  winners were: 750cc \nClass, John Hartle (Triumph Bonneville) at  a  race average \nspeed of  97.10mph; 500cc Class, Neil Kelly (Velocette \nVenom Thruxton), 89.89mph; 250cc Class, Bill Smith \n(Bultaco \nMetralla), \n88.63mph. \nIt \nwas \nconsidered \nto  \nbe  \na \nsatisfactory \ndebut \nfor \nthe \nnew \nclass, \nwhich \nset \ntarget \nspeeds \nfor \nfuture \nyears. \nAs \nwas \nthe \nnorm \nin \nProduction \nracing, \nthere \nwas \ndissent \nbetween \nriders \nand \norganizers \nover \ncom- \npliance \nwith \nthe \nregulations \nfor \nthe \nevent. \n1968: MORE RACES \nShort-circuit racing in  Britain was suffering from falling \nattendances but spectator and competitor interest in  the \nTT remained high. Among road-riding motorcyclists there \nwere still kudos to  be  gained from being able to  tell  your \nmates, ‘I’m going to the TT’. The Diamond Jubilee of 1967 \nhad seen record entries, boosted by the  new Production \nrace. That level was  maintained for 1968, where the Sidecar \nrace was split into two classes, run  concurrently, for up to \n500cc machines and 501—750cc ones. The latter gave an \nopportunity to use  big BSA and Triumph engines, although \namong the  entries of fifty 500s and forty 750s, the  500cc \n‘Renn Sport’? BMWs remained the  fastest. It was a  year in \nwhich riders from over twenty countries came to  ride the \nMountain Course. \nColin Seeley had purchased the manufacturing rights for \nNorton, AJS  and  Matchless race machines and  operated a \nservice depot on  the Island, providing support for the many \nriders still using them. As  well as  uprated engine compo- \nnents and such, he produced the Seeley frame and complete \nSeeley race machines. \nReally bad news was that Honda and Suzuki would not \nbe on  the Island, having pulled out  of World Championship \nracing. Yamaha were present with works bikes, but  were \nexpected to  reduce their commitment to  top-level racing \nafter the TT.  MV Agusta fielded Giacomo Agostini and, for \nthe first time in eight years, John Hartle. \nA  rejig of  the race programme saw the Sidecars run \non  Saturday evening, 50cc and Lightweights on  Monday, \nProduction and  Junior on  Wednesday, with Ultra Light- \nweight and Senior on  Friday. Spectators were by now used \nto hearing full race commentaries from Manx Radio, which \nhelped their understanding of what was going on  around \nthe course. \nDunlop had  new KR83 tyres available for solos, which, \nin cross-section, gave a more rounded profile. This allowed \na  smoother transition between vertical and lean, with the \nnew tyres also being able to  handle more power.

It was one  fitted with double-disc \nfront brakes, from Dunstall’s catalogue of components for \nracing. Ray Knight was first 500 home on  a  Triumph and \nTrevor Burgess (Ossa) finished as top 250, at a speed slightly \nslower than in  1967.

This left  the  two Italians Giacomo \nAgostini (MV Agusta) and Renzo Pasolini (Benelli) to fight \nthings out  on  their 4-cylinder 350cc four-strokes, with \ntwo-stroke-mounted Heinz Rosner (MZ) looking for third \nplace. That was  the way it went initially, with their respec- \ntive  straight-line speeds given as  152.5, 152  and  140mph, \nwith Bill  Smith on  an  ageing Honda at  130.4mph.

An  indication of what Bill \nIvy had  to  do to  achieve that lap comes from the  words of \na  spectator who watched his  progress down the  hill  after \nBarregarrow crossroads: \nIvy streaked down the  hill  standing on  the footrests, wres- \ntling with the bike in  an  effort to  control a  terrifying tank \nslapper. The front wheel was  flopping about all  over the \nplace and the bike was  doing its best to  tie itself into  a  knot. \nBut  Ivy didn’t shut down a  scrap —  he just stood up  and \nfought it with the  throttle wide open at  130mph. \nThat record-breaking 125  TT of 1968 is part of TT history, \nnot  least because Bill  Ivy actually stopped at  Creg ny  Baa \ntowards the  end of the  race, ostensibly to  enquire of his \nrace position, although the  real reason was  to  comply with \nYamaha team orders that Phil Read should win. \nLast race of the  week was the  Senior TT, and  this pro- \nvided Agostini with his  first double win in  a  week.

Seemingly, Yamaha had  at  last  matched ports, tim- \ning and  exhausts, all features that could make or  break the \nperformance of a two-stroke engine. \nIn  1969 Yamaha brought out  improved production race \nbikes with the  250cc TD2 and the  new 350cc TR2. Still \nair-cooled, output of the 250 went up from 39bhp to 44bhp \nat  10,000rpm and a  factory quoted maximum speed of \n133mph via  a  five-speed gearbox. Closely resembling the \n250, the  350  TR2 gave 54bhp at  9,500rpm and a speed of \n139mph. Initially in short supply, those production Yamaha \nrace bikes quickly became the  machine of choice for  the \nmajority. They were also the ones whose results were most \nnoticeably influenced by who had  prepared them and  how \nmuch had been spent upon them, for out  on  track substan- \ntial  differences in  performance could be  seen from what \nwere nominally the  same machines. \nRace bikes came with manufacturers’ recommendations \nto  replace major components like  pistons and  crankshafts \nafter a prescribed number of racing miles. That could be an \nexpensive business and not  every owner complied. Given \nthe  mixed quality of preparation that was carried out  with \nmachines in  the  hands of so  many different owners, pro- \nduction race bikes did not  have the strongest reputation for \nreliability over the  TT  Mountain Course, while those rid- \ning super-tuned versions were even less certain of reach- \ning the  finish of a 226-mile TT  race. Phil Read’s machines \nwould have been among the  best prepared, but after some \nmechanical issues during practice one  year, he commented \nthat \nthe  \n‘Mountain \nCourse \nwas \ndesigned \nto  \nproduce \ngreat \nbikes \nas \nwell \nas \ngreat \nriders’. \nYamaha \nprovided \nan \nelement \nof \nsemi-works \nsupport \nthrough \nits \nEuropean \narm \nto \na \nselect \nfew \nriders, \nincluding \nTT \nrunner \nRod \nGould, \nwho \nalso \nhad \naccess \nto \na 125cc \ntwin. \nWhile Yamaha supplied the  majority of over-the-coun- \nter  250 and 350cc racers, others were available at  differ- \nent  times from Suzuki, Kawasaki, Greeves, Cotton and  so \non.  Some, like  the  Kawasaki 250cc A1-R and 350cc A7-R, \nwere ‘proper’ racers, while others converted models like \nthe  250cc Suzuki Super 6 roadster into machines for  the \ntrack. \nNAMES \nWith some top  riders no  longer paid to  race and  retiring \nfrom the  TT  scene, the  way was open for  new names to \ncome to  the  fore in  Island racing. Names like Kel  Carru- \nthers, Rod Gould, Dave Simmonds, Paul Smart, Charles \nMortimer, John Williams, Charlie Williams, Tony Jef- \nferies, Brian Randle, Mick Grant and Tony Rutter were \nincreasingly seen on  the  leader board although, as  will be \nseen, not  all stuck with the  event. \nTRADE SUPPORT \nLess prominent than in  earlier years, when the  majority \nof needs to  be  met were the  fairly standard ones of Brit- \nish  singles, major component suppliers were still present \nto  support TT  runners. The greater variety of machinery \nbeing raced meant a wider range of items had to be carried \nby those supplying sparking plugs, carburettor spares and \nso  on,  while in the world of tyres, Dunlop were increasing \ntheir specialization and now developed different tyres to \nsuit different machines. In 1969 they had three types of tyre \nand five different tread styles for solo and sidecar use. As yet \nthey did not produce special wet-weather versions, but they \ndid introduce ‘grip cells’, comprising 2,000 small-diameter \nholes moulded into the  tread pattern, which were said to \noffer benefits in the  wet. \nTHE RACING \nThe 500 and 750cc Sidecars were given separate races, \nwhich tempted some of the  BMW runners to  fit enlarged \nbarrels to  their 500s and tackle the  opening 750 race in \nthe  hope of earning extra prize money. It was a tactic that \nproved successful for Siegfried Schauzu, who took his 550cc \nBMW \nto \nvictory \nat \nrecord-breaking \nspeeds. \nWith \n500cc \nbarrels refitted for the  smaller-capacity World Champion- \nship \nevent, \nSchauzu \nfinished \nsecond \nto \nKlaus \nEnders, \nwho \nrode \na \ncontrolled \nrace \nto \nset \nanew \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nwith- \nout \nbreaking \nhis \nown \nlap \nrecord \nfrom \n1968. \nHelmut \nFath’s \nw"

MZ and  Benelli had  a works pres- \nence in  the Lightweight race, with the  Benellis ridden \nby Kel Carruthers and Phil Read.

There were calls for  the  course to  be  made \nsafer, a  very difficult task given its  nature, but  the  racers \nthemselves accepted the  loss and went on  with the  racing. \nMore than anyone, they knew the potentially high price to \nbe paid for racing over the  Mountain Course. \nFormer Medical Officer for  the  races, Dr  Pat  Cullen, \nwhen asked what he  thought of riders risking their lives \nracing, said, ‘I don’t think they are  fools, some are  brave, \nsome are  lacking in  imagination —  | think one can  say  that \nthey do not  regard life  as  something which should be  held \nonto terribly dearly’, \nRegrettably, the  threat of death was, and  still is, insepa- \nrable from TT  racing. Riders adopted different attitudes to \nriding the course, with some claiming they did not  actually \n‘race’, or  that they only rode at  ‘nine-tenths’. But  it was \njournalist Ted Macauley who encapsulated the  attitude of \nthe  professional racer of the  time, who was  there to  win, \nwhen he described Bill Ivy’s riding to set the first 100mph lap \nby a  125cc machine back in  1968. Writing later, Macauley \ntold how Ivy ‘threw himself into heart-stopping moments \nof defiance of the course’s terrible promise to  anybody who \ntook liberties with it’. \nMajor works at the Verandah saw  its four bends widened \nand resurfaced prior to  the  1970 TT, resulting in  a  faster \npassage for riders and  a further saving of time. \nRoadworks at the Verandah show the sort of activity that occurs on  the TT  course when the racers are not around. \nee \nPRODUCTION RACING \nHaving proved themselves in  three-lap races since being \nintroduced to  the  Mountain Course in  1967, the  seventy- \nplus riders in what had become the International Production \nRace were required to  race over five  laps and 189  miles in \n1970. The ‘Proddie’ race seemed to have caught the imagi- \nnation of racegoers, boosting visitor numbers for its  Satur- \nday race slot, although some argued that it should be part of \nthe main race week. The Saturday running might well have \nbeen one  of those commercially based TT  decisions, aimed \nat bringing an  influx of visitors for a long weekend by offer- \ning them the  easy-to-follow massed start Production race. \nInitially known for  their small-capacity road bikes, \nJapanese manufacturers had been gradually building \nlarger-capacity ones through the  1960s, and  Honda CB750 \n4-cylinder machines were now entered in the  big Produc- \ntion class, alongside Triumph Trident 3-cylinder 750s, \ntwin-cylinder Nortons, Triumphs and  BMWs. Ina slightly \nstrange scenario, while the  BSA Triumph Group was able \nto provide works machines for American racing, it claimed \nthat differences in  specifications between American and \nEuropean racing meant it  could not  give works support \nto  events at  home. A magazine of the  day explained how \nTriumph entries, and  those of Honda, were actually made \n‘through a  (pretty transparent) veil  of dealer entries’."

Many machines were now fitted with fair- \nings, yet the  500 and 750cc classes seemed not  to  match \neither the  straight-line or  race speeds of previous years. \nHowever, the  750 race did  see  a  titanic struggle between \nMalcolm Uphill (Triumph) and  Peter Williams (Norton), \nwith victory going to  Uphill by less  than 2 seconds, after \nWilliams’ Norton spluttered with fuel starvation over the \nlast  couple of miles. Only in  the  250cc class were records \nbroken, and they went to  winner Chas Mortimer on  his \nDucati MkIII, who finished 6 seconds ahead of John Wil- \nliams (Honda CB250). \nFor 1970 the 750cc Sidecar race ran on  Monday and \nthe  500cc race on  Wednesday. Klaus Enders set  new lap \nrecords in both races and  took victory in  the  500cc event. \nThe \n750cc \nrace \nwent \nto \nSiegfried \nSchauzu \nand \nnew \nrace \naverage speeds were set. \nThe \nLightweight \n250cc \nrace \nalso \nran \non  \nMonday, \nand \nhere \nKel  \nCarruthers \n(Yamaha) \nrode \nto  \nvictory \nover \nRod \nGould \n(Yamaha) \nat \na \nfaster \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nthan \nin  \n1969. \nBoth Carruthers and Gould wore jet-style helmets, while \nthe  majority still wore pudding-basin style.

The Spanish single-cyl- \ninder, disc-valve two-stroke, had been timed at  137mph at \nThe Highlander and  Herrero was contesting the lead of the \n250cc World Championship at the time. Popular with other \nriders, his death gave weight to  a growing undercurrent of \nopposition among GP  competitors about having to  race to \nwin over a  course that was so  very different and difficult \nto  learn, compared to  the  average GP  circuit. Ironically, \nthe  Ultra Lightweight 125cc race was won by another rider \nappearing at  the  TT  primarily to  gain points for his  World \nChampionship challenge.

In  the  Senior, where his  race average was \nlower than in the Junior, he took over 4 minutes longer to \ncomplete the race than in  1969. There were battles aplenty \nfor  podium places in  both races, with Alan Barnett (Aer- \nmacchi) just failing to  set  the  first 1OOmph lap by a  350cc \nsingle while riding to  second place in  the  Junior. He  did \ntop  the 100mph lap in  the  Senior on  a  Seeley before he \ndropped it at  Doran’s, while in  close company with Peter \nWilliams (Arter Matchless). The latter, who was one of \nthose who claimed not  to  ‘race’ on  the  Island, also lapped \nat  over 100mph on  his  ride to  second place, saying of the \nMountain Course, ‘there is  no  doubt that it provides the \nPeter Williams (3) with Alan Barnett (5) in pursuit on  the Quarter Bridge Road. \ngreatest experience of fast motor- \ncycle riding in the  world’. \nTHE COURSE \nThe 1970 event finished with \ncriticism of the  TT  course by sev- \neral voluble riders, who called for \n‘1970 roads on  which to race 1970 \nmachines’. They had a point. The \nroads of the course were described \nat the  time by the  magazine Motor- \ncycle Sport as  ‘made up of good-class \nmain roads yet  they are not \ncomparable with good-class main \nroads on  the  mainland’. Particu- \nlarly vocal was Lightweight winner \nKel Carruthers, whose race aver- \nage was 96.13mph. Twenty years \nearlier, the Lightweight TT was \nwon by Dario Ambrosini (Moto \nGuzzi) at  a  race average speed of \n78.08mph. Ignoring the faster \nspeeds of the works Yamahas from \nseveral years before, that showed a \ngrowth of 18mph in twenty years, \nduring which time the roads of \nthe course had been improved. \nCarruthers clearly thought those \nimprovements had lagged behind \nmachine performance, but the \nIsland aimed for  normal highway \nstandards, not race-track ones. \nThere were always going to  be \ncambers that did  not  suit the  rac- \ners, street furniture that could \nbe  a  danger to  anyone falling off, \nlittle in  the  way of run-off areas \nand the  prospect of molten tar  in \nhot weather. \nThe dissatisfaction being expressed by a few was a prel- \nude  to  more of those who did not  like the  TT  deciding not \nto  race there; although, at  the  time, the  prospect of losing \npotential World Championship points was  usually sufficient \nto  bring them to  the  Island.

Earlier \nmention was made of the  long \napproach to  Hillberry giving \nriders time to  build up  their \ncourage to  take it  at  speed, \nand Peter Williams summed \nthings up  nicely by describing \nthis right-hand sweep as  ‘a bit \nof a dare’. \nThe Cronk y Voddy straight \nwas still a  bumpy stretch and \nvery testing for Production \nbikes at  speed. It  was a  loca- \ntion that revealed to  experi- \nenced watchers how poor their \nhandling was compared with \ngenuine race bikes. \n1971: A NEW RACE \nNot content with Production races for  Triumph Tridents, \nNorton Commandos, Honda CB750s, BMW R75/5s and \nthe  like, run  to  a fairly restrictive specification, some con- \ntestants wanted to  race more highly tuned and modified \nversions of  those big  roadsters. Accordingly, what was \ncalled the  Formula 750 race was added to  the  programme \nin  1971. This allowed for  more tuning of both engine and \nchassis. It  was run over three laps with the  novelty of a \nclutch start in  pairs at  10-second intervals and attracted \nthirty-nine entries, which included a degree of works sup- \nport. It  also yielded a  splendid race, with the  first three \nriders all averaging over 100mph and winner Tony Jefferies \n(Triumph) finishing at a race average speed of 102.85mph, \nwhile setting the fastest lap at  103.21mph.

Another rarity \nwas  the sight of Barry Sheene competing in the Ultra Light- \nweight race. Sheene was riding a  speedy ex-works Suzuki \nbut slid off at Quarter Bridge on  the second lap and decided \nthat was the  end of his TT  career. \nSpeeds crept ahead of the previous fastest in the  500 and \n750cc Production races, with wins going to  John Williams \n(Honda CB450) and Tony Jefferies (Triumph Trident), \nbut  250cc winner Bill  Smith (Honda CB250) was  slightly \nslower than before. \nIn  what was generally portrayed as  a  belt-tightening \nworld for former works riders now forced to  campaign pri- \nvate production racers, Phil Read treated himself to  a Rolls \nRoyce Silver Cloud at the  start of the  season.

However, neither the  ACU nor \nthe government picked up  on  the  overall mood towards \nthe \nhigh \ncost \nof \nracing \nin \nthe \nearly \n1970s \nand, \nmore \nimportantly, \nthey \nappeared \nnot \nto \nrecognize \na \ngrowing \nantagonism \ntowards \nthe \nTT. \nPromoters \nof \nWorld \nCham- \npionship \nrounds \nwere \nnotoriously \nmean \nin \nthe \namounts \nthey \npaid \nout \nin \nprize \nmoney \nand, \nwith \nthe \nsum \npaid \nto \nthe \nwin- \nning \nentrant \nat \nthe \nBlue \nRiband \nSenior \nTT \nstill \nthe \nsame \n£200 \nas \nit \nwas \nin \n1930, \nthe \nTT \norganizers \nalso \nexcelled \nin \nGiacomo Agostini leaps his  MV  Agusta over the hump in the Quarter Bridge \nTROUBLED TIMES @  111 \nae \nRoad that is now known as  ‘Ago’s Leap’. \nparsimony. Had prize money increased at  a  rate to  match \ninflation since 1930, a  Senior TT  win would have been \nworth c£2,500 in the  early 1970s. \nThe days when the  sport was awash with funding from \nthe  major Japanese and European factories had  gone, and \nmost riders operated on  tight budgets, with the two-strokes \nof the  day requiring considerable expenditure on  mainte- \nnance. For  all  the  tradition associated with the  TT, that \nitself was not  enough in  the  hard-headed world of racing- \nto-earn-a-living in the  early 1970s, and there was  growing \nopposition to  the  event. There were multiple reasons for \nthis, but many felt that the payment of realistic prize money \nwould have overcome a lot of  them and  reduced the level of \nopposition. Few people went into motorcycle racing with \nthe  intention of getting rich, but there were some who did \ngo on  to  develop that notion, and  were particularly voluble \nat  the  time. \nEntered in  the  Lightweight 125cc TT  in  1972 was pop- \nular Italian rider Gilberto Parlotti, who was leading the \nWorld Championship at  the  time on  his  Morbidelli. Hav- \ning prepared for  his  TT  debut as  thoroughly as  possible, \nhe  came to  the line on  the  last day of race week under \nwet and  overcast conditions. Challenging the  experienced \nChas Mortimer for the  lead on  time, during the  second lap \nParlotti ran  wide at  the  Verandah, collided with a  row of \nconcrete posts and was killed. It was a  tragedy for  racing \nto  lose such a fine rider, and his  death was to  have serious \nrepercussions for Island racing."

Taking this a  step \nfurther, they began a campaign to  have the  TT  stripped of \nits World Championship status. \nSadly, almost a  year later, on  the  approach to  the  1973 \nTT, the World Championship GP series showed that \nnowhere was really safe in  the  world of motorcycle rac- \ning. At the  historic Monza track, top  stars Renzo Pasolini \nand Jarno Saarinen were killed in the  250  race, in an  inci- \ndent that brought down a host of runners on  the high-speed \nCurva Grande. This famous bend was a right-hander with \nno  run-off area, only an  Armco barrier, which threw men \nand machines back into the tracks of following riders. It was \na racing tragedy that is remembered to  this day. \nThe incident at  Monza added weight to  what had been a \ngrowing campaign by riders for  safer race circuits.

Unfortunately, ihe only inter- \nest  some of those stars retained in  the  TT  was  to  snipe at  it \nfrom the  sidelines while casting covetous eyes on  what was \nnow one  of the  richest race meetings in Europe. \nMORETIME SAVED \nThe roads of the  Mountain Course continued to  receive \nimprovement. In  1973 resurfacing and bump-easing work \nwas carried out  through Laurel Bank to  Glen Helen, plus \nslight beneficial realignment at  Sarah’s Cottage. The effect \nof those was to  increase speed over the  combined bends of \nthat tricky section —  for those with sufficient skills. Further \nlengths of fencing were set  back on  the  Mountain, while, \nas  straight-line speeds continued to  increase, riders lived in \nhope that one day the  bumps would be  taken out  of Sulby \nStraight. \nIMPROVED YAMAHAS \nAlready dominant in  the  smaller classes of world racing, \nYamaha formally marketed an  air-cooled 125cc production \nrace bike in  1973, the TA125, putting out  24bhp. However, \nwhat really got the racing world excited was  the upgrading \nof what had become their TD3 and TR3 250  and  350 racers \nwith water-cooling and a little more power to create the TZ \ngeneration of racers. The TZ250 was  now said to give 48bhp \nat  10,500rpm and the TZ350 yielded 60bhp at  10,000rpm. \nNew six-speed gearboxes helped them towards maximum \nspeeds of 139  and 149mph. Those machines were to extend \nYamaha’s already huge influence on  racing, with the  350, \nin only slightly over-bored form, able to  challenge for wins \nin  the  bigger classes. Each bike came with with an  exten- \nsive spares kit  comprising barrels, pistons, crankshaft and \nso  on, for  unlike the old British single-cylinder racers, \nthey could not  be run for a  season without replacement of \nmajor components. Buyers found that performance came \nat  a  price and many were augmenting the  spares kit  with \nthe  purchase of further replacement parts well before the \nseason end. In  1974 the TZ750 went on  public sale. It was, \nin effect, a doubled-up 350  and was said to give over 90bhp \nat  10,000rpm in the state of tune in which it was  marketed \n—  which was below its maximum. \n1974: SUPERBIKES \nAway from racing, in  the  wider world of motorcycling, \ngrowing use  was being made of the  term ‘Superbikes’ in \nregard to  products from the  likes of Kawasaki, Norton, \nTriumph, BMW, Ducati, Honda, Moto Guzzi, MV Agusta \nand Yamaha, for  all  were producing road-going models \nto  support the  growing demand for  large-capacity sport-"

There was certainly plenty of scope for  variety \namong the  ‘Proddies’, although many preferred the  faster, \nnoisier and  more race-oriented models previously found in \nthe  Formula 750 race, which, perhaps to  recognize its  less \nrestrictive specification, was now named the  Open For- \nmula 750 Classic. \nOn the organizational front, additional contributions \nwere made towards riders’ expenses in  1974, and the  ACU \nbecame more selective about acceptance of entries. This \nmeant that some who had  previously entered just for  a  fast \nrun  around the  course had  their entries returned. \nSPEEDS \nThere were plenty of speedy laps set  during practice for \nthe 1974 TT, with ton-up ones now routinely expected \nfrom top runners in the  larger classes; well over fifty were \nrecorded in  practice week.

That was an  incredible Smph faster than before, \nbut Steinhausen’s two-stroke did  not  finish the race. Heinz \nLuthringshauser also rode BMW to  win the  Sidecar 500cc \nrace, from rising star George O’Dell on  his  Konig. It was \ninteresting to  see  O’Dell’s Konig followed by Weslake, \nYamaha, BSA and Honda-powered outfits. Seemingly, the \n500cc BMW’s long-term supremacy was under threat, but \nit had been a wonderful run. \nThe Ultra Lightweight and Junior races took place in \ngood conditions and  Clive Horton (Yamaha) was  first 125 \nhome at  88.44mph. It was this class that still had  the  big- \ngest gap to  close on  the existing record race average speed, \nwhich stood to Phil Read at 99.12mph. Fastest 350 was  Tony \nRutter (Yamaha), whose race average speed of 104.44mph \nwas  very close to Agostini’s record of 104.78mph, and Chas \nMortimer’s fastest lap of  106.39mph was within sight of \nMike Hailwood’s record 350cc lap of 107.73mph. Clearly, \nthe new water-cooled Yamahas came with sufficient speed \nto  challenge the  records set  by former works machines, \nalthough there was no  opportunity to  prove that in  the \nLightweight 250 race, for  wet conditions slowed Charlie \nWilliams’ (Yamaha) race average winning speed to just over \n90mph. Anyone lucky enough to  be  racing a  true works \nYamaha racer, a  YZR250 or  350, would have noticeably \nmore power in a bike that was  much lighter than a standard \nproduction TZ  model. \nThe 1974 Senior TT  lost its  customary Friday slot in \nthe  race programme to  the  Open Formula 750cc Classic \nrace and was scheduled for  Wednesday. However, poor \nweather saw  it moved to Thursday and reduced to five  laps, \nwhen it was  won by Phil  Carpenter (Yamaha) at 96.99mph. \nSuzuki’s new 4-cylinder RG500s appeared in the  Senior in \nthe  hands of Jack Findlay and  Paul Smart, but  did  not  last \nthe  distance. Conditions were slightly better for  Friday’s \nFormula \n750 \nrace, \nwhere \ninitial \nrain \ngave \nway \nto \ndrying \nroads. \nBut \nthe \nexpected \nbig-bike \nbonanza \nwas \nspoiled \n(for \nsome) \nby \nover-bored \nYamaha \nTZ350s, \nwhich \ntook \nthe \nfirst \nthree \nplaces \nin \nthe \nhands \nof \nChas \nMortimer, \nChar- \nTROUBLED TIMES MP  115 \nlie  Williams and  Tony Rutter, at  an  average race speed of \n100.52mph. Best four-stroke was  the Triumph of Percy Tait \nin fourth place. \nSo  ended an  interesting TT, although one in  which the \nsolo classes were dominated by the  sight, sound and  smell \nof  Yamaha two-strokes. A  similar situation prevailed in \nthe  wider world of racing and  attracted a  mixed response, \nleaving race followers wondering if the  company should be \nseen as  saviours of racing, or  as  wreckers, particularly as \nthey now had  new 4-cylinder works YZ500 and  TZ750cc \nmachines, which they intended to  make available to  pri- \nvateers, a  few of the  750s already being in  the  hands of \nfavoured riders. \nMORETHAN POWER \nWhile machines of the  early 1970s had  been gaining more \npower, there were other important factors that helped rid- \ners  reduce the  time they took to  do a lap of the TT  course. \nRace tyres were under continual development from the \nprincipal suppliers, Dunlop and  Michelin, with most types \nnow available in  differing compounds and tread patterns, \nwith the  trend being for  them to  get  ‘stickier’. Those sup- \nplied for Tourist Trophy races were still expected to  last for \na full  six-lap 226-mile race. \nJack Findlay is quoted on  a  Michelin website as  saying \nthat he used slicks while racing on  the  Island in  1974. This \noccurred during practice and  was not  too  well received by \nthe  organizers. Initially experimental, more riders tried \nthem in  1975 and  in  1976 Chas Mortimer won the  Junior \nrace on  a  Yamaha fitted with a  rear slick. Mick Grant was \nalso an  early user and  later described them as  ‘probably the \nbiggest single leap in  grip in  the  history of motorcycling’. \nInitially made just for the  rear, the  suppliers soon came up \nwith versions for the front. \nLike many major advances, there was  a price to  pay  for \nthe increased grip and, as  well as  the fact that riders had  to \nadjust their style to  suit  them, the new tyres also made the \nsuspension work harder. Both riders and  machines had  to \nadapt to  suit the  tyres. It was also a period when TT  races \nstill ran  in the rain, over wet  roads. Slicks were not  suitable \nfor use  in the wet, but there were no  such things as  full wets \nat  the  time and  tyres used in wet conditions were of road- \ntreaded type, built with racing compounds and  carcases. \nThe TT  organizers were initially against the  introduc- \ntion of slick tyres, mostly on  the  grounds that they could \nnot determine when they were worn. Steps were taken to \nhave them banned at the  TT, but that did  not  occur. How- \never, the  ensuing years were to  see  increased specialization \nin  the  world of tyres, which in  the  longer run was not  all \ngood for TT  racing."

Rear units were now available with a  range of \nsprings, and  could be gas- or  oil-filled. \nDrum brakes were gradually giving way to  discs to  help \nstopping and this brought further changes to fork legs, upon \nwhich front-brake calipers were normally mounted. \nAll these changes interacted with one  another and  manu- \nfacturers tried to  develop machines in  a  balanced manner, \nalthough, inevitably, one feature often had more impact \nthan another. With the  above improvements combining to \ncreate better racing motorcycles, it  was no  surprise that \nTT  lap times were reducing and  thus lap speeds increasing, \nalthough perhaps not  quite as  rapidly as  might have been \nexpected. \nMajor changes for  1975 were that the  Ultra Lightweight \n125cc race was  dropped, and the  Production race became a \nten-lap affair for  1000 and  500cc machines and nine laps for \nthe 250s, with each bike ridden by a team of two riders.

It \nwas a  year when there were few BMWs entered in  either \nthe 500 or  1000cc Sidecar races, but multi-TT winner \nSiegfried Schauzu gave the  marque what was to  be its  final \nTT  victory when he  won the  big class at  record-breaking \nspeed. ‘Siggy’ lifted the  race average to  97.55mph and  the \nlap speed to  99.31mph. It was a  final flourish from BMW \nthat fell just 10  seconds short of the  first 100mph lap bya \nthree-wheeler, but  left  a target for the  ever more powerful \nmachines that were to  follow. \n1976: MORE RECORDS BROKEN \nBetween the 1975 and 1976 TT  meetings, several speed- \nrestricting curves on  the  stretch between Braddan Bridge \nand Union Mills were eased. Known locally as  Snugbor- \nough, the  road-straightening saved riders a  few  seconds on \ntheir lap times. \nThe Sidecar races again saw advances in  speed in  1976, \nalthough their absolute lap record remained at  just under \n100mph, with Mac Hobson (Yamaha) setting a  new figure \nof 99.96mph on  his way to  winning the  1,000cc race. Sieg- \nfried Schauzu lifted the  500cc Sidecar record to  97.50mph \nafter troublesome early laps, although the win went to  Rolf \nSteinhausen (Konig). \nIn  the Production race, postponed from Saturday to \nTuesday, BMW got their first solo TT win  since 1939, when \nHelmut Dahne and Hans- Otto Butenuth came home first in \nthe  1000cc class, where a new lap record of 103.13mph was \nset  by Roger Nicholls on  a  twin-cylinder Ducati. The Pro- \nduction TT  was a  strange form of handicap race, in  which \nthe  record books show that the fastest 250 was actually \ngiven the overall win, at a race pace 10mph slower than the \nfastest 1000cc machine and  having completed one  lap less! \nThe outright lap record of 108.77mph, set  back in  1967, \nwas achieved by Mike Hailwood ona 500cc machine. Mick \nGrant and  his big 750 Kawasaki had  gone faster during the \n1975 Classic 1000 race, but  Hailwood’s record still stood \nfor the  Senior and  had  been relatively unthreatened during \nthe  early 1970s. In  what was a  step-change for  the  Sen- \nior  TT, John Williams lifted both the  absolute and  Senior \nlap record to  a  heady 112.27mph on  his  works-supported \nSuzuki RG500. But  what had  seemed like  a certain victory \ndisappeared after Williams had problems at  Governor’s \nBridge on  the  last lap.

      "text": "PAPA E Reso EvelaiN \nA  NEW ERA \nAt  the  end of  1976 the  FIM announced that the  Tourist \nTrophy races would no  longer count towards the  World \nChampionships. The news came as  no  surprise, for  the \ninfluential star riders who wanted to  race only on  artificial \ntracks were determined to take the sport away from natural \nroad circuits, both on  the Isle  of  Man  and on  the Continent. \nWith the decision made, riders could decide which element \nof the sport they would compete in.  Many were happy to do \nboth, but for those of a  single mind-set the  FIM’s decision \nconfirmed the  parting of the  ways. The gulf between the \ntwo could hardly have been made clearer with the news that \nBritain’s round of the World Championships would now be \nheld at  the  flat, featureless, former airfield of Silverstone. \nA greater contrast with the  TT’s Mountain Course could \nhardly be imagined. \nMuch was  written about the future of the Tourist Trophy \nraces in  early 1977, one  magazine headline encapsulating \nthe thoughts of many by asking, ‘Waterloo or  Watershed?’ \nPessimists forecast that the  loss of World Championship \nstatus signified the  beginning of the  end for  Island racing, \nwhile optimists regarded it as  the start of a new era. In sup- \nport of riders, the race budget was  increased to  £150,000, \nwith £100,000 going for  start and prize money, while \nto  make the  event more attractive to  visitors, the  Island \nworked hard to  create additional attractions at  TT  time. \n1977: RACE PROGRAMME \nThe 350cc race was dropped for  1977. Previously known \nas  the  Junior TT, that title was now given to  the  three- \nlap race for  250cc machines, which had been known as  the \nLightweight TT  since 1920. Someone, somewhere, prob- \nably knew the  reason for the  change of name, but race fans \nsaw no  logic in  the  decision. The Production TT  was also \ndropped. A  former winner in  that event, journalist Ray \nKnight, felt that it had lost its way, ‘due to convoluted rules \nthat permitted manufacturers to build any bike to a specifi- \ncation especially written by themselves for the  race’. \nReplacing the Proddies came four-lap races for  new \nclasses of  TT FormulaI, TT Formula II and TT Formula III. \nThey catered for road-based sports machines on which fairly \nextensive alterations could be made to  boost performance. \nFour-strokes were encouraged by giving them a  capacity \nadvantage over two-strokes and Formula races went on  to \ndevelop their own limited World Championship. \nOther changes for 1977 saw the 500cc Sidecar race \ndropped and new two-leg races created for  up  to  1000cc \nmachines. Each would be  of four laps, with an  individual \nwinner plus an  overall winner based on  the  best results \nfrom the  two legs. \nA four-lap Jubilee TT race was  also in the programme, in \nrecognition of Queen Elizabeth’s Silver Jubilee. \nYAMAHA \nEarly in  1977 Yamaha announced it would supply a  batch \nof new race machines to  Britain via sporting dealers. There \nwould be forty TZ250s, forty-eight TZ350s and five  OW31 \nTZ750s. It claimed they were being marketed on  a  sub- \nsidized basis with the  250 charged at  £2,709, the  350 at \n£2,884 and the  750 a  substantial £6,572. Before produc- \ntion of Norton single-cylinder race bikes stopped in 1962, a \nrider could buy a new Manx for £572. However, the OW31 \nwas ahead of its  rivals in  performance, so  it was the  bike \neveryone wanted, though few obtained, for  only seventy \nwere available to  satisfy worldwide demand in  1977. \nThe names of those who would ride the  new Yamahas \nwere publicized and  many of them were TT regulars, with \nmost being dealer-supported. The one-year-old models \nthey discarded would be eagerly sought after by those fur- \nther down the  chain, while riders of older machines who \ncould not  afford to  change bikes would seek more speed by \nupgrading with later parts, if they fitted. \nWith the TT races full of Yamahas, the demand for spares \nwas  always high and specialist dealers would be on the Island \nwith \nthe \nfull \nrange \nto \nkeep \ncompetitors \nmobile. \nThe \ncom- \nbined \ndistance \ncovered \nin \npractice \nand \nracing \nmeant \nthat \nthe \nTT \nwas \na \nhigh-mileage \nevent \nfor \nrace \nmachinery, \nand \nas \nmany \nmajor \ncomponents \nwere \ngood \nfor \nonly \na \nrelatively \nsmall \nnumber \nof \nracing \nmiles, \nit \nwas \nan \nexpensive \nbusiness \nto \nkeep \na \nbike \nin \ntop \norder. \nDespite \nthe \nexpense, \nthe \nmagic \nof \nthe \nTT \ncontinued \nto \nattract \nriders \nin \nlarge \nnumbers."

In  addition, while he  was coming back to \nmuch the same TT course, the machines he  was to  ride \nwere very different in  terms of power, tyres, suspension, \nbrakes and other parts, all  of which now came with a bat- \ntery of variables in  set-up.

      "text": "126 M@  A  NEW ERA \nWORKS SUPPORT \nThe level of works support received by top riders contest- \ning the TT varied through the  1970s, as  it did in the World \nChampionships. Yamaha had years when they were offering \nsupport and years when they were busy on  development and \nthus could not  give support. Sometimes their support was \ndirect from Japan, sometimes from their European branch \nin Amsterdam, or  from Mitsui in Britain. Usually the  sup- \nport was open and  publicized, but  at  other times it might \nbe  ‘under the  counter’. Suzuki were similar, with Suzuki \nGB  handling the  parent company’s TT  and World Cham- \npionship machines and  riders for  several years. Honda had \nnominally been out  of the  sport for  much of the 1970s, \nwhile Kawasaki had limited involvement, mostly with \ntheir 3-cylinder production racers. That involvement \ngrew later in the  decade with the  new FIM F750 Champi- \nonship and  the  appearance of their 250 and 350cc tandem \ntwins. \nIn the late 1970s Yamaha were producing race machines \nfor  the  250, 350, 500 and 750cc classes, having dropped \nthe  125  they marketed for  a  couple of years. By now the \n250 and  350  carried the TZF classification and for  1979 the \n350  received a substantial upgrade, with redesigned ports, \nnew exhausts and  new carburettors with power-jet sys- \ntem operating from 8,000rpm. Said to  give another 8bhp, \nwhich lifted output to  72bhp at  10,500rpm, when this  was \nallied to  considerable weight saving from magnesium cases \nand  aluminium swinging arm, the  350  became noticeably \nquicker. Far  less  work went into the  TZ250F and its  out- \nput remained 53bhp at  10,500rpm. Not  everyone liked the \nTZ’s handling in standard form, particularly with the extra \npower, and an  ever-growing number of specialist frame \nmakers offered alternatives. \nNota great deal was  seen of the YZR500 at the TT, where \nover-bored 350s tended to challenge for the Senior win, but \nthose lucky enough to  get their hands on  TZ750s did  use \nthem in  the  Classic race, although to  quote Tom Herron: \n‘Sulby Straight ...  now that is something out  of this world \non  a  750 Yam —  you have to  consciously brace yourself’, \nNot only did the biggest Yamahas test  a rider’s bravery and \nskill, but  they were also worryingly hard on  tyres over a \nlengthy TT race, where the latest slick tyres were available \nto  use  but  where mid-race tyre/wheel changes had yet to \nbe introduced. \nExperienced teams and riders would return to  the  TT \neach year with some idea of the  settings required for  car- \nburation, gearing and suspension on  the Mountain Course, \nbut much fine-tuning would be carried out  during practice \nto get the right balance. Newcomers often found setting-up \nto  be a daunting task; one  whose initial suspension adjust- \nment \nwas \nout  \ntold \nthat, \nfor  \nhim, \n‘Sulby \nStraight \nwas \none \nbig \ntank-slapper’. \n1979: MILLENNIUM \nThis \nwas  \nnot  \nthe  \nturn-of-the-century \nMillennium \nof \n2000 \ncelebrated \nby \nthe \nworld \nat \nlarge, \nbut \nthe \nlower \nkey \none \nin \n1979 \nthat \nmarked \n1,000 \nyears \nof Tynwald, \nthe \nManx \nPar- \nliament. \nHowever, \nthe \nManx \nworked \nhard \nto \nmake \nevery- \nthing \na \nlittle \nspecial \non \nthe \nIsland \nin \nMillennium \nyear \nand \nthe \nTT \nwas \nexpected \nto \ndo \nits \nbit. \nWhatever Mike Hailwood’s reasons were for  making a \ncomeback at  the  1978 TT, it is certain that a  profusion of \noffers of the  sort that could not  be refused helped make his \nmind up to  return in  1979. The fans were back too, want- \ning to  witness again the  seemingly unhurried and almost \ncasual style of the  man who, in  over twenty years of rac- \ning, showed that he  could ride anything and usually win. \nWhile he would have been guaranteed a good pay day from \nall  of his pre-race contractual arrangements in  1979, there \nwas also the  tempting target of a  £10,000 first prize for \nthe  Schweppes Classic TT  and  £5,000 for a  start-to-finish \nleader of the  Quintin Hazell Senior TT. \nPractice week was  troubled by poor weather, which made \nit difficult to  tell who was  really on  form amongst expected \nfront runners like Alex George, Charlie Williams, Helmut \nDahne, Tony Rutter, an  injured Mick Grant and, of course, \nMike Hailwood, who suffered handling problems with his \nDucati. \nRacing started with the  Formula I event on  Saturday \nafternoon and this time Hailwood could not overcome \nhis  substantial bhp deficiency compared to  the  full-blown \n1,000cc Honda and  Kawasaki fours. The race win went to \nAlex George (Honda), who raised race average and  fastest \nlap speeds to  new records of 110.57 and 112.94mph, leav- \ning Charlie Williams to  take second and Mike Hailwood, \nplagued with problems, to  finish fifth. Ironically, in  1979 \nthe Ducati factory had taken a little more interest in his bike \nthan they did in  1978, although not  all of it was  beneficial. \nSuzuki-mounted for  the  Senior TT, on  a  bike that had \nbeen subject to an  extensive weekend engine rebuild, Mike \nHailwood simply rode away from the  opposition, putting \nin laps of under 20 minutes and winning by 2 minutes from \nTony Rutter (Suzuki), breaking race and  lap records along \nthe \nway \nwith \nspeeds \nof \n111.75mph \nand \n114.02mph. \nThe \nlatter \nwas \nhis \nfastest-ever \nTT \nlap \nand \njust \n0.31mph \noff \nthe \nabsolute \ncourse \nrecord. \nSecond-placed \nTony \nRutter \nwas \na \nprevious \nT'T \nwinner, \nbut \nhe \nsaid \nto \nHailwood \nafter \nthe \nrace, \n‘When \nyou \ncame \nby \nI \ntried \nto \nkeep \nup \nwith \nyou, \nbut \nno \nway \n.... \nThat \nSenior \nrace \nwas \ndominated \nby \nSuzuki \nand \nYamaha \nmachinery."

Williams set  impressive new \nrace and lap figures of 105.13mph and 106.83mph on  his \nMaxton-framed bike, during what had  been restored to  a \nsix-lap race. \nSUCCESSORS? \nWhen Mike Hailwood announced after racing had  finished \nin  1979 that his  TT  career was at  an  end, people looked \naround for  someone who might emulate his  fourteen TT \nwins. As well as  the established riders who shone that year, \nshort-circuit ace Ron Haslam showed in  his  second year \nthat he was  getting to  grips with TT  racing. Strangely, this \nmay have been aided by a spectac- \nular fall at Ballaugh Bridge, when \nhe admitted he was going for the \nhigh-jump record, for  it  might \njust have steadied his future pace. \nHaslam knew that he  needed to \ntreat the TT differently from \nshort circuits, telling how Mike \nHailwood ‘gave me  a  wonderful \nriding lesson on  the Island... I'd \ntag on  behind him and watch him \nride ...  it was a masterclass’. \nAnother to  excite and grab \nthe imagination of  the crowds \nin 1979 was Kiwi newcomer \nGraeme Crosby. With his big \nKawasaki fitted with high-bars, \nhis wheelying out  of slow corners \nlike the  Gooseneck brought him \nto \npeople’s \nnotice \nand \nhe \nwas \na \ndefinite \ncrowd \npleaser. \nHis \nrace \nperformances \nalso \nrevealed \nhis \ntalent, \nwith \nfourth \nplace \nin \nthe \nA  NEW ERA @  127 \nFormula I race at an  average of 107.39mph and a fastest lap \nof 109mph. They were the  fastest laps ever by a  newcomer. \nAmong up-and-coming sidecar racers, a  young Mick Bod- \ndice was another who liked to  entertain the  crowds at  Bal- \nlaugh Bridge with height and distance. That was until he \nbegan to  experience problems with stretched chains, when \nhe decided a more mature approach was required. \nPARADING \nThe TT  liked to  show off its  history and one way was to \nallow former stars to  parade around the  course between \nraces. Nowadays that is done in  strictly controlled condi- \ntions, with the  pace set  by travelling marshals. At the  1979 \nTT, the  ‘parade’ was more of a free-for-all. \nFastest in  that Millennium Parade was Percy Tait, who \nlapped in  23  minutes 9 seconds, at  an  average lap speed of \nsome 97.5mph. Alan Dugdale was second on  a  Matchless \njust ahead of Messrs Read and Surtees, whose lap times \nwere 96  and 95mph. Also in  the  field were past winners \nlike Stanley Woods, Georg Meier, Tommy Wood, Geoff \nDuke and Bill Lomas. All  commented that the  course was \nvery much smoother than in  their days. Indeed, even the \nnotorious Cronk y Voddy straight had received attention, \nalthough it still could not  be classed as  smooth. \n1980: A BUMPY RIDE \nThere were no  complaints from sidecar crews about the \nNot \na  \nrace \nbetween \nJohn \nSurtees \nand \nPhil \nRead \non  \nMV \nAgustas, \nbut \na \nparade \nlap \nin \n1979: \nhere \nthey \nare \nentering \nParliament \nSquare."

Those \nFIT  and FHI races were won on  Yamaha’s RD350LC and \nRD250LC machines, which were destined to  achieve cult \nstatus on  road and  track. \nAninteresting machine in the Junior was  the third-placed \nCotton of  Steve Tonkin. It  was equipped with a  Rotax \nwater-cooled, disc-valve, tandem-twin engine, which was \nto  make its  mark at  the  TT  with other makers during the \n1980s, so  challenging the  Yamaha monopoly of the  class. \nCLASSIC \nThe closing Classic race of the  1980 TT was open to  1300cc \nmachines, and  Mick Grant turned out  on  a  1060cc Honda, \nRon Haslam on  a  999cc Honda and Graeme Crosby on  a \n1084cc Yoshimura Suzuki. Along with Charlie Williams \n(Yamaha), they were the  pre-race favourites (Alex George \nwas  absent through injury).

They did  this  later in the year and  so  started a long \nand  unconventional relationship, where the  company bent \nits  normally strict rules to  accommodate this special road- \nracing talent. \nJoey Dunlop headed an  influx of talented Irish riders \nto  the  TT  in the  early 1980s, which included Donny Rob- \ninson, Sam McClements, Con Law and Steve Cull.

That was well \nover twice the  output of a  good Manx of the  early 1960s. \nNo  comparable figures are  available to  show what speed a \nNorton reached on  the drop from Creg ny Baa to  Brandish, \nbut  the  best-ever published speed of a  Norton single from \nSulby Straight was Mike Hailwood’s 138.46mph in  1960, \nwith several other 500cc singles hitting 130-plus mph there \nin the  same era. Hailwood’s 138.46mph at  Sulby has  to  be \nworth at  least 140-plus mph on  the  drop to  Brandish, sub- \nject  \nto  \ngearing, \nwhich \nindicates \nthat \nbig \nincreases \nin  \nbhp \ngive \nrelatively \nsmall \nincreases \nin \nmph. \nLooking \nat  \nthose \nsituations, \nwhich \nwere \nnearly \ntwenty \nyears \napart, \nif \nit \nis assumed \nthat \nthe \nspeed \nof \nHailwood’s \nSenior \nTT-winning \nRG500 \nof \n1979 \nwas \non \na par \nwith \nWoodland’s \nof \n1980, \nthe \ndifference \nmade \nby \nthe \nextra \ntop- \nend \nspeed \nachieved \nby \nMike’s \n500cc \nSuzuki \nover \nhis \n500cc \nNorton \ncan \nbe \nillustrated \nby \ncomparing \nhis \nfastest \nlap \non \na \nNorton \n— \n101.31mph \nin \n1961 \n— \nwith \nhis \nfastest \nlap \non \na \nSuzuki \nRG500 \n— 114.02mph \nin \n1979. \nThat \ngives \na \ngain \nin \nlap \nspeed \nof \nalmost \n13mph, \nwhich \nwas \nalso \na 13 \nper \ncent \nincrease. \nThat \ncame \nafter \na \ndoubling \nof bhp \navailable \nto \nthe \nrider. \nHowever, \ntop \nspeed \nis \nnot \nthe \nonly \nfactor \nto \ncon- \nsider \nwhen \ncomparing \nthe \neffect \nof \npower \non \nlap \ntimes, \nfor \nas \nwell \nas giving \nincreased \nmaximum, \nthe \ngreater \nbhp \non \ntap \ncan \ncontribute \nto a \nmuch \nbroader \nspread \nof \npower \nand \nimproved \nacceleration. \nFaster \nlap \ntimes \nwould \nalso \nhave \nowed \nsomething \nto \nthe \nimprovements \nmade \nto \nhandling \nand \nbraking, \nplus \nthe \neffect \nof \ncourse \nimprovements. \nBack in  the 1960s a  similar situation had applied to \nspeed/time gains for  Mike Hailwood, when he  switched \nfrom a  500cc Norton to  a  500cc MV Agusta. In that move \nhe gained over 20bhp, but even three years later, he had put \nonly 4’mph on  his best lap speed. That meant 40 per  cent \nmore power gave a 4 per cent gain in lap speed. \nJust to  throw in another detail —  in  1966 Giacomo Ago- \nstini (MV Agusta) and  Mike Hailwood (Honda) were the \ntwo fastest 500s timed on  the  drop from Creg ny  Baa at \n151.9mph. Their machines were said to  be  giving about \n80—85bhp. \nIt is worth mentioning that the only official timing at the \nTT  in those earlier eras was of the  time taken by competi- \ntors to  complete a full  lap.

It left  some claiming that ‘the TT  was the \nrichest motorcycle event in the  world’. Certainly the  good \nmoney on  offer attracted the  top  road racers and, perhaps \nindirectly, it thus contributed to  faster races. \nIn  the  wider world of racing, the  FIM announced that \n1982 would be  the  last year of the 350cc class in  World \nChampionships and Yamaha’s TZ350H of  1981 was their \nlast 350cc racer. It  came with a  power valve that oper- \nated on  the  exhaust at higher revs and 55bhp was available \nfrom an  engine that had seen elements of redesign aimed \nat  increasing reliability and component life.

It was  the only change \nto  the race programme for what was the  seventy-fifth anni- \nversary of the  first TT  meeting. This was recognized by \nthe  usual issue of commemorative postage stamps and the \nminting of 50p pieces bearing an  image of Mick Grant. Of \nrather more importance to  competitors was the fact that \nthe  weather held good throughout practice and racing. \nMissing from the anniversary meeting in  1982 was \nGraeme Crosby.

As  is the  way \nat  such spots, his  wheels had  hardly stopped \nturning before a pint of beer was  thrust in his \nhand but, still keyed-up, he prowled round the \nbike and  suddenly spotted a kinked fuel line. \nPutting his beer aside, the  line was straight- \nened to allow a full flow of fuel, Williams put \non  his  helmet and gloves and rejoined the  race. Knowing \nthat he  had lost too  much time to  be  in  with a  chance of \nvictory, he was still determined to  show what he could do \nand on  his  fourth circuit he  broke the  Senior lap record, \nlifting it to  115.08mph. \nThis year the  350s had their own race within the  Senior \nand victory went to  Tony Rutter. His race average speed \nwas 108.53mph, which beat Chas Mortimer’s record \nof  106.78mph, set  back in  1976 at  the  last  running of a \nrace for  350s. Graeme McGregor set  a  new lap record \nof  112.03mph. Race speeds may have changed between \n1976 and 1982, but  what remained the  same was that the \nold  and  new figures had  all been set  on  Yamahas, for  they \nwere still the dominant race bikes of the day. Change was  in \nthe  air,  however, and  despite Yamaha swamping the  entry \nin the Junior 250cc event, it turned into a race of attrition \nfor  the  marque, with a  host of retirements, leaving Con \nLaw to  ride his  Ehrlich to  victory at  just below record \nspeed. A tandem twin, the Ehrlich was  variously described \nin  the  programme and results as  a  Waddon, a  Waddon- \nEhrlich and  a  Rotax-powered Waddon. It was also known \nas  an  EMC. \nThe only record broken in  the  two Sidecar races was in \nRace B, where Jock Taylor lifted the  fastest lap speed to \n108.29mph. \nSadly, \nTaylor \nwas \nkilled \nlater \nin \nthe \nsummer \nduring the  Finnish GP. \nPrevious \nyear’s \nFormula \nII \nwinner \nTony \nRutter \nwas  \nrid- \ning \na  \nDucati \nagain \nand, \nwith \nan  \nelement \nof \nworks \nsupport, \nlifted \nrace \naverage \nand \nlap \nrecords \nby \nan \nincredible \n6mph. \nThat \nsort \nof \nincrease \nwas \nunknown \nin \nTT \nraces \nin \nan \nage \nwhen \nthey \nwere \nbeing \nwon \nat \nover \n100mph \nand \nit \nwas \na \nperformance \nin \nwhich \nRutter \ntrounced \nthe \nopposition, \nwinning \nby \n4 minutes. \nNo  \nrecords \nwere \nset  \nin  \nthe  \nClassic \nrace, \nwhere \nHonda \nbrought \none  \nof \ntheir \nnew \nV4s  \nfor \nJoey \nDunlop \nto  \nride  \nonly \nto  \nfind \nduring \npractice \nthat \nit \nwas \nnot  \nup  \nto  \nthe  \ndemands \nof \nthe \nMountain \nCourse. \nDunlop \nreverted \nto \nhis \nwell-tried \nA  NEW ERA @  135 \nIn  recognition of Con Law’s record lap of  !!0mph on  his  EMC. \ntransverse-four, but  he  was among retirements from the \nrace, as  were fancied challengers such as  Charlie Williams, \nRon Haslam, Mick Grant and Steve Tonkin. Victory went \nto  Dennis Ireland (Suzuki) from Jon Ekerold (Suzuki). \n1983: TWO JUNIORS \nThe Formula III race was dropped for  1983 and  the  350cc \nrace machines were now given a race of their own, instead \nof running with the  500s in  the  Senior TT, as  in  1982. \nThe new race was called the  Junior 350cc TT  and  joined \nthe Junior 250cc TT in the race programme, both running \nover six  laps. The former Blue Riband Senior TT  had  lost \nits  premier status to  the  Classic TT  in recent years, but for \n1983 the two races were combined to give the Senior Clas- \nsic  TT, open to  machines up to  1000cc and  run on  Friday \nof race week. \nThe 1983 race programme opened with the  customary \nFormula I race, which went to  Joey Dunlop and his  new \nRS850 V4  Honda at  record race average and lap speeds, \nfrom Mick Grant and Rob McElnea on  997cc works \nSuzukis. Privateer Trevor Nation (Suzuki) took a fine  fifth \nplace on  second-hand tyres. Unusually for  the  TT, the \nweather was blisteringly hot, taxing the  riders even more \nthan usual over their six laps. The Sidecar races were run  at \na  slower pace than in recent years and  the  A race provided \na  second win for  Dick Greasley on  his  misfiring Yamaha, \nwhile race B gave Mick Boddice his first win after fourteen \nyears of trying.

However, \nBrown gambled on  getting three laps out  of a tank of petrol, \nbut  spluttered into retirement at  Creg ny Baa  towards the \nend of his  third lap. In  only his  second TT,  Rob McElnea \n(Suzuki) took over the lead and  raced to  victory from Con \nLaw (Suzuki) and Joey Dunlop (Honda) at anew record race \naverage speed of 114.81mph. Rider speeds were measured \nat The Highlander by Motor Cycle Weekly using a  police-type \nradar gun. The top fastest runners, against a slight headwind \nin the  Senior Classic, were all shown at  155mph. \nInarare TT occurrence, veteran Mick Grant finished the \nSenior Classic race off the podium, tyre troubles relegating \nhim to  fifth place. Suzuki works teamsters Grant and  win- \nner  McElnea both used the  same tyres, but  McElnea used \na  wider rear rim and somehow avoided problems. Unlike \ndays of old, the  correct choice of tyres was increasingly \nimportant to  a rider’s chance of race success, but with ever \nmore specialized compounds in use, rates of wear increased \nand changes of rear tyres at  pit stops were now common \namong the top riders. Principal suppliers of racing tyres at \nthe time were Dunlop and Michelin, with Pirelli also there. \nAmong other members of the trade, Shell Oils proclaimed \nin  post-race advertising that their products were used by \nmost of the winners in  1983. \nA  NEW ERA @  137 \nRiders making names for  themselves at  the  TT  in  the \nearly 1980s were Barry Woodland, Roger Burnett, Steve \nCull, Brian Reid, Geoff Johnson and  Gary Padgett. \nShowing that the TT  races still sorted the  men from the \nboys, the  Formula II and  Junior 350  TT  races were run  on \nthe  same day, with the  several riders who contested both \nraces each putting in ten  laps and 378  racing miles. \nSPEED \nFastest lap speeds moved from 108.77mph to  116.19mph \nbetween 1975 and 1983. While the increases were initially \nset by 500cc machines, the larger capacities allowed in For- \nmula and Classic TT  races saw the  bigger-engined bikes \nsetting the  fastest laps from the  late 1970s. \nMANX GRAND PRIX \nRunning since 1923, the  MGP had  seen many of its  com- \npetitors go  on  to  great things at  the  TT, with Tim Hunt, \nHarold Daniell, Freddie Frith, Phil Read and Norman \nBrown among those who went on  to  become TT  winners. \nWhile it  was not  known at  the  time, those standing on \nthe  podium after the  Newcomers race at  the 1983 MGP \nwere to  make a rich contribution to  TT  racing in the  years \nthat followed. They were: first, Robert Dunlop; second, \nSteve Hislop; and third, Ian  Lougher. While it  is  to  be \nexpected that Robert Dunlop’s early racing career would \nbe affected by the  activities of his  elder brother Joey, Steve \nHislop tells in his  autobiography, Hizzy, that it was watch- \ning Joey sweep through the  Eleventh Milestone at the  1983 \nTT  that inspired him to  sort out  his  life  and  make a  go  of \nhis racing."

These offered the  chance for  manufac- \nturers to  show how their roadsters could go over three laps \nof the  Mountain Course, in  classes for up to  250, 750 and \n1500cc machines. There were other changes, with the Jun- \nior  350 TT  being dropped after only one year of running. \nSimilarly, although the previous year had  seen the  combin- \ning of the  Senior and Classic races into one Senior Clas- \nsic  event, for  1984 they reverted to  separate Senior and \nPremier Classic TT  races. Other changes saw the  capacity \nof the  Formula I race revert to  750cc, to  accord with the \nFIM’s new limit for  the  class, and among the  sidecars, a \nFormula 2 class was  introduced for up to  350cc two-strokes \nand  600cc four-strokes. \nQualifying times were further reduced to: \nFormula I, Junior 250 and Senior 500: 26 minutes \nPremier Classic: 25  minutes \nSidecar: 28 minutes \nThose times provided an  indicator of the spread of machine \nand  rider quality to  be found in  a  TT  race, for Joey Dun- \nlop was lapping in just under 20  minutes on a solo and top \nsidecar man Mick Boddice was getting round in just over \n21  minutes with his three-wheeler. \nCompletely new in  1984 was a  Historic TT  for  ‘old’ \nbikes. Rated a  hit  by most of those who saw the  array of \nManx Nortons, AJS 7Rs, BSA Gold Stars, Aermacchis and \nso  on,  those machines of yesterday were piloted by riders \nclad mostly in black leather and provided a dose of nostalgia \nas  they trailed Castrol ‘R’  in their wake. But  the  three-lap \nHistoric TT  was not  a  particularly quick one and ran  for \njust the  one year. It provided a first-ever TT  victory for \nan  American rider, the  forceful Dave Roper on  his  G50 \nMatchless, with Steve Cull taking the  350cc class win on \nan  Aermacchi. \nFierce competition amongst established riders like Rob \nMcElnea, Joey Dunlop, Mick Grant, Charlie Williams, \nTony Rutter, Roger Marshall, Graeme McGregor, Phil \nMellor and Trevor Nation saw records broken in  several \nclasses in  1984. First up  was the Formula I race, where \nDunlop, on  his V4, now reduced from 850cc to 750cc, won \nby 20 seconds from Honda team mate Roger Marshall, lift- \ning the  lap record on  his  last  lap to  115.89mph and  hitting \n175mph past The Highlander. Come the  Senior TT  and  he \nraised not  only the  Senior lap record, but  also the  absolute \nrecord to  118.48mph. Unfortunately, a  shortfall of petrol \non  the last lap saw  him hand the win to  Rob McElnea. This \ngave Suzuki their seventh consecutive Senior victory with \nthe  RG500. The same ‘Rob Mac’ restricted Joey Dunlop \nto second place in the  Classic TT, during a fierce battle that \nincluded Mick-Grant (Suzuki) until he had  problems with \nhis  clip-ons. McElInea lifted race average and lap record \nspeeds in the  process. \nGraeme McGregor had a  midweek day to  remember \nwhen he won the  Formula II race on  a  Yamaha from Tony \nRutter (Ducati) and the  Junior 250cc on  an  EMC from \nCharlie Williams (Yamaha). In  the  latter he  also had to \nfight off the  likes of Joey Dunlop (Honda) and  Phil Mellor \n(Yamaha), setting new record race average and lap speeds in \nboth events. It was to  be Charlie Williams’ last  year at  the \nTT, but  in third place was Brian Reid (EMC), who would \nprove to  be a  worthy successor to  him, going on  to  record \nfive  TT  wins. \nThe reintroduced Production races were rated a success, \nwith Geoff Johnson on  a  Kawasaki GPZ900R taking the \n1500cc class, Trevor Nation on  a CBX Honda being best \n750cc \nand \nPhil \nMellor \non \na \nYamaha \nRD250LC \ntopping \nthe \nsmallest class.

      "text": "140 PRODUCTION MACHINES TO THE FORE \nThis was the  year that quick-fillers were finally banned \nfor refuelling, after several years of argument on  the  issue. \nNow everyone used the gravity-fillers supplied by  the \norganizers. Being very much slower, they increased the \ntime taken to  complete the  lap(s) when refuelling took \nplace, thus reducing race speeds. \nJOEY’S YEAR \nBy now known to  TT  fans simply as  ‘Joey’, William Joseph \nDunlop was  the  undoubted man of the meeting at the  1985 \nTT, taking three wins. Overcoming the handicap of having \nbeen on a fishing boat that sunk coming out  of Belfast just \nthirty-six hours before the start of practice, he was  the first \nto  achieve a  hat-trick since Mike Hailwood. Both did  it on \nHondas, all  three of Dunlop’s having the  company’s now \nfavoured V-configured engines, including the new Formula \nI RVF750, which, rather than being a  converted produc- \ntion bike, was much nearer a  purpose-designed race bike. \nHappy to ride large or  small machines, Dunlop’s wins came \nin  the  Formula I race where, not  pushed, he set  a  new lap \nrecord and won by over 5 minutes; in  the  Junior 250cc \nevent, where he set  new record race average and  record lap \nspeeds on  what was Honda’s return to  the  class; and  in the \nJoey Dunlop at  speed over the Mountain. \nnew 1000cc Senior TT, where he  beat team mate Roger \nMarshall at  slightly less than record pace. For that last \nrace of the  week, Dunlop chose Honda’s RVF 4-cylinder, \nfour-stroke, while Marshall rode their 3-cylinder 500cc \ntwo-stroke. The difference in  their race times was just 16 \nseconds. Dunlop loved the  RVF750, which was small and \nfast. It took him to  victory in all rounds of the  1985 World \nFormula I Championship and  provided the  basis for future \nTT  wins. \nBrian Reid (EMC) pushed Dunlop in the Junior 250 race \nand led  by 15  seconds on  the  last  lap, only to  run out  of \nfuel at  Hillberry. His  consolation was to  set  a new 250 lap \nrecord of 112.08mph. He  also broke the  lap record in  the \nFormula II race on  a Yamaha at  110.47mph, but again failed \nto  finish. \nNo  records were broken in the  1500cc class of the  Pro- \nduction race, but Mat Oxley (Honda) did raise the race and \nlap records in the  250cc class. Records were also broken in \nthe 750cc class by victor Mick Grant and by Glen Williams \nin setting the fastest lap. It was Grant’s seventh and last TT \nvictory and was achieved on  a  new Suzuki GSX-R750, a \nmodel that was to  go on  and carve a  name for  itself in  TT \nhistory."

      "text": "142 \nMl  \nPRODUCTION \nMACHINES \nTO \nTHE \nFORE \nVirtually every competitor now fitted a  steering damper \nfor  better control over the bumpy Mountain Course. \nTT, work started on  stage one of a  widening scheme for \nQuarry Bends. A really narrow and  tree-lined section, its \nseveral bends ran  between closely enclosing banks that lim- \nited riders’ speeds to  around 100mph. Changes from light \nto shade and retained dampness under the trees were also an \ninconvenience to  riders. It was a  spot where they all hoped \nthat they would not  come across a  slower competitor, for \na  swift passage through Quarry Bends had a big influence \non  the speeds achieved on  the following Sulby Straight. \nWhen the  changes were complete, they were reckoned to \nbe worth some 5 seconds a lap. \nHow much course improvements contributed to  faster \n|   lap speeds was a long-running topic, and  the  retired Geoff \nDuke chipped in with his opinion, comparing his 99.98mph \nlap in  1955 with Joey Dunlop’s 118mph absolute lap record. \nDuke felt  that of the 18mph increase, some 8mph came \nfrom course changes, which equated to  about 45  per  cent. \nThat percentage would have fluctuated down the  years. In \nthe  earliest days of the  TT, when poor course conditions \nrestricted riders from using full power, what small gains in \nspeed were made were probably due  to  machine and  rider. \nWith the rapid spread of tarmacadam surfacing in the early \n1920s, there were individual years when the  absolute lap \nrecord was  lifted by 4—Smph. Most of that gain would have \ncome from the course improvements. The rapid gains in lap \nspeeds of the  1960s were probably due to  the  outstanding \nworks machinery provided to  even more outstanding riders \nlike Mike Hailwood. Today most of the  speed gain comes \nfrom machines and riders, although every so  often there \nis a hike in speed that can  be related to  a major roadwork. \n1986: ‘PRODUCTION’ INCREASES \nThose who liked to  spectate at  the start and finish area \nwere able to  watch from a  new Grandstand at  the 1986 \nTT, \nalthough \nit \nwas \nstill \nmostly \nopen \nto  \nthe  \nelements. \nAlso \nopen \nto \nthe \nelements \nwere \nthe \nmany \ncompetitors \nwho \nchose \nto \ncamp \nnear \nthe \nPaddock, \nand \nearly \nin \npractice \na \nheavy \novernight \ngale \nblew \ndown \nsome \nof their \ntents. \nIt \nalso \nblew \ndown \nthe \nscrutineers’ \ntent \nand, \nmore \nimportantly \nto \nsome, \nthe \nbeer \ntent. \nOut on  the  course, riders returned from early practice \nsessions with customary complaints of how much bumpier \nthe  Mountain Course was than the  short circuits on  which \nthey were accustomed to  racing. Perhaps one of them was \nMichael McGarrity, who lost control of  his  Formula | \nHonda over the  notorious bumps of the  Sulby Straight and \nslid  down the  road for  150  yards. He  was lucky to  escape \nwith a broken shoulder and  abrasions. \nMention was made of the  increased use  of production- \nbased machines at the  1985 TT and this was  an  accelerating \ntrend in  1986, both at  the  TT  and in  the  wider world of \nracing. High levels of support for the races from Rothmans \nHonda, Heron Suzuki and Loctite Yamaha teams saw the \nvery best machinery being used over the Mountain Course \nby top TT  riders. The manufacturers also gave support to \nsporting dealers, for the organizers were keen to have them \nentering machines in what had become high-profile races. \nThe three Production classes of 1985 were increased to \nfour for  1986 and  named A, B, C and  D, with two-strokes \nand  four-strokes having different permitted capacity levels \nin  classes B, C and D.  In  Class B it was up  to  500cc two- \nstrokes racing against up to  750cc four-strokes; in  Class C \nup to  400cc two-strokes against up to  600cc four-strokes; \nand in  Class D  up  to  250cc two-strokes and up  to  400cc \nfour strokes. Class A retained its  1500cc upper limit. \nHIGH SPEEDS \nAt  the 1986 TT, where entry numbers were high —  some \nraces having 110  riders —  and spectator numbers were up, \nit was the  Production classes that delivered quite stunning \nresults. This was particularly so  for  Suzuki, whose blue- \nand-white machines took wins in  all  four classes. Trevor \nNation rode his  GSX-R1100 to  victory in  Class A, adding \nalmost 7mph to  the  race average speed and over 7mph to \nthe  lap speed. That was an  incredible performance, with \nNation becoming the  first rider to  lap at under 20 minutes \non  a  Proddie machine. He  left  the  race average speed at  a \nrecord 111.99mph and  the  lap record at  113.26mph. \nAnother impressive performance came from Phil Mel- \nlor on  the latest GSX-R750 with lengthened wheelbase. He \nadded \nalmost \nSmph \nto \nrace \nand \nlap \nspeeds \nin \nClass \nB, \nraising \nthem \nto \n109.23 \nand \n110.69mph, \nrespectively. \nIt \nwas \nthe \nturn \nof \na \nSuzuki \ntwo-stroke \nto \ntriumph \nin \nClass \nC. \nRiding \na \nspecially \nimported \n400cc \nversion \nof \nthe \nnormal \n500cc"

Strangely, reports \nof the  time failed to  mention how the  substantial 5—7mph \nincreases in lap speeds were achieved. The winning Suzukis \nwere ridden by good, but  arguably not  the  very best, rid- \ners  of the  day and  there had  been no  major changes to  the \ncourse. Therefore it would appear to have been down to the \nmachines, with Suzuki putting in much development effort \nand learning from the  worldwide racing successes of the \nGSX-R750 and its kin. \nTYRES \nOne thing that was changing racing in  the  mid-1980s and \ncontributing to an  increase in lap speeds was  the widespread \nadoption of radial tyres. The old  crossply design could no \nlonger cope with the  increasing strains imposed by high- \npowered race bikes, which created a  build-up of heat and \na falling-off of performance. The new radials were lighter, \nstronger, cooler running and made the  best use  of mod- \nern  materials, utilizing the improved compounds available. \nRacing would push the  development of radial tyres in  the \nensuing years and riders would benefit from the increase in \nperformance they offered. \n1987: FLOURISHING \nTen years after it lost its  World Championship status, the \nTT  was more popular than ever with riders who wanted to \nrace on  the  roads. For  1987 the  organizers tried to  accom- \nmodate as  many entries as  possible and the  upper capac- \nity of the  Senior TT  was increased to  1300cc. That must \nhave been to  accommodate the  biggest production-derived \nmachines, for nobody produced out-and-out racers of that \ncapacity. Similarly, although there was little in  the  way of \nnew 350cc race machinery, the Junior 250  TT  was  opened \nup  to  350cc machines, becoming just  the  Junior TT  and \nthus letting in  some of  the  older 350cc Yamahas. Total \nentries in  1987 were c870, with many riders having multi- \nple entries and  riding in as  many as  six  races. \nThe event as  a  whole was gaining more publicity from \nworldwide showing of race highlights on  satellite televi- \nsion. On-board cameras were getting smaller, so  armchair \nviewers got  an  improved and exciting TT  experience and \nalmost real-time results were available from information \nsources like Ceefax —  felt to  be high-tech in its day. \nThe rate of machine development by the  major manu- \nfacturers increased as  they strove to  take advantage of the \ngrowing publicity arising from the  racing of production \nmachines, and so  improve sales of their roadsters. Their \nglamorous large-capacity superbikes were now expected to \ndeliver race-track performance on  the  road, while being \nequally capable of running down to  the  shops in traffic and \ndelivering \nmotorway \nmile-munching \nperformance \nwhen \nused \nas  \nsports \ntourers. \nThey \nwere \nfar  \nmore \nversatile \nthan \nthe \nproduction-derived \nracers \nand \n‘TT \nReplicas’ \nof \nearlier \ntimes \nand \ncame \nwith \never-increasing \nuse \nof \nnew \ntechnol- \nogy \nin \nall \nareas, \nincluding \nengine, \ncarburation, \nsuspension, \nbrakes, \ntyres \nand \nelectrics. \nCompetition was particularly keen in  the  750cc cate- \ngory, with Kawasaki bringing out  its new GPX750 to  chal- \nlenge Suzuki, Honda and Yamaha, while Honda launched \nits  new CBR600, a  ‘middleweight’ tranverse 4-cylinder \nfour-stroke, for  which it claimed ‘heavyweight’ perform- \nance. That performance, from a  quoted output of 85bhp, \nwould be  progressively increased into a  far  greater figure \nduring its long, and  still continuing, production run. \nThe Mountain Course continued to  be the  supreme test \nfor any new motorcycle, with one  commentator remarking \non  ‘the  multitudinous bumps and  jumps that are  still  left \non  the course in spite of new roadworks every year’. Riders \ngreatly welcomed some smoothing of the  worst bumps on \nSulby Straight prior to  racing in  1987. \nWEATHER \nNow in  its  eightieth year of running, the  one factor that \nthe  TT  organizers had  never been able to  control was the \nweather, and  it affected both practice and  racing in  1987. \nAfter causing delays and postponements during race week, \nits worst impact was  on  the last day’s racing, where Produc- \ntion A and C races were cancelled entirely and  the  Senior \nwas  run  over a shortened distance of four laps. In conditions \nthat  were appalling, Joey Dunlop won at  an  average speed \nof 99.85mph, experiencing, in his words, ‘more slides than \nI've  had  in the  rest of my racing life’, \nRace week had started well, with Dunlop taking his cus- \ntomary Formula I win on  his works Honda at record-break- \ning race average and  lap speeds of 115.03 and 117.55mph. \nHonda had been good supporters of the TT races, but witha \nwidening area of racing to  support and  tightening budgets, \nthe  late 1980s saw  them enter a period where their level of \nsupport of the  TT  varied from year to  year. Dunlop was \nwithout the  ultra-rare RVF for  1987; instead, Mac McDi- \narmid tells in Joey Dunlop —  His Authorised Biography, he was \nprovided with ‘an American Superbike-spec V-four’, still in \nRothmans colours. \nRecords were not  threatened in  the  Sidecar or  Jun- \nior  races, but  a  first TT  win for  rising star Steve Hislop \n(Yamaha) \nsaw \nhim \nlift \nthe \nrecord \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nin \nthe \nFormula \nII \nrace, \nwhere \nEddie \nLaycock \n(Yamaha) \nset \na \nnew \nlap record of 112.36mph. \nIn  \nthe  \ntwo \nProduction \nraces \nthat \nwere \nrun \n—  \nB \nand \nD \n—  \nnew \nrecords \nwere \nset  \nby \nClass \nB \n(750cc) \nwinner \nGeoff"

With air-cooled, flame- \nspitting rotary engines, they added interest to  the  event \nand  both finished the  race. \nThe growing importance of the  Production races meant \nthat stakes were higher and that every possible advantage \nwas taken of the  rule book in  the  bid  to  turn out  faster \nmachines. This led to  much behind-the-scenes murmuring \nabout eligibility and compliance, but  that was the  Way it \nhad always been in  racing, for  it was a  highly competitive \narena. Mick Grant, now in race management, claimed there \nwas  a saying in racing: ‘you should never fall behind in your \ncheating, but  never get too  far ahead’. Not that Grant was \nadvocating cheating, but  he  firmly believed that the  rules \nwere there to  be  pushed as  far  as  possible. Thus the  rule \nbook got ever thicker. \nOnce again the Production races yielded substantial \nadvances in race average and lap speeds.

A titanic battle in  Production \nC between Steve Hislop and Brian Morrison on  their new \nHonda CBR600s saw  Morrison take the win and add almost \n6mph to  the  race average, while Hislop added just over \n6mph to  the  lap record. They were phenomenal increases \nand only in  Production D  were things more modest, with \nwinner Barry Woodland on a specially imported Yamaha \nFZR400R adding 0.43mph to  the lap record but leaving his \nown race average record intact. It was a  surprisingly lean \nyear for  former Production frontrunners Suzuki, whose \nbest results were fourth in  Production A and B.

The two \nremaining races for  production bikes were \nrenamed Production 750 and Production \n1300. \nReintroduced \nwas \na \nrace \nfor \nLight- \nweight \n125s, \nwhich \nlast \nran \non \nthe \nMountain \nCourse \nin \n1974. \nFalling \nin \nline \nwith \nFIM \nregulations, \ntwin-cylinder \nfour-strokes \nup \nto \n1,000cc \nwere \nallowed \nto \nenter \nthe \nFormula \nI race. \nSteve \nHenshaw \nand \nMark \nFarmer \nblast \nthrough \nthe \nbottom \nof \nBarregarrow. \nPRODUCTION MACHINES TO THE FORE MW  147 \nAllsolo and sidecar classes were filled by Yamaha, Honda, \nSuzuki and an  occasional Kawasaki machine. Those look- \ning long and hard at  the  entry lists might spot a  couple of \nEuropean makers’ names, with Steve Hazlett (EMC) best \nperformer with third place in the  Junior, but  the  only oth- \ners  to  be seen were a couple of Ducatis in the  larger classes. \nThe strong Rotax-powered challenge of a  few  years before \nseemed to  have faded away. \nThe top bikes were getting higher specifications and \nprices, with Honda’s RC30 costing £9,500 and Yamaha’s \nOW01 £12,000. The latter was quoted as  giving 121bhp, \ncomplete with EXUP (exhaust ultimate power valve), alu- \nminium perimeter frame and so  on.  For those serious about \nwinning, the  expense did  not  stop there, for  there were \nmany go-faster modifications that could be  applied to  a \nstandard machine. Joining the  TT  party for  1989 was the \nmuch cheaper Kawasaki ZXR750, which came in  Kawa- \nsaki’s traditional green. \nJohn Reynolds was a  three-times British Superbike \nchampion in the  1990s and  2000s, but only tackled the TT \non  one  occasion —  1989. In his words: ‘It pretty well scared \nme  to  death’. He  told in Motorcycle Racer in  2015: \nIt was  back in  1989; I’d just signed for Kawasaki and  they \noffered me  the  chance to  go  out  there just to  see if I liked \nit,  with no  pressure. I was  coming up to  a  place called Bar- \nregarrow on  a  Superbike and Steve Hislop came past me, \njust as  I was  shutting off the throttle for the corner. He  was \nstill accelerating and changing up  a  gear as  he  went into \nBarregarrow. His  bike bottomed out, I saw dust come off \nthe fairing as  it ground out  on  the floor and he disappeared \noff into the distance towards Kirk Michael. I thought, ‘You \nknow what? If that’s what you  have to  do to  win  a  TT, you \ncan  keep it —  there’s no  way I’m  ever going to  do that.’"

There was no  shortage of  up-and-coming riders \neager to  take advantage of his absence. \nCourse conditions from Ginger Hall to  Ramsey had \nalways been among the roughest, and in  1989, riders \nfighting their bikes through the  stretch described them as \nnoticeably worse. \nRECORD SPEEDS \nIn  a  year of eight solo TT  races and two sidecar, records \nwere broken in  all  solo and  in  one  of the  sidecar races. It \nwas  an  outstanding year for speed and American rider Chris \nCrew wrote of what was  required, saying, ‘You have to bet \nyour life  you know where the  next corner is  going over \nthe  crest of the  next hill.’ Of those crests, he said, “you go \nover wide open in top gear, 155  or  160mph, whatever the \nbike will pull, with your elbows and  toes tucked in,  head \nunder the  fairing, just watching the  white line, trying to \nsee  through the bugs’. \nMan of  the  week at  the 1989 TT  was Steve Hislop. \nAlready a  TT  winner, “Hizzy’ came with machines from \nHonda and  put his name firmly in the  record books with a \nhat-trick of wins at record speeds, which included the first \n120mph lap.

With a response that echoed the comments \nof many of the  great road racers of the  past, he  advised, \n‘work at the bends to get the best out  of the straights so  that \nyou can  carry the  speed with rhythm and flow, that’s the \nkey to  TT  success’. \nSpeeds were also  increased in  the  Junior race, won by \nJohnny Rea, with the  fastest lap coming from Eddie Lay- \ncock. It was Laycock who took victory in  the  Supersport \n400 race, with Production 1300 going to  Dave Leach and \nProduction 750 to  Carl Fogarty.

They permit- \nted  two-strokes up to  350cc and  four-strokes up to  600cc. \nTwo-strokes had taken all  the  wins to  date and that was \nrepeated in  1990, when Yamaha-powered Dave Saville and \nhis  green-and-yellow Sabre-sponsored outfit came home \nfirst in both races at  record Formula 2 speeds, with a fast- \nest  lap of 100.97mph. At this  stage the  600cc four-strokes \nwere a little off the pace, but that would change. \nFormula I machines were the  same as  the  previous year \nonly faster, with young hot-shots like Carl Fogarty, Steve \nHislop, Nick Jefferies, Dave Leach, Trevor Nation, Ian \nLougher, Bob  Jackson and  Phillip McCallen chasing a fat \nprize purse of £6,000 for a  start-to-finish winner.

Joey Dunlop (Honda) was  back in  1990, but \nnot really up to racing a 750 at its maximum. He had to settle \nfor  eighth place. With the  capacity limit for the  Senior TT \nnow reduced to  750cc, riders were using their FI bikes in \nthe  Senior, with minor adjustments to  suit  the rules. How- \never, no  real comparison could be  made between 1990’s \n750s and  the  1000s of 1989, due  to  the  Senior race being \nweather-affected.

In  mixed weather condi- \ntions, he hit a wet  spot climbing Lambfell, lost traction and \ncrashed. He  described the  aftermath of his  120mph spill \nwith ‘Silence! Running feet, shouts, radio messages, the \nworld spinning round.’ \nThe ‘new’ Norton marque had  a good year, with Robert \nDunlop taking third spot in the  Formula I race and  Trevor \nNation coming second in  the  Senior. Spectators loved the \ndistinctive high-revving sound of the  rotary Norton, and \nDunlop told that with his  9-stone weight, the  black-and- \ngold machine would spin up the  rear tyre in all gears, even \nin the dry. \nIn good conditions, new race average and lap speeds were \nset by Dave Leach (Yamaha) in winning the Supersport 400 \nrace and he also set  a new lap record in the Supersport 600, \nwhere victory went to  Brian Reid (Yamaha), at just below \nrecord speed. Over half of the  sixty entrants in  the  four- \nlap Supersport 400 race were mounted on  a  mixture of \nYamaha 400RRSP, Honda VFR400 and Kawasaki ZX R400 \nmachines. None of  those were big sellers in  the British \nmarket, but revving to  14,000—15,000rpm, they were the \nrecognized four-stroke bikes for the  race.

In  1990 he took his  second TT  win, \nbreaking his  own records in  the  Ultra Lightweight 125cc \nrace. Dunlop was Honda RS-mounted, as  was every one  of \nthe  fifty other riders in the  race. \nSpeed was a particularly special commodity to  125s on \nthe Mountain Course and, once gained, they were reluctant \nto  relinquish it,  maintaining very high corner speeds and \ndiving over and under bigger race machinery they came \nacross in  bends. During a race, slipstreaming other riders \nwas important, as  were tricks such as  riding in  the  lee  of \nroadside banks to  lessen the  effect of the  wind. The Ultra \nLightweight 125s ran  at the same time as  the Supersport 400 \nrace and, setting off immediately after the  400s, their top \nriders were soon mixing it with the  bigger bikes. Indeed, \nthey were often held up by them. \nThe 125s may have been fast for \ntheir size, but  it was among the  big- \ncapacity bikes contesting the For- \nmula I and Senior TTs that ultimate \nlap  records were regularly broken. \nIn the  period 1983—90, the  outright \nlap record went from 116.19mph to \n122.63mph. \nRadio TT  broadcast round-the- \ncourse commentaries on  all  races, \nand in  1990 its commentary box \nwas close to  the action at  Ballaugh \nBridge, where commentator Geoff \nCannell would have admired Steve \nCull’s controlled leap."

Attempts to  cut  costs by shifting the  emphasis to  the \nracing of production-derived machines in  the  1980s were \npartly offset by the  never-ending spending on  expensive \nmodifications, aimed at  gaining an  advantage over other \ncompetitors. Speed was an  extremely costly commodity. \nThere were a  few genuine private runners at  each TT, \nbut the  majority of riders had their racing sponsored by \nothers. At the top end  of the  scale this would be full works \nsupport with machinery, a riding fee and  all expenses paid. \nIn  1991 riders entered by Mitsui Yamaha, JPS Norton Rac- \ning, Silkolene Honda Britain and Team Green Kawasaki \nwould have received the highest level of support. Other rid- \ners  would have their bikes supplied, but have to  meet some \nelement of costs. Their bikes would have come from names \nlike Millar Racing, Smith &  Aldridge, Shirlaws Motorcy- \ncles, Bill  Smith Motors and McMenemy Motors Racing. \nFurther down the  scale, it was the  rider who supplied the \nbike, with companies or  generous friends helping to  pay \nentry and  running costs, usually in return for  seeing their \nnames on  the  fairing. Few of those riders had the  finan- \ncial  contingency to  cope with a major mechanical disaster, \nwhich could be quite common over TT  fortnight, particu- \nlarly for those using ‘tired’ equipment. \nIn  the  early 1990s the  organizers provided about £250 \nto \neach \nrider \nto \nhelp \nwith \ncosts, \nplus \nappearance \nmoney \nto \nthe \nstars \nand \nprize \nmoney \ntotalling \n£129,000. \nMost \nof \nthe \nlatter \nwent \nto \nthe \ntop \nfinishers, \nand \nriding \nthe \nTT \nstill \ncost \na \nmid-field \nsponsor \nor \nrider \nthousands \nof \npounds. \nWhile \ntalking \nof  \ncosts, \nHonda \nfelt \nthe \nTT \nwas \nsuf- \nficiently \nimportant \nto \nsend \ntwo \nof \ntheir \nRVF750 \nmodels \nfor \nSteve \nHislop \nand \nCarl \nFogarty \nto \nuse \nin \n1991. \nSaid \nto \ndeliver \n145bhp, \nthe \nmotorcycle \npress \nestimated \nthe \nvalue \nof \nthese \nultra-special \nendurance-based \nmodels \nat \nbetween \n£250,000 \nand \n£500,000 \neach. \n‘Foggy’ \nwas \nriding \nhis \nin \njust \nthe \nFormula \nI \nrace \nand \nJoey \nDunlop \nwas \nto \nuse \nit \nin \nthe \nSenior. \nDave \nLeach \nwas \nalso \nsaid \nto \nhave \nthe \nuse \nof \na \nfull \nworks \nFVR750 \nYamaha \n— \nvalue \nnot \nquoted. \nYamaha \ngenerated \nmuch \npublicity \nover \nthe \nfact \nthat \n1991 \nwas \nthe  \nthirtieth \nanniversary \nof \ntheir \nfirst \nparticipation \nin \nIBSIULSIUN Te sys \nthe TT.

It really was not  long for newcomers over such \na  demanding course. Typically, many new riders experi- \nenced problems that would see  them missing a session, thus \nreducing the  learning time and, as  in  1991, the  first ses- \nsion was lost to  all competitors, due to  heavy mist. In one \nof those vagaries of Manx weather, that mist was between \nBallacraine and Kirk Michael and not, as  it  usually was, \nover the Mountain. Experienced runners used the  prac- \ntice sessions to  reacquaint themselves with the  course and \nlearn any  changes. They also spent much time fine-tuning \ntheir machinery to  the  particular needs of the  Mountain \nCourse so  they could ride it to  its  limits.

Hislop was almost 30  seconds ahead of Fogarty at this point in the race. \nto  wheel in  the  early laps, before Hislop gradually eased \naway to  win by just over 1 minute, at a  record race average \nspeed of  121.00mph and a  new lap record of 123.48mph. \nJoey Dunlop brought his RC30 Honda home in third place. \nIt was a  similar situation in  the  Senior race, where Hislop \nagain used the  RVF to  win from Joey Dunlop and  Phil- \nlip McCallen, so  making it another Honda-filled podium \nat record speeds. \nSteve Hislop was the  man on  form at  the 1991 TT  and \nsecured a  third win in  the week in  the Supersport 600 \nrace at record speeds, riding Honda’s updated CBR-F2. As \nusual, the Junior race was  fiercely contested, Robert Dun- \nlop (Honda) taking the win and  Phillip McCallen (Honda) \nthe  fastest lap, at  slightly less  than the  exceptional record- \nbreaking speeds of 1990. \nThe Supersport 400 and Ultra Lightweight 125 races \nwere again run together, and while the mixed weather \nconditions held Dave Leach’s winning speed down a lit- \ntle  on  his 400 Yamaha, Robert Dunlop broke race average \nand lap records as  he  took his  125  Honda to  a  third con- \nsecutive win. He  described riding a  125  over the  Mountain \nCourse with the words, ‘you just sit there with it buzzing at \n13,000rpm and  wait for the corners to  come’. \nInterviewed after a  race, many riders will tell of  an \nuneventful ride and no  problems, but  not  everyone rides \nsmoothly to  victory. After his  Supersport 400 win, Dave \nLeach told how he thought his  race was over when, at  the \nMountain Box ‘I slid on  the white line. I was  nearly off.  The \nfront end just turned under me.

Both \nknew the Senior TT  had recovered much of its  prestige, \nthat the  manufacturers all  valued a  win and that, as  top \nTT  riders, they had  the  opportunity to  show their worth \nto  the  racing world. There was also the  small matter of a \npersonal battle to  show who was top  dog in  Island racing. \nBoth gave it  their all  over 226 racing miles and the  lead \nsee-sawed from lap to  lap, with pit-stop drama of wheel \nchanges and dropped fuel caps adding to  the  excitement. \nOn  the last lap Hislop held a narrow advantage but Fogarty \nmade a huge effort with the fastest lap of the race and a new \nabsolute course record of 123.61mph. However, it was  not \nenough, for  Hislop was only 1 second slower and with the \ncourse-side crowds cheering him on,  he kept his lead to the \nflag, to  win by just 4.4  seconds. It was no  surprise that his \nwinning speed was also a  new record average race figure \nof 121.28mph. \nThere were scenes of jubilation at  this British Norton \nwin, which was backed by Robert Dunlop bringing his \nNorton into third.

The three Honda works riders expressed \nthemselves far  more forcefully on  the  handling issue but, \nbeing paid to  race, they spent the  practice periods riding \nragged-looking laps while gradually improving their times, \nas  they sought to  get  the  elusive balance of stability and \nhigh-speed manoeuvrability. Steve Hislop showed his cour- \nage  and quality by eventually topping the  practice leader \nboard at  123.53mph. That was just a  fraction under the \noutright lap record. \nHislop had  not  wanted to  return to  the  TT, but  he was \nunashamedly using it as  a potentially good pay  day to  help \nfund his  short-circuit superbike racing. This worked out \nwell for  him, for  he  took the  RC45 to  wins in  both the \nFormula I and  Senior races, leading home his  Honda team \nmates in both and lapping at just Imph below record speed. \nSaturday’s Formula I race suffered from the  weather and \nwas stopped after two laps and  rerun on  the  Sunday. \nThat Sunday race proved a disaster for  Robert Dunlop, \nwhen the  rear wheel of his  Medd Racing RC45 collapsed \nas  he was leaving Ballaugh and  he  sustained serious injury \nin  the resulting crash. Riding in  his  first TT and also \nmounted on  a Medd Racing RC45 was Michael Rutter. He \nfinished the  Formula I race unscathed, but his entry in the \nSenior was scratched for his back wheel also showed signs \nof cracking. \nWhile Joey Dunlop was obviously troubled by  his \nbrother’s accident, he got on  with his  racing and  won the \nJunior and Ultra Lightweight 125 events. Running with \nthe  125s in  1994 was a  new race for  machines with four- \nstroke, single-cylinder engines —  the  Singles TT. Most of \nthose entered were of about 600cc and  featured machines \nfrom Yamaha, MZ, Honda, BMW, Kawasaki and others. \nThey were very much roadster-derived engines, although \nthere was a singles class run  as  a supporting event at World \nSuperbike meetings, which was  encouraging development. \nLap times of cllOmph were forecast and  the  race was won \nby Jim Moodie (Yamaha) with a  fastest lap of 112.66mph. \nMoodie also won the  Supersport 400 race, while Iain  Duf- \nfus took the  Supersport 600 at a record race average speed \nof 115.30mph. The latter used the new Yamaha FZR600R, \nwhich Yamaha claimed offered ‘the ultimate blend of street \nbike and track cred’.

Previously restricted to  machines from 601 to \n750cc capacity, it was opened to 201—250 two-stroke twin- \ncylinder and ACU/FIM Supersport 600cc machines. No \none  thought that a  250 was going to  win a  Senior TT, but \nit did  provide the  opportunity of an  extra race for  those \nriding them. \nThe race programme was subject to  change for  1995, \nwith the  title of Junior TT  (formerly for  201—350cc two- \nstrokes) now given to  a  race for  600cc machines to  FIM/ \nACU Supersport regulations. This resulted in  the  Super- \nsport 600 race being dropped and the two-strokes displaced \nfrom the Junior TT  coming back into the  programme in a \nLightweight race for  201—250cc two-strokes, which was \nalso open to  371—400cc four-stroke, 4-cylinder machines. \nInclusion of the  latter meant that the  Supersport 400 race, \nwhich previously catered for them, was also dropped as  an \nindividual event, although ‘official’ results continued to \nshow them under the  Supersport title for some years. \nQualifying times were now 22  minutes for  the  fastest \nsolo classes —  Formula I and Senior —  and 27  minutes for \nsidecars. That was a  4-minute reduction from the  time \nallowed ten  years before for solos, and 1 minute less for the \n‘chairs’, now operating to  the  smaller-engined Formula 2 \nspecifications. \nDUCATI \nCarl \nFogarty \nleft  \nthe  \nTT  \nfor  \na  \nwider \nstage \nand \nwon \nthe \nWorld \nSuperbike \ntitle \nfor \nDucati \nin \n1994. \nThis \nprompted \nincreased \ninterest \nin \nthe \nracing \nof \nDucatis \nand \nthe  \n1995 \nTT \nsaw \nfive \nentries \nin \nthe \nSenior \nrace, \nto \nbe \nridden \nby \nthe \nlikes \nof \nIain \nDuffus, \nMichael \nRutter, \nTrevor \nNation \nand \nSimon"

Both races were open to  motorcycles to  ‘ACU \nFI  Specifications’, with the Senior also accepting entries \nfrom ‘201-250 Two Stroke Twin Cylinder and  ACU/FIM \nSupersport 600 machines’. \nOnce again it was the  RC45 Hondas that won the  For- \nmula I and Senior races, ridden by Phillip McCallen and \nJoey Dunlop, with Dunlop also taking the ‘new’ Light- \nweight 250 race on  a  Honda, setting a  record race average \nspeed of  115.68mph. He  was just a  few seconds short of \nthe  lap record. Those with long memories could remem- \nber  when his  fellow Irishman, Tom Herron, won the  last \nrace to  go under the  Lightweight 250  name. That was back \nin  1976, when Herron’s race average speed was a  record \n103.55mph, achieved on  the dominant lightweight machine \nof the time, a  Yamaha. \nDunlop rated his  1995 Lightweight win as  one  of his fin- \nest  races, telling journalists after the  event: “The bike went \n100 per  cent, the  conditions were 100 per  cent —  dull and"

He  explained that it was \nnot  until he plunged down Bray Hill on  the  opening lap of \na race that he really knew if he was  going to be on  the pace. \nThose who knew him well felt  that they could tell  at  the \nstart how he would go.  TT  commentator of the time, Peter \nKneale, was one of those and would tell  listeners, “Joey’s \ngot his race face on’. \nThe only other records to  be  broken in  1995 were the \nUltra Lightweight 125 lap  speed, which winner Mark \nBaldwin (Honda) raised to  109.01mph, and  in  the  Sidecar \nclass, where double winner Rob Fisher (Yamaha) lifted \nthe  race average speed to  107.58mph and  the  lap record to \n107.67mph. Coming close to  another record, that of the \nclosest finish to  a TT  race, Mark Baldwin snatched his  125 \nvictory from Mick Lofthouse by just 0.6 seconds, after four \nlaps and 151  miles of racing. It was doubly disappointing \nfor  Lofthouse because he finished before Baldwin and was \ngiven to  believe that he had won the  race. \nThe 125s were mostly Hondas and competitors were \ndesperate to gain mechanical advantage and speed over each \nother, so  expensive performance-enhancing modifications \nsuch as  alternative ignition systems, exhausts and so  on \nwere incorporated by those who could afford them. In  1995 \nthere was much experimenting with airboxes, which were \nfound to  offer a  benefit to  carburation. But  the  application \nof science to  the  125s was  mixed with ‘rule of thumb’, and \nnowhere was this better illustrated than with their water- \ncooling. With no  thermostats, on  cool days the  use  of the \ncorrect amount of duct tape on  the radiator to  control tem- \nperature was  critical.

Such are \nthe  pressures to  win, encountered by a professional racer. \nMcCallen was probably the  fastest rider at the  TT  in  1995 \nand was a man who always gave his riding 100  per cent. He \ndid  not  believe that you could ride at  ‘nine-tenths’ on  the \nTT  course and expect to  win. Nor did  he  favour one part \nof the  course over another, as  many riders did. For  him it \nwas flat out  all the way. \nMORE EXPENSE \nNot fully supported across all classes by Castrol Honda at \nthe 1995 TT, Joey Dunlop found himself racing a  V&M \nDuckhams Honda in the Junior race. This meant additional \nexpense on  a  set  of new leathers in yellow and  blue Duck- \nhams Oils colours, for  he  could hardly have ridden their \nmachine in the  green, red  and  white of Castrol. \nHelping to  offset competitors’ rising costs —  not that \nDunlop paid for  his own leathers —  more money was \npumped into  the TT the following year, taking the total to \nover £500,000 for  1996. \n1996: PRODDIES RETURN \nKnowing that the  handling of mid-1990s sports bikes had \nimproved, along with the  tyres they used, the  organizers \nfelt it was  safe to reintroduce the Production race for  1996. \nOpen to  machines of 701—1010cc, it was to  be  run over \nthree laps on  Senior race day and  was  a popular addition to \nthe race programme. \nJust like race bikes, production models improved year \non  year. Back in  1985 the  Suzuki GSX-R750 spawned a \nwhole new generation of race replicas for  the  road and  its \npower output climbed with each batch of modifications. \nIn  1996 a  new version was launched that was lighter, \nhad  an  all new short-stroke engine, twin-spar aluminium \nframe, ram-air induction, 190 section rear tyre and the \nby now customary ‘computer controlled ignition’. But  the \nSuzuki was only a 750  and  at the  1996 TT it faced Honda’s \nuprated Fireblade, which many felt to  offer the best overall \npackage \nof \npower, \nhandling \nand \nstopping. \nNow \nof \n918cc, \nwith \nimproved \naerodynamics \nand \ncooling, \nnew \nframe, \nmodified \nswing \narm, \nchanged \ndamping \narrangements \nfront \nand \nrear, \nit \nincorporated \nmany \nother \nminor \nmodifica- \nA  COSTLY BUSINESS Ml  165 \ntions and was claimed to  deliver 128bhp at  10,500rpm in \nroad trim. \nHondas were the  machine of choice for  the  majority of \nthe  Production entry, but  ‘all-new’ Kawasaki ZX-7R and \nZX-7RR were also available, along with new Yamaha Thun- \nderace models and a couple of Ducatis of 750 and 916cc. All \nwere claiming outputs of over 125bhp in  road trim and as \nwell as  the  customary range of adjustment for suspension; \nsome offered easy adjustment of steering geometry, ride \nheight and  wheelbase. \nProduction racing was not supposed to  be  the place \nwhere those who spent the most were guaranteed suc- \ncess, but the  machines that came to  the  grid in  1996 were \nallowed modifications from standard. Most would spend \nmoney on  things like a new higher-performance rear shock \nand steering damper, braided hoses, Dynojet kit  for  the \ncarburettors, a  race exhaust to  give a  few  extra bhp and  a \nfibreglass body kit. \nFor all  the  claimed advance in  technical specifications, \nwhat most spectators wanted to  know was how much faster \nwould the 1996 Proddies be  compared to  those of  1989, \nwhen the  event was last  run. The answer was ‘not much’, \nfor Phillip McCallen’s Fireblade win at  117.32mph was less \nthan 2mph faster than Dave Leach’s winning race average \nspeed on  a  1000cc Yamaha in  1989, and the  fastest lap, \nof  118.33mph in  1996, was only Imph faster. McCallen \ndid  say  that he  could have gone faster, which probably did \nnot  go  down too  well with Iain Duffus (Honda) who fin- \nished just 6 seconds behind him, but  it  is  doubtful if his \nrace figures impressed those who automatically expect ever \nhigher speed at  the  TT. However, most race fans agreed \nthat 165mph from a  Fireblade on  Sulby Straight was pretty \nimpressive for a road bike. They also knew that riders faced \nthe  old  bogey of needing a  lot  more power and speed to \nachieve relatively small increases in lap times. \nMcCALLEN’S YEAR \nTaking victory in  1996 in  the  Formula I race, Junior and \nSenior races, plus the  reintroduced race for  Production \nmachines, Phillip McCallen became the  first rider to  take \nfour TT wins in one  week, although it was  only in the Jun- \nior  that he lifted race average and  lap speeds to  new levels. \nNevertheless, it  was an  impressive performance to  leave \nriders like  Nick Jefferies, Joey Dunlop and  Iain  Duffus in \nhis  wake. It might have been five wins in  a week if, while \nrunning well in the  Lightweight 250 race, he had  not  holed \nhis  exhausts on  the  suspension-bottoming, flat-out bend \nat  the  bottom of Barregarrow. This knocked the  edge off \nhis  bike’s performance and  Joey Dunlop went on  to  win. \nDunlop also took the  Ultra Lightweight 125  race. The only"

When the 1000cc Sidecar race was dropped \nafter the 1989 TT, the race record for  the Formula 2 \nmachines stood at  99.23mph, but  the  rapid development \nof  the 600cc four-strokes through the early 1990s had \nmuch to  do with the  increase in  F2  speeds, as  did  “Moly’s’ \ndevelopment of his  own outfit, known as  the  DMR (Dave \nMolyneux Racing).

It was headed \nby an  original version of their exotic 1950s V8, ridden by \noriginal rider Bill Lomas, and a  replica V8  ridden by its \nbuilder, Giuseppe Todero. Veteran Lomas rode the full  lap, \nbut  young Todero threw his  £500,000 machine down the \nroad at  Braddan Bridge, less than 2 miles from the  start. \nFortunately the  only damage was to  the  bike’s fairing and \nthe  rider’s pride. \nBy 1997 the TT had been running for ninety years and much \nhad changed in that time. The early pioneers who gathered \nA  COSTLY BUSINESS 167 \nat  St John’s in  1907 had no  conception of the  journey that \nreal road-racing would take after they had  chugged around \nin  that first race, with most setting lap speeds of under \n40mph. Come the  early 1990s, the  top  men were circu- \nlating the  Mountain Course at  over 120mph. In  1997 the \nrace average and  lap record speeds of the  big Formula I and \nSenior races were still stuck at those set  by Steve Hislop and \nCarl Fogarty during their epic battle in the  1992 Senior TT, \nThere was a similar situation in  the  Lightweight 250 class, \nwhere Ian  Lougher’s lap record, set  in battle with that man \nHislop again, had remained intact since 1990. There had \nbeen plenty of growth in  speeds in  other solo classes and \nin  the  sidecar classes, but  speeds in  those three solo ones \nremained about Imph short of the records. It was a position \nthat did  not  change in  1997. \nMounted on  a  special, ultra~expensive Honda Britain \nRC45, Phillip McCallen won both the  Formula I and Sen- \nior races with best laps approaching, but not quite reaching, \nthe  123mph mark —  Fogarty’s absolute lap record stood at \n123.61mph. In  the  latter race, second place was taken by \nJim Moodie on  a Padgetts Honda NSR500 two-stroke, said \nto  cost £90,000 and to  put out 135bhp.

Ian  Lougher took his  125cc Honda to \nvictory in  the Ultra Lightweight race, setting a  new race \naverage speed record of  107.89mph and a  new lap record \nof  109.25mph, while Ian  Simpson took another Honda to \nvictory in  the  Junior at  record speeds, with his  fastest lap \nat  119.86mph —  so  close to  120mph on  a  600 and a reflec- \ntion of the  development put  into those models. The only \nnon-Honda winner of a  solo class was Dave Morris on  a \nBMW in  the  Singles race, where he set  a  new lap record of \n112.07mph. \nWhile Dave Morris was a  new name among TT  win- \nners, he had  been close to  victory in  the  Singles class for  a \ncouple of years. Other up-and-comers going well in  1997 \nwere Derek Young, Adrian Archibald, Simon Beck, Adrian \nMcFarland and  Mark Flynn. \n1998:THE 120MPH CLUB \nIt  was Steve Hislop who set  the  first 120mph lap back in \n1989. Since then, a fairly select group had joined him in \nthe ‘120mph Club’. Totalling about twenty, some ten  of \nthem were present at  the  1998 TT, where spectators were \nstill waiting for  Steve’s absolute race average record speed \nof  121.28mph and Carl Fogarty’s absolute lap  record of \n123.61mph to  be  broken. Quite why those records set  in \n1992 remained intact in  the  face of manufacturers’ claims \nof  ever-increasing outputs from their machines and tyre \nmakers’ talk of increased performance from their rubber, \nwas  a bit  of a  mystery. Six  years is a  long time for  a  record \nto  stand in TT  racing. \nUnusually, only one  race record was  broken in  1998 and \nthat was in  the  Production TT. Jim Moodie was already a \nmember of the 120mph Club, but in  bringing his  Honda \nFireblade home in  first place at  record-breaking pace he \nlifted the  Production lap record to  120.70mph, thus bring- \ning Production machines into the Club. Of  course, his \n4-cylinder Fireblade was of greater capacity than the 4-cyl- \ninder 750s of the  Formula I class, but  it  was quite a  per- \nformance for a  sports roadster. Moodie was delighted with \nthe Fireblade, finding the standard set-up ‘brilliant’ and \nleading home Nigel Davies \non a  Kawasaki ZX-9RR, \nfollowed by  Michael Rut- \nter  on  another Honda. In \nfourth place came a rapidly \nimproving David Jefferies \non  Yamaha’s new YZF-R1 \n—an encouraging display by \nboth bike and rider, rein- \nforced by  Rls also taking \nfifth and sixth places. \nPhillip McCallen did  not \nride the  TT  in  1998 due to \ninjuries received at  Thrux- \nton, and Joey Dunlop was \nnot fully fit.

Both Dunlops rode Hondas, as \ndid all the other winners, except for Dave \nMorris taking the  Singles race again on  a \nBMW. \n1999: CAPACITY CHANGES \nThe TT races have always been shaped to  accommodate \nthe  popular engine capacities of the  time. In the  early days \nthey were for  350 and 500cc, with 250cc machines join- \ning in  1920, That was the  situation for almost thirty years, \nuntil a race for  125cc machines was introduced. There was \na  brief period in  the 1960s when 50cc bikes were catered \nfor, but  they were dropped and  the  next major change was \nthe  acceptance of 750cc machines. Thereafter the  upper \nlimit gradually increased, touching 1500cc for a while —  not \nthat there were any  race machines of that capacity. Engine \nsizes were then reduced to  750cc fours, with up to  1010cc \ntwins allowed into the  Senior race. \nWith manufacturers wanting to  showcase their flagship \nsportsters, which were now tending towards 1000cc, the \nTT  accommodated them by opening up the  Formula I race \nto  four-strokes of any engine configuration from 700 to \n1010cc. They also accepted 500cc GP  machines manufac- \ntured after 1994. \nThe \nLightweight \n250 \nTT \nfor  \ntwo-stroke \ntwins \nhad \naccommodated \nthe  \n351—400cc \nfour-strokes, \nbut  \nfor  \n1999 \nthe  \nlatter \ngot  \na  \nseparate \nrace \n—  \nthe  \nLightweight \n400 \nTT. \nThis \nmeant \nthe \nTT \nnow \nhad \nten \nraces, \nwith \nentries \nslightly \nup \non \nthe \nprevious \nyear. \nA CHANGE AT  THETOP \nHonda \nhad \ndominated \nthe  \nbig \nclasses \nat  \nthe  \nTT  \nin  \nrecent \nyears \nWw \nrith \ntheir \nexpensive \nworks \nRC45s, \nbut \nin \n1999 \nYama- \nhe \nrecovered \nmuch \nof \ntheir \nwinning \nways \nwith \na \nrelatively \nnew \nmachine \nand \nrider. \nThe \nmachine \nwas \ntheir \nYZF-R1, \na \nccacdate ay spies Rees nS : \nioe Dunlop’ eneering Quarter Bridge on  his  Honda at  the 1999 TT.

More like  a  600 in size, it came with \na new design feature of a  ‘stacked’ gearbox, which allowed \nfor areduction in wheelbase. The R1  was  very well received \nby press and buyers as  a  road bike, with Yamaha advertis- \ning proclaiming that it had  all the  best attributes to  attract \nthe  sporting rider, saying that it was ‘the shortest, lightest \nand  most powerful in its  class’. Their advertising extended \nto  the  glossy TT  programme, where a  double-page spread \nmentioned that ‘the R1  delivers levels of performance that \nwere quite simply inconceivable before its  launch’. They \nwere bold claims being made to  a knowledgeable audience, \nwith the  TT  Mountain Course waiting to  put them to  the \ntest against the  likes of Hondas, Kawasakis, Suzukis and \nDucatis. \nHowever good Yamaha’s R1  was  claimed to be, it needed \na top runner to  ride it anda top team to  prepare it.  No  one \ndoubted the  talents of the  latter in the  shape of the  experi- \nenced V&M Racing, but their chosen rider, David Jefferies, \nwas only rated at  number 15  in  the  organizer’s seedings, \nalthough he had  ridden to  fourth place on  an  R1  in the pre- \nvious year’s Production TT. \nIt turned out  to  be a timely choice of rider, whose father \nand uncle were both TT  winners, and whose riding was \nimproving from meeting to  meeting in  a  mixed schedule \nof short-circuit and  road racing.

He  was \nback to  ride in four races and, in  another surprise, he was \nriding Yamahas. Honda Britain (also calling themselves \nHonda UK) had their usual strong line-up of Joey Dunlop, \nIan  Simpson, Jim Moodie and Michael Rutter.

More Honda wins went to Ian Lougher \nin  the  Ultra Lightweight 125, Paul Williams in  the  Light- \nweight 400  and  John McGuinness in the  Lightweight 250, \nwith the last two breaking records in their races.

The three-lap Production race opened \nproceedings and David Jefferies took his second TT win  on \nan  R1  at  record-breaking pace, while leading home Jason \nGriffiths and  Phillip McCallen on  their R1s. \nHonda \nknew \nthey \nwere \nup  \nagainst \nit  \nin  \nthe  \nSenior, \nso \nhatched \na plan \nto \nsend \nJim \nMoodie \noff \nat \na pace \nthat \nthey \nhoped \nwould \nlead \nyoung \nJefferies \nastray. \nMoodie \ncertainly \nset \na \nfast \npace, \nfor \nhe \nbroke \nthe \nabsolute \nlap \nrecord \nfrom \na \nstanding \nstart, \nleaving \nit \nat \n124.45mph. \nBut \nHonda’s \nplan \nfailed \nwhen \nMoodie \nwas \nforced \nto \nretire \non \nthe \nsecond \nlap, \n8 \nmiles \nout \nat \nBallig \nBridge, \nwith \na \nshredded \nrear \ntyre. \nThis \nleft \nDavid \nJefferies \nto  \ncomplete \na \nhat-trick \nof \nwins \nat \na \nnew \nrace \naverage \nrecord \nspeed \nfor \nthe  \nSenior, \nwith \nJain \nDuffus \nsecond, \nIan  \nLougher \nthird \non  \nthe  \nfirst \nHonda, \na \nNSRSOOV, \nNigel \nDavies \non \nhis \nYamaha \nR1 \nin fourth \nand \nJoey \nDunlop \nan \nunaccustomed \nfifth \non \nhis \nRC45. \nROADSTER TO RACER \nDavid Jefferies’ TT-winning Yamaha R1  race  bike may have \nbeen a roadster some eight weeks before, but  it underwent \nmuch change to  make it a  winner over the  TT  course, as \ndid  most production-based bikes of the  time. V&M rac- \ning comprised Jack Valentine and  Steve Mellor, who both \nwere vastly experienced in the  preparation of competition \nmachinery. Their R1s, for they also built the one  ridden by \nlain Duffus, received a  complete engine strip-down, fol- \nlowed by a  rebuild that included things like a  lightened, \nrebalanced and  polished crankshaft with new oval section \nand chrome-moly steel con rods. The cylinder head was \nported, flowed and  polished, compression ratio raised and \nspecial valve springs fitted. They fitted their own camshafts \nand  adopted ram-air induction, special airbox and a radia- \ntor  twice the  size  of the  original. \nHaving seen 132bhp from a stock R1, V&M were pleased \nwith the 174bhp available after they had worked their \nmagic, which also included remapping the  ignition for the \nhigher revs now available and  a  special exhaust. The frame \nremained virtually standard, although a  Penske rear shock \nwas fitted, while front forks were re-valved and dropped \n10mm in new adjustable yokes. Among other changes it was \nfitted with new cast iron discs and six-pot calipers, while \nthe  petrol tank was enlarged to  allow completion of two \nlaps on  a tankful. So, no  longer your standard R1, but a TT- \nwinning motorcycle that V&M were prepared to  replicate \nfor customers on  payment of £26,000. \nSPEEDS \nEveryone had  their own view as  to  Yamaha’s resurgence in \nthe  big bike classes, with some crediting it to  the  machine \nand others to  the  men riding them. Most debate on  the \nmachines centred on  whether the  1,000cc Yamaha R1  was \nfaster and better handling than the  750cc Honda RC45s, \nfor without naming the opposition, Yamaha advertising had \nbuilt up an  aura of superiority in those areas. \nInformation on  speeds achieved was hard to  come by. \nSome of the  teams now had  set-ups from which they could \ngather \ndata, \nbut \nit \nwas \nnot \nthe \nsort \nof \ninformation \nthey \nmade \npublic. \nAware \nof \nthe \nfascination \nwith \nspeed, \nthe \norganizers \ninstalled \nan \nelectronic \nspeed \ncheck \nopposite \nthe \nGrand- \nstand \non \nthe \nGlencrutchery \nRoad, \nwith \na \ndigital \ndisplay \nof \nthe \nspeed \nachieved \nby \neveryone \nwho \npassed. \nThe \nfast-"

However, for  all  the  growth in  machine \nperformance, it  was becoming increasingly difficult to \nturn that gain in  power, handling and braking into faster \nlaps.

Armed with a  choice of  a Honda VTR1000SP-W \nfrom World Superbike and a Fireblade for the big races, he \nfound that the former, usually called the  SP1, had a stutter- \ning power delivery and that it did not handle. Much of prac- \ntice was spent doing single laps then coming in to tweak the \nsuspension, before going out  again to  see  if there was any \nimprovement. In the  end, reverting to  the  previous year’s \ntype of tyre helped solve the  handling difficulties. Other \nHonda Britain men on  Fireblades were lain Duffus, Jim \nMoodie and Adrian Archibald. Riding for  Yamaha UK  on \nV&M Ris, David Jefferies and  Michael Rutter had  a  good \npractice. Jefferies’ bike was  also  referred to  as  an  R71, for \nV&M claimed to  have squeezed his  R1  motor into a  modi- \nfied 750cc R7  frame. \nJoey Dunlop’s problems were made all the harder by the \nfact that he had  six  machines to  get race ready. Seemingly, \npast settings did no  more than provide a baseline when rid- \ners  returned to  the  TT, either with a new machine or  one \nthat had been subject to  a  season’s racing since it last  ran \non  the Mountain Course. It was an  intensely busy time. \nGrabbing his  250 for an  early morning lap, Dunlop found \nthat it had  not  been fuelled and spluttered to  a halt at  The \nBungalow. Needing to  get  back to  the  start to  take out \nanother bike, he  found a  paper cup and borrowed some \npetrol from a travelling marshal’s machine. As  his  Honda \nran  on  ‘petroil’, he also needed to  find some oil to  add  to \nthe \npetrol. \nWith \nthe \nassistance \nof \na \nwilling \nspectator \nand \nhis \nbike, \nhe \nremoved \nthe \ndrain \nplug \nfrom \none \nof \nits \nfork-legs, \nmixed \nsome \nof \nthe \ndrained-off \noil \nwith \nthe \npetrol \nin \nhis \ntank \nand \nwas \naway \nto \ncomplete \nhis \nlap. \nAlways \nknown \nas \na \ncanny \nrider, \nDunlop \nhad \ntwenty-five \nyears \nof \nIsle \nof \nMan \nracing \nknowledge \nto \ncall \nupon \nto \nget \nover \nhis \nproblems. \nSuch \nhard-earned \nexperience \nwas \nsomething \nthat \nprevious \nTT \ngreat \nMick \nGrant \ndescribed \nas \n‘priceless’. \nTHE RACING \nJoey \nDunlop \nshowed \nhis \nenduring \nclass \nby \nwinning \nthe \nFASTER AND FASTER @  173 \nopening Formula I race at the  2000 TT. Then, in an  almost \nunbelievable display, he went on  to  take the  next two solo \nraces, the  Lightweight 250  and  the  Ultra Lightweight 125. \nBoth of those wins came against stiff opposition. Just half- \nway through the  meeting, Dunlop already had a hat-trick \nof wins, bringing his total up to  twenty-six. The next best \nwas Mike Hailwood on  fourteen. \nWednesday afternoon’s Junior race at  last  gave Yamaha \na chance to  shine, for it was David Jefferies who took over \nthe  winning ways. He  also went on  to  win the  Production \nand Senior races, which meant that for  the  first time at  a \nTT, two riders achieved hat-tricks of wins in the same year. \nEn  route to  his  victories, ‘DJ’, as  he  was known to  most, \nraised the  race average speed in  the  Junior to  119.13mph \nand  in  the  Senior to  121.95mph, topping it all  with a  new \nabsolute lap record in  the  Senior race of  125.69mph. He \nwas  the first rider to  lap at  125mph —  yet another TT speed \nbarrier smashed. \nHonda’s share of the record-breaking came in the Junior, \nwhere Adrian Archibald lapped at  121.15mph to  become \nthe  first rider to  break 120mph on  a  600. \nNow in  his  fifth year at  the  TT,  John McGuinness was \nslowly building his tally of wins, taking victory in the  Sin- \ngles race, while Rob Fisher was victorious in  both sidecar \nraces, so  making it his third double. \nIn a difficult-to-believe scenario, the declared winner of \nthe  Lightweight 400 TT  was disqualified when his  engine \nwas measured and  found to  be  600cc. The win was  justly \ngiven to  Brett Richmond. \nJOEY —THE ENIGMA \nForty-eight-year-old Joey Dunlop finished 2000 TT  week \nwith third place in  the  Senior race. In doing so  he record- \ned his  fastest ever TT  lap at  123.87mph, setting it on  the \nvery last  lap of the  race. Some three weeks after receiving \nworldwide acclaim for his successes at the renowned Inter- \nnational TT  meeting, Dunlop loaded his  125  Honda into \nhis van, collected long-time supporter John Harris and  his \nCBR600 racer, and  set  off for Estonia to  take part in some \nlocal races. That was  his style —  he did what he fancied. But \nthere, ona rain-soaked surface, he left the  road on  his  125, \ncollided with trackside trees and  was  killed. \nAfter twenty-five years’ racing over the dangerously \nnarrow roads of his  native Ireland and on  the  high-speed \nTT  course, as  well as  on  short circuits worldwide that \nearned him several World Formula | championships, the \nseemingly immortal Joey was  dead. Mourned by the world \nof  motorcycling and beyond, his  funeral in  Ballymoney \nbrought the  town to  a  standstill. Reports talk of  50,000 \nmourners."

While \nJoey Dunlop would never be forgotten, race fans now had \nto  look to  the  future. However, what was scheduled to  be \nthe  next TT, in  2001, did  not  happen, for  an  outbreak of \nfoot and  mouth disease in  Britain had  the  Island fearful for \nits farming activity, so  the TT  was  cancelled. \nOn  the  wider stage there was concern that despite the \nproduction-based formula of World Superbike racing, costs \nwere spiralling out  of control, so  manufacturers were look- ° \ning for  ways to  reduce them. There was also recognition \nthat many people were now choosing to  buy 1000cc road \nbikes rather than the 750cc ones raced in the  World Super- \nbike series. \nTwo years after its  last running, the TT returned in  . \n2002.

The organizers also upped \nthe  prize money, with a  ‘bonus’ of £5,000 being paid to \neach race winner. \nCrowds returned in  2002, for  the  TT  was an  essential \npart of many peoples’ lives. Some were satisfied with the \nannual two-week ‘high’ they received from attendance at \nrace time, but for many it was a year-round focus of inter- \nest. Much was expected by the  speed-seeking element in \n2002, for while the TT was  a unique event, it was  also part \nof the  wider motorcycling racing scene, where develop- \nment was driven by World Superbike and GP  racing. Two \nyears’ progress in  those fields should have filtered down \nthrough the  competition departments of firms like  Honda, \nYamaha, Suzuki, Kawasaki and Ducati, to  the  benefit of \nTT  machinery. \nTHE RACING \nThe man expected to  do  much of the  winning was David \nJefferies. However, having switched from Yamaha to  Suzu- \nki shortly before the  event, there was a question mark over \nhow he would go on  a  new bike. Along with Ian  Lougher, \nDJ now rode under the TAS (Temple Auto Salvage)/Suzuki \nbanner. Top Honda runners were John McGuinness and \nAdrian Archibald, while Jim Moodie and  Iain  Duffus rode \nYamahas for V&M Racing. \nDavid Jefferies was  by now the  crowd favourite and  he \ndid  not  disappoint his  many fans, taking record-breaking \nwins in the  Formula I, Production 1000 and  Senior TTs of \n2002. Not  only did that give him his third consecutive hat- \ntrick of wins, but  in  the  Senior he lifted his  own absolute \ncourse record to  127.29mph.

Preparation for  racing raised \nengines to  an  even higher state of tune, and John McGuin- \nness’ Honda was redlined at  15,500rpm, a figure that he \nwould seek to  reach as  often as  possible over the  four-lap \nand 151-mile race distance. \nIan  Lougher gave solid support to  his  Suzuki team mate \nDavid Jefferies, including winning the  Production 600 \nrace. Switching to  a  Honda, he  then came home first in \nthe  Ultra Lightweight 125  event, setting new race average \nand  lap records, leaving the  latter at  110.21mph. That was \nsome going for a single-cylinder 125cc machine putting out \napproximately 46bhp. \nAmong first time winners in  2002 were Bruce Anstey \n(Yamaha) in  the  Lightweight 250 and Richard ‘Milky’ \nQuayle (Honda) in the  Lightweight 400, while Rob Fisher \n(LMS) achieved another double on  three wheels. \nIf those watching the  racing were not  convinced from \nthe multitude of new records that bikes were getting faster, \nthe digital speed recorder opposite the  Grandstand showed \nspectators that the  highest speed of  165mph recorded in \n1999 increased to  170mph in  2002, at  a  point where the \nbikes were still accelerating. \nThe Joey Dunlop Trophy was introduced for  2002 and \nawarded to  the best aggregate performance across the  For- \nmula I and  Senior TT  races. As winner of both, David Jef- \nferies collected the  trophy and the  accompanying cheque \nfor £10,000. \n2003: MINOR CHANGES \nTaking its  usual late  May and  early June spot in the  racing \ncalendar, the 2003 TT arrived with an  entry of 319 individ- \nuals, 150 of them being from the seventy-five sidecar crews. \nIt  was to  be  the  last  year of early-morning practice, a \nritual that had started with the  first event in  1907. Many \nriders complained about early-morning practice down the \nyears, as  did some marshals and  officials, for they had to be \nin position well before the  racers arrived. \nThe few Lightweight 250s again ran with the  Junior \n600s, but without a recognized race of their own, and  the \nJunior race was described as  being ‘for Machines to  TT \nSupersport 600 Regulations’, The term Supersport was \none  that would be heard more of in the future. Out on  the \ncourse the  series of bends at  the  Thirty-second Milestone \nwere renamed Duke’s, in honour of star of the  1950s and \nambassador for the TT races, Geoff Duke. \nTransponders were now mandatory and used to  deter- \nmine race results. Timing strips triggered by the  trans- \nponders \nwere \nlocated \nat  \nGlen \nHelen, \nBallaugh, \nRamsey, \nThe \nBungalow, \nCronk \nny \nMona \nand \nthe \nGrandstand. \nThose \ntiming \npoints \ngenerated \nadditional \ninformation \nfor \nrace \ncommentators \n— \nnow \nsitting \nin \nfront \nof \ncomputer \nscreens \n— \nwho \nwere \nable \nto \nquote \nsector \nspeeds, \nplus \nthe \nincreasing/ \ndecreasing \ngaps \nbetween \nriders \nand \nother \ninformation \nthey \nthought \nmight \nbe \nhelpful \nto \nspectators \nand \nsupport \nteams. \nThe \nlatter \nincluded \nthose \nlocated \nin \nthe \npits \nand, \nfor \nsignal- \nling \npurposes, \nthose \nout \naround \nthe \ncourse. \nHONDA DOWN, SUZUKI UP \nHonda had been long-time supporters of the  TT, but  in \n2003 they gave restricted input to  the  event, limiting their \npublicized involvement to Ian Lougher and Dave Molyneux. \nLougher had Colin Edwards’ 2002 World Superbike SP2 and \nMoly had  help with engines. The SP2 was much upgraded \nin fuelling, frame and  engine compared to  the  earlier SP1 \nand  was said to  give 180bhp. Not that Lougher was able to \nuse  all  of that in  the  early stages of practice, for  the  bike \nhad  stability problems at high speed. They were eventually \nironed out  and  a good race set-up obtained. \nSoichiro Honda, founder of  the  company bearing his \nname, knew that success in  racing sold road bikes, but \nsomething Honda no  longer seemed to be the bike of choice \nfor  riders to  compete on  at  the  TT. Five years earlier, at \nthe  1998 event, there were thirty Hondas in the  Formula I \nrace out  of seventy entries and  seventy-two Hondas in the \nJunior race out  of ninety-one entries. In  2003 there were \njust seven in the  Formula I race and  fourteen in the Junior. \nIt was a  change that would not  have escaped the  notice of \nthe  motorcycle-buying public. \nHonda had done their best to  keep their name in  the \nforefront of racing by winning the World Superbike Cham- \npionship with Colin Edwards in  2000 and 2002, although \nDucati probably made a  greater impact with their several \nwins earned by Carl Fogarty and Troy Bayliss. Indeed, their \nracing successes are  said to  have transformed the  Italian \ncompany. But  even Ducati’s multi-wins did  not  encourage \nracers to buy, for there were only seven of them in the 2003 \nFormula I TT.  Yamaha had been successful at the TT of late \nand  there were some twelve R1s  entered, but it was Suzuki \nwho dominated the Formula I  entries in  2003, filling \nthirty-nine of the  eighty places. Just two  years earlier they \nhad  replaced their GSX-R1100 with the  GSX-R1000, fit- \nted  with an  enlarged and  uprated 750cc engine. The 2003 \nversion was claimed to  weigh less, had more power and \nhandled \nbetter. \nThere \nwas \ntalk \nof \n180bhp \nat \nthe \ncrankshaft \nand \n143bhp \nat \nthe \nrear \nwheel \nfor \nthis \n180mph \nmotorcycle. \nDavid \nJefferies \nand  \nAdrian \nArchibald \nwere \nto  \nride \nTAS \nSuzukis, \nJohn \nMcGuinness \nwas \non \na \nDucati \n998, \nwhich \nhe"

After three consecutive \nhat-tricks of TT  victories, the  young superstar was gone. \nEveryone knew that racing could be  a  cruel business and \nthe  TT  more so,  for  it allowed little room for  either rider \nor  mechanical error. A tragedy like  DJ’s made many think \nabout stepping back from motorcycle racing, but it  was \nan  addictive pastime, whatever role a  person took —  rider, \nspectator, sponsor, organizer —  and  most soon returned."

      "text": "178 M  FASTER AND FASTER \nFAST RACING \nAfter the previous year’s record-breaking spree, speeds \nwere just  slightly down in  some classes in  2003. Adrian \nArchibald rode his Suzuki to  victory in Formula I and  Sen- \nior TTs, but  Imph down on  2002 figures. John McGuinness \nled both of those races on  his Ducati before dropping back \nslightly and Ian  Lougher finished both on  the podium, with \nJason Griffiths taking two fourth places. In  the  Formula \nI race, only the  latter three, out  of the  first thirty-three \nfinishers, rode anything other than Suzuki. \nShaun Harris ensured that Suzuki continued their win- \nning ways by taking both Production 1000 and 600cc \nraces, while fellow-Kiwi Bruce Anstey brought his  Tri- \numph home first in  the  Junior at  a  record-breaking race \naverage speed of 120.36mph. It was a race in which relative \nnew boy Ryan Farquhar impressed by raising the lap record \nto  122.30mph. Another lap record went to  winner of the \nUltra Lightweight 125  race, Chris Palmer (Honda), and he \nalso took the barely recognized 250  win within the  Junior \n600 race. In a world where the  major manufacturers were \nno  longer making ‘proper’ race bikes for  the  Lightweight \nclasses, 125  and 250cc riders faced an  uncertain future as \nmachines aged and  entry numbers fell. \nIan  Bell (Yamaha) and  Dave Molyneux (Honda) took a \nwin each in the  Sidecar races, while runner-up in both was \nlocal man Nick Crowe (Ireson). \nFor  several years, entries for the  Senior TT  had been by \ninvitation, based upon the  fastest riders in  practice. Allo- \ncated number 1 in 2003, Adrian Archibald felt that was  not \nright, as  David Jefferies had  set  a  fractionally faster time. \nAccordingly, he obtained the organizer’s permission to con- \ntest  the  Senior under number 0.  It was part of Archibald’s \ntribute to  a great rider and team mate. \nFurther tragedy struck away from the TT  later in  2003, \nwhen eleven-times winner Steve Hislop was killed in a hel- \nicopter crash shortly after winning the  British Superbike \nChampionship. \n2004: NEW ORGANIZERS \nThe ACU had  run  the  TT  races since 1907, with what, at \ntimes, had  seemed to  be  the  reluctant involvement of the \nManx government. But  times had changed. The financial \nvalue of the  races to  the  Island was recognized and from \n2004 the  government took a  twenty-year licence to  run \nthe \nentire \nevent. \nIt \nappointed \nthe \nManx \nMotor \nCycle \nClub \nLtd to  organize the  racing on  its  behalf. Having run the \nManx \nGrand \nPrix \nsince \nits \ninception \nas \nthe \nAmateur \nraces \nin \n1923, \nthe \nclub \nwas \nin \na \ngood \nposition \nto \ndo \nso. \nThe \ngov- \nernment \nalso \ninjected \nsome \nextra \neffort \nto \nattract \nquality \nriders, for the TT  was  in need of a boost. \nLike \nany \nnew \nbroom, \nthe  \nMMCC \nmade \nits \npresence \nfelt \nwith \nchanges. \nIts \nfirst \naction \nwas \nto \ndo \naway \nwith \nearly- \nmorning \npractice, \nthe \nloss \nof \ntrack \ntime \nbeing \npartially \ncom- \npensated \nfor \nby \nthe \nintroduction \nof \npractice \nlaps \nafter \neach \nday’s \nracing. \nNo \none \ngave \na \ndefinitive \nreason \nfor \nthe \nchange. \nIt \nwas \nknown \nthat \nmany \nriders \ndisliked \nearly \npractice, \nthat \nmarshals \nwere \nharder \nto \nget \nand, \nalthough \nunspoken, \nthat \nthe \ngrowing \nspecialization \nof \nrace \ntyres \nmeant \nthey \nwere \nbecoming \nunsuitable \nfor \nthe \nmixed \ndamp/dry \nconditions \nmost \nlikely \nto \nbe \nmet \nat \nsix \no’clock \nin \nthe \nmorning. \nA surprise move was the  reduction of the  race distance \nfor the Formula I and  Senior races from six laps to four. The \nreason given here was  that statistics showed more accidents \noccurred late in the race. The majority opposed the change. \nThe entry system for the  Senior TT, whereby the  fastest \nriders in  practice received an  invitation to  take part, was \nshown to have caused a reduction in the number who turned \nup to ride. For  2004, entries were invited in advance, as  for \nthe other races. \nENTRIES \nOverall numbers of race entries were good for 2004 at 731, \nbut, as in previous years, the level of support from manufac- \nturers varied. Honda had no  named presence although they \nmay have given Ian  Lougher support in  the  Formula I and \nSenior races on  a  CBR-RR through Mark Johns Motors. \nIan  had  other Honda-mounted rides from private entrants \nin  the  Junior, Production 1000 and  600, and Ultra Light- \nweight 125  classes. Official support from Yamaha Motor \n(UK) Ltd  was  given to  John McGuinness and  Jason Grif- \nfiths, while Adrian Archibald and  Bruce Anstey were with \nTAS Suzuki. Potential front runners on  Kawasakis were \nRyan Farquhar and Shaun Harris, while a Newcomer des- \ntined to  catch the  eye was Guy Martin. \nRECORDS GALORE \nJohn McGuinness showed his  true class as  a TT  rider in \n2004, taking his  first hat-trick of wins. He  was victori- \nous  in  the  opening Formula I race on  a  Yamaha, where \nhe  became the  first to  achieve a  race average speed of \n125mph (125.38mph) and  where he  lifted the  lap record \nto  127.68mph. He  went on  to  break records in  the \nLightweight 400 race on  a  Honda, before reverting to  a \nYamaha \nfor \nrecord-breaking \nwins \nin \nthe \nJunior. \nDespite \nhis \nundoubted talent, McGuinness admitted to being ‘a bit laid \nback’ \nin \nhis \napproach \nto \nracing, \nbut \nin \n2004 \nhe \nhad \nJim \nMoodie \nin \nhis \nsupport \nteam \nand \ncredited \nhim \nwith \nkeeping \nhim focused. \nElsewhere, \nBruce \nAnstey \n(Suzuki) \nlifted \nProduction \n1000cc \nrecords \nto \na \nnew \nrace \naverage \nspeed \nof \n123.72mph"

The Formula I race now became the  TT  Super- \nbike race, Production races were replaced by TT  Super- \nstock and the Junior became the Supersport Junior TT.  The \nabove were now only open to  four-strokes; there was no \nplace in  the  new race programme for  125  and 250cc two- \nstroke machines, nor for  400cc four-strokes. It  was said \nthat the changes reflected the  views of riders and  manufac- \nturers, but  there was no  mention of those held by specta- \ntors. Manufacturers Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki and  Kawasaki \nwere present to  support a seven-race programme, compris- \ning two Sidecar races (A and B), two Supersport Junior (A \nand  B),  an  opening TT  Superbike and  closing Senior TT \nthat were, in effect, duplicate races, and one  TT  Superstock \nrace. \nTyre \nmarks \non  \nthe \nroad \nshow \nthe \neffect \nof \nfull  \nthrottle \nbeing \napplied \no \nThe changes brought no  visual differences to the machines \nraced in  2004 and  the  harmonization of regulations saw  no \nattributable enhancement of performance.

There certainly \nwas no  secret as  to  where the  racing line was, for  it  was \nthere on  the  road surface for all to  see, both on  the  corners \nand the straights. However, it did reveal differences of opin- \nion  as  to  what exactly was the  right line, being up  to  2m \nwide on  some corners. \nIncreased tyre performance came from greater speciali- \nzation in  design and construction. With the  Island known \nfor  its  variable weather conditions, the  TT  really needed \ntyres that could cope with roads that were wet and dry \nduring a  race, but  that flexibility was not  a  feature of cur- \nrent tyre development. There were tyres for wet roads and \ntyres for  dry ones, but  the  in-between going often found \nat  the  TT  presented problems, because ‘wets’ would soon \ndeteriorate over drying roads and ‘slicks’ were unsafe in the \nwet. Such problems were compounded for  both solos and \nsidecars by the  ever-increasing power outputs of modern \nrace machines. \nThe situation was brought into focus during practice for \nthe  2005 TT, when time was lost due to  wet conditions. \nClerk of  the  Course, Neil Hanson, laid  down a  marker for \nthe  future when he  stated that he  would no  longer start a \nTT  race in  wet conditions. That decision was taken in  the \ninterests of safety, but  it was one that would impact upon \nfuture events. Indeed, it  affected the  opening Superbike \nrace in  2005 and saw it postponed until Sunday. \nRACING \nWhilst Superbike, Superstock and Supersport races intro- \nduced new titles to  the  2005 TT, it was still reasonable to \ncompare their results and  speeds with previous Formula I, \nProduction and Junior races. A fast pace was  set  throughout \nthe  seven-race programme, with records broken in  four of \nthem. Bruce Anstey (Suzuki) lifted the TT  Superstock (for- \nmerly Production 1000) average race speed to  124.44mph \nand  TAS Suzuki team mate Adrian Archibald set  a  new lap \nrecord of  126.64mph. In  TT  Supersport A  (formerly Jun- \nior  TT), Ian  Lougher (Honda) increased the  average race \nspeed to  120.93mph, while in  the  Senior TT, winner John \nMcGuinness (Yamaha) set  off with the aim of establishing a \nlead from the outset and raised the  lap record to  127.33mph"

The 4-cylinder 600cc machines \nused in  them were subject to  development effort by the \nmanufacturers and by race tuners, but, as  always, there was \na  price to  pay  for  speed and in  2005 it showed itself in the \nform of reduced reliability. There were seventy finishers \nin  race A  from eighty-one starters, but  only fifty-eight in \nrace B  from seventy-five starters.

Notwithstanding the \nexcellent service facilities available from the expensive \nmobile workshops run  by many teams at the TT, they could \nnot  undertake the  between-races sort of rebuilds required \nby machines that had been overstressed by the  demands of \nthe  Mountain Course. The solution chosen by the  manu- \nfacturers, and accepted by the  organizers, was to  reduce \nthe  TT  Supersport to  one race for  2006, giving a  six-race \nprogramme. \nThe slimmed-down programme of  six  races did not go \ndown well with all  TT  fans, for  many remembered when \nthere were ten, and  even if some of them were combined \nto  give races within races, they did  offer variety in  sights \nand sounds. For others, six races \nwere enough, because a large number \nof  them were present to  enjoy the \nTT  scene as  a  whole, with its  varied \nentertainments and general motorcy- \ncling theme. To them, the  races were \njust a part of that scene. \nOn the organizing side, efforts \nwere being made to attract more qual- \nity riders to  the  event, although the \noverall number of  entries accepted \nwas reduced to  give slightly smaller \ngrids. For 2006, there were just 226 \nindividual competitors across solos \nand sidecar events, with revised \ntimetabling bringing some changes to \ntheir race days.

      "text": "184 M  FASTER AND FASTER \nThere had been few major changes to the course in recent \nyears, but  2006 saw  reconstruction of Windy Corner. An \nopen, windswept bend at a height of 1,220ft (372m), it had \nseen its  share of racing incidents. From the 1930s to  the \n1950s it  was a  second-gear corner taken at  55—60mph. \nToday it is a  fourth-gear job, with riders taking advantage \nof its wide, positively cambered, right-handed sweep to get \nthe fastest run  on  towards the Thirty-third Milestone. The \n2006 improvements were thought to  save riders 4 seconds \na lap and, apart from the cat’s eyes on  the inside of the bend \nhaving to  be  lowered after John McGuinness complained \nthat he was  catching his knee-sliders on  them, the work was \nrated a major improvement. \nThe upgrading of Windy Corner was carried out  princi- \npally on  road safety grounds. Other measures introduced \nfor  the  benefit of the Manx motoring public included a \nprogramme of applying ‘Shell-grip’ at  busy junctions and \non  some bends. A blend of epoxy resin and  bitumen with \ncalcined bauxite chippings, it gave enhanced grip, but there \nwas little comment as  to  whether it offered benefit to  the \nracers. \nPractice week normally experienced mixed weather, \nbut in 2006 it was  almost completely dry. This enabled the \nrubber laid on  the  track to  remain and  riders felt  that this \ncontributed to grip. \nRACING \nMorecambe’s John McGuinness was  now recognized as  the \ntop TT rider of the era, although he had plenty of challeng- \ners  for that position. McGuinness was  riding works Hondas \nunder the  HM Plant banner in 2006 and  got off to  a  flying \nstart with victory on  a Fireblade in the  opening TT  Super- \nbike race, setting a  new lap record in  the  process. With \nrecord-breaking wins in  the  Supersport and Senior TTs, \nhe also raised the  absolute lap record to  129.45mph in the \nSenior and led something of a resurrection for Honda at the \nTT, where Nick Crowe also  used their new 600 engines to \nachieve a Sidecar double at record-breaking speeds. Having \nunofficially broken the  Sidecar lap record during practice, \nDave Molyneux was  travelling at  145mph when he managed \nto flip his outfit onto its back at Rhencullen in a later session \nand  put himself out  of the racing. \nOnly \nin  \nTT  \nSuperstock \ndid  \nHonda \nmiss \nout  \nin  \n2006. \nThere \nvictory \nwent \nto \nBruce \nAnstey \n(Suzuki) \nat \njust \nbelow \nrecord \npace, \nwith \nlan \nHutchinson \n(Kawasaki) \nsecond \nand \nJason \nGriffiths \n(Yamaha) \nthird. \nThe \nlatter \nwas  \n‘Mr \nConsist- \nent’ \nat \nthe \nTT, \nfor \nwhile \nnever \na winner, \nhe \nachieved \nmul- \ntiple \npodium \nfinishes. \nIn \nonly \nhis \nsecond \nyear \nat the \nevent, \nCameron \nDonald \nshowed \nthat \nhe \nwas \na \nman \nto \nwatch, \nwith \nsecond \nplace \nin \nthe \nSenior \nrace, \nand \nfuture \nstar, \nManxman \nConor \nCummins, \nmade \na  \nsteady \ndebut, \nas  \ndid  \nWilliam \nDunlop. \nSPEEDS ON  BRAY HILL \nThis fearsome drop has  fascinated spectators and fright- \nened riders down the  years, with many and  varied claims \nas  to  speeds achieved. At  the  first running of the  TT  over \nthe  Mountain Course in  1911, a  local newspaper forecast, \nperhaps optimistically, that riders would take it  at  up  to \n70mph. By the mid-1930s they were timed at 95mph; after \nsome smoothing, Omobono Tenni took it at a highly coura- \ngeous 120mph in  1948; while in the early 1950s, Manxman \nJackie Wood was  the  fastest at  127mph. \nOne thing that race followers always wanted to  know \nwas were riders flat  out  coming down Bray? For  their part, \nriders indicated that they were and speeds quoted were usu- \nally close to  the  maximum speed of the  day, although, in \nreality, only the  fastest riders kept the  throttle wire really \nstretched to  the  limit. Lesser riders would usually permit \nthemselves a little slack —  and  who can  blame them? \nAs  machine speeds increased, the  pace down Bray Hill \nalso got  quicker. By  1967 Mike Hailwood was talking of \n‘doing about 145mph ...  and everything bottoms in  the \ndip’. In the  1980s, top riders reckoned they could use  full \nthrottle on  the  popular Suzuki RG500s of the  day, which \nwould have been about 155mph. \nIn the  early 1990s Steve Hislop took an  RVF Honda and \nthe  rotary-engined Norton through the  bottom flat  in  top \ngear, which he thought equated to  167—170mph, while fast- \nest  lapper in  the  early 2000s, David Jefferies, felt  that his \nYamaha had  too  much power, and ‘I rolled it back’. How- \never, after moving to  a  Suzuki he  told, ‘I managed to  do \nBray Hill absolutely flat in the  Senior race ...  doing at least \n175mph, possibly 180’. \nIn  2006, John McGuinness explained, ‘I normally click \nthe big one  into top gear as  I crest the brow of Bray Hill ... \nit’s about 180mph down there’, with Guy Martin confirm- \ning ‘it must be knocking on  180mph’, \nA big enough challenge on  a  solo, Bray Hill must seem \nmuch narrower with a sidecar. In  the  late 1970s top man \nJock Taylor told  how he  used to  be  flat  out, but  how the \ndevelopment of bumps in  the  road meant he  backed off \nto  120mph. Moving on  some forty years, it is perhaps no \nsurprise that many-times winner and current star, Dave \nMolyneux, holds his  self-designed DMR outfit flat out, \nextracting every bit of power to  hit  150mph. \nTT CENTENARY 1907—2007 \nIn \n2007 \nthe \nIsle \nof \nMan \nwas \nawash \nwith \njustifiable \ncelebra- \ntion, \nas \nthe \nTT \nreached \nthe \ncentenary \nof \nits \nfirst \nrunning"

For  2007, former British Supersport \nchampion and  regular British Superbike competitor, Steve \nPlater, tried his  hand on  R1  and R6  Yamahas supplied by \nAIM Racing, while Keith Amor and Gary Johnson were \nother first-timers. Also, although this was a  return from \nyears \nat \nBritish \nSuperbike \nracing \nrather \nthan \nan \nIsland \ndebut, \npast \nregular \ncompetitor \nand \nTT \nwinner \nMichael \nRutter, \nstill \nonly \nthirty-three, \nmade \nan \nIsland \ncomeback \non \nKawasaki \nZX-10R \nand \nZX-6R \nbikes \nfrom \nMSS \nDiscovery \nKawasaki. \nFASTER AND FASTER MP  185 \nGROWING SPEEDS \nThe influx of such quality riders served as  a  spur to  estab- \nlished TT stars and  was  just another factor that helped con- \ntribute to  the  year-on-year growth in  speeds, as  everyone \nupped their game. Its effect would not  be measurable but it \njoined other influences like increased pressure from high- \nlevel sponsors, greater coverage and the subsequent gaining \nof publicity from TV  and online activities and, of course, \nthe  associated growth in  financial rewards available to  top \nriders. All  served to  heighten expectations and perform- \nances. \nAt  the  same time, a  never-ending stream of  machine \nimprovements played a  major part in increasing speeds. As \nit had  been for  a  century, this was a  step-by-step process, \nwith the  effect of each individual improvement being dif- \nficult to  quantify. John McGuinness arrived for  the  2007 \nevent with his  big Honda having a  ‘new spec’ engine with \nimproved engine management electronics, plus new fork \nyokes. He  was confident they contributed to  a better bike, \nbut no  one  could predict or  measure what effect that would \nhave on  race speeds. As  far  as  straight-line speeds went, \nMcGuinness reckoned his  Honda was giving him 195mph \non  Sulby Straight. It was such Sulby moments that caused \nhim to  say, ‘when you  are  on  the  bike, wide open and  flat \nout, it’s  the  best feeling in  the  world’. Lesser mortals can \nonly imagine, with envy, the  heightening of all  senses that \nmust occur in such a situation. \nRECORDS ALLTHE WAY \nThe result of  100 years of motorcycle development was \nshowcased at the 2007 TT. Contesting the event had helped \nmanufacturers enhance design and performance across all \naspects of the racing motorcycle, with those getting it right \nreturning home in triumph, while for those who got things \nwrong it was a  case of going back to  the  drawing board. \nThe pace was hot in  practice, and further proof that \ndesign and performance were still advancing came when, \nin  the  ensuing Centenary race week, records were broken \nin  all  classes. However, although nobody disputed that \ntyres were a  factor contributing to  advances in  perform- \nance, their unsuitability for  use  in  mixed road conditions \nand a  claim of poor visibility caused the  postponement of \nSaturday’s opening races until Sunday. \nWith track conditions still not  perfect, John McGuin- \nness (Honda) opened his  2007 TT  with a  win in the  post- \nponed Superbike race, leading home Guy Martin (Honda) \nand breaking both race average speed and lap records for \nthe  class, at  125.55mph and 128.27mph. Next day, ‘King \nof the  Superstocks’, Bruce Anstey (Suzuki), took his  third \nconsecutive win in  the  class in  perfect conditions. Again"

It was  a tremendous \nperformance by the  Kiwi on  what was said to  be  a  stock \nbike fitted with a  forks kit and  aftermarket rear shock but, \nstrangely, Anstey could not  get his  big Suzuki to  handle in \nthe  Superbike and  Senior races. A welcome sight and sound \nin  the  Superstock event was Martin Finnegan bringing a \nfactory-supported MV Agusta into fourth place. \nA less  than fully fit lan  Hutchinson (Honda) rode to  his \nfirst PT victory in  the Supersport race, setting a  new race \naverage record speed of  123.22mph, with John McGuin- \nness (Honda) just 2.84 seconds behind and Guy Martin \n(Honda) being the  first to  break the  125mph barrier on  a \n600. Martin took third place and left  the  new lap record \nat  125.16mph. The sidecar races saw two wins for  Dave \nMolyneux using Honda power, although he was just short \nof his  own race average record, but  Nick Crowe used his \nHonda power to break the outright lap record for the three- \nwheelers, leaving it at  a heady 116.67mph. Unfortunately, \nsuch treatment also  saw  Crowe break his Honda engine, so \nhe did  not  finish the  race. \nCome the  last  race of the  week, the  Senior TT, and the \ntarget of a 130mph lap was there for the  taking by the  top \nriders. The man who rose to  the occasion and  put his name \ninto the  record books was John McGuinness. With some \nHistory is made as  the \nscoreboard opposite \nthe Grandstand \nrecords the first \n130mph lap. \n200bhp available from \nhis Honda, he  opened \nwith a standing-start lap \nspeed of 129.98mph, \nsmashed the 130mph \nbarrier on   his second \nlap at  130.35mph and \nraced on  to  victory at  a \nnew Senior race aver- \nage record speed of \n127.25mph. McGuin- \nness won by 32  seconds \nfrom Guy Martin, who \nwas followed by lan \nHutchinson and Ian  Lougher. The first four all rode Honda \nFireblades. \nJohn McGuinness joined a select band of record-breakers \nand  the  130mph title was truly his, for he was the  only one \nin the  race to  reach the  figure. It was an  achievement that \nset  the seal on  a memorable and record-breaking Centenary \nIe. \nSPEEDS \nShown below is the  progression in  speeds since the  Moun- \ntain Course was brought into use in  1911. \nFirst lap achieved at  _—_ Rider Year \n50mph Frank Philipp 1911 \n60mph Jimmy Simpson 1924 \n70mph Jimmy Simpson 1926 \n80mph Jimmy Simpson 1931 \n90mph Freddie Frith 193y7 \n100mph Bob McIntyre 1957 \n110mph John Williams 1976 \n120mph Steve Hislop 1989s \n130mph John McGuinness 2007 \nDuring the  period covered by this chapter, 1999-2007, \nfastest \nlap \nspeeds \nincreased \nfrom \n124.45mph \nto \n130.35mph. \nThat was impressive."

Despite the  impo- \nsition of those restrictions, there still remain many places \nwhere spectators can  stand close the  racing and so  experi- \nence the  high-speed thrills of TT-watching. \nOn the racing front, the second Supersport race returned \nto  the  programme for  2008, and the 125 and 250cc TT \nraces were also reinstated. Rather diluting the news of \nthe  two-strokes’ return was the  fact that they would run \nover the 444-mile Billown Circuit in the south of the  Island \nrather than over the  Mountain Course. They would be part \nof Billown’s customary Steam Packet Race meeting, run  on \nthe  Saturday after the  Senior TT. \nTHE YOUNG GUNS \nA promotional theme at the  2008 TT  went under the head- \ning of ‘Young Guns’ and featured some of the  star young \nriders contesting the  event. The basis of the promotion was \nthat their growing talents showed that the  future of the \nTT  was in good hands. Those included were Conor Cum- \nmins, William Dunlop, Martin Finnegan, James Hillier, \nlan Hutchinson, Gary Johnson, Olie Linsdell and Guy Mar- \ntin. Of course, “Hutchie’ had already won a  TT  and Guy \nMartin had  come close to  doing so. \nJoining his  brother William, a  young Michael Dunlop \nrode his  first TT  in  2008. They were the  sons of the  late \nRobert Dunlop, himself a  five-times TT  winner. \nAll  of the  above would have been \non  high-class machines, but every- \none’s aim was to  achieve a  works \nride. It was an  age  where most fac- \ntories entrusted the  preparation and \nmanagement of their bikes to  private \nentrants like  TAS and HM Plant. \nHonda had  given much support to \nthe  TT  down the  years, but  its  level \nhad fluctuated in  recent times. This \nwas probably caused more by budg- \netary constraints than a reduction in \nenthusiasm. In  2008 there were no \nofficial Honda works entries at  the \nTT. It meant that John McGuinness \nwas mounted on  Padgett-supplied \nHondas, which, he  was assured, \nincorporated the  best Honda Racing \nbits. Honda’s decision not  to  support \nthe 2008 TT meant that both Ian \nHutchinson and Jan  Lougher had to \nfind alternative machinery. Hutchie \njoined Steve Plater at  AIM Racing, \nwhere they would race Yamahas. \nPlater was back at  the  TT  for a  second year, having set  the \nfastest-ever Newcomer’s lap of 125.61mph in  2007, on  an \nAIM RI  that was deliberately softer in  engine and chassis \ntune than their normal British Superbike machine. Indica- \ntions were that he would be on  a sharper version for  2008. \nAn  already strong sidecar class of established ‘drivers’ \nlike Dave Molyneux, Nick Crowe, John Holden, Steve \nNorbury and former World Champion Klaus Klaffenbok \nwere joined by three-times World Champion Tim Reeves. \nBetween them they used a mix of Honda and Suzuki power \nunits in Dave Molyneux Racing (DMR) and Louis Christian \nRacing (LCR) chassis. Like the solos, the sidecar men were \nkeen to  incorporate every new power-enhancing engine \n‘mods’ that the regulations allowed. They also sought \nimprovements in areas like the chassis, cooling, suspension, \nbraking and streamlining. \nNEW STARS \nWith solid previous TT placings, including a fine second in \nthe  2006 Senior race, Cameron Donald probably missed \nout  on  being classified as  a  “Young Gun’ at  twenty-nine \nyears of age. However, the  Australian was to  be the  star of \nthe  2008 meeting, mounted on  TAS Suzukis. \nIn the  opening Superbike race he moved to  the front on \nthe  fourth lap after earlier leader, Guy Martin (Honda), \nwas forced to  retire.

Chris Palmer won the  former and Ian  Lougher the  lat- \nter. They were both Honda-mounted, as  were the  major- \nity of the  entry.

Not surprisingly, in the \ntelling, it sometimes becomes a case of ‘the older I get the \nfaster I was’. \n2009: PUBLICITY \nThe organizers had done a  good job of bringing the  TT \ninto the twenty-first century and their advance publicity for \n2009 described it as  “The Greatest Show on  Earth’, while \nrenowned motor sport commentator Murray Walker, who \nhad links to  the  event stretching back over almost eighty \nyears, called it “The Greatest Motor-Sporting Event in the \nWorld’. Allied to such self-publicity, growing exposure was \ncatching the  imagination of the  world at  large and  bring- \ning more TT  coverage, which also helped attract quality \nsponsorship of the  event and its  riders. Self-generating in \na  way, such increased publicity saw ever more people add \nthe  TT  to  their lists of things they must see. Some would \nmake their pilgrimage as  enthusiasts for  the  sport, often \nwhile strapped for cash, while others would take the easiest \noption to  see  this high-speed festival, being happy to  pay \nwhatever it cost to be part of the TT  experience. \nMany of the  latter would be  based around the  Grand- \nstand area, where everything was  organized for them, while \nthe  former were more likely to  seek out  high-speed view- \ning points around the  course. Unfortunately, the  growth \nin  restrictions on  viewing points means that much of \ntoday’s most exciting on-course action goes unseen. \nThe picture shown here illustrates the commitment \nrequired from those who ride to  win at  the TT. John \nMcGuinness described the experience here with the words: \n‘You \n... \nget \ninto \ntop \non \nthe \nstraight, \nthen \nit \ngoes \nleft \nand \nright. \nWell \nthat \nright-hander, \nyou're \na \ncomplete \npassen- \nger \n... \nsat \non \na \nmoving \ntorpedo \nthat’s \ndoing \nits \nown \nthing \nand \nyou \njust \nhave \nto \nlet \nit \ndo \nit’. \nHe \nadded, \n‘You’re \nprob- \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS #191 \nably doing about 180, it’s  blind, you  can’t see  through it’. \nMcGuinness puts his life on  the line here perhaps fifty times \nat each TT meeting during practice and racing, but the only \npeople to  see  this  supreme display of high-speed riding are \nnearby marshals, for  spectators are  now banned from the \nspot and  even photographers, like Juan Cregeen, who took \nthis shot, are  no  longer permitted there. \nTHE ‘GREEN TT’ \nAmong claims that the “TT Festival’ had anew look for 2009, \none genuinely new event was a  Time Trials Xtreme Grand \nPrix (TTXGP) race, for  clean-emission race machines. \nThis was described as  ‘providing an  exciting opportunity \nfor  leading global innovators in  racing and clean emission \ntechnologies to  compete and  prove to  the  world that being \ngreen does not  mean being slow’, It was given the  status of \na genuine race for a Tourist Trophy, although it was to  run \nover only one  lap of the  Mountain Course. \nSeemingly there were not  too  many ‘global innovators’ \nwishing to  take up  the  challenge, and  after the  small bat- \ntery-powered field had done their lap, it  was Rob Barber \n(Agni XO10) who was  fastest at  87.43mph and  thus headed \nthe  “Best Buy Pro  Class’, while Chris Heath (Electric Mot- \norsport) was first home in  the  ‘Open Class’. Spectators \nwere divided on  the  merit of the  event, but just to  remind \neveryone that the  TT  is a business, the  Isle  of Man govern- \nment made a  business-based decision that a  place be  made \nfor the  Green TT  in future years. \nHONDA \nHonda may not  have given direct works support to  the  TT \nin  2008, but  the  name was everywhere in  2009, in  cel- \nebration of the  fiftieth anniversary of the  company’s first \ncompetitive visit in  1959. However, the most important \naspect of Honda’s presence was that it came with increased \nsupport of the racing. Under the banner of HM  Plant, John \nMcGuinness and Steve Plater were down to  contest the \nsolo classes and Nick Crowe received engine support for \nhis sidecar. \nWhile the  2009 TT  was not  quite a  Honda walkover, \nit gave the  marque much cause for  celebration, with wins \nand a  multitude of new lap and race records. The biggest \npotential threat to  Honda was seen as  TAS Suzuki-mounted \nCameron Donald, but after setting a blistering pace in early \npractice, he fell at  Keppel Gate, damaged his  shoulder and \nwas  out of the racing. There remained plenty of challengers, \nbut  Honda’s John McGuinness took victory in  the  open- \ning Superbike race, lifting the  absolute race average speed \nto  127.99mph and the  absolute lap record to  130.44mph. \nMcGuinness was in  control throughout, riding to  his  sig-"

Some twenty years later, multi-winner John Surtees \ndescribed it as  ‘one of the most difficult to  get right on  the \nTT  course’.

The almost 6mph \ngrowth in  lap record speed during this decade was twice \nthat of the  previous one  and came from engines delivering \noutputs that had increased from cl70bhp in  2000 to  over \n200bhp. \nContesting the  TT  was  a fiercely competitive business, \nand while the  machines brought to  the  event might still \nbe  referred to  by the  stock reference of Fireblade, GSX- \nR1000, ZX-10 and so  on,  apart from engine, transmission \nand major frame components, very little of the original bike \nremained after preparation as  a  top  TT  race bike. Among \nitems changed would be forks, steering damper, rear shock, \nwheels, brake discs, calipers, master cylinders and  hoses, \nradiator(s), oil-cooler, handlebars and clamps, clutch, \nexhaust system, chain, sprockets, quick-shift, fuel tank, \nfairing, seat, tyres, battery and all  electrics/electronics. \nThe replacement items would be the best that money could \nbuy —  or  that the team could afford. Sometimes the best, say \nthe  suspension, came with a  hidden cost, because it could \nbe so  ‘trick’ that it needed a specialist to  get the best out  of \nit. Today’s suspension is five-way adjustable, with main ele- \nments like compression and  rebound adjustments each hav- \ning something like thirty-two settings. While most teams \nmake use  of the  support of manufacturers’ representatives \nin areas like suspension, they learned to  be wary of getting \nout \nof \ntheir \ndepth \nwith \ntoo \nmuch \nadjustability, \neven \nthough \nthey \nand \ntheir \nriders \nrecognized \nthe \nsupreme \nimportance \nof \nachieving \nhigh-speed \nstability \nover \nthe \nMountain \nCourse. \nWhere \nengines \nare  \nconcerned, \nall \ngo \nthrough \nthe  \nhands \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS #   199 \ncGuinness \nSteve \nMercer \nie \nDerek Huxley fine-tunes a Jackson Racing Honda via  his \nlaptop. \nof specialist tuners, who apply their blueprinting skills and \nbring specialized knowledge to  traditional areas like pis- \ntons, valves, springs, porting and so  on,  with the aim of lift- \ning output.

This is \nanother area that can  be both hugely expensive and  difficult \nto  get the  best out  of if too  complicated. It usually needs a \nspecialist within the  team to  use  it to  full  advantage. \nBefore the  introduction of electronic control, areas like \nignition and carburation operated in  a  compromise mode. \nThe restrictive effect of that would have been more pro- \nnounced at low revolutions, for the limited settings of which \nthey were capable were generally utilized in  gaining the \nbest use  of a  racing engine’s potential at  full  power. Philip \nNeill, of TAS Suzuki, explained how the  use  of modern \nelectronics ‘allow you to  use  finer increments of change’. \nCorrectly applied, you could now achieve optimum per- \nformance throughout the  engine’s rev  range by the  precise \ntailoring of ignition and fuelling settings.

How much infor- \nmation was  available depended upon the number of sensors \nfitted, and it was  only accessible when the bike returned to \nthe  pits. It could take time to  interpret and the  resulting \nalterations to  set-up might have to  be varied for each rider \nin a team to  suit  their different riding styles. \nSuperbikes were still purpose-built for  the  demands of \nthe  TT  course, but they were very close to  those prepared \nfor  use  in  British Super Bike racing, perhaps sacrificing \n10bhp at  the  top end to  gain a little more performance in \nthe mid-range. With few major changes to  the  course dur- \ning the previous decade and with tyres easily able to last two \nlaps, most of the increase in lap speeds at the TT since 2000 \nhad  come from faster bikes. While developments across all \nareas of the machine would have played their part in giving \nmore speed, it was refined electronics that made the  big- \ngest contribution to  increased performance. That may not \nmean greatly increased maximum speeds, it being more the \ncase that the faster laps come from improved rideability and \nmore efficient power delivery throughout the  rev  range. \nRACING AND SPEEDS \nHaving written above about increases in \npower and  speed, the  only record bro- \nken during racing at the  2011 TT was in \nthe opening Superbike race, where win- \nner  John McGuinness (Honda) raised \nthe  race average speed to  a  new high \nof  127.87mph.

Bruce Anstey (Honda) was  third and \nset the fastest lap of the race at  131.53mph, just fractionally \nunder the  absolute course lap record of 131.67mph, set  by \nJohn McGuinness on  his  Superbike in the  opening race of \nthe  week. \nJames Hillier took his first TT win in the new  Lightweight \nrace, while Michael Rutter (MotoCzysz) took another win \nin  TT  Zero, with John McGuinness (Mugen) less  than 2 \nseconds behind. Rutter again raised the lap record by 5 per \ncent, leaving it at  109.68mph. There were eight finishers \nfrom ten  starters, but  the  lap times of the  last two were \nsome 35mph slower than the  winner. \nThe race average record for  the  sidecars had remained \nunbroken since 2009 and  their lap record since 2007. The \nrace regulations limited what changes could be  made to \ntheir 600cc engines, and in 2013 the winning speeds of  Tim \nReeves and Ben Birchall were below record pace. \nSPEEDS \nLap speeds of the  1000cc Superbikes grew from 125.69mph \nto  131.67mph between 2000 and 2013, representing an \nincrease of 4.75 per cent in a period when output increased \nby just over 10  per  cent, to  approximately 220bhp. The \nspeeds for  600cc Supersports went from 121.15mph to \n128.68mph, an  increase of 6.22 per  cent, with their out- \nputs increasing to  140bhp. \nWhen looking for the fastest lap in a TT race, it is worth \nremembering that only the final one  is a true flying lap. All \nthe  others are  either standing start laps, like  the  first one \nand those after pit stops, or  slowing down for  refuelling \nlaps. While the flying lap should offer the best opportunity \nof the  fastest lap, for  by then riders are  well accustomed \nto  course conditions and  have a light fuel  load, it does not \nalways happen. This is particularly so  if a  rider has  estab- \nlished a good lead, for he can  then ride his last lap at a con- \ntrolled pace, checking the time gap to his nearest Opponent \nby way of his  signalling boards. Many fastest laps are  set \nearly in a race, when riders are  trying to establish a position \nat the  front. \nFUEL CONSUMPTION \nCompetitors \nusually \ntry \nto \ngain \nan  \nidea \nof \nfuel \nconsumption \nduring \npractice, \nbut  \nmany \nfind \nthat \nit \nincreases \nwhen \nthey \nuse  \nthe  \nthrottle \nharder \nunder \nrace \nconditions. \nIndeed, \nthe \nnumber \nof top \nriders \nwho \nhave \nrun \nout \nof fuel \nand \nlost \na \nTT \nwin \nis legion. \nDuring \nthe  \nfirst \ntwo \nyears \nrunning \nof \nthe  \nevent \n(1907 \nand  \n1908) \nriders \nreceived \na \nfixed \nallocation \nof \nfuel \nand \ntheir \nconsumption \nfigures \nwere \npublished. \nChapter \n1 \ntold \nhow \nwinner \nof \nthe \nSingles \nrace \nin \n1907, \nCharlie \nCollier, \nused \nfuel \nat the \nrate \nof \n94.5mpg \nand \nwinner \nof \nthe \nrace \nfor \nMul- \ntis, \nRem \nFowler, \naveraged \n87mpg. \nBy the mid-1930s, British single-cylinder machines refu- \nelled just once in their seven-lap, and  264-mile races, using \nfuel at about 30—35mpg. Post-war multis were much thirst- \nier,  as  were the two-strokes that followed. \nToday, the race regulations restrict fuel-tank capacity to \n24 litres, which equates to  5% gallons. This is, usually, just \nenough to  complete two laps of racing before refuelling is \nrequired and gives a  fuel consumption figure of approxi- \nmately 1S5mpg. \nTT  GETS TOUGHER \nThe moment riders unleash the 220bhp of  a  Superbike \naround the  TT  course they are  taking their lives in  their \nhands. All know that they need every ounce of control and \nso  recognize the need to  show respect to other riders while \nriding in  close company and when passing. But the  often \nsmall time differentials between first and second place, the \nincreased presence of short-circuit specialists, the riches to \nbe  won and  just  the  overall pressure to  win, saw  tougher \ntactics coming into use on  the course. \nThe organizers were selective in  accepting entries and \nqualifying standards were based upon a  percentage allow- \nance over the average speed set  by the fastest three riders in \na class. However, there were big speed differences between \ntop riders and those lower down the order, and the fast men \nwere increasingly bullying their way past. It was a  cause \nfor  regret for  older riders like  John McGuinness, but  the \nnewer stars took it for granted. Such tactics would certainly \ncreate worrying moments for  those being passed, and it \ntakes a degree of bravery to  race with the  really fast riders. \nRising star Ivan Lintin remarked, ‘the likes of Anstey and \nMcGuinness will not  give you any slack if you  are  paddling \naround —  they will scare the living daylights out  of you’. For \nhis part, Bruce Anstey commented, ‘catching a slower rider \ncan  cost you  between 2 and  4 seconds’, \nSET-UP \nElectronic control packages now dealt with the  set-up of \nengine performance, while another important area that rid- \ners  spent much of practice getting right was suspension, \nfront and rear. With components that allowed ever more \nadjustments, most teams relied on  the support of specialists \nfrom \nfirms \nlike \nOhlin \nand \nK-Tec \nto \nhelp \nget \ntheir \nsettings \nright."

There are  many \nwho consider that the  straightening of bends over a period \nof  100 years must have reduced the  distance around the \nMountain Course and  it is a  topic that  has  been subject to \nmuch debate. \nFrom 1911 to  1914 the lap length was  given as  37’ miles. \nThe distance of 37% miles was  first used in  1920, when the \ncourse was extended from Cronk ny Mona to  include Sign- \npost Corner, Governor’s Bridge and Glencrutchery Road. \nThe organizers’ ‘General Conditions for  the  International \n1920 Auto-Cycle Tourist Trophy Races’ described it as  37 \nmiles and  6 furlongs, which equals 37% miles, a figure that \nseemed generally accepted. \nPerhaps not  everyone did  accept it,  though, for  in  its \nissue of 12 April 1923, The Motor Cycle said, “The TT Course \nis to  be  measured accurately: to  do  this it will be  neces- \nsary to  employ a revolution counter attached to  the  sidecar \nwheel of an  outfit driven slowly.’ The figure that resulted \nwas 37  miles and 1,299 yards. As  %  mile is  1,320 yards, \nthey obviously thought the  course was 21  yards short of a \nfull 3734 miles. But  did  the  sidecar take a  central line or  a \nracing line, and is a three-wheeler’s racing line  the  same as \na two-wheeler’s? \nFrom 1923 the organizers used a figure of 37 miles 1,300 \nyards and  a speed/distance table was published based upon \nthis, quoting an  equivalent lap distance of  37.739 miles. \nAfter another official measure in  1937 it was  declared to be \n37  miles 1,291 yards, or  37.733 miles; the  ACU used the \nfigure of 37  miles 1,29074 yards to  calculate lap times in \nthe pre-war period, which they said was 37.733 miles. The \nrace regulations for  1937 settled for  37 miles 1,290 yards. \nPresumably \nthere \nwas  \nmore \nagitation \nover \nlap \ndistance \nin \nthe \nearly \n1950s, \nfor \nassisted \nby \nTT \nwinner \nFergus \nAnder- \nson, \nThe \nMotor \nCycle \nmeasured \nit \nin \n1954 \nusing \na \nSmith’s \nInstruments \nwheel-revolution \ncounter \nand \ncame \nup \nwith \na \nfigure \nof \n37.449 \nmiles, \nwhich \nequates \nto \n37 \nmiles \nand \n790 \nyards. \nSo \nwas \nit \nreally \nsome \n500 \nyards \nshorter \nthan \nin \npre-war days? \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS @  209 \nIt was  the turn of Motorcycle News to have a measure before \nthe 1978 TT. The method used was not  declared, but  its \nresult of 37.195 miles (37 miles 343  yards) was. It seemed \nperfectly happy with its  figure, which showed that getting \non  for  1,000 yards had disappeared since 1920, although \nthe race organizers seemed equally content to continue cal- \nculating lap times based on  37.733 miles, as  it had  done for \nmany years. \nThe next record of the  course being measured comes \nfrom the  centenary year of 2007, when Alex Coward, a \nveteran cyclist and official course measurer for Manx cycle \ntrials, was  asked to ride a lap and establish a figure. The line \nhe  took was generally 1 yard out  from the  left-hand kerb, \nwith just the  occasional cutting of a  corner. After several \nhours of pedalling, Alex came up with a distance of 37.7224 \nmiles, which is just 17’ yards (52.8ft was  the actual figure \nquoted) short of the  official 37.73 miles given in  the  cur- \nrent regulations for the race, although it is now shown in its \nmetric equivalent, 60.70km. \nThe power put down by modern bikes sees them wheel- \nspinning under full  throttle even in the  dry, and  they also \nspend more time than in  the  past with their wheels off \nthe  ground over bumps. So  might those factors affect any \nconventional on-board recorded lap  distances? Further- \nmore, do all riders cover the  same distance, for the  ‘racing \nline’ of tyre marks on  bends can  be 6 to  8 feet wide, which \nbegs the question, do the fastest riders take the tightest line \n(and thus the  shortest lap distance) or  does their greater \nspeed through corners mean they take the  widest? So  the \nquestions go on.  Perhaps after a century of use  and  in this \nage  of on-bike GPS and  data-logging, it should be possible \nto  get a  precise figure of distance covered. But  what if the \ncourse is  shorter than is  officially stated, will TT  fans be \nhappy if current lap speeds are  ‘corrected’ to  sub-130mph \nfigures? \n2015: SPEEDS \nIn 2015 top riders were reaching 196mph on  Sulby Straight. \nThey had been nudging that figure for  several years and \npeople were beginning to  think that 200mph was  possible, \na  speed already reached on a longer straight at  the  North \nWest 200. Also, Bruce Anstey’s outright lap record speed \nof 132.29mph was  completed in  17 minutes 6.6 seconds, so \nthere was  talk of a rider getting into the  ‘sixteens’. Former \nTT  winner Nick Jefferies, thinking back to  his early days, \nsaid in  2015, ‘the  speed increases of the  bikes —  it’s mind- \nblowing’. \nOver the  winter of 2014—15, works of resurfacing and \nreprofiling were carried out  on  the  bends at  Keppel Gate \nand  the  results were expected to  benefit the  racers."

      "text": "214 M  ONWARDS AND UPWARDS \nIt was an  emotional John McGuinness who embraced his \nfamily after the  Senior race. Drained after a  fortnight of \nhigh-speed riding around the  Mountain Course and  all the \nassociated demands made on  his  time as  a  top  TT  rider, \nhe  knew that his  status had  been under challenge. But  he \nhad  dug deep to  achieve his  victory and  had  equalled Mike \nHailwood’s record of seven Senior TT  wins. McGuinness \nknew his Honda was  not  the  fastest bike on  the  track for it \nwas an  ageing model, but  he gained huge satisfaction from \nhis 2015 Senior TT win at record speeds, rating it as  one  of \nhis finest victories. \nSo  ended a  weather-hit TT  meeting that was attended \nby 42,000 visitors over the  two-week period, an  increase \nover previous years. More visitors was what the  Island was \nseeking to achieve, for it meant more money into the Manx \ncoffers, but TT enthusiasts noted a change in visitor profile, \nwith some of the  newer ones seeming to  be  there for  the \noccasion rather than the  racing. \n2016: NEWS \nAmidst the  hustle and bustle of preparations for  the  TT \nchallenge came a reminder that racing motorcycles could be \na cruel sport. Two young men who had shown their talents \nwith wins at  the  2015 MGP, Billy Redmayne and Malachi \nMitchell-Thomas, had entries for  the  2016 TT, but  both \nwere killed in pre-TT race meetings —  Redmayne at  Scar- \nborough and  Mitchell-Thomas at the  North West 200. \nAs  ever, racing went on. There were minor changes \nto  the Supersport regulations to  bring them in  line with \nJohn \nMcGuinness \npublicizes \nhis  \nEMC? \n‘cloud \ncomputing’ \nsponsorship \nas  \nhe \npasses \nthe \nHalfway \nHouse \non \nhis Superstock \nHonda \nin \n2016. \nevents \nat \nWorld \nlevel, \nwhile \nsidecar \nregulations \nwere \neased \nin \nrespect \nof \nchassis \nand \nstreamlining, \nwith \nthe \naim \nof \npro- \nmoting \ndevelopment. \nThe \nsecond \nsidecar \nrace \nwas \nmoved \nfrom \nWednesday \nto \nFriday \nof \nrace \nweek \nand \nthe \nLight- \nweight \nrace \ntook \nthe \nWednesday \nslot. \nThe \nIsle \nof \nMan \ngov- \nernment \nwas \nlooking \nfor \nan \nexternal \npromoter \nto \ntake \nover \nthe \norganizing \nof \nthe \nTT \nand \nto \ngrow \nthe \nevent, \nso \nbringing \nmore \nmoney \ninto \nthe \nManx \nExchequer. \nThere was the  usual publicity about tyres, with several \nmakers telling how they had  spent the  winter testing their \nlatest ideas and Avon claiming to  have been working on \n‘development of prototype rubber, with different carcass \nconstruction and compound mixes’. Everyone knew the \nimportance of tyres at  the  TT, although they were maybe \nnot  quite so  critical as  in  Moto GP, where tyres were the \ndominant factor affecting bike design. At  the  TT, riders \nnow ran  120  front and 200 rear, a  far cry  from the  cycle- \nsized tyres of the  first event. \nSpectators were always keen to  see  and  hear something \ndifferent in TT machinery and much interest was  generated \nby the news that Padgetts were providing Bruce Anstey with \na  Honda RCV123, which was a  limited edition road-going \nversion of the  V4  Moto GP  bike. In  addition, veteran Jan \nLougher was to  run a  576cc Suter MMX500 two-stroke. \nMost acknowledged that the  Suter was a new machine and \nso  expectations were not too high, but there was  keen antic- \nipation of what the  Honda would deliver. Along with the \ndistinctive sounds of those two  bikes, Norton were back for \nanother year with their Aprilia-powered machine, ridden \nby David Johnson. The  Norton’s unique \nexhaust note made it sound fast and 2016 \nwas to  prove that it was, with 130mph \nlaps. \nOn  the  rider front, Guy Martin was \nabsent, taking a  year out, while Ian \nHutchinson was to  ride a Tyco BMW in \nthe big classes and a Team Traction Con- \ntrol Yamaha R6  in  Supersport. It was a \nmachine choice mirrored by  Michael \nDunlop, but with different teams. \nManxman Dan Kneen was looking to \nmake a  step up from his  regular top-six \nplacings, having earned a  ride on  top- \nspecification Mar-Train Yamahas. How- \never, a fall  from a mountain bike on  the \nrun-up to  the  TT  landed him with arm \ninjuries and  unable to  ride. \nJohn McGuinness was again on  Hon- \ndas. He  was supported by several differ- \nent  sponsors and wore different leathers"

McGuinness knew that in the big classes his \nFireblade was  slower than the opposition, but he still  felt  it \nto  be a  well-balanced bike for the  Mountain Course. \nREADY AND WAITING \nIn  contrast to  the  poor weather often experienced during \npractice, the sun  shone throughout 2016’s week of prepara- \ntion. Getting underway on  Saturday evening, riders were \nimmediately on  the  pace and a few  of the  fastest put in six \nlaps in  their first practice session. By mid-week, stars like \nJohn McGuinness and Ian Hutchinson were saying that their \nbike set-ups were complete and they were ready to  race. \nBy the  end of practice all  competitors had  ridden more \nlaps than usual, and the high speeds achieved created \nexpectations of a  record-breaking TT  meeting. Arguably \nthe most experienced of the top-level riders, John McGuin- \nness, still rode a total of thirty-one practice laps, which was \nmore than any  other rider. Going on  to  ride twenty-five \nrace laps, all together he put in 2,114 ultra high-speed miles \nat the  2016 TT. \nSidecars were usually sent out  after solos and  often did \nnot  get the best practice conditions, but they enjoyed those \nof 2016, although two passengers were unfortunate to  fall \nfrom their very basic sidecar platforms and were injured. \nPast winner Conrad Harrison failed to find a passenger who \ncould stand the  pace, so  withdrew from the races. \nWhen interviewed, John McGuinness was  complimen- \ntary about the course, remarking on  the eradication of \nbumps at Tower Bends and  new surfacing on  some of the \nMountain Road. However, he was critical of the  condition \nof the  Sulby Straight, saying it was  ‘beginning to  feel  like a \nMoto-Cross course’. Sadly, later that day, the  experienced \nPaul Shoesmith lost control of his  BMW at  speed on  the \nSulby Straight and was  killed. The Mountain Course was  still \nso  very demanding; later in the week it also claimed the lives \nof sidecar drivers Dwight Beare in  Sidecar Race A, Ian  Bell \nin Sidecar Race B and rider Andrew Soar in the  Senior race. \nFASTEST SPEEDS \nFastest speeds recorded on  Sulby Straight during practice \nand racing in  2016 were: \nSuperbike/Senior: 196.8mph \nSuperstock: 191.2mph \nSupersport: 173mph \nLightweight: 154.6mph \nSidecar: 146.8mph \nTT  Zero: 158mph \nAll figures were set  in near perfect weather conditions. \nThe fastest riders were now timed at  175mph as  they \npassed the  Grandstand en  route to  the  descent of Bray Hill. \nBruce Anstey’s Honda RCV123 Moto GP-derived bike proved fast at  its debut TT  in 2016."

      "text": "A first-time win in  TT  Zero for  Bruce Anstey saw  him \nbring his  Mugen home ahead of William Dunlop (Victory \nBrammor), at  just under record pace. With five  finishers \nfrom seven starters, this was the  first year since the  intro- \nduction of the class in 2009 that the electric-powered bikes \nhad  failed to  record an  advance in lap speed. \nTHE FUTURE? \nThis book on  ‘Speed at  the  TT  Races’ concludes with a \nrepeat of the quotation that appeared in The Motor Cycle after \nthe  first races for  a  Tourist Trophy in  1907: ‘It  is useless \nto  say  that fast speeds are  not  to  be  encouraged, human \nnature being what it is.’  One hundred and  ten  years later, \nit still provides a  basic explanation of why riders strive to \nride ever faster around the  unforgiving Mountain Course. \nThere have been many machine developments aimed at \nproviding greater power, improved handling, better brak- \ning and increased reliability, all  of which have combined \nto  provide riders with faster racing motorcycles. Allied to \nthat extensive machine development, even the most ardent \nTT  follower has  lost count of the  countless improvements \nto  the  course that have aided the process of riding it faster. \nAnother, more speculative factor, is that with the  greater \nfamiliarity the human race now has with mechanically pow- \nered two-wheel devices, it is perhaps breeding even better \nriders. \nDespite the  developments on  all  these fronts, it is still \nhugely impressive that average lap speeds around the \nONWARDS AND UPWARDS #219 \nMountain Course have increased from 50.11mph in  1911 \nto  133.96 in  2016. However, it should be remembered that \nthe  object of the  first races was not  to  go ever faster, but  to \nbreed reliability in  motorcycles that were still in  the  early \nstages of development. Thus riders competed for a  ‘Tourist \nTrophy’. \nIn the years that followed, there have been many instances \nwhen the  motorcycle press announced that the  motorcycle \nhad  reached the  peak of its development in terms of power \nand reliability. They were repeatedly shown to be wrong, as \nadvances continued to  be made in all aspects of motorcycle \ndesign and  use. \nToday’s large-capacity motorcycles come with perform- \nance that far outstrips what can  be used on  the  open roads \nand, while the  highest measured top  speed of TT  Super- \nbikes is  196.8mph, they are  probably hitting 200mph on \nthe  drop from Creg ny Baa  to  Brandish, which is, in round \nterms, 100  yards per  second. Some may think that is fast \nenough, but the strong competitive urge present in TT rac- \ners  will see  them striving for  even more speed from their \ntwo-wheeled projectiles. \nAt present there seems no  desire to  cap  speeds, so  they \nare set  to  continue onwards and upwards, albeit with \nsmaller increments than in  the  past. Where it will all  end \nis  something that will be  revealed to  a  future generation. \nMeanwhile, those special riders who risk their lives by \nracing over the  TT  Mountain Course will continue to  go \n‘Faster and Faster’."

A constant \nfollower of Island racing ever since, \nhe greatly admires the  performances \nof today’s TT-winning machines from \nJapan and the  riders who have the \ncourage and talent to race over the \nfamous Mountain Course.

From \nriding the  earliest single-cylinder, belt-driven \nmachines with outputs of under 10bhp, to coping \nwith today’s sophisticated four-cylinder machines \ngiving well over 200bhp, generations of riders \nhave risked their lives to satisfy the  desire to go \nfaster than the  next man and to win  a TT.  In the \nprocess they have lifted lap speeds by almost \n100mph. Exactly how that huge increase has \nbeen achieved is told within these pages, set \nagainst the  background of the triumphs and the \ntragedies of TT history. \n978-1-78500-298-4 \n> Ne fe a \n85°002984\">"
