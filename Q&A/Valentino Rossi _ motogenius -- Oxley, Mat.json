More than anything, \nit's  his  mental strength. He’s got  the  capability to  stay \nright on  it week after week, which is where the  other \nguys fall  short. For  sure he’s  fast, but  some of the  others \nare  fast too. It’s  his  mental strength that pulls him \nthrough. If ever he  has  a  problem and a  little doubt \ncreeps in, he pulls through and  he’s  stronger than before. \nEver since he’s been in  GPs he’s been good for  the \nsport. He’s a  colourful character, he  loves life, he  loves \nriding motorcycles and he  wants to  portray that to \neverybody. He  arrived and changed the  way people \nthink about racing. He  proved that you can  have fun, \neven though he’s  very serious and  focused. \nAlso, he's  a team player. He  doesn’t believe he’s  the \nonly guy in  the team and that's really important in \nracing. Sure, he’s lucky to  have Jerry Burgess and the \nteam working with him, like  | was —  because JB's  got so \nmuch experience —  but  he  has  got  a  very good feeling \nfor  the motorcycle. He  understands what's going on \naround him, which is why he tends to  stay on.  A lot of \nguys feel  what's going on  but  they don’t know how to \ntranslate the feeling to their engineers. \nValentino is  at  a  point in  his  career where the \npressure could get to  him, but  even during 2001 when \nthe  pressure was really there, he  was on  top  of  it, he \ndidn’t let  it distract him, so  | don’t think that’s going to \nbe  a  problem. The biggest factor in  his  future is going \nto  be  how long he wants to  continue riding and this  is \nan  issue that Valentino alone will  determine. \nI've  known author Mat Oxley even longer than I've \nknown Valentino, since | first came to  GPs in  ‘89. That \nseason was a bit of a struggle for  me,  but  Mat  was  one \nguy who kept writing that | might have some ability \nlong-term. Since then he’s become one of  the most \nrespected media guys in  the  paddock. He  tells things \nlike  they are; he’s a  straight-shooter. He'll give praise \nwhen it’s  deserved and  criticise when it’s warranted. As \na  rider, you can’t ask  for  more than that. \nMick Doohan \nGold Coast, Australia, May 2002 \n\nWA SES S| STA NT tis aT IS fea) ROSS! QB) INTRODUCTION \nIntroduction \nMotorcycle racing is a  funny old  game. In  fact it is the \nfunny old  game of ‘| can  go faster than you’ amplified to \nthe  nth  degree; grown men risking life and  limb for ego. \nThis book is  about a  man who has played this \ngame like few others, achieving an  extraordinary run  of \nsuccesses while wearing a  smile as  wide as  his  extrava- \ngant racing lines. Valentino Rossi just loves racing \nmotorcycles, and his  infectious enthusiasm for  speed \nand two wheels has transported him into the \nmainstream and helped change the way the world \nlooks at  bike racing. As  someone recently said, Rossi is \nnot  your ‘typical motorcycle racing psychopath’. \nValentino skipped into the World Championship \narena seven years ago as  a  mopheaded teenager. \n‘Who's that girl?’ people asked. Now, as  a bewhiskered \nLondon geezer, his  face is  more recognised than any \nmotorcyclist’s in  history. Rossi has  become GP  racing, \nhe’s a  phenomenon, and yet  he’s a  rider on  a  multi- \nmillion pound salary who still  likes to  muck about with \nthe stickers on  his race bike. That's not  normal. \nValentino keeps it simple, stays true to his roots. He's \na rider who thinks deeply about his racing but  never out- \nthinks himself. His  philosophy is straightforward: think \nhard, have fun. He  isn’t a  desperate trier, he’s  a  natural, \ndoing the  right thing comes easily to  him, whether it's \nriding right or  looking right. The  man understands. \nHe  approaches his  racing. both as  boy and man, \nboth as  art  and science. To  him the  art  of  the  racing \nline is  ‘like a  poem’, which is why he  can magic the \nkind of  lines of  which most racers seem incapable. As \npaddock philosopher Dr  Claudio Costa says: ‘Valentino \nabandons himself to  the  creativity of the  mind so  that \nhe  can  play the  game of  life  according to  the  carefree \nrules of the  child.’ \nAnd yet he  is  almost digitally efficient. ‘The \nweirdest thing that happens to  me  when |'m  racing,’ \nhe says, ‘is that | perceive the  race not  as  a unit but  as  a \nsuccession of  fragments that pass before my  eyes in \nslow motion.’ Which may go  some way to  explaining \nhow he  unerringly applied his  relentless two-year \nprogramme to  deal with the  125, 250 and 500 World \nChampionships; one year to  explore each new class, \none  year to conquer. But  this  season he has  ditched the \ntwo-year plan, dominating the new _ four-stroke \nMotoGP class from the  outset. His  touch, it seems, is \nmore golden than that of King Midas. \nValentino is so  good at  racing, so  good at  life,  that \nhe seems almost too  good to  be true, like  the  invention \nof  some Hollywood scriptwriter with a  Superman \ncomplex who writes an  impossible amount of  genius \nand nobility into his  male lead. Of  course, Rossi isn’t \nSuperman, he just likes to  dress that way sometimes... \nMat Oxley \nLondon, England, May 2002 \n\nValentino has done a \nbit of  growing up \nover the past few \nyears, revealing a \nmore contemplative \nside. (Gold &  Goose) \neo: \n7 \n4 \n= \nne \nae \nea \n\nVEEN TiN @ ross!) 14 Es NEO IN ie} Aes: \nRossi mania grabbed me  for  the  first time during the \n1979 British GP  at  Silverstone. Standing at  Stowe \nCorner amongst the crumpled beer cans, | watched \nGraziano Rossi lay waste to  the 250 pack, his  extrava- \ngant style and the speed of  his  lovely Morbidelli \nmoving him well clear of  that year’s world champ, \nKawasaki's Kork Ballington. With just three corners to \ngo  he  had stretched his  advantage to  an  unbeatable \n2.5  seconds. Then he crashed. \nAs  a  reckless 20-year-old | thought that was pretty \ncool —  chucking away a  surefire win like  he just didn’t \ncare. Why slow down just because you can almost \ntaste the  champagne? Rossi was a  motorcycle racer \ndoing what he  thought he  was paid to  do:  going as \nfast as  he possibly could, from green light to chequered \nflag. Silverstone should've been his  fourth win of  the \nyear, instead it  was the last time he  got close to \nwinning a  grand prix. \nPapa Rossi also looked pretty damn fly,  like  Jesus, \nonly much faster. His  leathers and helmet were white, \nrent through by a  zigzag lightning streak of  red  and \ngreen for  the  Italian tricolor, and his  shoulder-length \nhair whipped around from beneath his  helmet. But  it \nwasn't a  dodgy haircut, Rossi was way too  cool, way \ntoo charismatic, to  ever look wrong. In fact, he  was so \nright that | used to  spend evenings doing sketches of \nmy  own Rossi-replica leathers and helmet, which | kind \nof knew I'd  never get around to owning. \nRossi retired a few  years later, a nasty bump on  the \nhead forcing an  end to  a  career that never made the \nmost of  his  intelligence and riding talent. He  faded \nfrom my  memory after | started racing, still  without \n\nGRAND PRU \nCESKE REPUBL \nBrno 1997 \nthose red,  white and  green leathers. Twelve years later | \nspotted him off  a  bike for  the  first time, not  counting \nthat moment he’d parted company with his  Morbidelli \nat  Silverstone. During the  summer of  ‘91  | was in  the \nAdriatic resort of  Rimini doing a  story on  Italy's latest \ncraze, minimoto racing, and  there he was, stood by the \ntrack beneath the  floodlights (it was almost midnight), \nwatching intently. | went over to  shake his  hand, to tell \nhim he'd been a  hero of mine and  to  ask  him  what he \nwas doing at some dodgy minimoto track in the  middle \nof the  night. Rossi pointed into  the  gloom, at a  midget \nfigure circulating the midget racetrack on  a  midget \nbike. ‘Is my  son, Valentino,’ he grinned. ‘Good to  meet \nyou,’ | replied, and not  wanting to  cause any  further \nembarrassment to  either of us,  | made my  excuses and \nleft papa and bambino to  themselves, never thinking \nI'd see  them again. \nOf  course, | got to  see plenty of  them, we  all  did. \nOver the  next decade the  little kid  would grow into a \nbig kid,  dazzling pretty much the  whole world with his \nspeed and charisma, his  ever so  slightly eccentric dad \nalong for  the  ride, eschewing flash hotels to  sleep in \nthe  back of his  BMW. \nIt wouldn't be  too  much of an  exaggeration to  say \nthat Valentino Rossi has  changed the face of grand prix \nracing; certainly no  other bike racer has  ever got closer \nto  being a  pop  star. And his actual racing achievements \nare  awe-inspiring, history-making stuff: first GP  win  at \nthe  age of  17, first world title at  18,  another title at 20, \n10 \nhis  first 500 win a  few months after his  21st birthday, \nand  the  500  World Championship a year later. He’s the \nfourth youngest rider to  have worn the  500  crown, the \nyoungest man to  have won three world titles and at \nthe  age  of just 23  he’s  already well into  the  top ten  all- \ntime GP winners’ list. \nHis  progress has  been so  relentless that it smacks \nof  the automaton sportsman —   grim-faced, head \ndown, no  thought for  anything but  total victory —  and \nyet  each and every one of  his  successes has been \nachieved with a joy that never fails to touch everyone's \nheart. ‘Valentino likes to  win, he’s a  great fighter,’ says \nhis  engineer Jerry Burgess, who's worked closely with \nthe  youngster since the end of  1999. ‘But he  also \nknows we're in the  entertainment business, so  he  likes \nto  entertain.’ \nEven back in  his  125 and 250 days his  infectious \nenthusiasm was breaking the sport to  whole new \naudiences, amongst them the Valenteenyboppers, \ngangs of Italian schoolgirls drawn to  racetracks by their \nheart-throb's pretty blue eyes. Valentino doesn’t appre- \nciate that kind of  attention though because he’s a bit \nof a  biking purist. ‘They’re not  fans of Rossi the  motor- \ncycle racer, but  just because I've  got  blue eyes, | don't \nlike,’ he  says with faint exasperation after years spent \nfleeing these seething ranks of  moist, pubescent Latin \nlovelies. ‘It's  good to  have one  or  two nice girls chasing \nyou, but not one thousand.’ That's what he  says, but \nyou wonder if  he  really means it  once you've been \n\nGraziano’s \ninfluence on his \nson has been \nimmeasurable, all \nthe way from \nriding bicycles... \n(Rossi family \narchive) \n11 \n\nAE TEAST PN ed ross!) iu Ee Ne MEE NO a  ee SesSar \ninside his  motorhome, watching him and constant \ncompanion Uccio Salucci giggling madly as  they field \nlewd text messages from female admirers. \nFor  all  his  talent and his  charm Rossi is a  sponsors’ \ndarling, and yet  he stays true to  himself, tells it like  it is, \nhe  doesn't do  PR  spew. Like he’s never afraid to  voice \nhis dislike of  bitter-rival Max Biaggi and _ that's \nsomething in  GP  racing, where everyone has  got  into \nthe habit of  ‘sugaring each others’ asses’, as  former \n500  champ King Kenny Roberts once put  it. \nValentino knows how to  make people laugh too. \nPerhaps his  cheesiest post-race celebrations have been \na  mite overdone but  he was pure comedy at Jerez ‘99, \ndumping his  Aprilia RSW250 halfway around the \nvictory lap and diving into a  marshals’ trackside \nPortaloo, emerging seconds later to  150,000 fans \ngoing off their nuts. \nSo what has  he got that other racers haven't? He's a \nphenomenon, the  leader of  a  new breed of  cool GP \nracer, a  bright, enlightened 21st century version of the \n12 \npDaptism \nthe world of \nP  racing and \ntill there. \n<eulemans) \nmacho hell-raisers of  old. Maybe there's never been a \nrider who combines such warmth of character with so \nmuch natural talent, raw bravery and tireless dedication. \nTo  dissect and understand the  Rossi phenomenon \nwe should begin by  looking further back than his \nimmediate genes. We  must look to  where he  comes \nfrom, because his  national culture is just as  important \nas  his  inherited family characteristics. Italy is the  heart \nand soul of  motorsport, Italians are obsessed with \nspeed, and when it  comes to  racing as  romance, \nthey're the  kings, from Ducati to  Ferrari, from Agostini \nto  Nuvolari, from Monza to the  Mille Miglia. \nItaly's record of bike racing glory is beyond compare. \nDuring 53  years of motorcycle grand prix  racing, Italian \nriders have scored almost twice as  many 125, 250 and \n500 grand prix victories as  any  other nation. By the  end \nof  the 2001 season, Italians had won 491 GPs, the \nBritish are  next with 276 victories, then the  Americans \n(169), the  Japanese (149) and the  Spanish (139). \nValentino is  just the latest in  a  long lineage of \n\nracetrack conquerors that goes way back to  the  pre- \nwar exploits of  Tazio Nuvolari (the grand prix car \nlegend who started out on  bikes) and thence to  1950 \n500 World Champion Umberto Maseti, Sixties’ and \nSeventies’ heroes Giacomo Agostini, Walter Villa and \nRenzo Pasolini, Eighties’ 500 World Champions Marco \nLucchinelli and Franco Uncini, and current names like \nBiaggi, Loris Capirossi and  Manuel Poggiali. \nSo  from where do  the Italians get  their lust for \nspeed, what are  its  roots? Their passion goes back to \nthe  start of the  20th century, to  the  earliest days of the \nmotor industry when Italy fell  head over heels in  love \nwith the  machine and  the  future that machines might \noffer. Futurism was an  Italian cultural phenomenon, \nfuelled by the  birth of the  new technological society, a \nnew age of  noise and speed: aeroplanes, cars, motor- \ncycles and telecommunications. ‘We declare that the \nworld’s splendour has  been enriched by a  new beauty: \nthe  beauty of speed,’ proclaimed Italy's 1909 manifesto \nof  Futurism. ‘A  racing motor car, its  frame adorned \nwith great pipes, like  snakes with explosive breath...a \nroaring motor car,  which seems to  run  on  shrapnel... \nOkay, so  they were getting a  bit  carried away but  you \ncan see  what they meant, and it’s  no  different now; in \nBritain people hate noisy cars and bikes, in  Italy they \nlove ‘em. \nOfficially sanctioned long-distance street races, \nroaring from one town to  the  next, exploded across \nItaly during the  1920s as  the  nation’s big  five motor- \ncycle factories (the so-called Pentarchia of  Benelli, \nBianchi, Garelli, Gilera) and Guzzi) fought for \nsupremacy in the  showrooms by fighting for supremacy \non  the  ‘racetracks’. Such was the  national passion for \nthese often lethal events that Italy was the last \nContinental nation to  ban racing on  public roads. Italy's \npowered two-wheeler industry really took off  after the \nSecond World War when the rapidly industrialising \nnation needed to get the  largely peasant workforce out \nof  the villages and into the factories. The workers \nrequired transport but  cars were beyond their meagre \n13 \n\nwages, so  the  scooter was born. Lambretta and Vespa \nwere both established in  1946, and four years later \nDucati and Aermacchi joined the  race for  mobilisation. \nAs  sales boomed, so  did  the  race scene. Most of the \nmanufacturers were enthusiastic in  their involvement \nand naturally signed local riders who could communi- \ncate with their engineers and promote sales in  the  all- \nimportant home market, as  Biaggi and Rossi did  so  well \nfor  Aprilia half  a  century later. (It is no  coincidence that \nthe  vast majority of  Britain’s 276 GP  successes were \nachieved when the  country had  a  motorcycle industry.) \nIt  is  more difficult to  ponder exactly when the \nItalians first fell  in  love with engineering and maybe it \nwould be  pushing the  point to  speculate that the  first \nSparks were ignited by  Leonardo da  Vinci and the \nRenaissance way back in  the  15th and 16th centuries. \nOr  maybe not, for  Italy has been renowned for  its \nartisans ever since. The metal workers who toiled at \nEnzo Ferrari's first workshops, for example, were \ncraftsmen continuing Modena’s centuries-old reputa- \ntion for  skilled manufacture of just about anything in \nmetal. Of  course, there are  other less  complex reasons \nfor  Italy's ongoing motorcycling success story, like  the \nfact that the  sun  shines a  whole lot  more down there \nthan it does in northern Europe. \nWhatever, Valentino's Italian blood is a  major factor \nin his success, in all  kinds of ways. He  has that Latin lust \nfor  life  and a  sunny, catholic attitude, he’s enthusiastic, \n(D \nJ \n14 \n\n\n\nBees rsa \nBe NG Mere Ne @ \nle \n: \nE \n® \n5 \n16 \n\nVAS LE Noh iN ross! |) it fe SNe UME NG: fe  Ors S| \nloquacious and determined to  have fun, even though \nhe’s involved in  a  deadly serious business. His  attitude \nto  life  and to  racing demands inevitable comparisons \nwith that of  Mick Doohan, the man who dominated \n500 GPs when Valentino was riding 125s and 250s, \nand whose team he  inherited after the  Australian quit \nracing at the  end  of 1999. \nIn fact, ‘The Doctor’ and ‘Mighty Mick’ have little in \ncommon, apart from their blinding talent to  ride a \nmotorcycle faster than anyone else on  this planet. \nDoohan was a driven man, to the  scariest of degrees, he \nused to  go  racing like  there were demons chasing him, \nand  if he ever slowed down, they'd have him. There was \na  terrorised urgency to  his  riding, he  forced the  bike \ndown into corners, hunched over the front like some \nkind of desperado; ‘all  prick and  ribs  like a drover's dog’, \nas  the  Aussies would say. Who knows what drove him, \nbut the  inside of a  racer’s head is a strange place: weird \nforces driving weird psyches to  take weird risks, and \nmaybe the  pain that cut  right through his injury-blighted \ncareer coloured his  temperament. Valentino (so far, \ntouch wood, relatively unscarred by  racing) doesn’t \nseem to  possess that kind of mildly psychotic inner self \nand  really does look like  he’s  having fun  on  the  bike; he \nlooks more natural, more fluid, more smooth. Off  track \nhe appears remarkably well adjusted, with few obvious \nsigns of that often ruinous desperation to  prove himself \nbigger and braver than everyone else, which is  the \ndefining behavioural characteristic of  so  many racers. \nMostly he just seems to be having a ball. \n‘I've always said Mick enjoyed winning and \nValentino enjoys racing,’ adds Burgess, who previously \nguided Doohan to  his five  500  crowns. ‘If Valentino has \na  great race and  finishes second, he’s  disappointed but \nhe’s  not  angry with the  world like  Mick used to  be, he's \nnot  going to tear your head off.’ \nFormer journalist Barry Coleman, who covered the \nWorld Championships when Rossi senior was racing, \nknows from where he  got those characteristics. \n‘Graziano was anything but  a typical motorcycle racing \npsychopath,’ Coleman recalls. ‘He’s a  marvellous man \nand it’s  inevitable that Valentino has  taken a  lot  from \nhaving a dad like that. Valentino recently said: “I'm just \na fan  on  a bike”, and | think that’s exactly how he is.’ \nToo true, Vale (as mates call him, pronounced \n‘Valay’) was a  dedicated GP  anorak long before he \nStarted racing, with an  encyclopaedic knowledge of \nriders’ helmet designs, numbers and liveries. One of  his \nearliest visits to  a  GP  is  burned into his  memory, as  it \nwould be  in the  mind of any  ordinary race fan. ‘The first \nGP  | remember going to  see  was Mugello '91,’ he  says. \n‘| used to  watch all  the races on  TV,  so  | knew all  the \nriders’ numbers, all  their helmet designs, the whole \ncircus. | was with Gibo (Badioli, old family friend and \nnow his manager) and Graziano. We parked the \ncamper at  Casanova Savelli (a  daunting, downhill \nright-left flick where his fan  club now camps out) and | \nremember very well the 125 race with Ueda, with \nnumber 56  and the  green and blue Hero Sports Honda, \nfighting with Capirossi and Gresini.’ This is not  normal. \nMost riders hold zero interest in  other racers, except \ntheir direct competitors, but Valentino really is  an \nenthusiast. He  can  even recognise a  journalist's helmet \ndesign. When | was researching this  book he  grabbed \nmy  lid  and said: ‘Yes, | remember your helmet from \nwhen | was a  boy reading Motosprint [Italy's biking \nweekly], didn't you have a  big accident one day, going \nunder a  truck?’ Well, yes, | did. So  what can we  tell \nfrom this? That he’s bright, that he’s got a  good \nmemory, but  most of all  that he’s  interested in ordinary \npeople, which Is a serious rarity in the  me-me-me world \nof GP  racing. Some top-line racers show less  interest in \npeople like  us  than some folk might in their dustman. \nHe  is even aware that it's  pretty weird having his \nbiography published when he's only 23  (in  fact this is \nthe  fourth Rossi book in  as  many summers). ‘Yes,’ he \ngrins. ‘Is  strange, but | don’t take it serious, it's  not \npossible to  take everything serious, in  life  or  in  racing. \nIf possible | take it with a smile, it makes life easier.’ \nValentino's uncomplicated, unaffected, unpreten- \ntious attitude to   life and racing is  everything. \nNowadays, GPs are more intense, if  less lethal, than \nthey've ever been. Track safety may be better than ever \nbut  the  danger is still  there, and grand prix  riders tend \nto  crash more often these days, because the  demands \nand rewards of World Championship racing drive them \nto  exist on  the outer extremes of  traction. Some \ncrashes hurt more than others; very few don’t hurt at \n17 \n\ndown, Vi \nwalks to work, \n<P ready to  shut out \nthe madness that \nfills his off-track \nlife.

Highsides (racing's equivalent of  flinging yourself \nout of  a  speeding express train) hardly ever happen \nwithout a subsequent visit to  Dr Claudio Costa's Clinica \nMobile for  a  dose of  mesotherapy, a  local pain-relief \ntherapy that can require more than 100 micro-injec- \ntions. As  Valentino says: ‘| have very much fear of the \nmesotherapy needle. Of  course, I’m scared about \ngetting hurt, but  what am  | going to  do,  lock myself in \na  room and be happy being safe?’ \nThe further psychological pressures on  top riders \nare  crushing, impossible to  overestimate, and come \nfrom every direction —   from the factory, from the \nsponsors, from the team, from the media, from the \nfans and, of course, from inside the  rider himself. Sure, \nthere’s harder ways to  make a living, but  when these \nguys aren’t on  the  bike they're huddled for  hours in \ndebriefing sessions with their engine, chassis and tyre \nengineers, surrounded by  the flicker of  computer \nmonitors and the  whirr-whirr of  hard drives. And if \nthey're not  doing that, they're being gushed over by \ntheir sponsors, suffocated by the  fans or  harangued by \nthe  media. Racing becomes a chore. \nWhich is  why so  many modern-day riders are \nanything but  a  bundle of laughs. In TV  interviews they \nstare at  the camera, mouthing weary platitudes \nbecause their minds are  burdened by  some hi-tech \nconundrum: transient engine behaviour, high-speed \nrebound damping curves and data-logging outputs. \nValentino seems to  be  one of  the  few top guys who \nrossi (4) iL rie N   OM EBN o \nA  eS St \nhas  this sorted. By keeping the  joy,  he  rides at  his  very \nbest. He  rides fast because he wants to,  because It’s  a \nblast. Many of his  rivals have let the  serious stuff get to \nthem, so  they've stopped having fun, so  they struggle \nto  be as  quick, week in, week out. \nBack in  bike racing’s so-called golden days —  the \nFifties, Sixties and Seventies —  GP  racers were fast- \nliving, up-for-a-laugh daredevils, apparently able to win \nraces with inspired, risk-taking heroics. Back then \nracing was an  art  and racers behaved accordingly: out \non  the  piss, sniffing and snorting their way through \nranks of glamorous shags. \nIt’s  not  like  that anymore. Racing at  grand prix level \nis now a science and racers are  the  front-line laboratory \ntroops, they just wear leathers instead of  white lab \ncoats. It’s  not  only about white-knuckle, devil-may-care \nrisk  taking anymore, nowadays racing is  a  cold and \nprecise science —  a  giant, globally televised physics \nexperiment. Sure, racers need balls just as  much as  they \never did, but  only as  much as  they need to  understand \nthe science of  it  all.  Sixties’ legend Mike Hailwood, \nwho like  Valentino won his  first 500 crown at  the  age \nof  22,  was happily technophobic. Vale may not  be  a \nrocket scientist but  he  needs to  be able to  discuss deep \ntechnical concepts with his  crew for  hours and hours. \nAs  King Kenny Roberts puts it:  ‘People say  the riders \naren't the  same fun  guys they used to  be,  well, they \ndon’t have the time to  be, that’s the  whole thing.’ \nThere is a  parallel here with the  USAF's jet-fighter \n\nWA SG UTES IS  ae {PINS} rposs!(A) it \ntest pilots, as  described in  Hunter S.  Thompson's book \nThe Great Shark Hunt. The gun-totin’ acid casualty \nauthor talks of how, during the  Sixties, the  USAF devel- \noped ‘a computerised version of the  legendary, hell-for- \nleather test  pilot’, banishing the  old  ‘kick the  tyre, light \nthe  fire  and away we  go’  heroes of  old. He  goes on: \n‘the best pilot in the  world —  even if he  could land a  B- \n52  on  the  number eight green at  Pebble Beach without \ntaking a  divot —  would be  useless on  a  test-flight \nproject unless he could explain, in a written report, just \nhow and  why the  landing could be made.’ \nIt's  the  same with modern racers —  GP  bikes are  so \nhi-tech that riders must be  able to  describe machine \nbehaviour in   acute detail, then analyse potential \nimprovements with their technicians. And there's \nanother link  between old  fliers and  GP  racers. Thompson \ndescribes how USAF test  pilots used to  get their off-duty \nkicks on  terra firma around their base in  the Mojave \ndesert: ‘back in the  good old  days, when men were men \nand might was right and the devil took the hindmost, \nthe  peaceful desert highways were raceways for off-duty \npilots on  big  motorcycles. Slow-moving travellérs were \nfrequently blown off  the road by  wildmen in  leather \njackets and  white scarves, human torpedoes defying all \n20 \na1 INS Me INL at ie) tS) 47 \nspeed limits and  heedless of their own safety.’ \nNot  any  more, when he revisited the  base years later \nThompson found the USAF appalled at  the idea of \nanything as  fun and as  dangerous as  a  motorcycle. \n‘Today's pilots go  to  bed early, and regard big  motor- \ncycles with the  same analytical disdain they have for \nhippies, winos and  other failure symbols. They take their \nrisks, On  assignment, between dawn and 4.30pm’. In \nGP  racing, it’s Sundays between noon and 3pm. \nThat's exactly what Valentino found when he came to \nGPs in  1996. If  Doohan had raised dedication and \ncommitment to  a  new level, the  Australian’s psychotic \napproach to  racing had transformed paddock atmos- \nphere. Mighty Mick was breaking everyone's balls \n(including his own), he brought withering aggression and \nunrelenting pressure to  his  racing, because that’s what he \nneeded to  win. And he  was so  successful that everyone \nmimicked his  attitude until the  paddock became almost \nunbearably intense. Valentino wanted to  change all that, \nhe  couldn't imagine going racing and not  having fun, \nhe'd hate it, what'd be the  point? So he changed things. \n‘When | came to  GPs all  the  riders were very, very \nserious,’ he  recalls. ‘So  when | started winning, me  and \nmy  friends decided we  should try  to  make some big \n\nVASE Ee Net IN \nfun. We  just wanted to  do  something new to  show the \nbig  emotion of  winning races. The ideas usually came \nto  us  In  a  bar  in  Tavullia at  two in  the  morning! They \nwere just a game, just some fun  with my  fan  club.’ \nFrom the  Portaloo gag  to the  prank with the  blow-up \ndoll, through his  entire alter ego wardrobe from Robin \nHood to Superman, and  through his numerous Madonna- \nlike makeovers from girly mophead to   bearded \nragamuffin via  skinhead and  trance cadet, Valentino tells \nthe  world that he  likes a  laugh. It’s  all  just good fun, \nthough there's little doubt there's an  element of palliative \nhere, as  if to ward off the  round-the-clock stress that gets \nto  many big-time riders. By halfway through a  GP  season \nsome riders look burned out and ground down, but \nValentino counteracts the pressure, even though, or \nperhaps because, he’s the  most sought after of  all,  his \nevery step dogged by a  ravenous pack of  Italian media, \nshades on,  notebooks in hand, pretending to  be his mate. \nNo  motorcycle racer has  ever been bigger than Rossi, \nnot  even glam Seventies’ superstar Barry Sheene who was \nrossi A) 1 mS GuMie Nee AoOrs' SI \nfamously namechecked in  a  top-ten hit.  He  is,  if you like, \nthe  David Beckham of  bikes and, like  Becks, he  pays a \nhigh price for  his  fame having crossed over into the \nmainstream. Like Becks and Andre Agassi, he’s the  guy \nwho transcended his  sport's own territory, because he \ndoesn’t only appeal to  blokes. The ladies, the  Valenteenies \nand  the  kids  love him  too; so  these days whole families sit \ndown to watch GP  racing like  never before. \nValentino arrived at  the pinnacle of  his  sport with \nimpeccable timing, for motorcycle racing needed \nsomeone with mainstream pulling power if  it  was to \nthrust itself into  the  global consciousness. Like any  other \n21st century sport, bike racing is  a commodity that has  to \nbe sold to  as  many consumers as  possible, and  Valentino's \nsweet, smiling face is  exactly what the  sport, and the \ncorporations behind it, were looking for,  the  weapon that \nwould fire  their products deep into the  wish lists of \nconsumers. Indeed, there’ve been times over the  last  few \nyears when it appears that Rossi is grand prix racing, he  is \nits sun, the  rest  of the show just orbits around him. \n21 \n\nVIA EINGia IN@ \nAs  a  result, his  life is  barely his  own these days, \nindeed he  is  so  popular at  home that he’s had to  exile \nhimself to  London. The pressures of  celebrity really \negan to  bite  home as  he strode towards the  500  title  in \n2001. Battered by the  incessant demands of the  media, \nhis sweet nature hardened somewhat, the  perma-grin of \nhis  125 and 250 years buckled; it  had to  if he  was to \npreserve his  sanity. And he  gave up  his  more outlandish \npost-race celebrations. This, after all,  is what we  do  to \nthe celebrities we adore. We squeeze out of  them \nexactly what it  is  that we  love within them, as  Oscar \nWilde once observed, we  kill  the  things we  love. \nEven so,  Valentino is still  as  at  ease with his  mind- \nboggling fame as  it's  possible to  be.  And in  that sense \nhe’s the  very opposite of  his  predecessor Doohan, who \ncouldn't help but look agonisingly, but endearingly, \nawkward whenever thrust into the  limelight outside of \nhis  helmet. Doohan, you see, never crossed into the \nmainstream, never ever wanted to.  Roberts again: ‘The \nthings that make Valentino popular are  also the  things \nthat make life  hard for  him. If you’re only a  good motor- \noy \n22 \nross! (4) le) Bs \neae iN) @  Mire Nie \nAOS si \ncycle racer it’s  one thing, but  the  more your face gets \nsplashed around the place for selling sunglasses, \nwatches and stuff like  that, the  more problems you're \ngoing to  have. For  every plus there’s a  minus, and the \nmore pluses, the  more minuses. That's the way the world \nworks, we  didn’t invent it, we  just have to  live  in it.’ \nThe  devastating demands of riding the  fastest bikes \non  earth have also made their mark. Like Doohan, \nEighties’ 500 king Eddie Lawson and many others \nbefore him, Valentino's face has  aged rapidly since he \nmoved on  from 250s: the  cheeks more hollow, the  eyes \nmore sunken, the  look a little more haunted. That's \nwhat 200 horsepower motorcycles do to  you. \nAnd yet despite the  pressurised lifestyle, both on  an \noff  the  track, he  obviously does love what he’s doing, \nand like  Becks, he’s  fully aware of the  Faustian contract \nhe’s  made with fame. ‘For  sure there is more good than \nbad  to  being famous,’ says Rossi with a  glint in  his  eye. \n‘The bad  thing Is the  stress.

Since he  moved to  London \nVale has  revealed a  growing love for the  ‘F’  word, deliv- \nered with an  Italian intonation, like ‘sack!’. The word \nobviously doesn’t hold the  same sting for  him that it \ndoes for  some Anglo-Saxons; presumably it’s  the  Latin \nderivative of the  Gaelic ‘Feck’... \nAmidst the madness Valentino keeps it  real by \nsurrounding himself with mates, most of  whom he's \nknown since they got together to  make some mischief \nin  primary school. He  doesn’t do  the  celebrity circuit. \nHis  thick-as-thieves Latin homies call  themselves the \nTavullia Chihuahua (Tavullia, his  hometown in  Italy, the \nChihuahua, a   tribe of   North American Indians), \nalthough, of  course, this is  only the inner sanctum; \nAprilia weren't slow \nto use Valentin \nstar qualit \nscooters. ‘l’d dc \nanything \nSR,’ says \nSNM) EIN) A@ ss \nwhen Vale wrapped up  the  500 title in  Australia ,  more \nthan 2000 Tavullians stayed up  partying until 6am, \nwatching the  race on  a  big  screen in  the  town piazza \nNo  wonder he cherishes the  anonymity of London \nFormer 500 champion Kevin Schwantz, whom \nmany older fans see  as  a  kind of proto-Rossi because he \nshares a  similar attitude to  life  and racing, remembers \nthe  stresses of racing being one  of the  hardest things to \nhandle during his years at the  top. ‘l always found there \nwas so  much pressure, and a lot  of it self-inflicted,’ says \nthe  ‘93  champ. ‘You put  so  much pressure on  yourself \nto  be  the  best that you've got  to  keep telling yourself \nthat it's  fun, because if it ever quits being fun  it's  really \nnot  worth it,  because however much you're making, \nthere's a  lot  on  the  line, you could get  hurt in  nothing \nflat. When | wasn’t liking it anymore, | decided to  stop. \nThe  thing with Rossi is that he’s having fun, so  he’s  out \non  the  track every time wringing the  bike’s neck, trying \nto get everything he can  out  of it.’ \nFellow American Roberts, who went on  to  become \na  successful team owner after winning his  three 500 \n23 \n\nVOR ENT Nc rossi(@) it EN GME sis \ntitles, agrees with Schwantz. ‘I  think Rossi's secret is \npretty simple,’ he  says. ‘It  looks to  me  like  he’s loving it, \nhe’s happy to  be  out there. He  doesn’t play mind \ngames, he  loves riding the  motorcycle, and he  rides it \nright. That’s a  hard combination to  beat; then when \nyou get the best rider on  the best bike, that’s a  hard \ncombination to  beat, too. If he  keeps going like  this, \nset  a  lot  of  records and be  one of  the  best, for \nsure. He's is  definitely up  there, but  only time will  tell  if \nhe’s the greatest ever. The only thing that could \nhappen is  that he'll get  burned out, but | don’t see \nthat, he’s having more fun  than anyone.’ \nAnd yet, is  this impression of  a  straightforward \nyoung man having a  ball  the  real  Valentino? Maybe not \nentirely, believes Giampiero Sacchi, the urbane Italian \nmanager who brought the  mop-haired 16-year-old into \nGP  racing back in  1996. ‘The Valentino concept is this,’ \nsays Sacchi. ‘He  wants other people to  think that he’s \njust having fun but  for  sure he’s not  just having fun, \ninside he’s  saying: ‘You think I'm  just crazy but  I’m  not’. | \nthink this is  the  key  to  understanding Valentino; you \nwatch him  and it looks like  he’s  just  having fun, but  if \nyou  watch him  more carefully you  realise there's nothing \ncasual about what he  does, everything happens for  a \nreason, his  is a  very studied performance, he’s thinking \nabout all the  details, all the  time.’ In other words, there's \na fair dose of cunning in his make-up. Of course there is, \nno  guileless rider ever won a world championship. \nNo  wimp ever won a  World Championship either, \nhe’ \nAOS S11 \nso  how come someone so  apparently sweet-natured as \nValentino has  carved such a  swathe through the  sport? \nBike racing is a vicious game, and  while he isn’t  the  kind \nof  rider who strikes fear into rivals by  riding out of \ncontrol, there's no  doubt that he  takes no  shit from \nanyone when he’s on  the  racetrack. Scary aggression, \nintimidation and a  bit  of  argy-bargy are  all  part of \nracing. ‘GP riders don't mind riding into each other,’ \nsays Jeremy McWilliams, a  stubborn rival during \nValentino's ride to  his  first 500 win at  the  2000 British \nGP.  ‘You want to  pass as  cleanly as  possible, but if \nyou're getting frustrated and it’s  the  last  lap, you ride \ninto  the  guy. And it helps if you’ve got a  bit of a  reputa- \ntion for  being crazy. You need to  stamp your authority \non  the  other guys when you're making a move.’ \nPeople love Valentino because he’s capable of \nracing hard, working hard and enjoying himself. His \nrivals also work hard but  most of them have forgotten \nhow to  get their kicks out  of what they're doing. Work \nhard, play hard isn’t a new concept but  it’s  a  concept \nlost on  many of  today’s richly rewarded sports stars, \nwhether they're Formula One drivers, tennis players or \nbike racers. And there's something deeply unattractive \nabout watching someone getting paid serious money \nfor  doing what they love and yet  remaining so  deter- \nminedly miserable. Vale could never do  that, whatever \nthe  hours he  puts into his  racing. ‘And he  really does \nwork at  it, more than | ever did,’ agrees Doohan. ‘He's \nin  the  garage till  all  hours of the  night, going through \n\n\n\nV  AOE VIN Tl ING ross!

During his  first year in  500s, Valentino badly \noverslept at  the  Catalan GP  missing half of  morning \npractice. ‘When | wake up  | always have a  big confusion \nfor  the  first five  minutes,’ he  says in  mitigation. ‘Then | \nremember: “Oh fack, I’m  at world grand prix!”.’ \nFew club racers are  that laidback and his  horizontal \ndemeanour once again contrasts vividly with Doohan, \nwho, you just know, would've been a  very different \nperson on  race mornings, awakening like  some psycho \nout of  a  dodgy Hollywood thriller, lying rigid on  his \nback, eyes twitching from tight shut to  wild stare in, \nwell, the  blink of an  eye. \nBurgess remembers the Catalunya incident. ‘He \narrived in the  pits in a state of shock, he’d never missed a \npractice session in his life.  When he was  at Aprilia his chief \nmechanic always went down to his motorhome and woke \nhim  up,  So  now it’s me  that goes and  knocks on  the  door.’ \nBurgess has  always known how to  extract the  best \nfrom his  riders. Before Valentino and Doohan, the \nAussie helped Freddie Spencer and Wayne Gardner to \nworld titles during the Eighties. He  expects 100 per \ncent commitment both on  and off  the  track, and when \nhe doesn’t get  it, he  tells them exactly what he thinks. \nSome other crew chiefs won't do that, they're too  wary \nof  destabilising their riders. There's no  doubt that the \nBurgess tough love has  played its  part in  Valentino's \nretire to \nand watc \nworld go by \nof the tov \nalready as \nits home-gr« \nhero. (M \nrecent successes, and yet  Burgess is  clever enough to \nrealise that his  rider wouldn't react well to  regimenta \ntion. ‘Valentino is  Valentino, and if you kill  that off  you \nmay kill  off the  goose that lays the  golden egg,’ he \nsays. ‘You've got to  let  him be  himself, he  certainly \ndoesn’t clown around in  testing and he’s always well \napplied in  practice. In  that way he’s like Mick, you \nnever see  him just riding around, he's on  it  every lap. \nHe  does his  own thing after races, but | don’t think \nthat affects him, he’s  just enjoying himself.’ \nValentino's character still  shines through when he's \ngetting messy at a  Sunday night victory party. At  Rio  2001, \nwhere he wrapped up  the  last-ever 500 title, he  was the \nstar  attraction at  a Honda celebration party. Sharing a  table \nwith mate Marco Melandri, Valentino refused to  hog the \nlimelight, instead turning it on  Honda's even-younger guns \n—  the  Spanish Telefonica Junior team of  teen heroes Toni \nElias, Daniel Pedrosa and Juan Olive. He  invited them to  his \ntable to give them a first  lesson in  heavy drinking, perching \nuncomfortably on  the  corner of  his  chair while Elias \nenjoyed the  comfy part of  the  seat. That's not  normal \nbehaviour for  a World Champion —  most racers are  takers, \nnot givers. They say  that nice guys don’t win World \nChampionships but  Vale does seem to  be  an  exception. \nHe’s  a  giver not  a taker, which is why he takes the  trouble \nto entertain his fans. Cynics may say  that’s all guile to  raise \nhis profile, and sure there's guile in there, but  most of all it’s \nyouthful joie de vivre; boys just wanna have fun... \n27 \n\nlays the © \n=JUlale tions of his. \ngenius at  a local \n“minimoto track. \n(Rossi archive) \n\nTavullia is  your typical sleepy little Italian town, the \ndusty tranquillity rent asunder by  an  ancient Vespa \nStruggling up  the  hill,  its  gnarled owner hunched over \nthe cockpit, fag hanging from his  mouth as  he’s \nswamped by a  gang of grinning scooter kids, all  knees, \nelbows and dodgy riding styles. \nThe town is  perched on  the spur of  a  hill  a  few \nmiles inland from the  Adriatic and is  reached by the \nkind of twisting country lanes that can  give youngsters \na  taste for  speed, the  lanes down which cops used to \nchase Rossi and his  gang of grinning scooter kids. \nLike most of  Italy the  place is  steeped in  history. \nTavullia’s hillside location made it an  important vantage \npoint during the  conflicts that raged throughout the \npeninsula in the  centuries that preceded Italian unitica- \ntion in  1871.

A  rusting Lambretta lies  on  its  side in \none corner of  the garden, but there are  few other \nsigns that this is the  home of  Italy’s greatest motorcy- \ncling family. \nGraziano Rossi wasn't as  fast as  his  son, but he \nwas one of  Italy's quickest in  the late Seventies and \nprobably would've gone on  to  win more than just \nthree GPs if  his  career hadn't been blighted by  a \ncouple of  serious concussions. You can’t know \nValentino without knowing his  father; meet Graziano \nand  you  fully understand why Valentino is the  man he \nis)  warmer, smarter and more modest than your \naverage racetrack maniac. Graziano is a  bit  of a  hippy \ntoo, a  bit  of  an  eccentric, renowned for  his  wacky \nhelmet designs, extravagant clothing and the  appar- \nently bizarre habit of sleeping in the  back of his  BMW \nestate when he’s  at the  races. ‘I’m  really proud to  have \nfound the alternative way to  live  at  GPs,’ he  smiles. ‘I \ndon't want to  drive a motorhome, | don’t want to  stay \nin  a  hotel because the  best time to  be  with Valentino \n30 \nRossi @) makina VALE Nil Nee \nis  in  the  evenings, and | can’t stay in  his  motorhome \nbecause he  never goes to  sleep before one.

They were neighbours as  kids \nand got  together when they were teenagers, by which \ntime Graziano had  already discovered his  love of speed \nwhile racing his  mates on  pushbikes. ‘We'd have races \non  the  way home from school and | was the  fastest \ndownhill,’ so  it was only a  matter of  time before he \nwas  scraping around for an  engine. \n‘We had no  money but  my  best friend Valentino \n\nWee METIS) ole if PSI) poss! @) Maxine VAI Ee NG tN @ \nwas a  genius with his  hands, he  got  an  engine from \nhere and a  chassis from there and built our first \nmotocross bike.’ Rossi had wanted to  go  roadracing \nbut his  parents wouldn't sign for his  licence, so  he \nStarted on  the  dirt. ‘For me  roadracing was always the \ndream, it was more colourful, more important and all \nthe real heroes were roadracers, anyone could do \nmotocross.’ \nThe pair worked in  seaside restaurants and hotels \nto  scrape together cash for  their homebuilt racer until \none summer Valentino was drowned in  the  Adriatic. \nGraziano still sheds a  tear at  the memory. ‘Many \npeople think we  christened Valentino because he  was \nborn two days after St Valentine's day, but  he’s named \nafter my  best friend. He’d be  Valentino even if  he'd \nbeen born in December.’ \nRossi started roadracing when he  was 21  and \nquickly established himself, graduating to  GPs within a \nfew seasons. He  enjoyed his  greatest year in  1979, \nwinning his  first GP  in  the former Yugoslavia, four \nmonths after Valentino was born. Stefania gave birth \non  16  February in  Urbino, a  few miles further into the \nDig the leathe \nand the number \nDad rark&4t6 wher! \nhe won his first \nSP in  1979. \nfather, like son \n(Henk Keulemans \nhills from Tavullia. Urbino was also birthplace of  Rafael, \none of the  greatest painters of all  time, and the  walled \nRenaissance city has remained largely unchanged in \nhalf  a  millennium. \nGraziano and Stefania had been \nOctober 1978 when Graziano was recovering from one \nof  his  crashes. The couple divorced in  1990. ‘| think he \nonly married me because he  was confused!’ smiles \nStefania, who's now in  another relationship and has  a \nsecond son, Luca. ‘We met at such a young age, | think \nthat's why it didn't work.’ \nRossi won another two 250 GPs in  ‘79  for  the  local \nMorbidelli factory and was then snatched up  by Suzuki \nto contest the following year's 500 World \nChampionship. But  a  nasty rally car  accident left  him \nnursing head injuries and his  career lost momentum. \nNevertheless he  managed to  get  a  ride with Giacomo \nAgostini’s Marlboro Yamaha team in  1982, which \nended with a  horrific 150mph crash at  Imola. His  career \nwas over. ‘I finish racing because | almost finish to  be \nalive,’ Graziano laughs at  the dark moment, which \nrenowned GP medic Dr  Claudio Costa eased him \nmarried in \n31 \n\n\n\nVA LENT iN @ possi @) Maxine VAL LOE AN 7   il \nthrough. ‘I was in  coma for  half day, | was Dr  Costa's \nfirst  miracle!’ \nThree-times 500 champ King Kenny Roberts \nremembers Rossi fondly, as  a  bit  of  a  crasher. ‘I! recall \none time he  was scaring the  shit out  of  me, and, of \ncourse, he  ended up  in  a  heap. | always knew that \nabout him: “Okay it’s  Rossi, make sure you're not  right \non  his ass  coming out  of this  turn,” you  needed an  exit \nplan, so  | always gave him  room.’ \nSo Graziano was scary, but with a great mind and  a \nheart of  gold, according to  former racing correspon- \ndent Barry Coleman. ‘He  rode like  the  wind and  was a \nliterary man, so  we'd sit  in  his  awning and discuss \nwriters like Alberto Moravia (a  20th century Italian \nnovelist). He’d say  interesting things, like  he’d wonder \nif racing was humane. He  told me  that whenever he \nsaw someone crash he  had  a  huge temptation to  stop \nand help, which he  had to  repress; that’s just too \npeculiar for a racer.’ \nEven if Valentino has  no  more than the  haziest \nmemory of his  father’s career, he  now knows all  about \nwhat Graziano got  up to  on  the  racetrack. When | told \nhim about my  own youthful regard for his  dad, \nValentino wanted to  know why | was  a fan. | said | \nliked the  way Graziano could lead a  GP  by  several \nseconds, then crash on  the last lap. ‘Yes, yes!’ he \nreplied, his  face brightening in  instant recognition. \n‘That’s my father!’. On  balance Valentino has done well \nout of  his  dad, inheriting some good genes and \nbenefiting from an  upbringing rich  in  paternal warmth, \nintelligence and riding tuition. \nValentino had his  first ride on  a  motorcycle when \nhe was two and a bit.  Neither father nor  son  remember \nWhat the  bike was, but  it  came with outrigger safety \nwheels which lasted just three days. Surprise, surprise, \nhe  seemed to  have a  natural gift  for  it.  ‘He  was pretty \ninstinctive from the  start,’ says Graziano, who worked \nas  a  primary school teacher before his  racing career \ntook off.  ‘| was surprised by how little | had  to  explain, \nbut  | now think that kids of that age  have more ability \nthan we  ever imagine.’ \nStefania wasn’t exactly thrilled to  see Valentino \ngetting into bikes but she  too  realised he was a  natural. \n‘| could see  that he  wasn’t dangerous, just from the \nway he was, the  way he  rode and | wasn’t too  protec- \ntive as  a  mother,’ she says. ‘| was a  lot  more worried \nwhen Graziano raced! He  made me  too nervous, so  | \ndidn't go to  many races.’ \nBut  Valentino did  go to  enough races to absorb the \nthrill of speed, colour and noise. Graziano remembers: \n‘After | retired | was friends with riders like (Loris) \nReggiani and (Luca) Cadalora, so  we'd go  to  grands \nprix to  watch them. Valentino's first memories are  of \nthe  paddock and  when he was at  home he played with \nmotorbikes instead of other toys, this  was just  natural, \nhe  was never pushed. Around the  age of four or  five \nhe was very curious and  was surrounded by some great \nriders, so  he’d always ask  2,000 questions to  everyone, \n\nDad Rossi's last \nseason, with \nMarlboro Yamaha \nin  *B2, ended with \na  150m ph crash. \n(Don Morley) \n\nYA LEN TIN © \nas  any kid  would do.  People would disappear if they \nsaw him coming, he  was a  pain in  the ass  at  those \ntimes, but  in general he was a  bright and lovely kid.’ \nAnd pretty soon Valentino was trying to  emulate \nhis  heroes. ‘|  remember my  first big  crash. It was ‘84 \nand I'd  seen Randy Mamola hanging so  far  off  his \nHonda 500  that his  outside foot was off  the  footpeg. | \nwent home and tried to  do  the  same with my  BMX \nbike and had a  highside. Fack, | had  a  huge bruise and \nvery much pain in the  ass.’ \nSo  he was already getting a  kick out  of risk  taking. \nMost kids take risks somehow, it's  one way of  finding \nout  what they can  get  away with and how they relate \nto  the world. One child might slap the face of  a \nplaymate, another might climb a  tree, Rossi did  daft \nthings on  bikes. \nlf  mum wasn’t much worried about their boy \ngetting into motorcycles, Graziano was concerned. So \nhe  built him a  go-kart, and not  just any old  go-kart. \nThe chassis had been designed to  take a  60cc grass- \ncutter motor and a  ten-year-old driver, so  Graziano \nbolted in a  100cc national kart motor and  gave it to  his \nfive-year-old son. It  was, dad remembers, ‘an evil \nthing’, and so  fast that no  one could stay with \nValentino during their outings to  local gravel pits. Here \nthe  gravel-pit gang —  Rossi, Reggiani, Cadalora & Co.  — \nwould race around in  beat-up rally cars, just  for  kicks. \n‘We had old  Ford Escorts and Opel Asconas. We'd race \naround the  pits  and Vale was always faster in  his  kart. \nPm  OSS @) MAKING \nVOX Ee Nitin G \nThe ground was great for  learning, not  so  much grip so \nhe'd be sideways all the  time.’ \nBoth Rossis have a  passion for  rallying and the \ngravel-pit gang still  hang together today. ‘We still  go \nvery often,’ says dad. ‘Me, Aldo (Drudi, racing's \nfavourite graphic designer and the man behind both \nRossis’ helmet designs), Uccio (Vale’s childhood mate \nand  constant companion) and  others, it’s  a  nice  way for \nfriends to  get  together. Valentino is  the  only pro  there \nand it’s  a  big pleasure for  us  to  watch him  drive and do \nthings. He  grew up  amongst racers, so  it’s  always been \nwith him, but  there was no  future seen in any  of this, it \nwas just fun, though maybe a   bit dangerous.’ \nDangerous, for  sure, but  the kind of  distraction that \ncan  stop kids growing up to  be crackheads. \nMeanwhile Valentino was getting on  with primary \nschool in  Tavullia. Mum wanted him to  grow up  to  be \nan  engineer but while he  was bright, he  wasn’t the \nmost dedicated of  pupils. ‘He  didn’t used to  feel like \nstudying,’ she  remembers. ‘But he  had  a great memory, \nso  I'd  read his  school books to  him  while he  lay on  the \ncouch and he'd get what he  needed from that. He  was \na  good kid,  the  kind that would get  all  the  other kids \ntogether, his teachers always talked about that.’ \nIf bikes and cars were the  core of  his  childhood \nworld, Valentino also showed a  talent for  guitar and \nfootball, although mother's efforts to  take him to \nsoccer school failed to  distract him from his  need for \nspeed. And when his  dad wasn’t taking him to  the \n\né \n| Shiaeee \nVAC IE IN TIGNES) poss! @) Maxine VASE EN iN @ \ngravel pits or  to  another GP,  Vale would be sat  in front \nof the  TV,  entranced by the  great racers of the  day. ‘In \nF1  my  heroes were Senna, Prost and Mansell, in  bikes, \nKevin Schwantz, Doriano Romboni and Loris Capirossi. \nAlways Schwantz because he was the  most spectacular \nand most beautiful on  the  bike, and also because of \nthe  colours. The style has  always been important to \nme, and he  was riding the Pepsi Suzuki then.’ Even \ntoday the  best compliment you can  pay  Valentino is to \ntell  him  that he  rides like  Schwantz. They both have an \nelement of the  cavalier in their riding and  they've both \ngot  long, gangly, sticky-out legs. \nInevitably, the  day came when Valentino wanted to \ngo  racing. He  was nine at  the  time, a  year too  young \nfor  his junior kart licence but  that wasn't going to  stop \nthe  family from getting started. Remembering his  own \nparents’ refusal to  sign for  his  racing licence, Graziano \nforged some documents with inside help from Tavullia’s \ntownhall, but  their efforts were thwarted by a silly \nmistake. So Valentino had  to wait. \n36 \nSe \nValentino was  fast from the  day of his very first  race \nin  early 1989, what a  surprise. In  1990 he  won the \nregional championship, enjoying his  first victory that \nApril, but  by then he'd already spotted the toy he really, \nreally wanted. ‘The end of  ‘89  was the  start of  the \nminimoto craze, there’d been nothing like minimoto \nbefore,’ he says. ‘As  soon as  | saw these bikes | wanted \none, so  | pushed and  pushed my father until he bought \nme  one. It was black, like  Ron  Haslam’s Elf Honda.’ \nRight away it was obvious that this  was what the \nboy really enjoyed: riding round and round in  circles, \ngrinding his  kneesliders to  dust, just like  the  big  boys. \nAnd he wasn’t the  only one. It seemed like  all the  local \nkids had these Lilliputian racers which they'd thrash \naround the  mini racetracks that pockmark the  nearby \nseaside resorts of  Rimini, Riccione and Cattolica. Not \njust the  kids either, anyone could rent a  minimoto for a \nfew thousand lira  any  day of the week and  pretty much \nany time of  day or  night.

At  first it was \nfour of us,  then six,  then 35, just  riding around for fun, \nnot  proper racing.’ \nVale wasn’t the fastest of  his  gang, at  least until \nthe racing started for  real. ‘It  was at  Miramare in  the \nsummer of  ‘91  and it  must've been one of  the  first \nproper minimoto races. | remember it very well, the \ngreat atmosphere and the  floodlights, because it was \nnight. We used to  ride at  Cattolica on  Wednesday \nevenings, then go  to  Miramare. There’d be  so  many \npeople there, like a  World Championship, because \nthere were all  the  rent-a-racers too. There were 20  in \nthe  race and | was able to  go  away out  front, it was a \nSurprise because |’d  never been fastest before.’ Vale \nwon another 15  races that summer, invariably running \nnumber 46,  the  number his  dad had used to  win his \n40 \nfirst GP  in  ‘79, and wearing a  Schwantz-replica Arai \nwith a  glued-on Ninja Turtle along for  the ride. The \nNinja Turtle fetish is still  there —  one of  the  creatures \nstanding guard in  his  motorhome as  he  gets dressed \nbefore riding. \nIt's  impossible to  overestimate minimoto’s crucial \ninfluence on  the  career of  Rossi and his  peers. ‘You \nthink of  any Italian racer my  age or  a  bit  younger — \nMelandri, Poggiali, Sabbatani, Brannetti —  they all \ncame from minimoto. The first time | went to  the \ntrack at  Cattolica in  December ‘89, Melandri was \nalready there, he  was only seven at  the  time but  he \nwas already a  phenomenon.’ Of  course, Marco \nMelandri went on  to  succeed Rossi at  Aprilia in 2000, \nManuel Poggiali won the  125  world title in 2001 and \nboth Max Sabbatani and Alessandro Brannetti got  GP \nrides. ‘Minimoto helped me  very much.

It was difficult to  overtake at  some \ntracks, but | never had a  problem.’ He  was already \nsummoning up  those weird lines that no  one else \neven considered, showing the  skills that would help \nhim  conquer the  world. \nAnd yet however hard he raced as  a  kid, Valentino's \npersonality always shone through. He  was. already \nforging the  characteristics that would serve him  so  well \nin  adulthood and his  mother soon recognised that he \nhad a  special attitude, unlike most kiddy racers who'd \nsulk or  bawl whenever they got  beaten. ‘| was always \nimpressed by how he  always had fun  with the  whole \nthing,’ says Stefania. ‘He  was really passionate about \npaddock life, he’d talk about that, or  about battling \nwith another rider, for  days. He’d win one race, then \nOkay, we get \npicture, you've go \nthe hang of it  now \n(Rossi archive) \nmaybe lose another or  crash, but he  liked the  whole \nthing, not  just the  winning.’ \nStefania reckons Valentino hasn't changed in  that \nrespect. ‘It’s  his  easygoing attitude, it’s  not  something \nhe was taught. The  things | really like  about him  are  the \npersonal stuff. If | had  to  tell  you  what's his  best quality, \nit  wouldn't be  his  riding talent.’ But then she’s his \nmum, she  would say  that. And yet  talking to  Stefania \nand Graziano It's  obvious that both have an  extra- \nspecial love for  their son, there’s huge warmth within \nthis  family unit, even if the  parents split over a  decade \nago. \nFollowing the  divorce Vale moved in with his  mum. \n‘Living with her  was very much easier,’ he  recalls. ‘My \nfather always gave me a hard time if | came in  late  or \nsomething, but  my  mother never did  that, she  was \nmuch calmer. We  were all  happy though, because they \nstill  had  a good relationship and lived near each other.’ \nNonetheless Giampiero Sacchi, the  man who gave \n41 \n\n@) Maxine VA.

He names two other recent \nchampions to  support his argument: Max Biaggi, \nwhose parents split when he  was very young, and \nDoohan, whose dad died when Mick was 11.  Divorce \ncan  shatter lives but  childhood troubles can  strengthen \nsome characters, giving them an  inner strength, a  spirit \nof  independence. ‘I've come to  the  conclusion that to \nbe  so  strong in  your life  you probably need to  have \nbeen in  some difficult corners,’ says Sacchi. ‘|  under- \nstood that when Valentino was doing 125s with me. \nThese young guys are  not  living a  normal life. A normal \nkid  of  16  or  17  is okay thinking about school, he's not \nready to  think about racing 16  GPs, travelling all  over \nthe  world and fighting for  a  World Championship. | \ndon't know whether these guys are  crazy or  not, but \nsure they’re special.’ \nLike Stefania, Graziano is  also well aware of  his \nson's special qualities. ‘His approach to  racing has \nalways been the  same. Even now when he  has  a  bad \nThrashing alone \nthe driveway, \nhis first mir \n—  the bike that \nstopped him \nbecoming a  cal \nracer.

Any racer who thinks about pulling over when \nhe  sees someone crash obviously has a  bit  of  a \nproblem. To  most racers, though they wouldn't admit \nit,  a downed rider is just one less man to  beat. It’s  a \nhard sport, people die  and get  crippled in  motorcycle \nracing, and most riders have little room within \nthemselves for sympathy or  concern. It’s  a  denial thing, \nif they opened up  to  others’ suffering or  the  possibility \nof  their own, they'd probably end up  quitting. Sure, \nValentino isn’t your average racetrack psycho, he's a \nsweet and charming human being, but  some kind of \ntransformation obviously takes place within him  when \nhe’s on  the  racetrack. \n‘There's one difference between myself and guys \nlike Valentino, Doohan and Biaggi,’ says Graziano. \n‘And that’s the fact that |  never won a  World \nChampionship! Valentino has  this  thing, the  quality of \na World Champion. When he shuts his visor and  starts \na  race everybody becomes his  worst enemy, he  needs \nto fight these people and he needs to win. When | was \nracing | noticed that World Champions have this  ability \nto  shut off  from the  normal world. | didn’t have that \nand  that’s why | don’t have a World Championship.’ \nIn cold psychological speak, Valentino has  a Jekyll & \nHyde character. No  surprise there because there are \nplenty of  nice guys racing motorcycles who are  trans- \nmogrified the  moment they ride down the  pit  lane. \nUntil they return they are  possessed, prepared to  take \nthe kind of  risks, with their own lives and those of \nother people, which they'd never dream of  taking in \nnormal life  (except, of  course, when driving a  rent-a- \ncar). And yet  these contrasting on-track and off-track \ncharacteristics aren't difficult to  reconcile in Valentino's \npersonality. It really is very simple: going fast is a  gas \nand  winning is a laugh, and  while these actions require \ndoing some pretty scary things, there’s no  requirement \nto  bring the  maniac with you  when you climb off  the \nbike. It’s just that some racers get so  wound up in  it all \nthat they forget that. ‘If you  win it's very much better,’ \ngrins Valentino. ‘But | never say  to  myself: “Ah fack, \narriving in  front is all  that matters”, I'm  not  obsessed. \nBut, especially over the  last  two or  three years, | know \nthat | can  win  if | stay relaxed and  concentrated. Maybe \nother riders like  Biaggi are  more angry with the  other \nriders. I'm  not  angry with the  other riders.’ \nSo  whatever Graziano says, it's  obvious that he \nhas  taught his  kid  plenty. ‘For sure | sometimes did \nthe opposite of  what my  father told me,’ admits \nValentino. ‘That's normal between father and son. If | \nmake a  mistake it’s necessary that it's  my own \nmistake. But he  told me  a  lot  of  things and | often \nfollowed his  advice. Whenever someone gives me \nadvice | quickly decide whether it’s  bullshit or  not. If \nit’s  not, | follow it.’ \nAt the  end  of ‘91  father and  son  had  an  important \ndecision to  make. Rossi was still racing karts at  this \nstage, minimotos were just for  fun. He  had finished \nfifth in that year’s national kart championship at  Parma \nand  was ready to  graduate to the  Italian and European \n100cc series in  ‘92; the next step in  a  career that \nmight have taken him all the  way to  F1.  ‘My plan was \nstill  for  Valentino to  race four wheels because | was \nscared he’d get  hurt on  a  bike,’ says Graziano. ‘But \ntwo things changed this. First, he  really, really liked \nminimoto, he  used to  spend all  his  days riding. \nSecond, we  realised that karts were getting too  expen- \nsive for  us,  and we  knew that car  racing Is all  about \nmoney. If you don’t have the best kart or  car, you \ndon't have much chance.’ \nValentino takes up  the  story. ‘We'd arrived at  this \npoint where we'd need 100  million lira  for the  ‘92  kart \nseason, so  | said to  my  father, “Maybe it’s  better we \nrace with the  bike,” and  he say  “Ah, bo,  really?”. | say \n“Yes, So  is it possible we  race bikes?”. He say  “Yes,”.’ \nSo  throughout '92  Vale, concentrating exclusively \non  minimoto racing, continued to  learn the essentials \nof riding a motorcycle on  tarmac just as  fast  as  it'll  go. \n‘But | was still just playing, not  really thinking about the \nfuture. | wanted to  win just like  | wanted to  win in \nkarts, | think that's normal for  a  boy.’ And win he  did, \nall  the  way into ‘93, growing more serious about his \nracing by the  day and growing taller too. It  became \napparent that soon he'd need a real  motorbike. \n45 \n\nNey! ats \nre ‘ \nES po \nPike ‘ : \nVale's mop ra \"= : / \nincreasingly out  of & << \ncontrol in '97. \n—  The longer it \n;  grew, the faster \n‘ :  : “he rode. \n(Henk Keulemans) \n\nVeo EE Nor iN): @ \nross! @) Kio: ita E BAe ee  tS) \ntTnese \nGraziano Rossi's memory |s  a  bit  iffy  at  the  best of \ntimes —  blame a  few too  many bumps on  the  head — \nbut  he has  a vivid recollection of his son’s first race on  a \nreal  motorcycle. And if all  of dad’s stories are  scattered \nwith laughter, this  tale  fills  him  with particular glee. \n‘We  were at  Maggione in spring of '93,  practising for \nValentino's first race  on  his Cagiva 125. He got on  the bike, \nrode 100  metres out  of the pit lane  and  crashed at the first \ncorner. So  he came back and  we  fixed the  bike. An  hour \nand  a half  later the  bike was  okay, so  he rode down to the \nfirst corner, no  problem, then second corner, crash!’ \nGraziano loves this story because, like most bike \nracers, he sees a  harmless crash as  something to  laugh \nabout, which makes two crashes so  close together \nalmost hilarious. Most of all  though, he  likes the  story \nbecause of what happened right afterwards. \n‘When he  got  back to  the  pits  we  were thinking: \n“Are we  doing the  right thing here or  are  we  making a \nbig mistake putting him  on  a proper bike?” It wasn't so \ngood. For  sure, Valentino was also wondering if this \nwas his  job for  the rest of  his  life, and there was an \nimportant look between us.  We  didn't exchange words \nbut  what I'd  meant with that look was: “Yes, this  can \nstill  be your job  if you  want, don’t give up”.’ There he \ngoes again, teaching without actually saying anything. \n‘You could see  the  disappointment in  Valentino's \neyes, he  was almost crying. But these are  the most \nimportant moments in  a  racer’s career, when you find \nthe strength to  react and to  show whether you're \nstrong or you're weak.’ \nValentino did  indeed bounce back that weekend, \nfinishing ninth in  his  first-ever race on a full-size bike. \n\nSN a Ne) \nross! @)kios Tine Ss] SyAges \nnatural. \nluated to \netbikes in \ni Sel \n2 Italian \n48 \narchive) \n\nVAS LIEN oT alain @) ross! @) kios LAE Seo Ay. Ss \nLater on  the world would see him perform similar \ncomebacks time and again, until they became a \ndefining feature of  his  career. He  did  it in  his  first 125 \nWorld Championship season, recovering from a  rash of \ncrashes to  win his  first GP,  he  did  it  in  his  first and \nsecond 250 campaigns, putting tumbles and miserable \nresults behind him  to  go  on  to  dominate. And he did  it \nagain when he  graduated to  500s, dismissing two \nconfidence-sapping get-offs to  quickly assume mastery \nof racing's most challenging category. \nThere's obviously a pattern here, both in the cock-ups \nand the comebacks. ‘It's a  system,’ says Valentino, \nexplaining the  crashes. ‘Whenever | ride  another kind of \nbike the beginning isn’t fantastic, | make mistakes. | try to \nride fast, | make mistakes, | need this  to  go  faster.’ It \nmakes perfect sense, really. In racing there's only one  way \nof locating the  absolute limit and  that’s by tripping right \nover it.  Once you've crashed you've found it, the  next \ntrick is to  remember where it is, and a  lot of racers never \nquite manage that part of the  process. \nPossibly even more miraculous than his  ability to \nlock on  to  the limit, to  the  extent that he  can dance \nalong it all day, like  he’s  taking a walk in the  park, is his \nability to  stay cool when things go  bad. ‘Yes,’ he  says. \n‘This is very important, this is  the key.’ Again, many \nriders don't have this facility. Once they've started \ndigging a hole for themselves they keep digging. It’s just \ntoo  easy to fall  into  this  trap because racing is all about \nconfidence and focus, and big, scary crashes tend to \ndestroy both, unravelling even the  greatest of  talents. \nProbably it is only the  real  greats who can  recover from \nsuch situations, but who knows how.they manage that, \nvia  a Zen-like inner state or  sheer bloody mindedness? ‘I \ndon’t know how,’ offers Valentino. ‘Just that I’ve had \nsome difficult periods but  so  far  I’ve  arrived at  all  my \ntargets.’ His  Honda engineer Jerry Burgess begs to \ndiffer: ‘Determination is  the thing that unites the \nchampions, that and a real  fear  of getting beaten.’ \nSo  he was rightly delighted with his  ninth place at \n»  Maggione, although he remembers that crunching first \nday of  practice somewhat differently from his  father, \nand this isn’t the  only time their memories conflict. \n‘Yes, | crashed at the  first corner but  next time | made \nthree or four laps before | crash.’ In mitigation he adds: \n‘It was early morning, very cold, and new tyres.’ \nThe race was the first round of  that year’s 125 \nItalian Sport Production Championship, open to  hotted- \nup  125 streetbikes like Valentino's Cagiva Mito. This \nwasn't the  first man-sized bike he'd ridden though. The \nprevious summer he'd sneaked out  at  Misano, riding a \nmate's Aprilia SP  racer. ‘| was still  too  young to  go  on  a \nreal  racetrack, so  it had  to  be  secret. My friend signed \non,  then | wore his  leathers. This was my  first  time on  a \nproper bike and  a  proper racetrack, it was like  a dream.’ \nValentino didn’t set  the  world alight in  1993. He \nmade more mistakes, of course, but  by season's end he \nwas quick enough to  take pole position at  the  Misano \nfinale and finish the  race third behind Andrea Ballerini \nand Roberto Locatelli. Both these men moved into GPs \nbefore Rossi, Locatelli going on  to  capture the 2000 \n125  world title. \nThe  following year was very different. Rossi had  an \nofficial Mito, supplied by  Cagiva team manager \nClaudio Lusuardi, with which he  recorded his  first \nnational victory at  Monza. By the  Misano finale he only \nneeded a third-place finish to  claim the  title. ‘|  was \nthird into the  last  corner but  Stefano Cruciani arrive \nmuch too  fast  and  knock me  wide because he's  facking \ncrazy. | finish fourth, then they disqualify him, so  | am \nthe  champion.’ Cruciani, by the  way, never made it to \nGPs. During '94  Rossi also became acquainted with life \non  slicks, contesting the Italian 125 GP  series aboard a \nSandroni, an  Aprilia-engined special built by  Pesaro \nengineer Guido Mancini, the engine provided by Aprilia \nrace chief Carlo Pernat, an  old  mate of Graziano’s. \nSo  he  was getting pretty busy with his  racing, \nwhich didn't leave much time for  school. If he  wasn’t \nplaying truant to  go  riding, he  was struggling just to \nget out  of bed  in the  mornings, a habit that would stay \nwith him into his  first  year of  500s when he famously \nslept through morning practice at  the  Catalan GP.  His \nlove of the  lie-in compelled him  to  find a  new way of \ngetting to  school and he  hit  on  the  idea of  using the \nfamily’s Ape car,  a  rather comical three-wheeled pick- \nup  powered by  a  desperately overworked scooter \nmotor. Stefania remembers: ‘Getting the bus  to \nsecondary school meant he’d have to  get  up  earlier, so \nhe'd wake up  at  the  last  minute, grab the  Ape and  fly \n49 \n\n\n\nVALENTIN O ross! @)kios ant SE \ndown the  hill  to  Pesaro.’ Soon all  his  friends had Apes. \n‘At  first, everyone looked at  me  like | was an  idiot but \nthe  Ape became our  gang's official means of transport, \nwe  even used them to  go  to  the  disco!’ Once again \nValentino was showing a  tendency to  stand out  from \nthe  crowd, \nAnd of course, all  this  youthful exuberance got  him \ninto trouble with the  local police. ‘There was a time when \nValentino, his  friends and their scooters caused total \npanic around this  area,’ says Graziano, a proud dad's grin \nspreading across his  face. Nothing serious, mind. ‘They \nwere always getting chased by the  cops, and  at one  time \nit was like open war between them, they really hated \neach other. They got  chased down a  dirt  road and the \npolice car  ended up  in  a  ditch.’ You can imagine the \nscene, straight out  of  a Keystone Cops movie: the cop car \nteetering on  its  side, steam rising from beneath the \nbonnet and the  sweating Carabinieri in  their bulging \ntunics and pompous hats, shaking fists and screaming \nobscenities. In  fact, this  is another case of  father's and \nson's memories diverging. Valentino doesn’t remember \nthe incident, but even if this  is Graziano’s memory playing \ntricks on  him again, it’s  too  good a  fantasy to  remain \nuntold. This is  what Valentino remembers: ‘We were \nracing along the  road from Pesaro to  Cattolica on  our \nscooters, like  we  always did,  and  suddenly we  arrived at \nthis  police road block. | tried to escape by diving down a \ndirt  road and  crashed. So  | kept quiet and  waited for the \npolice to  go  away but  they didn’t, so  eventually | came \nThere \nplenty to lee \ncourse. ‘ \nInv \n(Gold \nBAY 'S \nout  with my  hands up.  The  problem was that they were \nlooking for  people with drugs, so  they wanted to  know \nwhy |’d  been so  keen to  get away.’ \nHis  father goes on: ‘That kind of  thing is  prett \nnormal around here. The  good thing was that Valentino \ngroup of  friends were very close, this was just a  b \nadventure for  them. Getting chased by  the cops ar \ngetting tickets was a  downside, but  they looked after \neach other, made sure no  one got into real trouble.’ Vale \ndidn’t survive his scooter days totally unscathed, however. \nIn the  summer of ‘94  he grabbed a lift to the  beach with \na mate, a car  pulled out  in front of them, breaking his  left \nankle and  mangling a couple of toes. \nIf his  racetrack results didn’t yet  put  him head and \nshoulders above his  rivals, he’d done enough to  further \nprick the  interest of Aprilia, who were signing a certain \nMax Biaggi to  their 250 GP  team at  the  same time. \nPernat had liked Vale from their first meeting. ‘I  like \nhim,’ he  says from behind his  rarely removed black-out \nshades, ‘because he  remind me  of  Kevin Schwantz.’ \nAprilia provided a standard RS125R for the  1995 Italian \nand European championships and it was during those \nsix  months that Valentino came of age as  a  roadracer. \nHe  dominated the Italian series from the  outset and \nmade his first  forays abroad. \n‘| think ‘95  was the  best-ever European series because \nthe  races were run  at the  GPs. It was  good because the  GP \nriders would practice, then we'd be  on  the  same track a \nfew hours later, so we  could compare. | watched all the  125 \namet \nShey (iy \n\nVAEEN TIN @ rossi @) kios A= SS \nGP  sessions and races.’ During his  travels he  struck up  a \nfriendship with Japanese 125  GP rider Haruchika Aoki, who \nwon the  1995 and  ‘96  125 World Championships and then \nmoved to  250s and 500s. ‘| had  always had  a  passion for \nJapanese rjders because | was  very much into  graphics and \ncolours. They seemed to  come from another world, with \ncrazy helmet designs and  very different leathers. Both me \nand  Haruchika used Diadora boots that  year, that’s how we \ngot  introduced, and  every time we  went to  another track \nhe would take me  around for a  lap and  tell  me  important \nthings. That was fantastic.’ And this  was the  year that \nValentino's first alter-ego was  born. Rossi became Rossifumi, \nafter wild-riding Japanese 500  star  Norifumi Abe. \nAoki’s teachings may have been vital but  they took \na  while to  sink in.  Rossi spent much of his  time abroad \nlimping in and  out  of Dr Claudio Costa’s Clinica Mobile, \nthe travelling hospital that looks after GP racing's \nwalking wounded. ‘In  the Euros | was always racing \nLucio Cecchinello who had  an  HRC-kitted Honda which \nwas impossible to  beat. But  | wanted to  beat him, so  I'd \ngo,  go,  go,  and after, crash, crash, crash.’ Nevertheless \nhe  finished the  series third, enough to  guarantee him \nentry to the following year’s 125  World Championship. \nThis time Rossi did  a  deal with Giampiero Sacchi, \nracetrack kingmaker, collector of old  Gileras and a lyrical \nteller of racing tales. ‘At that time | was Biaggi’s manager \nand  the  idea came to  me  to  make a  team for  the  ‘96 \nWorld Championship,’ says Sacchi, who later guided \nManuel Poggiali to  the  2001 125  title. ‘| couldn't afford \na  big  rider, so  | came to  an  agreement with Valentino \nDAYS \nand his  father. It was a  good team with standard bikes \nbut very enthusiastic and even then Valentino was \nValentino. I'd  never seen a  rider who wanted to  do \nthings like fix all the stickers to  his bike. He’s  always been \nvery careful with the  details, that was the first shock!’ \nSacchi wasn’t the  only one in for  a shock. First time \nRossi shared a  racetrack with his  GP  heroes was during \npre-season tests at Jerez in southern Spain. ‘Fack, it was \nincredible, they were so  fast! It was like  another sport, \nmaybe four seconds a lap faster. | thought | would never \nbe  able to  ride like  that, | needed to  learn another way \nto  ride  the  bike.’ \nAnd learn he did.  The  ‘96  season started at Malaysia’s \nold  GP venue, Shah Alam, a tortuous track that winds its \nway through encroaching tropical jungle. Rossi finished a \ncreditable sixth in  his  GP  debut and  followed that with \nreasonable enough rides to  11th in Indonesia and  Japan. \nBack on  familiar ground at  Jerez for  the  start of  the \nContinental sector of the  championship he was bang on \nthe  pace —  on  the  front row  for the  first  time and  in the \nthick of a  typically crazed ten-man battle for the  lead. ‘I \nwas second out  of the  final corner but  | crossed the  line \nfourth, and  exactly the same happened at the next race at \nMugello. My bike was very slow, | had  many good races \nthat year, but also some big, crazy mistakes.’ \nIndeed, Rossi suffered more than 15 crashes during \n1996. He  was a  young man in  a  hurry, too much of a \nhurry after missing the  podium by a fraction in  Spain \nand Italy. Desperate for  his  first pop at  the  post-race \nchampagne, he  crashed out  of  the  next two races in \n\nm \nVOXEL ENT IN O rossi! @)kios THES DAYS \nGRAND \nPRIX \nRING \n1996 \npodiurr \n‘9B, witt \nlvan Go \nGoose) \n\n\n\n3) Kins THES \nThe merry \nprankster comes \nout to play after \nanother win, this \ntime in  France. \n(Henk Keulemans) \n\nVE EEN INES ross! @) kilos 1  AES & DAS \n\nVA EE EaNai WN: © ross! @) kilos ioe ee \nFrance and Holland, although not  before he'd secured \nhis  first GP  lap  record at  Ricard. ‘It  was necessary for \nme  to  ride crazy because my  bike was so  slow, and \nwhen you ride like this all  the time, it’s  possible you \ncrash. At  Assen it was damp, | started 20th and after \nthree laps | was second, then crash. Crazy!’ \nThat accident brought matters to  a  head within \nSacchi's tightly budgeted little outfit. “You can  imagine \nthat all  these crashes weren't good for the team,’ \nSacchi recalls. ‘Many came from Vale just  not  thinking; \nthe  tyres: cold! Give gas: crash! So  we  take him into \nthe  motorhome and | say: “Vale, how is it possible you \ncrash so  much?”. But  now | understand there are  many \nriders who don’t crash and who never make it.  The \nlesson is this: if a  young rider is very fast, he’s  going to \ncrash. He  needs to  discover the limit, and without \ncrashing it's impossible to find the  limit.’ \nRossi remembers that little chat in the  motorhome \nlike  it was yesterday. ‘| remember Sacchi's words, he say \nto me: “If you  continue like this, the  maximum possible \nis  that you become like Kevin Schwantz [who had \nrecently been forced into retirement by aching injuries], \nbut  if you  want to  become like  Max Biaggi [then riding \nthe  crest of a wave in the  250 class], it’s  necessary you \nchange.” So  | say  to  myself: “Fack, | continue like \nSAY S \nthis!\".’ The Rossi/Biaggi agro may have been far  in the \nfuture, but Valentino already knew he  didn’t like the \n250 champ, Biaggi was too  proud, too  Roman for  his \nliking. You only need to  take a  look at  www.valenti- \nnorossi.com to  guess what he  thinks of  him: Biaggi’s \nname never even appears, just XXX XXXXX. \nDespite all  the tumbles, Valentino’s speed hadn't \ngone unnoticed. Aprilia were impressed enough to  give \nhim  some factory parts; a  better cylinder and a  carbon \nfront disc  brake, because he was shattering the  standard \nsteel discs. The  trick gear made all the  difference: third in \nAustria for  his  first podium, then his  first pole position \nand win  at Brno in the Czech Republic. Rossi had  arrived. \nAt  Brno he  beat veteran 125  champ Jorge Martinez \nby a  fraction after a  frenzied final few laps. Martinez, \nlike  many of the  older GP  racers, greatly disapproved of \nthe kamikaze tactics employed by these crazy \nminimoto-drilled kids. The  Spaniard had  started his  long \nand illustrious World Championship career way back in \n'82  when racing was less  frantic, if only because there \nweren't so  many good bikes around back then. He even \nremembers seeing Graziano’s toddler in  the  paddock, \nand ruefully remarked after his  defeat: ‘|  should've \ntaken my chance then and  run  him  over’. \nSacchi, of course, had seen it all  before. ‘It’s  like a \n57 \n\npack of  wolves, a  new leader arrives, pushes the  limit \nand the  old  leader has  to  give way. When Valentino \narrived at  the  front, Martinez said that his  riding was \ndangerous, and people said the same thing when \nPoggiali arrived.’ Martinez retired a  year later. \nRossi should’ve won more races in  1996. ‘But after \nBrno the  bad  luck came. | was leading at  Imola when the \nfacking sparkplug broke, then Tokudome took me  out  at \nthe  first turn at  Barcelona. At  Rio  | had a  bad crash in \npractice which gave me  a  problem with my  shoulder, so  | \ncrashed again in  the  race. In Australia another ‘plug break.’ \nAll  this  was of little consequence, however, because \nBrno had rocked Rossi’s world. Now he  knew he  was \nmore than just part of  the pack and that changed his \nwhole perspective on  racing. ‘Until you win you don’t \nknow you can win.’ Sounds obvious, doesn’t it?.  ‘And \nthe  win made me  more happy because | think maybe \nit's  possible | can  win some more.’ \nFor  ‘97  Rossi was afforded the  full-factory treat- \nment by  Aprilia: a  pair of  expensively honed factory \n58 \n\nVi AIEEE INiStilr IN| @) ross! @) «ios Tet S \nRS125Rs and  a factory crew headed by Mauro Noccioli, \nSacchi still  fronting the  effort. And it wasn’t just the \nequipment and personnel that were better, Rossi was \nalso new and improved, no  longer a  GP  dreamer, now \nhe knew he could win  this  thing. \n‘|  had a  very good bike for  '97  so  | knew in  my \nheart that | could win. Winning the championship \nwasn't a  surprise, though winning 11  races and not \nmaking too many mistakes was. Before ‘97  | always \nmade mistakes —  | had  more than 20  crashes in  ‘95, 15 \nin ‘96  and maybe only three in ‘97. | changed because \nwhen you understand your power you become more \nconfident and with more engine you can be  more \nrelaxed. The better bike also helped my  concentration \nbecause when you've got  a  slow bike you push too \nhard and  sometimes lose concentration. And after you \ncrash, crash, crash you  say to yourself: “Fack, It’s  better \n| don’t crash” because the  asphalt is very hard.’ \nSacchi was well aware of  the  change that came \nover his young protégé that winter. ‘His  mind changed, \nhe  became another person, but maybe the biggest \nchange happened when he  won the first race in \nMalaysia, then he  realised he could win all of them. He \nDAYS \nwas now sure of  himself inside, he  had  the  conviction, \nsomething that normal riders don’t have. For  me  '97 \nwas a dream, like  being in paradise.’ \nRossi messed up  only once all  season, tumbling out \nof  round two at  Suzuka while planning a last-lap push \nfor  victory. ‘| thought | could win, now | just think I’m \nan  idiot,’ he  said after wandering back to  pit  lane, \ngrinning all  the  way and waving to  the  crowd. Even \nwhen he  was beaten he  appeared unbeaten. On  the \nfew occasions he  was defeated in  ‘97  he  giggled his \nway through the  podium ceremony just like  he’d won, \nso  his  Japanese rivals couldn’t nurture a  hatred of  the \nguy that might help them push just a little harder. \nNobby Ueda (who won the other four races), Tomomi \nManako, Kazuto Sakata and Masaki Tokudome could \ndo  nothing but laugh with him. Maybe Vale wasn’t \nconscious of  what he  was doing, but  these days he \nseems more aware of  the psychological benefits of \ngrinning when he’s not  winning, denying Biaggi & Co. \nthe  pleasure of seeing him  well and  truly vanquished. \nNinety-seven was the year Rossi mania grabbed \neveryone, when he began the winning that allowed him \nto  indulge his  kink for  dressing up  and showing people \na  good time. He  looked no  less  ridiculous out  of  his \npost-race fancy dress, his  girly mop raging increasingly \nout  of control as  the  season went on,  especially when \nsoaked in  that stinking podium cocktail of  warm \nchampagne and sweaty leathers. At  times the mane \nwas kept vaguely in  check by a  girl's Alice band, and \nfinally, after he’d secured the  title, it was chopped off, \nthe new and much tidier coiffure dyed blue with a \nblond number 1 at the  back. \nThe  fun  and games began after he  scored his  third \nvictory of the  year at  Mugello. If he was going to  make \nthe effort anywhere, he  might as  well do  it  there, \nwhere the Italian fans go  to  extraordinary lengths to \nget  involved and make some noise. The most ardent of \nthem bring along static, open-piped engines which are \ndeployed on  the  hillsides surrounding the  Tuscan track \nand then rev  them to  oblivion, joined now and again \nby bikers caning their own motors until they rat-a-tat- \ntat  off  their rev  limiters. Fireworks, thunderflashes and \nhundreds of  camp fires complement the  megaphone \nmadness to forge a war-zone ambience. ‘Up on  the  hill \n59 \n\nVALE Na EN © ross! @)kios Eve Sle \nit's  another world, the crowd is  coming crazy: drink, \nnaked people on  motocross bikes, it's  crazy! | was up \nthere in  ‘96  when | wasn’t so  well known and blew up \nsomeone's CBR engine, ooops! In  '97  | went up  in the \nevening and it was very dangerous, everyone jumping \non  me, shouting ‘Rossi! Rossi!’. There was this big wall \nof  people and only one way out, through the  shower \nblock, so  | rode my  scooter through the  shower block. \nIf | hadn't, |’d  probably still  be up there now.’ \nSo  how was he  going to  entertain this bunch of \ncrazies? In  recent years it had become the  fashion for \nwinning riders to  stop on  the  slowdown lap  and find \nan  obliging track-invading fan with the appropriate \nnational flag. ‘If  | won | didn’t want to  do  that, | \nwanted to  ride around with something different.’ So \nhalfway through his  victory lap  he  stopped by his  fan \nclub's encampment and rode on  accompanied by  a \nblow-up Claudia Schiffer. The doll had been in  its \nwrapping for  nine months: in case of victory, open box. \n‘Gibo and me  bought the  doll before Imola ‘96  but, \nfack, | didn't win  there, so  it stay in  box  until we  win  at \nMugello. But  the  Claudia idea wasn’t mine because this \ntalk about the  Biaggi thing with her  hadn’t happened \nwhen we  got  the  doll, it was my  fan  club’s idea to  write \nClaudia Schiffer on  the  back!’ The gag poked fun  at \nBiaggi’s rumoured liaison with Naomi Campbell. The \nrelationship between Italy’s favourite two racers, such as  it \nwas, had  deteriorated after Rossi had  a  go  at  Max on  an \nItalian TV chat show, Biaggi fronting up to him  in a Suzuka \nBAYS \nrestaurant, saying: ‘Stay quiet, | am  number one.’ Rossi’s \nnew profile had  brought his feelings for Max into the open \nand  the  Italian media were in like  Flynn. Asked by one  shit- \nstirring journalist if he considered himself the  Biaggi of the \n125s, he  cheekily replied: ‘No, Biaggi is the  Rossi of the \n250s!\" From now on  the  pair would be rival  suitors for the \naffections of the  Italian public, the opposing armies of fans \ncolour coded for  easy identification: Marlboro red  for \nBiaggi, yellow for Valentino, his favourite colour. \nNext time out  in Austria Ueda cancelled the  party, by \nfour thousandths of  a  second, but  normal service was \nresumed in  France (minstrel’s hat  on  the  podium) and \nHolland (a  carefully customised plastic Superman-style \nRossifumi cape). At  Imola, where he  achieved his  third \nstraight win, he  left  it to  his  fans to  indulge in  some \nstraightforward crowd anarchy —  the hillside opposite \nthe  pits  ablaze with yellow fan  club T-shirts and giant \ncut-out letters proclaiming ROSSIFUMI COSMICO. From \nhere on  in, it was // fenomeno Rossi all the way. \nMore wins followed in Germany (medieval torturer, \nswinging a  mace), Britain (Robin Hood, brandishing a \nkid's bow and arrow), and Rio  to  make it six  in a  row. \nLate in  August he  wrapped up  the  title at  Brno, three \nraces still  to  go.  He  still  counts that day the  best of his \nmany great days. ‘Becoming World Champion is  for \nsure the  greatest moment and  maybe the  first  one  was \nbest. That and  the  500, because it was the  500.’ \nA month later in Indonesia, he won his  12th and  last \n125 GP,  dancing on  to  the  podium wearing a  comedy \nReady for some \nter mayhem in \n5  piazza.

The previous weekend he'd been \ncelebrating the  championship in  Tavullia and the  night \nwent all  rock star  on  him: a few  drinks, a couple of girls \nand a  car  crash. ‘My popularity had  gone from zero to \nhuge, my  life  went from normal to  not  normal, so  we \nmade a big party with the fan  club.

It was a  big, \nbig  casino (Italian for  row), fack, incredible!’ This was \nRossi's first experience of  the  dark side of  the  media \nand  it shook him  up.  ‘I was  very, very angry, it was  a big \nshock.’ Until then he’d been more sociable with the \nmedia than any other rider, whiling away hours on \nSunday evenings laughing and joking with journalists \nin circuit media centres. Maybe he'd been trying to  get \non  the right side of  the oh-so-fickle Italian press, \nalthough it really had looked like  he  was just having \nsome fun.

In  125s, being a  psychopath is almost enough. \nIf you're braver and madder than the  other guys, you \nmight just succeed, if only on  those occasions when \nyou don’t end up  in  an  agonised heap by the  side of \nthe  track. Relatively speaking, talent and intelligence \naren't essential to  racing a  puny 45  horsepower 125. \nValentino might not  be any  different. So far there'd \nbeen little indication that we  might be  witnessing the \ncreation of an  all-time great, because all he'd done was \nride  a  125  very well. But  Aprilia were pretty sure they'd \ngot hold of  someone special, someone who would \nmore than recompense them for  the  loss  of  the  man \nwho'd put the  little Italian concern on  the  motorcycling \nmap. Max Biaggi had quit Aprilia under a  storm cloud \nat  the  end of  1996, defecting to  Honda, whom he \nhoped would look after him when he  was ready to \ngraduate to  500s. The Roman did  what was expected \nof him, wresting the  250 crown from his  old  employers \nand presenting it to  Honda, who kept their part of the \nbargain, furnishing him with a  brace of  NSR500s for \n1998. So  the much awaited Valentino v_  Biaggi \nshowdown would have to wait a while longer... \nAprilia determined to  nurture their new asset like  a \nfavoured son. They assigned Valentino one of  their \ngreatest pit-lane engineers, the squat, avuncular \nRossano Brazzi, who had  worked with Aprilia’s original \nGP  hero Loris Reggiani. Over the  next two years Brazzi \n65 \n\nbie rt i \n» a ‘ ¥ \nst popping \n~ down the  beach. \nDisplaying a  talent \nfor gloriously \ninappropriate \nclothing after \ner riding to second \n-  at Mugello '98. \nfe (Henk Keulemans) \nVed \nee \n\nWAL EIN Wl IN  © \nand Valentino would build a  special relationship that \ncontinues today. ‘We still have fun together,’ Brazzi \nsays. ‘We meet up  when he's back in  Italy and go  out \nfor dinner. Most of these evenings end  up the way they \nalways used to, with the  restaurant getting trashed.’ \nBrazzi was perfect for  Vale: a  dedicated technician \nbut a warm and  gentle human being, so  unlike the  cold- \nblooded, data-fixated brainboxes who populate some \nstretches of pit lane. And he  knew exactly what he was \ndealing with from the word go.  ‘The quality of Valentino \nwas evident from the  first time | worked with him at \nJerez at the  end of '97,’ recalls Brazzi. ‘That was the  first \ntime he rode the 250  and  he broke the  lap record!’ \nSo  right away Valentino had proven that he  was \nmore than just a  125 nutter, and not  just with his  riding \nskill  but  also with his  guile. He  was only 18  at  the  time \nand  yet he  knew the  eyes of the  racing world would be \nupon him  when he  rolled up  for  his  first ride. He  there- \nfore wanted to  make sure he  made a real  impression, a \npsychological impact, so  he  got  on  to  the  Dunlop guys \nand  asked them to bring some super-soft qualifying tyres. \nAt the end  of the tests he comfortably surpassed the 250 \nrecord. All of  a sudden he was  faster than Biaggi. \nFortuitously, Valentino entered the  250 arena when \nAprilia were at  the  height of their powers in the  class. \nThe  RSW had  long been the fastest 250  but that year it \nenjoyed a   greater-than-ever advantage, because \nHonda’s engineers had got  their sums badly wrong \nwith a  brand-new NSR250. The ‘98  NSR was a  dog, \nLeading Capirossi \nand Harada at \nRicard. Aprilia’s \nspeedy threesome \nspent most of 98 \nformation fighting, \nwell ahead of any \nrivals. (Gold & \nGoose) \nrossi @) coins Tres \n0  a \ne)  A  m \nZ \nnothing more, nothing less. And not  only did  Aprilia \nenjoy superior speed, they'd also assembled their \nstrongest-ever team, Valentino lining up  alongside his \nchildhood hero Loris Capirossi and the  similarly experi- \nenced Tetsuya Harada. Harada had  won the  250 world \ntitle at  his  first attempt in  ‘93 and would almost \ncertainly have been further decorated if  he  hadn't \nsuffered some miserable luck. Capirossi had been the \nproto-Valentino, the first of  GP  racing's teen stars, \nwhen he  won the  1990 125 crown at  17.  The toothy, \nhard-riding Italian from Riolo Terme, an  hour's drive \nfrom Valentino's hometown, had retained the  title in \n‘91  and  graduated to 250s the following year. \nThus Vale seemed to  be  in  an  ideal situation: fast \nbikes and fast team-mates, so  no  pressure to  succeed \ntoo  soon. Not  so.  ‘All  the  other bikes were shit but  | \nhad two foxes for  team-mates, both with many years \nof  250 experience, and the  atmosphere in  Aprilia was \nterrible. All  the chief mechanics were fighting, you \nknow, it was an  Italian team: “Ah you have the  best \ncylinder”, this and that and so  on. For  me  it was diffi- \ncult to  ride like Loris and Harada because they have \nmore experience, but | didn’t want to  arrive third \nbehind them, because to  arrive third was to  arrive last.’ \nAnd yet there were reasons to  be  happy he’d made \nthe  move, rather than indulging himself by carrying the \n125 number-one plate. ‘Maybe the best thing about \n250s was that | could get  out  of bed  later! | had  to  get \nup at seven for  125  practice, and  that was a big problem \n\nfor  me, in 250s | could stay in bed until nine.’ \nComfy lie-ins notwithstanding, Valentino cites 1998 \nas  the toughest and  therefore most important year of his \ncareer. Just as  it was Mick Doohan’s injury-wracked ‘89 \nGP season that tempered the  Aussie into  an  indomitable \nracetrack warrior, so  it  was ‘98 that helped make \nValentino the  man he  is today, although his  suffering \nwasn't so  much physical as  psychological. He was having \ntrouble distinguishing his  real mates from an  ever- \nburgeoning gang of  hangers-on and dealing with the \ndeaths of two of his best friends in a car  accident. \n‘It  was the most difficult year for  me, because \neveryone expected so  much and  |  really felt the \npressure. | was fast but | made mistakes because | \nwasn't relaxed. | had some personal problems with \nsome friends who weren't real friends. It  was like  a \nballoon, it got  bigger and bigger, then it had  to  burst. \nThere were too  many people around who only stayed \nwith me  because I’m  Valentino and  | didn’t understand \nthis very quickly because it  was something new. | \nneeded some time to  understand and then | realised \nwhy | wasn’t concentrating on  racing. My  level went \ndown all year, until we  hit the  bottom at  Brno.’ \nThe racing started at  Suzuka, where bike problems \nkept him out  of the  running. He  was quickly realising \nthat 250s were altogether tougher, requiring intricate \nset-up work. ‘Unlike 125s, everything must-be just \nperfect or  you have no  chance of  getting on  the \npodium, let alone winning. Also, | missed my friends in \n125s, though in  my  first qualifying session | saw that \nthere are  just as  many crazy guys in 250s!’ \nValentino would find out  just  how crazy when the \ncircus headed south for  the Malaysian GP,  staged for \none year only at  Johor, just across the  border from \nSingapore. Wearing a  new skinhead cut for the \nsubtropical heat, he  was right on  it, qualifying on  the \nfront row  for the  first  time and racing for the  lead with \nHarada and Honda's Tohru Ukawa. Just a  few corners \nto  go  and he  was ahead but  Harada stuffed it up  the \ninside at  the  final turn, robbing the  youngster of  the \ngrippy line  and forcing him on  to  the  dirtier tarmac. \nThe crash was a  big  one. ‘Maybe | should've let  him \npass but after leading | couldn't do  that. As  the \nJapanese say: “Necessary make win!”.’ The  race wasn’t \nthe  only thing he  lost  that weekend —  a  reckless bet \nwith Capirossi cost him a  further million lira. All  his \nteam-mate had  to  do was risk  his  life  by jumping off a \nhotel walkway into the  pool, a  12-metre drop with no \nrun  up. \nOn  to  Europe and another two crashes during \nSpanish GP  practice suggested that Valentino was \nretracing his  125 GP  learning curve —  fast, furious and \noften floored. But  Jerez also commenced a  strong run \nof results, his first 250 points for  a  hard-ridden second \nbehind Capirossi, and another vital lesson learned. ‘I'd \ngeared my  bike for the  fastest-possible lap;  that's what \n| used to  do  in  125s because you could run  the  same \nspeed all  race. But  that’s not  possible in 250s: the  tyres \n\nVANS EIN INS \nslide very much, so  you  go  slower through the  corners, \nSO  your gearing ends up too  high.’ \nSecond again at  Mugello and Paul Ricard, he \narrived at  hot  ‘n’  dusty Jarama, outside Madrid, in  mid- \nJune, convinced he  was ready to  win. Once again he \ndid  lead, as  he’d done at  Johor, Mugello and Ricard, \nand once again he jumped off.  If he  thought the  press \nwould cut  him  some slack during his apprenticeship, he \nwas very wrong. He’d made a  few mistakes on  track \nand now he would make his  first off  it:  naively under- \nestimating the  fickleness of  the media and his  fans. \n‘Very many journalist, who | thought were my  friends, \nsaid: “Rossi won very many 125 races but  250s aren't \nthe  same and he’s made mistakes, he’s stupid”. This \nwas really bad  for  me, but  also really good because | \nfound out who my  real friends were. Before then | \nthought | had  more friends than | actually did.’ \nHe  also  copped plenty of flack for  his  post-race jinks \nat Mugello, where he stopped on  the  slowdown lap and \nchanged into beach gear, riding back to  the  podium \nceremony in  flip-flops. ‘People said bad things about \nthat. It’s  like  if you  win  every race of your career you're a \ngenius, but  if you  finish second you're a facking clown!’ \nDespite the  media casino, Valentino was having as \nmuch fun  as  ever between races; playing football and \nracing minimoto, motocross and radio-controlled cars \nwith Melandri, who'd just started his  first 125 GP \nseason. His  weakest point was motocross. ‘So  I'd  ring \nMarco, tell  him we  don’t need to  ride today, then do  a \nA SS: 1  @) \nSO nt TAE \nNIE e es Ger lat et Gass EIN \nfew hours riding in secret!’ \nThe nights were just  as  hectic. ‘The Saturday before \nJarama we  went to a crazy club in  Riccione —  a lot of people \nout  of their minds, really high, it’s incredible what the young \ndo  for  enjoyment! And | nearly got  into  a  fight. This guy \nasked me  for a cigarette and | told him | don’t smoke, so  he \nasked me  again, then he  said: “You won't give me  a \ncigarette because you're Rossi,” he wanted a fight!’ \nThere were other reasons he needed bigger \nmuscles. ‘|  never did  any proper training when | was \nriding 125s because the  bikes are  like  bicycles. Then at \nthe  end  of '97  everyone said | need to  go to  the  gym to \nbe stronger for the  250, but  | don’t go  because | don’t \nlike. At  Jarama it’s  very bumpy, | wasn’t in  control of \nthe  bike, that's when | understood | need more power. \nSo  my  mentality changed, | started going to  the  gym \nand now it’s  one of my  passions, if | don’t go  for  some \ndays | get  frustrated. | think I’m  in  good shape now, \nwith very much more power than two years ago.’ \nThe weekend before the Dutch GP  the  season's \nhalfway point, Valentino and some of  his  real mates \nscootered six  miles down the  road to  play the  fan  at \nthe  Misano World Superbike round. ‘It was like  being a \nkid  again, we  just laid  in  the  grass by the  side of  the \ntrack, sunbathed and watched the  racing.’ And in  the \nevening he  joined Yamaha's larger-than-life Supers \nhero Noriyuki Haga for some serious drowning of \nsorrows. The Japanese had crashed out  of  both races \nthat day and  astonished Vale with his drinking ability. \n\nbias \nte \n. \nboredom between \npractice sessions \nat  the \nSachsenring. \n(Milagro) \n\nVALE SOT )  NO ROSS! @) ooING Figs clon \nAssen next and the  big breakthrough. His  hair  dyed \nbright orange for  the  occasion, although unaware of \nthe colour's significance to  the Dutch crowd, he \nmotored into  the  lead ‘like | was in a  plane’ and  won by \n20  seconds. Capirossi and Harada both stopped with \nbike problems. \nBrazzi was impressed: ‘It  took Valentino half a \nseason to  get  used to  the  250. The biggest problem \nthat most riders face when they move up  from 125s is \nthat 250s move around more, they're more nervous, \nboth on  the  power and  in their general handling behav- \niour. Initially, that nervousness gave him some \nproblems; he  didn’t like  it when the bike started sliding \naround, but he  soon understood that’s the way it  is, \nand after a  while he  realised that just because the  bike \nis sliding doesn’t mean he's going to  crash. Then he \nunderstood how to  use  the  sliding to  his  advantage, \njust as  he did  in 500s.’ \nHis  team-mates’ Assen DNFs brought Valentino to \nwithin 19  points of  series leader Harada, although he \nhardly dared believe he  was ready to  race for  the  title. \nJust as  well, because he  crashed again at  Donington, \ncaught out  by a full  tank of gas  and hard race tyres. It \nwas the  end of a  miserable weekend, Italy crashing out \nof the  football World Cup on  Friday night. \nIn Germany, two  weeks later, he was  a chastened third \nbehind winner Harada and  Jeremy McWilliams’s privateer \nHonda. ‘Maybe | could've made second on  the  last  lap, \nbut  after Donington | had very much fear of  crashing \n= ANTS Ye Cri ints: ke Sen \nagain.’ The weekend at  the  tortuous new Sachsenring \nwasn't entirely wasted, however. ‘Il  realised |  was. still \nhaving problems with slow corners on  the  250. They're \ndifficult because you  need to  go  slow mid-corner, then lift \nthe  bike really quickly and give gas  when you're on  the \nfatter part of the  rear  tyre, like  Doohan used to.’  He  was \nalready laying the foundations for his drive to  500s. \nBut  it only took a  few  weeks off to  forget that hard- \nlearned lesson. He  spent the  mid-season break largin’ it \nin Tunisia with Reggiani, Melandri & Co. and returned to \nBrno rested and ready to  race. This time he  lasted just \nfour corners before falling. ‘It  was possible | win but  | \nmade the mistake because the fight between me, \nCapirossi and  Harada was  too  much. Everyone say  again: \n‘Rossi was Okay with the  best 125  but  now he  has  same \n250 as  other guys, it’s another story’. After Brno | took all \nthe negative power and transformed it  into positive \npower. | don’t know how, | think | just understood better, \nso  | became a  lot  calmer. It was a  very bad time, but  | \narrived at the  next races harder and  more focused.’ \nJust  four races remained in which he might prove to \neveryone that he was more than just  a  fast fool;  two in \nEurope —  Imola and Catalunya —  and two outside — \nAustralia and  Argentina. Valentino won the lot,  pushing \nCapirossi into second on  each occasion. And he  did  so \nin  style, wearing a  tricolor hairdo at   Imola and, still \nunable to  resist playing the  clown, riding his  Catalunya \nvictory lap with a  chicken on  the  pillion. Well, a  friend \ndressed up  as  a  chicken.

Harada had  been running second \nat the last-but-one turn, good enough for the title, when \nCapi arrived at warp-factor five, wiping out the Japanese \nrider to  claim the  crown for  himself. That left  Valentino \njust shy  of  winning the championship, too close for \ncomfort: ‘I lose the title  by just three points, shit!’ \nLooking back at his first  250 season, he had  done a \nlot of growing up,  he was no  longer the  naive teenager \nmerely out  for some fun. ‘That summer changed me  in \nlife and as  a  rider, it was a  bad period but  maybe neces- \nsary. | very much change my  comportment in  the \nPUNK Y Gm i6 Kk EIN \npaddock, when | am  with people who are not my \nfriends. | become more clever and less impulsive, so \nwhen | speak with journalists | stay more quiet, because \nit’s  like  the  police: “What you  say  may be  used against \nyou”. But  when | am  Valentino, in  my  mind and with \nmy  friends, | maybe became less  serious, maybe have \nmore fun, because it’s  necessary.’ \nDuring 1998 racing also ceased to  be  playtime and \nhis  250 rivals weren't playmates. ‘In  125s everyone is \nlike a  family, everyone stays friends, it’s  not like  that in \n250s,’ he  said halfway through the  year. ‘| don't like \nthe  way some 250 riders behave. Before | came into \n250s a  lot of them were my  heroes, but  not  any  more. \nSome guys like  Ukawa get  in my  way and  try and slow \nme  down when I'm  on a fast  qualifying lap. Then they \nsay  they didn’t see  me, but  for  sure they did, no  one \never did that when | was in  125s.’ \nNo  worries; he’d teach them. He  knew he  didn’t \nneed to  change much for  1999, just his  alter ego: out \nwith Rossifumi, in with Valentinik. ‘We needed a  super- \nhero to  come back from the  bad situation of  ‘98. We \nwere preparing to  win in  ‘99, so  we  chose a  superhero \n73 \n\nbased on  Italian comic hero Paparinik.

Paparino becomes a \nsuperhero and becomes Paparinik, so  Valentino became a \nsuperhero and  became Valentinik!’ Simple, really... \nAnd the  1999 world title  could hardly have looked \neasier. Vale was now solo numero uno at  Aprilia, \nHarada having graduated to  the  factory's 500 twin, \nCapirossi back at  Honda after getting the  flick for  his \nBuenos Aires indiscretion. But if  HRC had squeezed \nmore speed from their NSR, the  bike was still  slower \nthan the  Aprilia, although marginally faster than the \nsluggish but sweet-handling YZRs of  Yamaha's new \nchallengers Olivier Jacque and  Shinya Nakano. \nThe 16-race campaign began true to  the  Valentinik \nscript: bike trouble at  Malaysia’s new space-age venue \nSepang and a  dismal seventh in  pouring rain at \nHonda's grim new Motegi circuit; ‘I still  don’t like  riding \nunder the water,’ he explained. \nBack to  Europe, already a worrying 21  points down \non  joint series leaders Capirossi and Nakano. Time for \nanother miracle renaissance. ‘But this was different \nfrom '98, | was in a deeper hole in ‘98,  this  time | arrive \nat  Jerez relaxed and, no  problem, | win.’ He  coolly \ndefeated Ukawa’s NSR, Nakano retiring with bike \ntrouble, and celebrated in  hilarious fashion, dumping \n74a \nhis  RSW on  its side and  diving into  a trackside Portaloo. \n‘On the  Thursday | was jogging around the  track \nwith Uccio and  we  saw  this  toilet. | thought: ‘Why they \nhave just one toilet out  here, all  alone?’ So  | say: “For \nsure, if | win | go  in.”  When he  reappeared, the  crowd \nwent berserk. \nTwo weeks later it was Valentino's turn to  suffer \nbike trouble. Cruising to  an  easy win at  Ricard his \nAprilia’s drive chain jumped the  sprockets, leaving him \nlanguishing trackside and fourth on  points, 40  down \non  race winner Ukawa. Now there was a  mountain to \nclimb. ‘I  found myself in  a  strange situation. | was \nfighting for  the  title with Ukawa and though | knew | \nwas faster, |  knew |  couldn't afford one mistake \nbecause the  gap would increase to 60  points and  I'd be \nfacked. | always knew in  my  mind that | could beat \nUkawa, but  if he  kept finishing second it'd  take eight \nraces just to catch him. So | stay quiet and  relaxed.’ \nFrom here on  in,  he  rode the knife edge like a \nmaster. He  won eight of  the last 12  races, finished \nsecond twice and  third once, only missing the  podium \nat  rainy Valencia, still  struggling with that water stuff. \nPoor Ukawa didn’t know what had  hit him. \nThe rout had begun on  home tarmac at  Mugello, \nValentino's special home-race leathers and bodywork \nresplendent in swirly Seventies-style graphics, \nproclaiming ‘Valentinipeace&love’.

The  Italians \nwent crazy, it was a  nightmare, | think | would die.’ \nTwo weeks later at  Catalunya, another win and \nfastest lap,  Ukawa yapping at  his  heels all  the  way, but \nwell covered at  every turn. The next Saturday at  Assen \nhe  looked very ragged, very unRossi, as  Capirossi \nwreaked revenge, beating him by a  fraction, with \nUkawa, Nakano and Briton Jeremy McWilliams right in \nthere too. ‘Assen wasn’t a  race, it was a  battle. That \nsometimes happens, you stop with the  right lines and \njust fight, like  remove one  chip from your brain and put \nin another. It was me  against Capirossi, and, fack, | lost.’ \nAt  least he'd got something of a  buzz in qualifying, \nbettering Biaggi’s previously unbeaten 1995 pole \nrecord. ‘The Aprilia mechanics who worked with Biaggi \n76 \n.

After the  final \nsession | couldn't resist going into  their pit and  having a \nlittle laugh at  them!’ The  achievement mattered all the \nmore because Assen is considered GP  racing's ultimate \ntest of  rider talent. ‘It’s  like  a  horizontal rollercoaster,’ \nsaid Valentino, already wondering what it might be  like \non  a  500. ‘No  problem on  a  125, a little problem on  a \n250 and maybe a very big problem on  a  500. Watching \nthe  500s there is scary, they’re so  fast  and  wobbling all \nover!’ \nDuring July he  paid back Capirossi, beating him  by \na  fraction at  Donington and Sachsenring, and all  of  a \nsudden he  was leading the  championship.

Luck was on  his  side once again, \nhowever, because closest points-challenger Ukawa \nlimped in  12th after a  mid-race tumble. \nThe  next day he was holed up in an  Imola hotel room, \nholding the first of  many secret meetings with HRC \npersonnel. ‘They wanted me  to say yes or  no  immediately, \n77 \n\nVA AT Ne) noss!@ \nbut | said: “Sorry, | want to  win 250 before | make \ndecision”. The hard thing for  me  was leaving Brazzi’s \nteam because they'd become like family to  me.  But  | told \nBrazzi then, “If | win title, my work in 250 is finished” .’ \nAfter an  eighth-place finish at  rainy Valencia the \ncircus headed out of  Europe for  the last four races, \nValentino pursued everywhere he  went by  Honda \nrepresentatives and an  ever-growing pack of  spying \nItalian journalists, gathered here and there in  conspira- \ntorial huddles. At windswept Phillip Island he somehow \nmanaged to  keep his  head in the  midst of the  feeding \nfrenzy, recovering from a  bruising crash in qualifying to \nwin a  classic four-way battle with Jacque, Ukawa and \nNakano. ‘During practice we  didn't have so  much rear \ngrip and eventually we realised it  was a  gearbox \nproblem; the  gearing was too  tall  so  | wasn’t able to \ntransfer weight to  the  rear tyre when | was getting on \nthe gas. My mechanics lowered the gearing on \nSaturday evening and  that made the  difference.’ \n78 \nFUNKY CHIGigew Bros NS ils Ee \nWhile his  crew toiled on  his  RSW he sneaked across \nthe  makeshift Phillip Island paddock —  all  Portakabins \nand corrugated sheds —  to  visit the  HRC pit.  Inside was \nJerry Burgess, Doohan’s crew chief who'd been \ntwiddling his  thumbs ever since the Aussie’s bone- \ncrunching crash at  Jerez. Burgess was the man who \nwould be  looking after Valentino if he  did  make the \nswitch and  this  was their first meeting. \n‘It was like  when | first met Mick way back in  ‘88; \nthe important thing was to  listen and to  understand \nwhat he would want from us  if he were to join Honda,’ \nrecalls JB.  ‘Then | showed him  over the  NSR500 and  he \nlistened to everything, took it all on  board, even though \n| wasn't doing a  salesman deal on  him because he \nwanted a  Honda, he  knew it was the  bike to  do the job \nin  500s. He  was very quiet, which | always think is a \ngreat sign of intelligence. | pretty much said to  him  that \nif he  got to  the  top  of Honda's pyramid of riders, we'd \ndo whatever he wanted to  make things work.’ \n\nSST IIN GS \nAersrs | \nVeo IN iN @ \n793 \n\nWAS EN Tal Nee nhoss!@) cone THE FUNKY Ch Vela \nOne close look at  Honda's money-no-object NSR \nwas enough to  make up  Valentino's mind. ‘When | see \nthe  bike up  close | say: “This is  the  bike, maybe it's \nnecessary we  go to  500”.’ \nDirectly ‘from Melbourne to  South Africa, for  the \nfirst GP  at  the brand-new and only just completed \nWelkom venue outside a  gold-mining town fallen on \nhard times. Once again, Valentino and his  crew battled \nset-up problems. ‘We always struggled at.  slippery, \nbumpy circuits because the Aprilia has such a  stiff \nchassis’, but  he won anyway. By now there was a sense \nof the  relentless about the  racing; after a  messy start \nhe  casually brushed aside all  opposition to  head home \nNakano’s easier-handling YZR. If things kept going like \nthis  he’d clinch the  title  at  Rio  in a fortnight. \nThe Italian media could barely contain themselves, \ntheir hysteria tweaked more by rumours that he  was \ndefecting to  Honda than by his genius stroll to the title. \nHe  found the  fuss hilarious: ‘They make a  big  casino \nbecause | will  be racing against Biaggi for the  first  time. \nFor  sure Biaggi will  be  difficult to  beat, especially in my \nfirst year. He’s one of  the  best 500 riders, but  at  the \nend of  the day he’s only another rider.’ The papers \ncould see  exactly what was coming. \nAt  Rio he  came back from another sluggish \ngetaway to  hunt down Capirossi, Ukawa, and Jacque, \nthen saunter past to  take his  ninth win  and collect the \ncrown. Not only that, he  also became the  youngest \n250 world champ, taking the  record away from the \nlate  Mike Hailwood who'd been 21  when he won the \ntitle in  1961. Valentino had  flown 20  members of  his \nfan  club to  Brazil for  the  occasion and celebrated with \na  riotous party at  a  nearby yacht club, where he  was \ntossed fully dressed into  the  swimming pool. That same \nevening he  made another clandestine visit to  a  hotel \nroom, where he  met the  men from HRC once again. ‘| \nsay to the  Japanese: “Okay, we  are  ready” .’ \nAprilia still  had a  bigger pile  of cash on  the  table, \ntheir deal reputedly worth £2.3 million, although he \nrefuses to  talk numbers. ‘I always knew Honda would \nbe  less money but  at  that point in  my  career | never \nthink about money because it’s  necessary to  concen- \ntrate on   racing.’ Although the fine details were \nthrashed out  at  a  later date, Valentino was destined to \nbe  his  own one-man team, outside of  the Repsol \nHonda clique, which allowed him to  run his  own \nsponsors, his  own livery and his  own favourite colour. \n‘When | make this  kind of decision | try to  go  the  way \nthat gives me  the most freedom. So  with Nastro \nAzzurro and my  other sponsors | can make a  yellow \nbike. Yellow is my colour, like 46  is my  number.’ \nIt was back to business the following Sunday for the \nseason finale in  Argentina, where an  incorrect tyre \nchoice left  him third behind Jacque and Ukawa. Or \nmaybe his  mind had been on  other things: Aprilia had \ngenerously granted him an  early release from his \ncontract, so  HRC had  booked Jerez for  his first  500  test \njust four weeks hence. Okay, he could ride  a 250  but... \n= \n\nCelebrating the \ntitle at  Rio '99. \nThere are those \nwho suspect that \nValentino always \nrides with angels. \n(Gold &  Goose) \n- 81 \n\n\n\nVEE IE ING IiINE@ rossi ©) « =  = 3p \nAll  the racetrack and a little bit  more, that’s always \nbeen Valentino's style. His  signature is the  flurry of dirt \nkicked up  from trackside as  he carves an  extravagantly \nwide line in  search of  the  fastest launch out of  a \ncorner. It's a  perilous technique, especially on a \nviciously overpowered motorcycle like  an  NSR5OO. It’s \ntempting fate, then giving fate the  finger, and that’s \nexactly why he likes doing it. Plus, of course, going that \nextra centimetre is  a key element in his  ability to  magic \nthe  best out  of a  racetrack. \n‘| always like  to  go to the  edge, because it give me \na  power. If | can  exit  a  corner for  ten  laps every time \none  centimetre from the  edge of the  track, | feel  every- \nthing is under control. I’ve  always had a big passion for \nthe  line, for  me  the  line is  like a  poem. My  focus is \nalways for  my  lines to  be  within the  same centimetre \nevery time for  20  laps. This feels good, because you \ncan  do  one fast lap all  with your heart, with the  eyes \nshut, but it’s  not easy to  ride 20 laps like that. \nSometimes | crash because of my  passion for  the  line. \nUccio and Gibo say  ‘Fack, stay 50  centimetres inside’, \nbut  it's my passion.’ \nSito Pons Corner, Jerez, December 1999. Valentino \nis riding out  of the circuit's most important turn, a blind \n85mph right-hander that crosses the brow of a hill, \nthen plunges the rider down into the  track’s fastest \nstraight. He  is  looking stiffer than usual, a  little \nhesitant, nothing like he  had looked 30  days earlier in \nSouth America where he’d been master of  a  96hp \nmotorcycle. Now, here he was a few weeks later, a  190 \nhorse motorcycle very much his  master. He's exiting the \nLN M@Ttan \nomer \ncorner, the  revs building fast, then too  fast  as  the  rear \nslick loses traction and smears sideways, driving the \nmotorcycle off  the  tarmac and across the  kerb where \nhe fights a mother of a tankslapper. He  stays on  but  it’s \nhardly poetry in motion. \n‘Valentino looked a  little awkward on  the bike \ninitially, | mean it's  a  big  step,’ says crew chief Jerry \nBurgess who has  vivid memories of that first test  with \nAlex Criville’s title-winning NSR. ‘| wouldn't say  he  was \nawestruck, he  gave the  impression that he  was pretty \nmuch prepared for anything, but  he was  feeling his way \nthat first  time, he knew he had  some learning to  do.’ \nIf anyone was awestruck, it was Burgess and  his ex- \nDoohan crew: Bernard Ansiau, Alex Briggs, Dickie \nSmart and Gary Coleman. After years of  sweating in \nthe  pressure-cooker of Mick's pit box  they could hardly \nbelieve the aura of  calm in  which they found \nthemselves. Burgess: ‘The guys were like: “Jesus, isn’t \nhe  great?” and | was saying: “Yeah, |  know, it's \nfantastic”. We had to  do  a  complete mind switch \nbecause we'd gone from working for  the  grandfather, \nand thinking like  that, to  getting on  with the  mentality \nof  a  21-year-old. For  me, approaching 50,  that was \nvery enlightening and part of  it  was getting some \nenjoyment out  of the  way Valentino sees life.’ \nPretty soon the guys discovered that Valentino \nwasn't just fun to  work with, he  also had real intelli- \ngence, an  enquiring and analytical mind that would \nallow him to  quickly convince any doubters that he \nreally is one  of the  all-time greats, not  just a  great 125 \nand  250 rider. After a  predictably shaky start, while he \n83 \n\nVEATE EE ING WaINY Gy rossi) « P-Oe ih UN MoS oihieN \nattempted to  locate the  500’s limit, he  swiftly rose up \nto  conquer his  NSR and then the  entire 500 grid. The \ngroup of riders who had been elevated to the  status of \ntitle fighters by  Doohan’s crunching exit from racing \nonly enjoyed the briefest moment of  glory before \nValentino had them done and dusted. His  13  500 GP \nvictories from the next two seasons exceed even \nDoohan’'s win rate; 40.6 per  cent to  39.4 per  cent. \nAfter Jerez, Burgess’s first job  was to  revise the \nNSR‘s riding position for  its  gangly new pilot, then get \ndown to  the  task of  adapting every facet of  machine \nperformance to  suit his  riding style. ‘From the start \nValentino was very open about any problems he  was \nhaving with the  500,’ he  says. ‘And when we  made \nmodifications he  was very open about whether they \nwere an  improvement or  not. We  quickly learned that \nhe’s very good at  working on  set-up. When he  comes \ninto  the  pits  he’s  like  a  computer. He  gives you a list of \nsix  or  eight things he  wants looking at, like a \ndownload. He's more analytical than the  rest  of them. | \nthink we  have a  lot  to  thank his  parents for  because \nthey gave us  a  kid  who can think logically and also \nAprilia, who gave him  the  training so  he  can  say  what \nthe problem is  and whether we're making the bike \nbetter or  worse. But  back at the start we  could see  that \nhe was looking forward more to the  racing.’ \nThere was much to  learn before the season started, \nalthough things were looking pretty rosy. After all, he’d \njust joined the  factory that had  won every 500 riders’ \nand manufacturers’ title since 1994, so  there was. no \ndoubt he'd got  his  hands on  the  best 500. No  doubt, \nat  least, until the  2000 season actually started, when it \nquickly became apparent that something had gone \nvery, very wrong with the  NSR. This was the  year that \nHonda lost  the  riders’ crown to  Suzuki's Kenny Roberts \nand  its manufacturers’ title to Yamaha. \nThe reasons for  the upheaval in  factory fortunes \nwere several. Suzuki and Yamaha were trying harder \nthan ever, and their riders, especially Roberts and \nMarlboro Yamaha's Max Biaggi, were coming nicely to \nthe  boil. Also, Doohan was no  longer around at  HRC, \nwhich put Criville top of  the pyramid. Without the \nAussie’s guiding light HRC were lost  in  the  darkness, \nthe  engineers making the mistake of  listening to  a \n84 \nrider, well, listening to  a  rider who didn’t really know \nwhat he wanted. \n‘It's  like  Honda did  with Wayne Gardner when he \nwon the  title in ‘87,’ explains Burgess, who had  guided \nthe  rodeo-riding Aussie to the  500  crown after working \nwith triple world champ Freddie Spencer. ‘They asked \nwhat Wayne wanted and he  asked for  more power. \nThat's what Alex asked for  too. More power is easy \nenough, so  long as  you  can  open the  throttle, but  the \nnew engine was very different in  terms of  power \ndelivery. Later on  an  HRC engineer told me  that Mick \nwouldn't have done half a  lap with the  2000 engine, \nso  | asked the  guy: “Why the  hell  would you make it \nthen?”, but  it was what Alex wanted. Alex didn’t have \nthe experience, he'd always just followed along in \nMick's slipstream, beating him  from time to  time when \nthings went his way.’ \nIncredibly Valentino clocked the dodgy power \ndelivery the very first time he rode the  new NSR  at Phillip \nIsland in  early 2000. It  took HRC’s more experienced \nmen longer to  realise they’d got  a  serious problem. ‘All \nthe power had been moved to  the top, so  there was \nnothing there when you  were fully leaned over in  the \nmiddle of the corner, so  you'd give it some more throttle \nand there’d be too  much power,’ Burgess explains. ‘He \nsaid it felt  too neutral in  the  middle of  the  corners.’ \nWhich is how Valentino crashed on  that first outing. \nNo  worries; by round one at  Welkom he  was well \nup to  speed, qualifying just a  tenth of a second off the \nfront row. He  also set the fastest lap of  the race, \nmoments before he crashed out, losing his  NSR right in \nthe  middle of  a  turn, like  it just rolled over and died. \nAussie terrier of  slide Garry McCoy won the race, \nCarlos Checa second on  a  Yamaha, and Loris Capirossi \nthird on  a  ‘99  NSR. Same deal at  round two; Valentino \nlow-level flying into  a  heap again, this  time Roberts the \nwinner ahead of  Checa and McCoy. The factory \nHondas were nowhere once more and  within HRC the \naccusations began to fly. \nBurgess could see  from the  computer readouts why \nValentino was crashing and why the  other NSR riders \nwere struggling, but  was unable to  do  much about it \nvia  HRC. ‘Valentino was the  new boy on  the  block, \nfourth in  the  pecking order behind the  Repsol guys: \n\nVA EEN TIN © ross! ©) « Bera IN MOTION \nAlex, Tady (Okada) and Sete (Gibernau). Plus he’d got \nno  points on  the board so  we  couldn't go  in  there \nscreaming and shouting.’ \nYet despite Valentino's deadly unimpressive start, \nHRC didn’t take long to   realise they had _ hired \nthemselves an  exceptional talent. While the  media were \nalready wondering If he’d got  what it takes to  cut  it in \n500s, HRC had  some definitive evidence suggesting that \nhe surely would. His  data traces didn’t only highlight the \nNSR’s problems, they also  showed that Valentino already \nhad more refined throttle control, the  essential weapon \nin  a  500 rider's armoury, than other HRC riders like \nCriville, veteran of more than a  hundred 500  starts. \nHRC was also impressed with Valentino's fighting \nspirit. ‘He  was carving through the  pack at Welkom and \nSepang, trying to  do  what he  thought he  could do,’ \nrecalls Burgess. ‘So  they'd seen that he  had the  deter- \nmination to  get  the  bike to  the  front and this is what's \nvery much rewarded at  Honda. Anyone who just rides \naround doesn’t get a  lot of say,  but  there’s always hope \nfor  the  guy  who pushes hard, even if he  falls down, it’s \nlike: “We can  work with this  guy”.’ \nValentino didn't know that at  the  time and the  two \ncrashes had rattled his  cage. He  arrived at  Suzuka for \nround three physically and  psychologically bruised, and it \nshowed on  the  track: 13th on  the  grid, 11th in the  race, \nhis  worst result since his  earliest 125 GP  days. Perhaps \nthis really was a  class too  far.  ‘Valentino was very, very \nbadly spooked by the  two non-finishes and he was very \nspooked by  the 11th place. Suzuka was a  complete \nshutdown of a guy  who could've done better.’ \nAfter Japan the  circus returned to  Europe. Would \n8S5 \n\nVALEN TUN '®@ ross! ©)“ \nValentino get  it  together on  more familiar tarmac, or, \nhaving started digging himself a  hole, would he \ncontinue to  dig? The  comeback at  round four in  Spain \nwas as  emphatic as  those he’d managed in  125 and \n250: first front-row 500 start and first podium behind \nRoberts and Checa. New engines parts, or  rather old \n‘99  parts, had arrived for Jerez and Valentino was back \non  a  bike that he could work with. \n‘Once we  got to  Europe we  started to  kick  off,’ says \nBurgess who had quickly established an   excellent \nworking relationship with his  new charge. ‘You didn’t \nhave to  be  Einstein to  work out  what he  was capable \nof.  The  talent was obviously there for  anyone to  see, so \nlong as  he was kept happy and kept in the  right frame \nof mind. So  | was emphatic with the team and  everyone \naround us,  | told them that this  guy isn’t going to  fail \nunless we  fail  him  and  the  only way we  can  fail  him  is if \nhe’s not happy within this team network. So  the \nnumber one  priority is to  keep him  happy.’ \nRacing Is all  in the  mind, so  Burgess's job is to  ooze \nconfidence, to  instill his  rider with the belief that he \nreally can  go that extra two tenths faster. ‘In  this  game \nit's  80  per  cent in  the  rider's head and 20  per  cent in \nthe machine,’ he  says. ‘So  if your rider wants gold \nhandlebars, you give him gold handlebars.’ Or  you do \nif he  knows what he’s talking about and Burgess had \nalready sussed that Valentino knows exactly what he \nwas talking about. ‘There are  some riders who don’t \nknow what they want, they ask  for  stuff simply out  of \nthe  frustration of  not  obtaining decent lap  times; so \nPs ean, SMO Sree \nyou could move the geometry all  around and then \nnobody knows what's going on.  The  old  KISS principle \ndoesn't work too  badly on  a  motorcycle: keep it simple, \nstupid.’ Burgess is an  arch-pragmatist. While some rival \nengineers vainly attempt to  reinvent the  wheel to  give \ntheir rider an  advantage, he  stays firmly grounded in \nthe  realms of the  possible, his  fundamental attitude to \nhis job  summed up  by his  father's racing principle, the \nfive  Ps:  perfect preparation prevents poor performance. \nBut  Valentino's astounding gift  for  understanding \nand  analysing machine performance was  about to show \nBurgess that the realms of  the possible could be \nexpanded. At  Le  Mans, all  second-gear hairpins, he \nspirited himself through the  pack after a  so-so start, \nsetting a  new lap record as  he  caught leaders Roberts, \nCriville and  Yamaha's Norick Abe. This was his first  time \nproperly up  front and his  first real opportunity to \ncompare himself to  his rivals and their machines. \n‘Valentino really started to  talk about the  bike after Le \nMans. He  said that where Alex had  wheeispin, he  also \nhad wheelspin, but at  that same point Abe’s Yamaha \nwould still  be driving forward with traction. That’s when \nwe  started the ball rolling for  the NV4A, the derivative \nNSR which we  used for  the  last  few races of  2000, \nwhich developed into  the  NV4B he used in 2001.’ \nTwo weeks later was the  biggest day of his  life:  the \nItalian GP  at  Mugello and his  first premier-class race on \nhome tarmac. Whole hillsides tinged yellow by his fans, \noutbreaks of  Biaggi red here and there. Valentino's \nshaky start was fast  being forgotten by the  media who \n\nVie SIS LIN © rossi ©) A Ooo SiN) eM ear he iN \nwere now Salivating at  the  prospect of  the  first Rossi \nversus Biaggi duel. Whoever was writing the  script was \ndoing a  great job: two Italian fighters set  for  a home- \ntown brawl, no, make that three, Capirossi was up \nthere too. One nation, three gladiators. \nQualifying was super close, the  trio  split by 0.132 \nseconds: Biaggi second, Rossi third, Capirossi fourth, \nAlex Barros on  pole. The race was even closer, the  trio \ntrading blows out front, no  doubt about it,  this was \ngoing to  end in  tears. One and a half laps to  go  and \nValentino hit  the  attack button, slid  into the  lead, then \nlost the front and fell at  the next turn. Doohan, \nrecently appointed HRC general manager to  keep an \neye  on  Honda's young chargers, had  seen it all coming: \n‘He  started riding the  bike like  a  250, running pretty \ndeep into corners, he  just got in  there too hot  and \nloaded up the front.’ \nBiaggi lasted another lap  before colliding with \nCapirossi and falling, leaving Capirex to  cruise across \nthe  line. Burgess had found the  entire weekend an \nenlightening experience. ‘| was unaware of  what the \nMax/Valentino thing was about, | pretty much thought \nit was a  media thing. | didn't know that Italy only \nbecame a  country in  1871, so  a  lot  of the  regions still \ndon't like  each other.’ Too  right, it’s  Italy's north-south \ndivide, the mezzogiorno, one of  the reasons the pair \nare  apparently irreconcilable. Biaggi is Roman, he’s  old- \nschool Italian, resides in  Monaco and has  tea  with the \nPope; Valentino is from the  Marches region, he’s new- \nskool Italian, hangs out  in  London and goes clubbing \nwith his mates. \nSo their first  clash had  ended nil-all; it wouldn't be \ntheir last. From now on  every time they were in  the \nsame room together, usually only when duty called for \npre- and post-race press conferences, the  air  crackled \nwith animosity. Words would not  be spoken, their eyes \nwould never meet, and  yet somehow they managed to \nkeep a lid on  it for another year. \nAt Catalunya Valentino rode his first  wet 500 race, \neasing home third like  he'd been doing it all  his  life, \nand remember this was the  man who hated riding \n‘under the  water’. Thirteen years earlier three-time 500 \nchamp Wayne Rainey had  ridden his  first  wet 500 GP, \nwatched by his  father. Sandy was awestruck, petrified \nby these meanest of machines, ‘these things that don’t \neven want you  on  their backs,’ as  he called them. True, \nrain tyres and digitally controlled power curves had \ncome a  long way since ‘88  and Catalunya’s designer \nturns aren't the  cold-steel lined sweepers of  Spa, but \nthis was another moment that history seemed to \nwhisper his  name. While all  around people were losing \ntheir heads —  the  race turned into something of a  crash \nfest  —  Valentino kept his,  gleefully juggling the  throttle, \ntwisting his  NSR sideways out  of the  turns. \nAt  Assen he  came in  sixth after threatening the \nleaders before the  rain  came down. Two weeks later at \nDonington, more rain, for this was the year that \nswollen grey clouds followed the circus everywhere. \nUsing wets on  a  drying track, Valentino jostled with \nchampionship leader Roberts and Jeremy McWilliams, \nsmokin’ his overheating rear  tyre as  he  launched out  of \nturns to  win by  a  fraction. His  first 500 victory had \nhardly come as  a surprise. \nHis  next ride, to  second at  the Sachsenring, was \neven more impressive. He  may have been learning the \nart  of  500 riding with astounding speed but he  still \nhadn't acquired the  ability to  launch a  190hp/130kg \nmotorcycle from the grid, a  delicate balancing act \nrequiring immaculate throttle/clutch interaction. Too \nmuch throttle, too much clutch and it's  loop-the-loop \ntime, too  little and you  get wasted on  the  dash to  turn \none. Valentino got  destroyed, 16th at  the  end of  the \nfirst lap, and this at a tortuous track where it’s  reckoned \nthere's little or  no  room for  overtaking. So  he  made \nsome, conjuring lines that others seemed incapable of \nusing, making fools of  500 racing’s great and good as \nhe  picked them off wherever he  pleased. With five  laps \nto  go  he  was ahead, then he  bungled the  final lap, \ncrossing the  line eight hundredths behind Barros. \n‘I'm very used to  coming from the  back because \nI've  never been a  very good starter, it was the  same in \n125 and 250. Like at  Barcelona 2001, | started from \npole but was almost last at  the first corner after | \ncollide with someone. Maybe other riders would have \nthought “Oh  fack, we're lost”, but  | did  the  same in \n250  there in ‘99  and  the  same at Sachsenring in 2000, \njust stay calm and go.  It's  always been quite easy for \nme  to  overtake anywhere, but | don’t think that’s \n87 \n\nbecause I’m  better than the  other guys, just because | \ntry.  Many other riders say  that it's  very hard to  overtake \nat  the  Sachsenring, okay so  it is,  but  if you try,  maybe \nit’s  not  very hard.’ If only it was that easy for everyone. \nAfter Germany the  little matter of the  Suzuka Eight \nHours. This classic event, acted out in  Japan's high \nsummer of  withering 35° heat and 80  per cent \nhumidity, is the  most important event in  the  world to \nHonda because of  its  influence on the massive \ndomestic bike market. The roll  call  of winners includes \nillustrious names like Doohan, Rainey, Gardner and \nEddie Lawson, all  of them former 500 kings. But  most \nGP  riders loathe the  race, finding it an  awkward distrac- \ntion from the  real  job of winning the  World Champion- \nship. Not  only can  the  switch to  unfamiliar four-stroke \nmachinery affect their 500 riding, but the factories’ \nobsession with winning the  event demands their stars’ \npresence at  pre-event tests. Poor Valentino had  to  go to \nJapan not once but twice during the five weeks \npreceding the  race, delivering two doses of  strength- \nsapping jetlag. Then again, he  had asked for  it.  While \nDoohan had  spent years fighting to  get the  Eight Hours \nscrubbed from his  HRC contract, Valentino had volun- \nteered for  the  job. ‘I  always love Eight Hours from \nwhen | was young because | love the  Japanese colours \nand graphics. When | was at  Aprilia | push very hard \nwith Jan  Witteveen (Aprilia’s technical chief) to  race an \nRSV Mille there. Also | want to  try a  Superbike, | want \nto  ride  with Superbike riders, see  their level.’ \nSo  here was another question: okay, so  he  could \nride 125, 250 and 500 two-strokes but how would he \ncope with the  very different demands of a four-stroke? \nThis wasn't merely idle contemplation, there was a \ncrucial significance to  his  Eight Hour performance \nbecause GP  racing was awaiting a  landmark shift in \ntechnical regulations. From 2002 the premier class \nwould be going four-stroke. \nSurprise, surprise, Valentino had little trouble \nadapting to  the  factory SP-1 Superbike he’d share with \nrace partner Colin Edwards, who went on  to  win the \n2001 World Supers crown. He  found the  softer, heavier \nSP-1 easy to  ride and deceptively quick. ‘The bike is \nincredible, it feels slow but the lap  time is almost the \nsame as  with the  NSR. You can ride the  Superbike at \nNow he’s getting \nthe hang of it, \nleading Roberts, \nCheca, Barros \nand Biaggi at \nMugello.

With 500 you can \nride it  100 per cent maybe three or  four times a \nseason, and when you use  the  500 at  100 per  cent, it’s \nnot  like  different class, it’s  like  different sport.’ Is easy \nbut  not  that easy —  Vale and his  American team-mate \nled  the race, then they had a  crash each. Situation \nnormal: new bike, necessary find limit. \nAlready GP racing’ biggest star, he was \ndowngraded to  non-person for  the next GP  at  Brno. \nVale had left  his  passport at  home, so  he  smuggled \nhimself over the  Czech border, competing as  an  illegal \nalien. Not that anyone seemed to  notice, let  alone care. \nSecond there and  third in Portugal he now found himself \nhauling in  points leader Roberts. With three races to  go \nhe was 46  points behind the  son  of a  legend, a  long call \nbut  not  impossible. Was he about to change the  habit of \na  lifetime and  win  something at the first  attempt? \nIt  seemed unlikely, since he  was happy to  admit \nthat he  was still  struggling to  get  the  hang of  riding a \n500 and even more so  the  labyrinthine art  of  refining \nthe  bike's settings to  suit  his  style. ‘I still  have problems \nunderstanding the  500, | still  can't use  100 per  cent of \nthe  bike,’ he  said in  Portugal. What he  really wanted \nwas to  ride a  500 like his  childhood heroes, the ‘Old \nDogs’ as  he  called them, brave men like Schwantz, \nDoohan, Rainey and Gardner who raced with reckless \nthrottle hands, kicking out the bike’s ass end and \ngetting ‘kinda squirrelly’. ‘They were the true 500  riders \nand  my  dream is to  use  a  500  like  those guys.’ \nHe'd get  there very soon but  not  just yet.  His title \ncharge ended in  the gravel at  Valencia after he'd \nteetered on  the  brink once too  often, asking too much \nedge grip from the front tyre, still  riding the thing like  it \nwas a  250. He  effectively crashed twice in  the  race, \nexcept he  somehow managed to  save the  first. This \nwas Vale in  rare rostrum-or-hospital mode. Burgess: \n‘He  pretty much knew that if he  didn’t beat Roberts \nthere then the  title was gone. If he  had beaten him \nthere he  could've kept the  title open right to  the  last \nrace, that was  the  way he saw it.’ \nDown in  Rio  he  bounced back with his  first dry- \nweather 500 win, dismissing Barros, McCoy, Abe and \nBiaggi with a  new-found confidence —  he'd finally \nmanaged to  kick his  250 habits and start riding the \n930 \nNSR like  a  true 500 rider. ‘In  Rio  we  change my  style \nvery much because |  basically crash two times at \nValencia, the first, whooooa,’ he  says, doing a  very \npassable imitation of  his  big  sideways moment. ‘The \nsecond | crash, so  | speak with Jeremy (Vale is one of \nthe  few people who uses JB’s full  Christian name), we \nwatch the  race and understand | need to  change my \nstyle because | make very much crash with the  front \ntyre. Until this race | was quite fast but | ride like  250, \nSo  | always finish the  front tyre after half  the  race.’ \nSo Valentino adapted his cornering lines. He  reduced \nthe  arc  of  corner entry, lowering his  mid-corner speed \nand  focusing all his efforts into  a straight drive out  of the \nturn. That way he  could lay down as  much horsepower \nas  his  rear Michelin would allow and a little bit  more, \nusing the  wheelspin to  get  sideways, pointing his  NSR‘s \nfront end back towards the  inside of the  corner, tight- \nening his  line  and giving him more room to  get  on  the \ngas, which means more speed down the  next straight. \nIt's  like  using the  handbrake in  a  car,  except he  breaks \ntraction with the throttle, not  the  brake. \n‘The perfect line is stay wide, wide, wide and after \nyou  close the  line  and  go  in inside, slowing a little bit to \nthe  apex. With the  250 it’s possible to  do this  and  if you \nmake like  this  with the  500  you  are  very fast  but  when \nyou go  to  close the  line  after seven laps you lose the \nfront and you crash. So  necessary go  inside a little bit \nearly and a little bit  more, use  less  speed in the  corner \nand after pick up  the  bike and accelerate. So  | change \nvery much the  first  part of the  corner. Not  so  much the \nsecond part because when | ride  250 | already ride a little \nbit like  500, picking up the  bike  to accelerate, more than \nother 250  riders. In Rio  | use  less speed in the corner and \nStart to spin the  rear  tyre very much on  the exit. \n‘For  many years | train for  spinning with motocross \nbike because sliding and spinning is  also very much \nfun. But  spinning was impossible with the  250 because \nnot  enough power, so  when | arrive in 500  | want to try \nand | get  better and better. In winter | still  train on  the \ndirt, using a motocross front tyre and  trail-bike rear  tyre \nwith little grip, so  I’m  sideways all  the  time, this  gives \nme  a  big help for sliding the  500.’ \nLike Donington there were no  comedy post-race \ngags at  Rio, just a  loving hug for  his  NSR.

During \n2000 Vale flaunted their thriving relationship with the \npost-race rolling burn-out, a  tricky stunt that became \nhis  favourite way of telling the  world what a  laugh he \nwas having out there. ‘The 250 never had enough \npower but  it's  sweet on  the  500, you  just spin the  tyre \ntill  it gets hot  and  there’s no  grip, then you  only need a \nlittle throttle. | like  it very much.’ \nOnward to  Motegi for  the Pacific GP  where he \ncouldn't catch a  runaway Roberts but  did  defeat Biaggi \nin  a  last-lap duel, their first serious encounter since \nMugello. ‘Passing him,’ he  said afterwards. ‘Was like \nthe  best orgasm.’ One-nil. But  Biaggi had his  revenge \ntwo weeks later, brave winner of  an  epic season- \nending Australian GP,  Capirossi second, Vale third, the \nthree of them separated by just  two tenths.

He  rented a  West-End apartment in \nthe  British capital because he  needed to  get  out  of  Italy \nbut  couldn't handle the  thought of moving to  Monaco, \nthe  VIP  ghetto that is home to  so  many GP  riders, F1 \ndrivers and  other chinless tax  exiles. ‘| could live  there for \ntwo days, but  after that? Is not  the  real  world.’ London is \nthe real world, urban mayhem and gridlock, so  he \nblagged an  SP-1 and a  FireBlade from Honda UK,  then \nsettled on  a  less  hectic CBR600. Most of  all  though he \nwas having fun  descending into London clubland with \nhis  mates who were taking it in  turns flying over from \nItaly to  help him party. In  October he  had split up  with \nlongtime girlfriend Eliane Ferni so  he  was out  on  the \nloose, often at  the upmarket China White Club near \nPiccadilly which counts Prince Andrew amongst its other \nclientele. Oh well, you  can’t have everything. \n91 \n\nOS. \n‘For 500s you \nneed to be quiet, \ncalm and \nthoughtful; more \nlike a  doctor.’ So, \nexit Valentinik, \nenter The Doctor. \n(Gold &  Goose) \n\nWANE EIN Wl ING@ \nPre-ride rituals are vital to  racers. They provide an \nordered system of  preparation devoid of  the unfore- \nseen, so  the rider can maintain his  focus on  his \nmachine and retain all  his  mental capacity to  deal with \nwhatever mayhem might be unleashed on_ the \nracetrack. Like most racers, Valentino's pre-ride \nritualism has  little to  do  with superstition; how could \nany serious racer believe that the  outcome of  a  race \nmight depend on  how he  slips on  his  gloves? No,  it’s \njust a  procedure that allows him  to  prepare as  perfectly \nas  possible for each outing. Through order comes calm, \nso  his  leathers and  back protector are  always laid  out  in \nthe  same neat arrangement in  the  team truck and his \nhelmet and  gloves are  always to  be found in the  same \nplace in the  pits.

Mick used to  do  it, \nhe  used to  spend minutes and minutes putting his \ngloves on.  It  was a  concentration thing, leaving one \nworld behind and preparing to  enter another. A  racer \nambles around the  paddock at  a  few kays, then he’s \ndoing speeds of  300kmh, so  he’s got  to  have his  wits \naround him. All  the  ritual stuff is  like  a  buffer zone \n\nVASE EN TIN © \nrossi ©) winnine VOR RY MM  LING \nbetween those two worlds, it puts the rider's mind in \ngear before he gets on  the  bike.’ \nValentino's post-ride ritual is just as  crucial to  his \nrace-day performance. He  keeps to  a  strict debrief \nregime with JB  and his  crew. ‘After practice we  sit  in \nthe pits for  ten minutes and he'll go  through what \nhappened in that session,’ says Burgess. ‘Then he'll talk \nto  Juan (Martinez, Showa suspension technician) and \nme, making a  lap  on a circuit map, telling us  what's \nhappening with the  bike. During that first conversation \nI'll  ask him if  we'll be  changing the gearbox or \nanything else major, so  we  can  do  a  certain amount of \nwork before he  comes back at  six-ish when he  talks \nwith Juan and myself again, and within 20  minutes \nwe've got  it all done. \n‘Valentino uses his  head, he  thinks and he  thinks \nand he  thinks. He  was great from the moment he \nStarted working with us  at  the  end of  ‘99, but  there \nwas a  big  change in  him from 2000 to  2001, like  he \nwas coming out  of  being a  teenager and becoming a \nman. In 2000 everything had been pretty spontaneous, \nin 2001 things were more methodical and  thought out, \nmore of the  brain side coming in.  | get  the  feeling he \nnow feels he’s an  adult in  an  adult's world, while the \nprevious five years of  his  career had just been good \nfun.’ \nValentino agrees that his  attitude to  life has \nchanged over the  past few years. ‘The way you see \nthings, your view of  the  world, changes between the \nages of  18  and 22,’ he says. ‘I’m older now, so  | think | \nunderstand more, and for  sure my  life  has  changed. \nWhen you're 16  or  17  you  don’t have problems, unless \nit's  something really big  like  family problems. Life is \ndifferent when you're young, you only think about \nhaving fun.’ \nRiding the  500  changed him  too, from boy to  man. \nThe daft victory celebrations faded into memory as  a \nnew-found seriousness took hold. He  was growing up \nanyway and there was no  way he  could remain \nunaffected by the  pressures of  competing in  racing's \nbiggest class on  the  scariest race bikes known to  man. \n‘The jokes also stop because | don’t think a  lot  of \npeople really understood the whole thing.

So  | \ndecided it was better to  stop all this  and  just wave like \nother riders, then have a  big  party on  Sunday night \nwith my  real  friends.’ Plus he  had new responsibilities \nhelping Honda develop two amazing motorcycles, the \nlast-of-the-line NSR500 and the RC211V, HRC'’s V5 \nweapon for the  new four-stroke MotoGP class. \nAll  this was reflected by a  change in  alter ego for \n2001: exit Paparinik, enter The Doctor. ‘We change \nbecause with 500s you don’t need a  superhero, you \njust need to  be quiet, calm and thoughtful, more like  a \ndoctor,’ he  explains. ‘Also, because in  Italy there are \nvery many doctors called Dr  Rossi, so  | became Dr \nRossi.’ The  new nickname could hardly have been more \napt, because he  began 2001 in  immaculate style, \nwinning the  first  three races with surgical precision. \nThe season began at  Suzuka, the circuit that \nSoichiro Honda built in  1962, where success means so \nmuch to  the  world’s biggest bike brand. And this  time \nmore than ever. Honda had won a total of 497 world \nchampionship races since their first GP  win in  1961, so \na  full  house of  125, 250 and 500 victories at  Suzuka \nwould give them their 500th success. But  it had been \nwell over a  year since they had won all  thrée races in \none  day, so  it seemed an  impossible dream that Honda \nwould attain the magic number on  cherished home \ntarmac. Especially since their 125s were well off  the \npace in qualifying. \n‘It  was a  Honda fantasy that they win their 500th \nrace on  that day,’ Vale recalls. ‘It  was incredible, we \nwatched the other races on  TV  and | say: ‘For sure \nHonda won't win 125,’ but  fack, Azuma wins, then in \n250 Kato wins, so  fack, | must win 500.’ And win he \ndid, recovering from a  scary 120mph collision with \nBiaggi to  beat McCoy by less  than a second and  trigger \nmassive celebrations within Honda. The Midas touch \nonce again. \nThis was another of  those days that had one idly \nwondering if the  boy is  perhaps blessed or  if there’s \nwizardry afoot in  his  life.  Valentino's career was appar- \nently evolving into an  implausible plot for  a  cheesy \nHollywood racetrack drama, Days of  Thunder style. \nAnyone could have won Honda's 500th Grand Prix \nvictory and it could have happened in any  class at  any \ntrack, but It didn't, it was Rossi, in  the premier 500 \nclass and  at Suzuka. \nThe  suggestion that greater forces might be at work \nin his  life would keep returning throughout the  next 12 \nmonths or  so,  not  that they’d been entirely absent in \nprevious years. At  Donington in  July he  suffered a \nmassive 125mph get-off during practice and walked \naway to  win the race. Three years earlier the same \ncorner had  almost claimed Checa’s life.  During August's \n\nCzech GP at  Brno a  bee  flew inside his  helmet, flew out \nagain and he  rode on  to  win  the  race. British 500 rider \nLeon Haslam suffered the  same fate that weekend with \nvery different consequences; he  got  stung and went \nblind in one  eye, forcing him  into  the  pits. By the  end  of \nthe  season Valentino had  also won the  closest 500 GP \nin history, at  Phillip Island, and the  final race of the  500 \nera  at  Rio, where a  conveniently placed backmarker \nhelped him beat Checa at  the  very last  turn. Then he \nbegan the  new age of  four-strokes with victory at  the \n2002 Japanese GP,  making it look too  easy on  a flooded \nSuzuka track, like he  was walking on  water. And to \nthink, his father looks like Jesus ... \nOf  course, you can attribute much of  Valentino's \nsuccess and apparent luck to  his  genius, but there’s \nlittle doubt that he  seems to  enjoy more than his  fair \nshare of  historical coincidences and lucky escapes. \nSome people are  just like  that, when things go  right, \nthey keep going right. Or  as  Eddie Lawson once said: \n‘The more | practise, the  luckier | get’. \nWins at Welkom and Jerez completed the  hat-trick \nand these were dominant victories achieved at  a \ndizzying speed, race records smashed at  every track. \nValentino was forcing the  500 pace for  the  first time \nsince Doohan had  disappeared, helped along by a  new \ngeneration of  Michelin slicks. He  had quickly realised \nthat the  French company’s 16.5-inch rear tyre offered \nmuch better grip at  the  end of  races, so  he  made the \neffort to  adapt his  settings to  suit  the  tyre’s different \nprofile, while some of  his  rivals stuck with the easier- \nhandling 17-inch tyre and paid the  price at  the  end of \nraces. Once again he was proving himself to  be  recep- \ntive to  new ideas, all  he  wanted was speed, it didn’t \nmuch matter what the bike felt like. ‘After Mick \nstopped the  500 pace was always slow. | hated that, so \nit was time to  raise the  pace.’ \nAnd there were few that could run with him: \nCapirossi a  lone and firmly defeated rival at  Welkom, \nand no  one to  play with at  Jerez after he'd finished \ntoying with Abe. Valentino, like Doohan before him, \nwas going quicker and quicker, the pack scattered \nbehind him, and for  a  while it looked like 500 racing \nmight return to  those oh-so predictable Doohan days, \nwhen everyone awoke on   Sundays with just one \nquestion on  their minds: who'll get second? \nDoohan, a  hard man to  impress but  mellowing in \nretirement, was moved to  fulsome praise by  his \nprotégé’s lightning form. ‘He's riding the  bike like  it \nshould be  ridden and he  doesn’t feel there’s any \nreward in just running around with the  pack. Some of \nthe  other guys have been caught out a little and guys \nlike  Max need to  learn to  ride the  bike when it's  not \n100 per  cent.

Cheeky. \nThis was the  start of  Biaggi’s tilt  at  the  title. The \nRoman's technicians had made a crucial forward jump \nwith machine settings, and when Valentino crashed \nout of  the rain-lashed Italian GP. his  arch-rival took \nanother chunk out  of  his  points lead. In  the  space of \nthree races his  advantage over Biaggi had  shrunk from \n46  to  21  points and tension was building. At  Catalunya \nit exploded, the  pair going for each others’ throats in a \ncramped ante room after the  race, which Vale had  won \nin  masterful style, recovering from a  disastrous start to \npick off  his  rivals and leave them trailing, Capirossi \nsecond, Biaggi third. The  punch up  between these two \npumped up  racers had  been brewing for years, though \nit was more of an  unseemly brawl than a  man-to-man \nduel. There is  no  impartial record of  exactly what \nhappened because the  pair were out  of view when the \nfight kicked off,  on  their way to  the  post-race TV  inter- \nview room with their various hangers-on. \n‘What happened wasn’t very big  and it  wasn't \nimportant,’ insists Valentino. ‘It  was like being at \nschool: “He started it!” “No, he  started it!” “No, he \nStarted It!”. Biaggi said that | started this  facking shit \nbut it's  necessary to  think about what happened \nbefore. | started the race from last position and | \narrived first at  the  flag, | made the  fastest lap  and | \n| \nmade a  fantastic victory, so  why would | want to  make \nall that shit?’ \nAccording to  one witness, Biaggi did  manage to \nheadbutt Valentino's team manager Carlo Fiorani while \nhis  arms were behind his  back. Then he  managed to \nfight free, clocking his  nemesis in the  face. If you  were \nlooking for  a  points decision in  the absence of  a \nknockout you'd probably give the  fight to  Mighty Max \nwho won more cred in  the  post-race press conference \nwhen quizzed about his  grazed face. ‘A  mosquito bit \nme,’ he  replied. The incident uncovered a  streak of \ndignity within the older Italian, who was quick to \nremind everyone that he’d never stoked the  fires of the \nlong-running feud. ‘My only defence is to  say  nothing,’ \nhe  said, well aware of the  difficulties of  a  PR  offensive \nagainst everyone's favourite GP  racer. All  he did  say was \nthat Valentino only whacked him while Fiorani had his \narms behind his back: ‘That wasn’t nice, it was unfair.’ \nBiaggi insists he’s baffled by the  rivalry. ‘We only \nstarted racing together in  2000 but  it feels like  Rossi's \nbeen racing me  ever since he  was in  125s. It's  not \nnormal to  have a  go  at  another rider when you're not \neven in  the  same class. Rossi is clever, he  gets energy \nfrom all  this, but | think people get  tired of  it.’  Of \ncourse, people weren't getting tired of  it.  This was \nmore fun than anyone had had for  years: a  real, \ngenuine confrontation between two riders who hate \neach other's guts.

The forced smiles did  nothing to  soothe their \nantagonism or  hush the  apoplectic Italian media, but  at \nleast they'd made the  effort to  convince people that \nthey weren't out  to  kill  each other at  this most fright- \nening of racetracks. \nValentino reckons that Assen features the most \nchallenging corner in  GP  racing, Hoge Heide, where \nriders must tackle successive waves of  camber while \nnegotiating a  160mph right-left flick near the  end of \nthe lap. Through the right they ride into a  deep dip, \nsuspension fully compressed, before rising out  of  the \ndip  and heaving the bike left  as  the  suspension fully \nextends. A moment of  deathly silence follows, riders \napparently in  cruise mode, unable to  do  anything \nbecause the  bike is just floating across the  tarmac with \nno  grip, SO  any input would almost certainly cause a \nbig, big  crash. But  as  soon as  they descend from that \nfinal wave of camber the  suspension loads up  and  they \n104 \nflick into the  110mph Ramshoek left. It’s  an  impressive \nsight in qualifying when riders are  mostly alone, putting \ntheir all  into one perfect lap, but  in the  race, with Vale, \nBiaggi, Capirossi and Barros locked together in a vicious \ndogfight, it was frankly terrifying. Someone up  there \nmust've known this confrontation might end_ in \ndisaster, So  down came the rain and out came the red \nflags. Biaggi had been ahead the  lap  before the  race \nwas stopped and was thus declared the winner, \nValentino second, Capirossi third. \nRobbed of  victory and now only 19  points ahead, \nValentino and crew headed across the  Channel for  the \nBritish GP  where things went from bad to  worse. That \nhuge tumble in qualifying left  him  a  dismal 11th on  the \ngrid, Max sitting pretty on  pole. In the  race he  bided his \ntime, waiting for  the  fuel load to  lighten before relent- \nlessly working his  way toward the  front. Race leader \nBiaggi must've got  the  shock of  his  life  when his  pit \nboard told him  who was behind him  and  within a  few \nlaps he  too  succumbed. At  such a  crucial stage of  the \nseason, when lesser racers might've settled for safe \n\nWAS e   ST 1  NO Ross! @ winnins WA tela Rtg MEE Gt \npoints rather than a  risky ride to  the  front, this  was a \ntruly inspired ride. And it’s right up there in Vale’s all-time \nbest races. ‘Maybe this was my  most exciting victory \nbecause | didn’t think it was possible to  win, so  when | \ncrossed the finish line  it was  the  most emotion for me.’ \nTo  Japan for Eight Hours tests and then to \nGermany, where he  was back to  earth with a  bump. If \nthe  2001 NSR was a  magnificent motorcycle it  soon \nbecame obvious that it  didn’t like the Sachsenring’s \ntortuous twists. Once again he  qualified 11th but  this \ntime there was no  Lazarus-style comeback and he \nfinished the  race a  crestfallen seventh. Biaggi won at  a \ncanter, leading home three other Yamahas, the YZR’s \nsweet-handling chassis lapping up  the  German curves. \nNow there were just ten points between them, and all \nof a  sudden the  clever money was on  Biaggi who had \nwon three of  his  four 250 titles with storming end-of- \nseason flourishes, while Vale had never been involved \nin a  bruising fight to the  finish. \nBut  no  time for wailing and gnashing of teeth, just \nanother 12-hour plane ride to  Suzuka where he  and \n105 \n\n\n\nVALENTINO ross! @ winnins VE Rie 8 IMnGl Gait \nEdwards made no   mistakes second time around, \nwinning the  Eight Hours and  returning to the circuit the \nnext morning for  something much more important: \nValentino's first ride on  the all-new RC211V. With \nBiaggi’s YZR500 in  the  ascendance, here at  least was \nsomething that might give him some cheer for  the \nfuture. Not so,  Vale declared the  test ‘a  disaster’ and \nreturned home to  psyche himself up  for  the  Czech GP. \nIn  all  kinds of ways this would be  a  crucial encounter. \nBrno commences the  second half of  the  season after \nGP  racing's summer recess and performances at  this \nepic, high-speed circuit are  invariably a  good forecast \nfor the  remainder of the  campaign. During the  summer \nholidays some riders mysteriously fall  out  of the  groove, \nwhile others find the  speed missing from their earlier \noutings. So  from a  purely psychological standpoint it \nwas vital for  both riders that they win  here. No  wonder \nValentino considers it the  most difficult race of his  life. \nEver the master of  the artfully fast one-off lap \nBiaggi claimed pole, just over a  tenth up  on  Valentino, \nthen led  the  race, his  rival quickly slotting in  behind. \nThat's how they stayed for  some while, Valentino \nwatching and  waiting, gathering the  information he'd \nrequire for  an  end-of-race attack. ‘Biaggi was going so \nquick and | was thinking, “Ah, maybe it’s  possible to \novertake him here on  the last lap”, or  “Here |'m  faster, \nthere I’m  slower”, and  when he crashed | thought “Oh \nfack, now it’s  necessary to  change my  plan”.’ Biaggi \nhad skated over the  edge of  the  precipice, losing the \nfront and sliding gracefully to  earth, then remounting \nin a panic to salvage a  handful of points for tenth. They \nhardly mattered. The gap was back to  29  points and \nthe scene had  been set  for the final six races. \n‘|  think Brno is  the masterpiece of  my  career \nbecause the  mental situation was  so  difficult before the \nrace, though after Biaggi crashed it wasn’t very much \nexciting.’ He  followed that with another untroubled \nwin  at Estoril where Biaggi covered himself in dust once \nmore, clambering back on  board to  grimly keep himself \non  the  scoring board. At  Valencia Biaggi got  his  own \nback, beating Valentino by almost three seconds, but \nthey were only racing for tenth place, the  event turned \ninto  a tyre lottery by a pre-race downpour. \nLeaving Europe behind for  the  final four ‘flyaway’ \nraces the  gap had  swollen to  47  points but  Biaggi was \nnot  for  giving in.  He  led  Valentino at  Motegi, only to \nstumble over the limit once more. Biaggi's pride had \nbeen pricked by the  run  of  calamities and turned his \nwrath not  against Valentino but  against Yamaha. The \nYZR chassis, he  announced, had a  ‘structural problem’ \nwhich didn’t allow him  to  ride  as  fast  as  he wanted. He \nhad already complained that Rossi always got lucky, \nalways got  the  best bikes, conveniently forgetting that \nhe  too  had been favoured with NSR500 power in  ‘98. \nBut  that year he  had been in  a  satellite Honda team \nand had  complained once too  often that his  equipment \ndidn’t match up  to  Doohan’'s factory tackle. After that \nHRC weren’t keen to  promote him  to  official team \nduties, so  he switched factories. \nValentino, of course, saw it all  differently. There had \nbeen no  crisis at  Yamaha, rather Vale and his  crew had \nbeen shaken into getting their act  together following \ntheir disastrous Sachsenring weekend. ‘After Germany | \ntold him  we  wouldn't tolerate the  second or  third rows \nanymore,’ reveals Burgess. ‘I  told him he  was making \ngreat entertainment for the  fans but  if he wanted to win \nthe  championship he'd have to  put some pressure on  his \nrival  and  it’s hard to do that from the third row. After that \nwe  were only off  the  front row once all  year. We  also \nchanged a lot during the  next few races: shocks, suspen- \nsion links, geometry, engine bits, everything, which \nallowed us to make big improvements in handling.’ That's \nwhy Biaggi could no  longer hack the  pace. \n‘The better parts from HRC helped but  it was the \nteam that made the  difference because they changed \ntheir way of working to  suit me,’ adds Valentino. ‘| use \nmore corner speed than Doohan and you need more \naccurate settings to  ride with my  style. So  all  the \nsuspension settings changed and the  bike started to \nturn better. The Honda 500 had always had a  turning \nproblem, it would always run wide, but it was better \nafter Germany.’ \nThree races to  go  and the  title would be  his  if he \ncould make the  top  eight at  Phillip Island. Oooh, too \ntough. Indeed it was, of all the  races in which he might \nhave been granted an  easy ride, this wasn’t it.  Phillip \nIsland's fast, swooping curves always encourage elbow- \nto-elbow racing, but  the  2001 Australian GP  was an \n107 \n\nVA EE Nie tN® noss!©@ winnine VERY Seine Gers \nepic amongst Aussie epics, the  closest race in over half \na  century of  500 racing, almost too  close. During the \nearly laps Barros and Nori Haga scared the living \ndaylights out  of everyone as  they duked it out  for  the \nlead, Valentino deciding the only safe place was out \nfront after he'd kissed tyres with Barros at  190mph. He \ndidn't stay there long, barging back and forth with \nBiaggi, Capirossi, Jacque, Nakano and Ukawa. On  the \nfinal lap  it  was Max out front by’a smidgen but \nValentino timed his  move to  perfection, diving ahead \nwith three corners to  go. Less than two seconds \nseparated the  first nine riders past the  flag, so  tactical \nriding had  never been an  option and  anyway, riding for \npoints isn't his  style. Roberts and Criville had won their \ncrowns by doing no  more than was absolutely neces- \nsary and he  wasn’t about to  emulate them. Burgess, \nlike  everyone, was mightily impressed: ‘I’ve always said \nthat if you win races the  championships take care of \nthemselves. It's always been that way with the  guys I've \nworked with —  Mick, Gardner and Spencer, they all \nknew how to fight.’ \nBack home in  Tavullia it was almost 6am and the \nexultant locals were painting the  town yellow. Mum \nwasn't with them though, she’d made the  long trip \nDown Under to  celebrate her  boy's conquest of motor- \ncycling's highest peak, just 22  years and  240'days after \nshe'd first  laid  eyes on  him. \nValentino isn’t the  youngest rider to  have won the \n108 \nration. This \nfirst time \n1   nad it  cut \n=  suffering \nareer-ending \nead injuries in \n(Vitali Rosati \n500 crown, however. Three others have managed it \neven younger: Freddie Spencer won the  1983 title  at 21 \nyears and 258 days, Mike Hailwood secured the  1962 \ncrown aged 22  and 160 days and John Surtees took \nthe  1956 championship at  22  years and 182 days. So \nwhat's so  special about these guys? What unites them? \nRiding talent, for  a  start, towering mountains and \nraging rivers of the  stuff, plus total, unfaltering dedica- \ntion. (Surtees called his  own brand of  world-beating \ndetermination, ‘the inherent Surtees family cussed- \nness’.) And dads that raced bikes: Spencer Senior raced \njust about anything —  dirt bikes, drag bikes, sprint cars, \neven powerboats —  while Hailwood’s old man and \nSurtees’ dad raced sidecars before the  Second World \nWar. In  other words, it  all  comes down to  nature \nand nurture. \nAfter watching the  race in  his  pyjamas at  home, \nGraziano may well have been pondering this very \nsubject as  he  popped down the  local barbiere to  have \nhis  pony tail  cut  off  in celebration. The cherished pony \nhad been growing ever since he’d emerged shaven- \nheaded from his  career-ending coma in  September \n1982 and here at last was a good enough reason to get \nrid  of the  thing. ‘It  wasn’t for  a  bet, just a  display of \nappreciation and affection,’ explains Graziano. ‘I told \nhim I'd  cut  it off  if he  won all  three titles. Every time \nhe’s passed to  a  higher level it's  been a  pleasurable \nsurprise for  me.  When he  won his  first GP  in  ‘96  that \n\nVALENTIN © Ross! G) winnine VER ae MA) eel \ndidn't mean he'd be  good at  250s, and 500s are  a \nwhole different thing again, so  | only realised he’s  really, \nreally good when he won the  500  championship.’ \nMoving swiftly on to   Sepang the following \nweekend, Valentino might have been tempted to  kick \nback in the  stultifying tropical heat and luxuriate in the \nglory of  it all.  Not so,  he  made the rest look second- \nrate with a  runaway win, having big  fun  spinning his \nhot and greasy Michelins well ahead of  Capirossi. \nIncredibly, this was the  moment that Valentino reckons \nhe finally mastered the  500: ‘In  Malaysia | finally arrive \nto  go  very fast with the  500.’ And this 38th win took \nhim  into  the all-time top  nine GP winners’ list. \nJust one race to  go  before the  end of the  500 era \nand surely there was only one man who should win it. \nBut  conditions could scarcely have been trickier at  Rio, \nthe rain coming and going, Valentino crossing the \nfinish line second, a  fraction down on  Checa, but still \nwinning. How so?  The race had been interrupted by a \nrain shower and run  in two parts, the  result decided on \naggregate. Valentino crossed the  finish line a  metre \nbehind the  Spaniard but  had  a two  tenths advantage in \nhand from the  first leg. To add  indignity to  defeat, he'd \ndone it running the wrong tyres —  squirming intermedi- \nates against his  rival’s noticeably grippier cut slicks. \nChubby Checa’s look of abject misery upon the  podium \nspoke for  everyone: ‘Just what do  we  have to  do  to \nbeat this  guy?’. \nWAIIAY MWAITIA \nental Sareea Sen \n109 \n\nVATE EIS et ING Ross! @ winnins VE eye MUN Gar \nOf  course, there was one man he'd never beaten — \nDoohan. So  could he  beat the  biggest, baddest of  the \nOld  Dogs? ‘I've seen some of Mick’s data readouts and, \nfack, he was very fast. It was him that made the  differ- \nence, not the  bike. If | was to  race Mick, | think | could \nfight with him, but | don’t know who would win. \nNobody knows!’ Burgess also sits  on  the  fence on  this \none: ‘| wouldn't like  to  say  Valentino's got  more talent \nthan Mick, I've  seen Mick do some pretty special things \non  a  motorcycle.’ \nAnd what if Valentino rode a Yamaha, could he still \nbeat Max? ‘Biaggi gave 120 per  cent to  beat me  in \n2001, so  the  fight was facking hard. In  the  past he \nnever rode the  500  like that. For  me,  | think | could beat \nhim with Yamaha because we're not talking about \nBlagg! winning six  races and me  seven, or  me  scoring \njust ten  points more than him. Of  course, | think my \nbike is very good, but  | also think that | was the  fastest \nrider of 2001, usually. | won 11  races, Biaggi won three \nand he  only won Assen because the  race was stopped \nearly. And when he  won at  Le  Mans and Sachsenring \nhis  team-mate Checa was second, so  for  sure those \ntracks were not  so  bad for  the  Yamaha; at  Sachsenring \nthere were five  Yamahas in the  first  six!’ \nNot that the  relative differences between the  YZR \nand NSR mattered any  more, because 500s were about \nto  be  consigned to  history, although Valentino wasn’t \nhappy about that because he  didn’t reckon the RCV \nwas going to  be  as  fun to  ride. In  fact he  kept \nsuggesting he  might stick with the NSR in  2002, \nalthough he was only kidding himself. Honda had  been \na  prime mover in the  shift to  four-strokes, so  there was \nno  way they were going to  let  their number one rider \ncontinue racing a  ‘stinkwheel’. \nRCV testing began alongside new team-mate \nUkawa at  Jerez in  November, a  whole army of  HRC \nengineers descending on  the  Andalucian track, praying \nthat the  work they'd done since July would be to  their \nchampions liking. It wasn’t. ‘The bike still  wasn't very \ngood but  we  made a  good test at  Jerez. I'm  good at \nunderstanding what | want from the  bike and HRC are \nvery good at giving me  what | want. After Jérez every- \nthing changed: the cowling, the seat, the engine \ncharacter, all  the  electronic parts, it was a  new bike by \n110 \nthe  start of the  2002 season.’ \nIn  other words, maybe the RCV wouldn't have \nbecome the  weapon it did  without Valentino’s unique \ninput. Your average rider works on  machine set-up one \nadjustment at  a  time, so  if the  bike turns better, keeps \nits line  better or  is more stable, he'll know what caused \nthat improvement, so  his crew can  make further adjust- \nments in that direction and perhaps make the  bike even \nbetter. If his crew were to change several things at once \n—  say  one click on  the  front rebound damping, two \nclicks on  the  rear  compression and  a  different construc- \ntion front tyre —  the  rider couldn't be  sure which of \nthese changes affected performance, so  his  crew can’t \ngo  on  from there. Valentino is different. ‘He  has  some \nkind of amazing link  system which allows him  to think \n“Il like  this” and “I don’t like  this”,’ explains Fiorani. ‘So \nhe  can test many different things at  the  same time \nwithout getting confused.’ This is just another part of \nhis  talent for  riding a  motorcycle ridiculously fast  —  it’s \nnot  just riding ability, it’s  his  pit-lane brain that helps \nhim improve the  bike, so  he  can  employ even more of \nhis talent on  the  track. \nDuring the  Jerez tests Valentino did  at  least break \nhis  own 500 record, although recently crowned 250 \nchamp Daijiro Kato was also there, getting into the \nswing of  things with his  NSR500s, and he  went even \nfaster. This was  the  first  hint  that the two-strokes might \nnot  roll  over and die  the  moment the  four-strokes hit \nthe  track. Ever since Checa had ridden Yamaha’s YZR- \nM1  four-stroke to  a  blindingly fast  simulated race time \nduring private tests at  Brno in  August, the  500s had \nlooked dead and gone. But here was evidence to \nsuggest that reports of  their demise had been greatly \nexaggerated. Around tighter and slower tracks the \nfour-strokes seemed unable to  fully exploit their 200- \nplus horsepower engines while the  two-strokes could \ncapitalise on  their lighter weight. \nFour wheels were next, and he  put  on  an  impres- \nsive  display in Michelin's Race of Champions rally event \non  Gran Canaria where he made it to the  quarter finals, \nonly losing out to  World Rally star Alistair McRae. \nPeople were already suggesting he’d quit bikes in  a \nyear or  two to  go  full-time rallying. ‘If  | win with the \nfour-stroke maybe it will  be  necessary to  change sport, \n\nVea TEN INS Foss! ©@ winnine NA  1  Sh MU GH \n111 \n\nWA EN tl iNio ross! @) winning VERY SIMNEiGart \nand after bikes rallying is my  passion, but  to  say  I'll  do \nhe World Rally after bikes is unreal, because, fack, you \nNave people who've been racing rallies for  25  years, \nwhile I'd  be  starting from zero, so  | don’t know if | can \nbe  fast  enough.’ \nMeanwhile, HRC returned to  their Asaka HQ  to \nfurther refine the  RCV, agreeing to  meet Valentino at \nSepang in  late  January. But  the  test never happened. \nn  early January the  two parties fell  out over a  new \ntwo-year contract, reputed to  be  worth £10 million. \n‘In  December we  understand we  are  still  a  little too  far \naway, SO  we  need time to  change something in  the \ncontract about our  point of view and something about \nHonda's point of view. But  the  biggest problem is that \nall  the Italian journalists write too much, is  not  true \nthat the  argument was about Honda wanting me  to \nuse  number one, not  46.  We  had  already finished that \ndiscussion before the end of  2001 season. No, we \nhave other problem but is  better we don’t say; \nis secret.’ \n112 \nThe  disagreement forced Vale to  cancel his holidays \nand stay in  London, hunkering down with Gibo, firing \noff  faxes and emails and working on  his  new look: \nshaggy-dog hair, bewhiskered face and  a  military green \nforage cap, like  a  youthful Fidel Castro. Very cool. ‘| \nbegin to  look like  a wolf and in March my  mother say  | \ncan’t come in  her  house!’ He  also acquired a  deep tan \nfrom somewhere, certainly not  from London’s winter \nsun. ‘Is  not  real  sun, is lamp! My girls like  it!’  And we \nthought Biaggi was the  vain one... \nThe contract bickering was resolved in time for  the \nnext tests at  Sepang in early February, where he demol- \nished the 500 race record he’d established in  October, \ngiving HRC a timely reminder of his worth. News of the \nRCV's devastating speed raised blood pressure in  race \nshops around Japan and Italy, especially in lwata where \nYamaha were toiling away on  their M1. Biaggi and \nCheca had  tested the  M1  at  Sepang during December \nand neither had gone as  quick. But  lap times exacted \nfrom private tests are  often misleading because track \n\nVAS INT TIN © ross! @ winnins VER ¥ \nconditions vary from day to  day and because the \nnumbers can be  pure propaganda. So  no  one was \nquite sure whether HRC were giving it some spin, until \nthe  first group teams’ test at  Catalunya in  early March \nwhen Valentino came out well on  top, Ukawa and \nCapirossi the  only ones even close. And Capirossi was \nriding his  2001-spec NSRs like a  maniac: little body \nhunched forward, grimly hanging on  as  the  bike took \non a life  of  its  own, all  crossed up  and pointing any \nwhich way but  straight. \nThe same deal during final pre-season tests at \nSuzuka; Valentino well ahead and Capirossi already \nproclaiming him  World Champion. ‘Loris say  that with \nthe RCV | can win the title riding with one hand, \nmaybe | will try  that later,’ he  joked. Suzuka race \nweekend was no  walkover, however. He  crashed twice \nin practice, destroying one  of his  RCVs on  the  Saturday. \nThis was surely a  wake-up call  for  someone straying \ndangerously close to  the  foggy realm of  over-confi- \ndence, like  someone was still  up  there, looking out  for \nDifferent \nbike \nSsafne \nValentino ar \nhead Ryo, Ito \nCheca at rain \nlashed Suzuke \n(Gold &  Goose \nMeL GA \nhim. The crashes were big  ones. On  Friday he  lost  the \nfront at  120mph, bloodying his  hands as  he  scrubbed \noff  speed before ricocheting off  the  trackside barriers, \nthen the  next morning he  took such a  wide line into \nDegner Two that he  ran  off  the  track on  the  outside as \nhe  peeled in.  This was playing way too  fast and loose \nwith his cornering lines. \nSuitably chastened, he  only just scraped into pole \nposition, his  rivals much closer than pre-season lap \ntimes had predicted. And on  Sunday he  rode a  careful, \nwell-thought-out race in  sodden conditions, learning \nthe  best rain lines from local Akira Ryo  before moving \nahead to  win  the  first race of the  new four-stroke era. \nThe victory was also Honda's first four-stroke GP \nsuccess since their original racing era  ended in  1967, so \nnot only was the shift of  eras helping to  build his \nlegend, it was also making Honda love him even more. \nNewly appointed HRC president Suguru Kanazawa \nemphasised the  significance of  the  success: ‘Winning \nGPs with four-stroke machinery has  always been our \n113 \n\ngoal, so  today’s victory is  very meaningful to  me  and \neveryone else at  Honda.’ Kanazawa had been working \ntowards this day ever since he'd left  university in  the \nlate Seventies and designed the  exotic, oval-pistoned \nNR500 four-stroke, which was humiliated by the  then- \ndominant Yamaha and Suzuki two-strokes. \nSuzuka, however, proved to  be  a  useless season \nforecast. First, the  RCV was in fact much further ahead \nof  its  rivals than it had appeared in Japan, and second, \nValentino \nwasn't \ngoing \nto \nwin \nevery \none \nof \nthe \nyear’s \n16  races. At  Welkom, he  and Ukawa finished almost \nhalf a  minute ahead of  the pack, Capirossi the only \nman \nanywhere \nnear \ntheir \npace \nand \nflirting \nwith \ndisaster \nat  every corner. But it was an  unusually bad day for \nVale.

Y) How ROS Ss RIDES \nGrand prix  bikes are  the  baddest-assed motorcycles on \nEarth because they’ve got more brakes, more grip, \nmore rigid chassis and, most crucially, more horse- \npower than anything else. Valentino has  to  constantly \njuggle body weight and throttle input to  get  his  RCV \non  to the  fattest part of the  tyre, so  he can  rip as  much \nhorsepower as  possible through that contact patch, all \nthe  while keeping the  rear tyre spinning, not  too  little, \nnot  just too  much. Too  little wheelspin means he’s not \nlaying down enough power and not  helping the  bike \nto  turn, too much wheelspin and he’s losing forward \ndrive or  he’s  about to  have a highside. \nLike only the  greatest racers, Valentino keeps the \nthing dancing on  that precipice, using everything just \nas  hard as  he  can, so  if he  braked any later, cornered \nany faster, accelerated any harder, he’d go  over the \nedge. Like any  pro-racer, he  makes a living out  of  being \ngiven an  inch and trying to  make it a  mile, but  his  own \npersonal precipice is many miles on  from our  own, and \neven out  there his  control is so  much more deft, even \nwhen the  bike's skipping and sliding beneath him, like \nit does into every corner, through every corner and out \nof every corner. \nSomeone like  Valentino inhabits a  world that's diffi- \ncult  to  compare with our  own because his experience of \nbike riding is so  alien to  ours, but  maybe you  can  have a \ngo  at  imagining for  a  moment that you're a  GP  rider. \nLet's say  that you're in  the  closing stages of  the  British \nGP  and you're rocketing into the  first  turn at  155mph, \nthere's someone to  the  left  of you and someone to  the \nright, the guy on  the right has  just barged past and \nnicked your line, brakes squealing, suspension juddering, \n\nVE ASL EINE TIS se) \ntyres chattering as  he  ricochets off  your bike and nearly \nrips  your right hand off the  ‘bars. \nYour front tyre is  tucking, pushing and sliding as \nyou tip  into the turn, so  you're thrusting your right \nknee deep into the  tarmac to  keep some weight off the \nover-worn tyre, at  the same time as  you're thinking \nabout getting on  the  throttle. You crack the  throttle a \nfraction, just to  get  the  revs building and take some \nmore weight off  the front, then you open it  some \nmore, until you can  feel  the  rear tyre loading up,  then \nyou open it some more until you feel the  revs rise  and \nthe  tyre getting all  greasy and braking loose, so  you \nease off and  push like  a  bastard on  the  outside footpeg \nuntil the rubber regains some traction, which you \nimmediately eat  up  by  getting back on  the  throttle, \nwhich pushes the  bike wide until you’re on  the  rumble \nstrip, SO  you  ease off  again as  the  tyre jumps, spins and \nkicks back across the  kerb. Now you're pushing back in \nthe seat to  get more weight on  that rear tyre and \nweighting the  ‘pegs to  complete the  cornering arc  to \nthe  right, which takes you  back on  to the  tarmac where \nthe  rear tyre  grips and kicks the front wheel into the  air, \nso  you pull your weight over the front of  the bike, \n118 \nrossi ZG) HO W \nASS Si Fa ee Sei. \neasing the  throttle for  a  millisecond, trying to  get  the \nfront back on  the  tarmac as  you head down towards \nCraner Curves, your hands, feet, backside and brain in \nsome kind of a  St Vitus dance of a  balancing act  as  you \nlean hard right at  130mph, all  of three feet behind the \nguy  who's just overtaken you. \nThat's one breathless snapshot of  maybe five \nseconds in a  GP  that lasts 45  minutes. In other words, a \nGP  is just like  that, except repeated about 550 times, \nand I've  mentioned only the  most basic inputs that a \nrider uses through each and every corner. The really \nscary thing is that a  rider like  Valentino has  made the \nmost intricate of  adjustments to  all  of  those inputs \nevery time he’s switched bikes, from 125s to  250s, \nfrom 250s to  500s and from 500s to  1,000cc four- \nstrokes. Somehow he  has  been able to  reach into his \nsubconscious, then override and  reconfigure each facet \nof  his  riding technique, and all  this while all  hell is \nbreaking loose on  the  racetrack. \nHis  achievement is unique in  bike racing history. In \nmore than 50  years of  GPs only one other rider has \nsecured the  triple crown of  125, 250 and 500 titles and \nthat was Briton Phil Read, who took ten years to \nE a, \nim \nDS \naqornia \n——————— \n\n\n\n120 \nconquer the  different classes, almost twice as  long as \nthe  youngster. Valentino's ability to  adapt so  quickly \nmarks him out as  a  superman among supermen, and \none of  the  most versatile riders ever. So  what is this \ntalent with which he is blessed? \nEvery rider has his  own style, his  own way of \ncontrolling a  motorcycle via  throttle control, body \nweight and maximising traction. But  different types of \nmotorcycle require very different techniques to  extract \nmaximum performance from their engines and chassis. \nValentino has  the  ability to  swap seamlessly from one \nbike to  another because he’s been riding all  kinds of \nbikes for 20  years, because he  inherited the  right genes \nfrom his  GP-winning dad and because he's a  bit  of  a \ngenius. He’s not  quite unique, of course, men like  King \nKenny Roberts ruled American dirt track before \nconquering 500 GPs, and  Sixties’ legend Mike Hailwood \ncould win  three different GP classes in a day, though the \nspecifics of  different racing categories were less back \nthen. \nBut \nmost \nriders \nare \nmuch \nless \nable \nto \nachieve \nthe \n\nWoO Ee INT IN © rossi Y) How \nsame level of  competitiveness with different types of \nmachine —  witness the  many 250 and Superbike stars \nwho have failed to  reinvent themselves as  500 heroes. \nThese riders develop their skills and technique as  they \nmaster a  particular type of  machine, but  when they \nchange classes, their style won't change with them. \nRiding technique is a  largely subconscious function, \nso  it’s  hard to  know exactly what you're doing a  lot  o \nthe time, because there's so  much going on  when \nyou're teetering on  the  limit, duelling with a rival. To  be \nable to  adapt the  way you brake, turn, accelerate, shift \nyour body weight and so  on  therefore demands a  very \nspecial mind. Valentino, being a  modest guy, shrugs it \nall  off. ‘Racing 125s was like a  game, 250s were \nserious, but 500s are very serious!’ he  said halfway \nthrough his  first 500 season. ‘They're dangerous: you \nopen the  throttle and you've got  almost 200 horse- \npower, so  you  have to  be careful...’ \nNiall Mackenzie, who won the British 250 title, \nthen went on  to  score several 500 GP  podiums before \nreturning to  dominate the national Superbike scene, \nbelieves Valentino's secret is threefold: his  lack of  an  ‘I \nknow best’ ego which allows him to  look, listen and \n<at a \n1 \n— ae \nAl \nRe sy: | Bi 2 \nmT  i) \nlearn, his  ability to  rear-wheel steer and his  refusal to \nhang around in any  one class too  long \n‘The longer you stay on  one kind of  bike, the \nharder it  is to  change,’ says Mackenzie. ‘Rossi wasn’t \non  250s too  long and  even when he was he  looked like \nhe  was already thinking about how to  ride 500s. He \nseems prepared to  change how he  rides, while most \nother riders decide their way is the  only way. \n‘When | was riding 500s |’d  be  competitive if the \nbike or  my  style suited the  track but  that doesn’t work \nevery week, you have to  be  able to  adapt and that’s \nwhere the Americans and Australians scored when | \nwas riding, and where Rossi scores now. They ride the \nrear wheel because you can give the rear so  much \nmore abuse and get  away with it.  If you rely  on  the \nfront there’s such a  fine line between the tyres \ngripping, to  allow you to  keep up  your corner speed, \nand crashing. On  a  125  you  can  push the  front all  day \nlong, maybe a little less  on  a  250, but  500s push the \nfront so  much harder, because you've got  more weight \nand a  huge rear-tyre contact patch.’ \nCalifornian Wayne Rainey, who won three 500 titles \nwhile Mackenzie struggled to  get the  best out  of 500s, \n; aN \nA  2 \nMARIANIPE (R01! \n121 \n\nVAL EN TaN @ \nwas the  master of  slide. ‘As  a  kid, being sideways was \nas  normal as  riding in  a  straight line,’ says Rainey, who \ngrew up  doing US  dirt  track. ‘When | started roadracing \nin  the  early Eighties, | didn’t know if sliding was right or \nwrong but  it  was what | felt  comfortable with. If the \ntyre wasn't spinning and the  bike turning, | didn’t feel \nright. | liked it spinning because it gives you a  safety \nbuffer, you  kinda know where you  can  go with it. \n‘In  fact, sliding is the  easy part, the  difficult part is \nfront-tyre feel. The key  to  my  riding style was getting \nthrough that area really quick, getting the  front tyre \nout  of the  way so  | could get on  the  throttle. When you \nbrake and flick, it’s  all  front tyre, which is kinda risky. \nThe advantage rear-wheel steering gave me  was huge. \nAnd it’s just the  same now —  watch Rossi, he’s  getting a \nbit  sideways now. It’s  great when you've a  lot  of  grip \nbecause you  can  use  more throttle than the  other guys, \nand  then when the  grip starts to fade, you know where \nthe  traction is. \n‘To  me  the  throttle was everything. But  when you're \ndoing this  you're talking very small changes in  throttle \nopening because you're at  the limit of  everything — \nthrottle position, chassis flex, tyre  flex, you're feeling all \nthat stuff. Spinning the  rear  relieves pressure on  the  tyre, \nrelieves pressure on  the  suspension and  that widens the \nsafety area. But  you're only spinning to  keep the  bike \nturning, just to  keep it on  track. Most of the  time you \ndon't want the  tyre to  spin much at  all,  you  want it to \ndrive maximum, you're always focused on  drive.’ \nRoss! (%) How REO rSrSrie eae) \nm  0) \nValentino's mentor, Mick Doohan, played his part in \nhelping the youngster adapt to  big bikes but the \nformer 500 champ insists that Valentino did  most of \nthe work himself. ‘He has studied everyone, from \nFreddie Spencer to  the  guys he races against now,’ says \nDoohan. ‘He  looks at them all on  TV  and  works out  the \nbest way to  ride. He’s watched so  many races on  video \nthat he  probably knows them better than the  statistics \nguys. He  watches, he  thinks and he  listens to  others. | \ntold him  a  few things early on  —  not  to  keep the  bike \non  its  side so  much, just get  it into the  turn, get  it up \nand  get it out  —  but  it didn’t take him  long to catch on.’ \nWhatever his  god-given talent, Valentino needed \nto  change his  riding style when he  came to  500s. He'd \ngrown up  through 125s and 250s, where corner speed \nis  king, and while corner speed is also crucial in  big- \nbike racing, it’s  not  the  way to  ride  from start to  finish. \nA 200hp motorcycle burns up  its tyres during a  race, so \nthe  sidegrip that is there in  the  early laps isn’t there \nlater on.  Watch Valentino accelerate out  of a  turn and \nhe  does exactly what Doohan advised him to  do  —  he \nlifts the bike, almost violently, as  he  brings on  the \nthrottle, which gives him a  larger tyre-to-tarmac \ncontact patch that can  handle bigger throttle openings. \nAdjusting to  that corner-exit style requires the  rider \nto  use less corner speed, so  he’s got to  adapt by \nslowing down, obviously a  very difficult thing for  any \nracer to  do  since this is the  opposite of their remit. To \nsucceed on  a  500 you must breach that mental barrier \n\nVAAL EN Tl NO \nand slow your corner entry so  you can  focus on  corner \nexit, raise the  bike on  to  the  fatter section of  its  rear \ntyre and then open that throttle, little by little. That's \nhow Valentino transformed himself from 250  winner to \nbig-bike king, by using less corner speed, much more \nintricate throttle control and a  willingness to  adapt his \ntechnique throughout the  race, according to  fuel load \nand  tyre wear. \n‘It’s  really difficult because your head's telling you \nthat the rear-end style seems slow,’ continues \nMackenzie. ‘In  a  race you're in an  intense, urgent situa- \ntion, so  you're just thinking “Fast, fast, keep going \nfast!”, your brain is telling you to  rush into corners, so \nyou're pushing the  front for  more corner speed. You've \ngot to  force yourself to  slow down but  you’re thinking \n“Using the  rear and not  pushing the  front is slow, if | \ndo that I'm  going to  lose  time and  places”. \n‘Somehow you've got to  have some kind of \nmechanism within yourself to  override what feels fast \nand what is fast, that’s the  clever bit,  that’s the  tricky \nbit.  Guys like  Rainey and Doohan could ride the  rear \ntoo, because it came naturally from riding the  dirt. If \nyou  can  force yourself to  keep riding the  rear, eventu- \nally  you'll go  faster, although the  longer you've been \ndoing high corner speed, the  harder it is to  stop.’ \nWhich brings us  to  Max Biaggi. Rossi's arch-riva \nchallenged for  the  2001 500 title after three wins at \ntracks well suited to  his  high corner speed style but  his \nbrave effort collapsed after three copycat front-end \nrossi (J) How ROS \n19) \nD \nU  TT ) \ncrashes. The  theory goes that Biaggi stayed in  250s too \nlong, lording it over his  rivals with the  number-one plate, \nso  that by the  time he  got  to  500s he  couldn't change \n(although he'd argue that he challenged Doohan for  the \ntitle in  his  first 500 season, when he was riding Hondas, \nSuggesting It’s  his Yamaha that was at fault). \n‘Biagg! is a  very hard 250 rider and he's also very \ngood on  500s,’ says Valentino. ‘But you never see  him \nSlide the  rear because he  uses the  front so  much. When \n| started 500s | also used the  front very much and | \ncrashed many times.’ \nMackenzie likens Rossi's adaptability to  that of \nDoohan, who won five 500 titles after a  near-crippling \naccident which left  him  more disabled than he ever lets \non.  ‘Rossi's ability to  think and adapt compares to  the \nway Mick coped with his  right foot not moving. He \nforced himself to  adapt, to  ride the  bike with a really \nweak right leg  and with no  movement in  his  right \nankle. Most other riders would say: “| just  can’t do this, \nit's  not  physically possible”. It’s  hard enough to  ride a \n500 when you're 100 per  cent, so  it's  easy to  say “| \ncan’t ride it properly now”, but  Doohan forced his  way \naround that.’ \nValentino admits to  using Doohan’s riding style as  a \nreference point, but he  hasn't simply copied every \naspect of the  grand master’s technique. ‘Mick used to \nslide and go,  like  a  real 500 rider, and his settings didn't \nhave to  be so  exact because of that,’ he explains. ‘But | \ncame from 250s so  | had  to  change my  style to  go  into \n\nVAS IE  Nah a  INN@ \nEN \nGBREIL & \n« 2 \nies: \nFacing \nania \n\nMie Lets IN SY Rossi) How ap (i 2 UR RoabDee Ss \ncorners a little slower, and though | learned to  under- \nstand slide control and started to  slide like Mick, I’m  still \nfaster in  the middle of  the corner, not because I’m a \nbetter rider, just  because | have a  different technique.’ \nNevertheless, Doohan has nothing but praise for \nRossi's technique: ‘|  think Valentino is  the only guy \nwho rides right at  the moment. The rest of  them ride \nlike  they’re on  250s, so  when the  tyres go  off  they’ve \ngot no  answer, their only answer is  to  roll  off  the \nthrottle. In  qualifying, everyone goes quick because \nthey've got  fresh tyres and low fuel loads, but  come \nhalfway through the  race, when the  front tyre starts to \npush and the  rear starts to  spin, they've got  to  slow \ndown but  Valentino adjusts his  riding style to  accom- \nmodate the  change in  grip, moving his  body weight \ndifferently and using the throttle differently. That's \nwhere he’s got it,  that’s why he’s consistently quick \nfrom lap one to  lap 30.’ \nMackenzie is  amazed that Valentino mastered \nsideways corner exits so  quickly. ‘He  seems to  slide the \nrear so  easily, though he’s got a  very ordinary riding \nstyle, like  some guy at  a  track day, but  he’s obviously \nusing his weight, balance and  throttle control. It’s  pretty \nobvious what he  was doing on  the  500 during 2001. \nHe'd be  with them for  the first half of  the race, \nwatching, waiting and probably pretty much at  his \nlimit. But  during the  second half, when everyone else's \nfronts were shot, so  they couldn't push hard anymore, \nthen he'd start riding the  rear.’ \nValentino's rear-wheel-steering ability is the  result of \na  very special natural talent that has  been honed since \nthe  day he  first rode a  minibike aged two and a half. \nAgain, he shrugs it off:  ‘I think my  throttle control is just \n125 \n\nVAILEN TIN © Ross!

When me \nand Loris Capirossi were racing 250s for Aprilia, he  used \nthe  throttle like  a  switch, on  or  off, | use  more gentle \ncontrol, but he was usually just as  fast.’ Maybe on  250s, \nbut  Valentino's ultra-delicate throttle contro! makes all \nthe  difference when you're dealing with double the \nhorsepower. When he came to  500 GPs in 2000 it took \njust a couple of races before his data-logging traces told \nHonda that his  throttle control was far  superior to  that \nof  their more experienced riders like Capirossi, Alex \nCriville and  Tady Okada. \nBut  Valentino's corner-exit secret isn't just throttle \ncontrol. It’s  also the  intricate feel he  possesses, so  he \nknows what the  rear  tyre is going to  do,  almost before \nit does it. \n‘To  slide like they do, GP riders need a  huge \namount of feel  and  feedback,’ explains Michelin's bike \nracing boss Nicolas Goubert. ‘They need to  sense \nexactly what the  tyre is  doing, and from experience, \nknow what it's  going to  do  next. Tyre compound and, \nto  a  lesser extent, construction are  the  crucial factors in \noffering excellent feedback. \n‘The more grip a  rider has  at  his  disposal, the  more \nfeel  and  feedback he needs. What most riders want is a \nperiod of  warning as  they approach the limit. It’s  no \ngood having massive amounts of  grip if  the limit is \nreached without any  warning, because the  rider won't \nhave the  confidence to  approach that limit. Most riders \nwill  go  faster with slightly less  grip and more feedback. \nOnly the  very best riders can go  fastest with a  huge \namount of  grip and minimal feedback, because their \nskill  allows them to cope with less  of a transition phase.’ \nSuperbike star Chris Walker's fated attempt to \nconquer the  500 class in  2001 was spent in  awe of \nmen like  Valentino. ‘When | followed good 500 guys \ninto corners, | could sometimes run  up  on  them a little, \neven the  best riders out  there. But  by the  time | came \nout of  the turn, they were halfway down the next \nstraight! The good 500 guys seem to  turn the  corner \nmore, then pick up  the  bike and get  on  the  gas  really \nhard. With Superbikes you spend a  lot  more time on \nyour side, so  on  the  500 I'd find | was always leant over \nfurther than anyone else. With a  four-stroke you can \nactually get  on  the  power while the  bike is on  its side. \nA  Superbike weighs more, so  there's more weight on \nthe tyres when it's  leaned over, so  there's obviously \nmore grip, and the power is  less aggressive, much \nsmoother, so  you can  drive out  of the  corner. The 500 \nis very different —  they're so  aggressive when the  power \ncomes on  tap, that you go  from good grip to  zero grip \nvirtually instantly.’ \nThat's the  real  difference between a  hard man and \na  hero, between a  good GP  rider and a  legend: super- \nintricate throttle control that allows the  rider to  unleash \nmaximum horsepower impossibly early out of  every \ncorner.

Honda has  always been a  four-stroke \nbrand, indeed company founder Soichiro Honda hated \nsmelly, smoky two-strokes so  much that his  R&D \nengineers used to  explain away two-stroke blueprints \nas  lawnmower engines. \nHonda's speciality always was exotica; during the \nSixties the company’s engineers produced a_  twin- \ncylinder 50cc GP  bike, a  five-cylinder 125 and a  250 \nsix,  all  revving beyond 20,000rpm; no  wonder Honda's \nfirst nine years of  GP  racing yielded 16  riders’ world \nHonda RCV 2002 \nEngine specifications \nType liquid-cooled 20-valve, 75.5° V5 four-stroke \nDisplacement 990cc \nFuel system PGM fuel  injection \nClaimed output around 220hp \nGearbox six-speed, cassette type \nChassis specifications \nFrame type dual beam aluminium \nTyres Michelin \nWheels 17in  front, 16.5in rear \nFront brake four-pot Brembo, twin carbon discs (dry), \ntwin cast-iron discs (wet) \n-Rear-brake two-pot Brembo, single disc \nFront suspension upside down Showa, multi-adjustable \nRear suspension unit  Pro-link with  Showa shock, \nMh  ee multi-adjustable \nWheelbase \n1,440mm \nLength 2,050mm \nRace weight over  145kg \nchampionships, 18 constructors’ crowns and 138  victo- \nries.

This seismic shift was \nsomewhat inevitable, given the environmental \nconcerns that have marginalised the  two-stroke engine \nas  a  practicable power source for  streetbikes.

The RCV does indeed look seriously \nunaerodynamic but is it?  In  some ways, yes, in  some \nways, no.  The kind of  swoopy bodywork required to \nslice through the  air  in a  straight line  actually compro- \nmises performance in  other areas, causing instability \nduring braking and  cornering, especially in  high-speed \nturns. The  tight, angular fairing therefore improves lap \ntimes and it doesn't matter if the  RCV’s straight-line \nspeed is compromised because Honda have never had \na  problem squeezing more horsepower out of  their \nengines than anyone else. \nThe RCV is a  distillation of everything that Honda \nhas  learned from racing in  almost half a  century of \ncompetition, and yet  the  bike's V5  configuration was \nanything but an  obvious choice for  the new four- \nstroke championship. But  Honda has  always believed \nthat taking the more difficult road can earn them \ngreater knowledge, although this insistence on  being \ndifferent has  sometimes cost Honda dear. Back in the \nlate Seventies they tried to  take on  the  all-dominant \ntwo-stroke 500s with the  NR  and  never scored a single \nworld championship point despite blowing billions of \nyen. Then, in the  mid-Eighties their first NSR500 ran  its \nfuel tank under the  engine, with the  aim  of  lowering \nthe  centre of gravity, but  the  bike was a disaster. \n‘We aim  to  prove that Honda technology is better \nthan the  easy way, like  inline four,’ says Honda Racing \nCorporation director Yasuo Ikenoya. ‘People ask  us  why \nwe  chose the  difficult way but  the  answer is simple: \nracing is  meant to  be  a  challenge, and racing is  in \nHonda's DNA. Of course, we  considered other configu- \nrations. A V4 would be good —  short and  narrow —  but \na V4  is not  interesting to  us!’ \nBurgess reckons Honda are  ahead because they \ndidn't compromise when they designed the  RCV. ‘I really \nthink that it's  better to start with a clean sheet of paper, \nthen you  don’t have to make any compromises,’ he says. \nWEAPONS \n‘Honda started from nowhere when they began work, \nthen they did  enough research to  see  what's the  best \ntool to  work within the  regulations. Yamaha and Suzuki \nboth shoehorned their four-stroke motors into modified \n500  chassis, and that's a compromise.’ \nThe straight-talking Aussie, who's never been afraid \nto tell  his Japanese bosses what he  thinks when they do \nget  things wrong, also believes that HRC were correct in \nchoosing a  five-cylinder engine. MotoGP regs have a \nsliding scale of  minimum weight limits: the  more cylin- \nders, the higher the  minimum. weight, but fours and \nfives share the  same 145kg limit. ‘If  you can run  the \nsame weight as  a  four, you might as  well have a  five,’ \nhe adds. ‘So  the five was definitely the  right way to go.’ \nHonda also considered building a  V6  but  the  new \nfour-stroke regs place a  further 10kg weight handicap \non  bikes using six  or  more cylinders. Honda have \nheavily emphasised the  concept of  total balance with \nthe  RCV. ‘Total balance’ is racing's current buzz phrase \nand isn't difficult to  grasp. Outright horsepower isn’t \nthe way to  win races nowadays, especially in  four- \nstroke GPs, because all  the bikes have more than \nenough horsepower. What counts is how that power is \nmade to  work with the  rest of  the  bike —  the  chassis \nand, most crucially, the  tyres. \n‘The RCV combines all  our racing experience to \nproduce optimum power with good machine control,’ \nIkenoya goes on.  ‘There are  three elements to our  total \nbalance concept: concentration of  mass, minimal \nfrontal area and optimum traction. All  the  riders that \nhave ridden the  bike have been impressed by its power \nand  compactness.’ \nCompactness is a  driving force with the  RCV, hence \nthe  narrowish vee  angle of  75.5°. The more compact \nyou  make the  motor, the  more room you  have to put the \nengine where you  want it, focusing the centre of mass. \nHRC have further followed that concept by \nmounting the fuel tank as  low as  possible. That's \nobviously what Honda were trying to do when they built \nthe  ‘upside-down’ NSR500 in  1984, but  they went too \nfar that time. Instead of gaining from a  low c of g, they \nsuffered for  it, because their engineers didn’t realise that \npitch is crucial for  adjusting traction between the  front \nand  rear  tyres as  the  rider goes in and  out  of a corner. \n131 \n\nMe \nLSS \nIST \nSTC \nWN \nEd \nross! \n@) \nsossi's \nWie \nAP \nGUNes \nThe RCV's fuel tank isn’t that low; it's  positioned \nvery centrally, partly under the front of  the seat, a \nclever feature that helps to  banish the  excessive pitch \nsuffered by machines with conventional tanks, \nespecially on  full  fuel loads early in the  race. \n‘In  \nthe  \npast \nall  \nour  \nriders \nhave \ncomplained \nabout \nriding \nwith \nfull \nfuel \ntanks,’ \nadds \nIkenoya. \n‘You \ncould \nsee  \nthat \nRossi \nwas \nalways \nvery \nfast \nat  \nthe  \nend \nof  \nraces \nwhen \nhis  \nNSR500’s \nfuel \nload \nwas \nless, \nwe  \nwanted \nhim \nto \nbe \nfast \nfrom \nthe \nearly \nlaps \nand \nthe \nRCV's \nfuel \ntank \ndesign \nhelps \nin this \nway.’ \nIt \nwould \nbe  \ngross \nunderstatement \nto  \nsuggest \nthat \nthe  \nRCV \nis \neasy \nto  \nride, \nbut  \nthe  \nbike \nis  \ncertainly \nless \ndemanding \nthan \nthe \nold \nNSR, \nwhich \nis \nwhy \nthe \nnew \nbreed \nof  \nfour-strokes \nare  \ngenerically \nquicker \naround \na \nracetrack \nthan \n500s. \n‘The \nfour-stroke \nis \neasier \nbecause \nwhen \nyou're \nmid- \ncorner \non  \na  \n500 \nyou \nhave \nzero \npower,’ \nsays \nValentino's \nengineer \nJerry \nBurgess. \n‘When \nyou \nopen \nthe  \nthrottle \nfrom \nthe  \nlowest \nrpm \npoint, \nsay  \n6,000, \nthe \n500’s \nnot \nmaking \nany \nmore \npower \nthan \na \nstreetbike, \nbut  \nthen \nit \nsuddenly \nbuilds \nto  \n190hp. \nWith \nthe  \nfour-stroke \nyou \ntouch \nthe  \nthrottle \nmid-corner \nand \nyou've \nstill  \ngot  \ntons \nof \ntorque, \nso  \nfrom \nthat \npoint \nyou  \ncan  \nopen \nthe  \nthrottle \nfairly \nquickly, \nwhereas \nwith \ntwo-strokes \nyou \nhave \nto \nbe \n132 \n<i  c  Ne i 3 \n\\oa SENS \nGos fears \nreally \ncareful \nhow \nyou \nopen \nthe  \nthrottle.’ \nIn  \nfact, \nit’s \nnot  \nquite \nas  \nsimple \nas  \nthat. \nEarly \nin \nthe  \nRCV's \ndevelop- \nment \nphase \nValentino \nfound \nthat \nthe \nRCV \nhad \ntoo \nmuch \nlow-rpm \ntorque, \nso  \nmuch \nso  \nthat \nit'd  \nkick \nthe \nbike \nsideways \nthe  \nmoment \nhe  \ntouched \nthe  \nthrottle \nat \nmaximum \nlean, \nso \nhe \ngot \nHRC \nto \ntinker \nwith \nthe \ntorque \nCurve. \nTowards \nthe  \nupper \nreaches \nof \nits \nrev  \nrange \nthe  \nRCV \nis \nall \nabout \nbrute \nhorsepower \n— \nin \nfact \nthere’s \nnever \nbeen \na \nmore \npowerful \nGP \nbike. \n‘The \nengine \nis \njust \nbloody \nfast,’ \nadds \nJB.  \n‘There's \nso  \nmuch \npower \nthat \nyou \ncan \njust \ndrive \npast \na \n500, \neven \non \na \nshort \nstraight.’ \nAnd \nthere \nare  \nother \nadvantages. \nFour-strokes \nhave \nmuch \nmore \nengine \nbraking \nthan \ntwo-strokes, \nwhich \ngives \nbetter \ntraction \nand \nimproved \nfeel \non \na \nclosed \nthrottle. \nWe'll \nleave \na \nrival \nengineer, \nGarry \nMcCoy's \nformer \ncrew \nchief, \nHamish \nJamieson, \nto \nexplain \nthis \none. \n‘| \nthink \nthere's \na  \nfew \nreasons \nwhy \nfour-strokes \nare \neasier,’ \nsays \nJamieson. \n‘They're \nheavier \nfor  \na  \nstart, \nwhich \nmakes \nthem \neasier, \nbecause \nthey're \nless  \nflighty. \nThey've \nmore \nweight \nand \ninertia, \nso  \nthey're \nless  \nof  \na \nhandful \nto  \ncontrol, \nwhile \n500s \nare  \nbarely \ntouching \nthe \nground \nhalf \nthe \ntime, \nso \nthey've \ngot \nno \ngrip. \n‘In  \nthe \nRed \nBull \nYamaha \nteam \nwe  \nhad \na  \ngood \nexample \nin \nNori \nHaga \ncoming \nto \n500s \nfrom \nSuperbikes \n\nWA fe  INT NO ross! @) \nlove with the \naie \n(James Wright) \nRCV’'s low \nfuel tank has a \n©  of g  be \nVale found the \ngassed-up -f \nISR a \nhandful in  the early \nstages of r \n(Gold &  Goose) \nin 2001. He  found the  500  difficult to  turn in  because \nthere's no  engine braking. A  500 doesn’t slow down \nwith stability from the  rear  the  way a  four-stroke does. \nGetting a  500 stopped and turned is difficult because \nthe  bike just wants to go straight on,  and  if you  get the \nfront to  stop, the  rear wants to  come around. With a \n500, there's this transition period when the  rider has \nfinished braking but he’s not opened the throttle, so \nthe  bike's loose, it's  not  taut like  a  four-stroke, it’s just \nrunning free, a  bit  out  of control. That's why guys like \nHaga and  Chris Walker struggled on  500s.’ \nBut four-strokes aren't all  good. According to \nminimum weight regulations the  V5  must weigh 15kg \nmore than a  500, and that’s a  huge difference in \nracetrack terms. ‘And the  weight is  also in  different \nplaces compared to  the 500,’ adds Burgess. ‘So  the \nRCV doesn’t turn as  fast  as  the  500  and  Valentino can’t \nflick it left  and right so  quick, plus it’s  fuel injected, so \nit's  a whole new game.’ \nOf  course, too much engine braking can be  a \nbad thing, but HRC have got that well and truly \nsussed with their four-stroke racers. They developed \nthe  so-called back-torque limiter for  the  high-revving \nNR500, to  minimise rear-wheel hop into corners, \nand have perfected the design in  recent years. \npe em te (i \nBurgess again: ‘The RCV's slipper clutch is  just \nanother setting part for  us,  we  can dial it  out for \nsome tracks, sO  we've no  engine braking, and dial it \nin for  others.’ \nThe RCV's five-cylinder configuration helps here \ntoo. Some of Honda's four-stroke GP  rivals have strug- \ngled with excessive engine braking unsettling their \nmachines as  they hurtle into corners, seriously affecting \nlap  times. ‘The five is  definitely a  help on  engine \nbraking,’ adds Burgess. ‘Way back | had an  old  Honda \nCB750 four road bike and | could kick start it with my \nhand, you couldn't do  that with a  Norton twin. It \nfollows that you're going to  have less  compression at \nany  one time if you've got  five  strokes per  two engine \nrevolutions rather than four, and that's got  to  help any \nengine-braking problems.’ \nIf the RCV gives Valentino an  easier ride on  the \nracetrack, it also gives Burgess and his  crew an  easier \ntime in  the  pits. No  longer do  they have to  fully strip \nand rebuild engines, as  they did  with the  NSR because \nRCV engines are  prepared away from the racetrack. \nAlso, the  bike's fuel injection system means no  more \nfiddling around with carburettor jets, and the four- \nstroke’s wider rpm range means less mucking about \nwith gearbox ratios.

Aossi's WEAPONS \nMaximum respect \nFonda NSR500 \n2000/2001 \nValentino's Nastro Azzurro Honda NSR500 was the  last \nand greatest of  the  two-stroke 500s that ruled Grand \nPrix racing for  quarter of a  century, from 1975 to  2001. \nThe machine was the  apogee of the  high-performance \ntwo-stroke racer, a  190hp, 130kg surface-to-surface \nmissile that could be safely and  successfully guided only \nby the  sharpest, bravest riders. \nValentino has  more respect for  the  NSR than any \nother motorcycle he’s ridden. ‘I think it’s  necessary to \nhave big balls to  ride  the  500,’ he says. ‘The four-stroke \nRCV may be  faster but  for  sure it doesn’t give same \nsensation. Yes, the  satisfaction of riding the  500 was a \nvery, very big  motivation for  me, because when you're \nriding the  most difficult bike in the  world, it’s  necessary \nto  have a  perfect set-up if you're to  be able to  ride  fast, \nand  you've also got to  ride perfect all the  time.’ \nBy the time Valentino graduated to  500s in  2000, \nthe  NSR500 had  been developed into  the  most successful >   immune \n500  GP  bike  ever.

It's  great with Valentino because he  wants to \nwork at  making the  bike better. | think it’s  because he \ncame from 125s and 250s, where you have to  get  the \nmost out  of  the  machine to  win. Mick came to  500s \nfrom Superbikes, which are  less technically accurate.’ \nWhen Valentino quit Aprilia at  the  end of 1999 to \ngraduate to  500s with Honda, the  NSR was losing its \ndominance.

The \nSpaniard had asked HRC for more horsepower (a \nmistake that many racers make) and that’s the last \nthing the  NSR needed. With more power the  NSR got \nslower, not faster, because it became more difficult to \nride. It was Valentino who saved the  day. \n‘Valentino was like  a  new brain for  Honda, his  mind \nwas unpolluted and uncluttered by  some of  the NSR \nphobias the  other guys may have had,’ adds Burgess. ‘He \ngave clear and  honest comments that gave the  engineers \nsomething to  get their teeth into. Because he was new to \nthe  bike, he wanted to work on  things that Mick and Alex \nhad got  used to  because they'd always been that way. \nAlso, Valentino rides different to Mick. He still  has a bit of a \n250  style, he doesn’t hang off as  far as  Mick used to,  and \nhe ran  the bike higher than Mick did, to get it steered.’ \nHonda pretty quickly realised that the  young genius \ndeserved a  new NSR. ‘The old  bike had a  lack of rear \ntraction compared to  the Yamaha and Suzuki, so \nValentino would be spinning the  rear rather than going \nforward,’ Burgess continues. ‘They built a new bike for \n135 \n\nVAC Ee NIN, © ross! ®) possi's WE A Gens \nthe  last  few races of 2000, with the  engine higher and \nfurther back for  better acceleration traction.’ \nAnd traction, especially rear-end traction, is  every- \nthing in  big-bike racing, as  rival Suzuki engineer Warren \nWilling explains: ‘To  get the  best race time out  of a  500 \nyou have to  compromise, you mustn't abuse the  tyres \nany more than necessary. It’s  about understanding the \ndynamics and the  interaction that’s going on  between \nrider and bike and remembering that all  the  forces on \nthe motorcycle are  driven through the tyres. All  the \nhorsepower in the  world doesn’t equate to  any  force if \nit’s  not  hooked up.  It’s  all  in the  tyres: how the  suspen- \nsion effects them, how the  engine effects them, the \nrider, the  track temperature and so  on.’ \nHRC's decision to shift the  NSR’s centre of mass didn’t \nonly improve the  bike out  of  turns. ‘The higher engine \nposition also threw more weight on  to  the  front during \nbraking, improving traction into turns,’ Burgess explains. \n‘Then we  just played around with suspension and  linkages \nto fix the speed of weight transfer from rear  to front.’ \nFinally, the  shift in  overall balance also helped fix \nthe  NSR's oldest problem —  understeer. The bike had \nalways been known for  drifting wide through corners, \nand that’s one reason for  Doohan’s famous hunched- \nover-the-front riding style; he was desperately trying to \nget more weight up front. \nValentino, Burgess and HRC also worked at \n136 \nMaking sense of \nquiggly lines, \nWe and Jerry \n2Ss examine \nNSR data. (Henk \nKeulemans) \nimproving the  NSR's already very linear power delivery. \nLike Doohan before him, Valentino prioritised a  user- \nfriendly mid-range over peak horsepower because 500 \nriding is all  about meting out  the  power, and you  can't \ndo that if the  power curve isn’t right. That's why his 2001 \nNSR was equipped with uber-trick magnesium Keihins, \nof which there were only two sets  in existence. No other \nHonda rider was deemed worthy of  them. Of  course, \neven with that kind of help, 500 racing was always like \nriding the  razor’s edge for Valentino, and  that’s why he \nso  loved his  NSR. The  new breed of GP  four-strokes may \nbe quicker but they don’t give that same skating-on-the- \nedge-of-disaster feeling that racers crave. When a rider \ngets it right on  a 500, he's  climbed Mount Everest. \nChris Walker, who had a torrid crash-happy time with \nan  NSR  during 2001, puts it like this: ‘If you  go through a \ncorner on  a 500  and  don’t get it quite right and  you  think \nabout it, you've missed the  next turn! There’s so  much \nthinking, the trouble is that everything happens so  fast. If \nyou  make a mistake, you're generally wearing it, whereas \non  a  Superbike they give you some warning. On  a  500, \nyou miss a  gear going into a  corner and that's it, you've \ncrashed. Do that on  a Superbike and  you'll probably be all \nright, you  bang down the  gears and  find one, run  wide \nand  maybe touch the  grass, but  you  get  away with it.  If \nyou watch a  500 GP  there's not  many mistakes made \nbecause a mistake generally means a crash.’ \n\nVAS BUNT IN '@ ross! @)rossi's \nFast but fickle \nAprilia RSWe250 \n1998/1999 \nAprilia has enjoyed so  much success over the past \ndecade that it’s  easy to  forget just how short a  time \nthe little Italian factory has been with us.  The first \nAprilia grand prix bike was built in  1985, a  kind of \nbackyard special using a  Rotax 250 motor, and yet  by \nthe time Valentino won the 1999 250 crown the \nfactory had won ten  world titles and over 100 GPs in \nthe  250 and 125  categories. \nLike Soichiro Honda almost half a  century before \nhim, Aprilia founder Ivan Beggio is well into his  racing, \nand it was Aprilia’s track successes that quickly estab- \nlished the  brand as  a  serious player in  the  Italian and \nthen the world markets. Neither is there any  doubt that \nthe  company’s relationship with the  two highest-profile \nItalian racers of  recent years —  Valentino and before \nhim Max Biaggi —  helped burn the marque into the \npublic consciousness. \nIn  turn, both Valentino and Biaggi have been \nlucky to  have had Aprilia around. It  is  Italy's motor- \ncycle industry that has  helped foster so  many Italian \nstars, and without Aprilia, their climb to  the  top of \nthe sport would almost certainly have been much \nmore difficult. Good machinery is vital in  motorsport, \nwithout it even the  best riders can fail  to  make the \nmost of  their talent, so  it’s  not inconceivable that \nValentino and Biaggi would never have made it \nwithout Aprilia around. \nValentino was also lucky that the  Aprilia RSW250 \nwas the  most competitive 250 when he  graduated to \nthe  class in  1998. In  fact, ‘98  was the  factory's best- \never year in GP  racing, the  RSW winning all  but  one  of \nthe season's 15  races. It  hadn't always been so,  for \nalthough Aprilia’s 250s had always been fast, they'd \nalso been fragile and  fickle. \nWEAPONS \nAprilia RSW250 1989 \nEngine specifications coe \nType liquid-cooled, 90°  V-twin two-stroke, disc \nvalve induction, with adjustable ignition, \nexhaust control \n54 x  54.5mm \n249.6cc \nBore & stroke \nDisplacement \nFuel system two 42mm DellOrto carbs \nClaimed output over 96hp at  12,500rpm \nGearbox six-speed, cassette type \nChassis specifications \nFrame type dual beam aluminium \nTyres Dunlop \nWheels 17in front and rear \nfour-pot Brembo, twin 255/273mm carbon \ndiscs (dry), twin cast-iron discs (wet) \nRear-breake two-pot Brembo, single 190mm disc \nFront suspension 42mm upside down Ohlins, multi-adjustable \nRear suspension carbon swingarm with Ohlins shock, \nmulti-adjustable \n1,270mm \n1,970mm \nFront brake \nWheelbase \nLength \nRace weight 96kg \n137 \n\nVOR BIN SENG @ \nAprilia won its  first 250 GP  in  1987, with Loris \nReggiani on  board, but  it wasn’t until ‘92  that the  bike \nbecame consistently competitive against its  Japanese \nrivals, Biaggi, Reggiani and Frankie Chili all  scoring \nfamous victories over main rivals Honda. It was another \ntwo years before race wins were turned into champi- \nonship wins, Biaggi dominating the  1994, ‘95  and '96 \ncampaigns before defecting to  Honda. \nThe  Aprilia’s winning speed has  always been attrib- \nuted to  one major factor —  its  intake system. While all \nthe Japanese 250s —  Honda's NSR, Yamaha's YZR and \nSuzuki's RGV —  use  reed-valve induction, the  RSW uses \ndisc-valve induction. Disc valves offer the  opportunity \nfor  higher peak power output but  with a  trade-off in \nlower-rpm usability, while reeds do the  opposite, deliv- \nering heaps of user-friendly mid-range but  rather stran- \ngling the  engine at  peak revs. \nIn its earlier days the  Aprilia probably suffered more \nthan it gained from its  uniqueness, for  while the  bike \nwas a  rocketship in  a  straight line, with a  maniacally \nfast pick-up, it was slow out of  the  corners because \nriders struggled to  cope with the vicious power \n138 \nrossi@) Rossi's WE ATP @UNes \ndelivery. But as   electronics developed during the \nNineties, that awkwardness was tamed, thanks to \nmuch-improved ignition systems and exhaust power- \nvalves. GP  racing's switch to  unleaded fuel in  ‘98  also \ncalmed things down. \nNevertheless, the RSW’'s powerband was still \ncrazily narrow —   with the real business tucked \nbetween 12,000 and 13,000rpm —   so  Valentino \ndidn’t find the RSW the easiest of  machines to \nmaster in  ‘98. While he  was immediately fast on  the \nbike, it chucked him off  at  every opportunity in their \nfirst season together. He  crashed out  of  no  less  than \nfour races in  ‘98. \n‘I'm still riding my 250 like it’s  a  125,’ said \nValentino midway through his  debut 250 season. ‘| am \ntrying to  learn something from my  team-mates Harada \nand Capirossi but  it doesn’t work to  change your own \nstyle too  much, everyone has  their own way of riding a \nmotorcycle. |  ride very different from Harada and \nCapirossi.

It  took \nyears for factory engineers to  get the  bike's chassis fully \nsorted. Initially, the RSW’s twin-beam aluminium frame \n—  ostensibly the  same as  its  rivals —  was too  stiff, giving \nriders a  scary, edgy feel which failed to  induce confi- \ndence through some corners and at  some circuits. No \nwonder Valentino found the  NSR500 so  easy to  get  on \nwith when he quit Aprilia at the  end of '99. \n@) soss 6S WEArP ONS \nRossi's \nlearner special \nAprilia RS17125R \n1995/1996/1997 \nEven the fastest 125 GP bikes aren't imposing \nmachines, until you see a  bunch of  them involved in  a \nscary mid-race encounter, their riders taking the  kind of \nrisks that would get them into serious trouble on  a \nMotoGP bike. If MotoGP racing is a  hi-tech confronta- \ntion between outrageously over-powerful surface- \nattack missiles, then 125 GP racing is  good ol’ \nfashioned hand-to-hand combat. \nIn  125s, it's  not the bikes that are impressive, it’s \nwhat the  riders can do  with them that’s impressive. A \n125 forgives where a  250 or  MotoGP bike won't, so \n125 racing is a  great way for  a  rider to  smooth off  his \nroughest edges, before moving on to more \ndemanding, more dangerous machines. In   125s \nthrottle control is  not  very important, with less than \n50hp available you can take big  greedy handfuls and \n(probably) get away with it. \nUnlike big-bike racing, throttle control isn't what \nAprilia RS125R 1997 \nEngine specifications \nType liquid-cooled, single-cylinder two-stroke, \ndisc-valve induction, with adjustable ignition, \nexhaust control \n54 x 54.5mm \n124.8cc \nBore & stroke \nDisplacement \nFuel system 39mm DellOrto carb \nClaimed output over 45hp at  12,700rpm \nGearbox six-speed, cassette type \nChassis specifications \nFrame type dual beam aluminium \nTyres Dunlop \nWheels 17in front and  rear \nfour-pot Brembo, single carbon disc  (dry), \nsingle cast-iron disc (wet) \nRear-brake two-pot Brembo, single steel disc \nFront suspension 35mm upside down Ohlins, multi-adjustable \nRear suspension aluminum swingarm with Ohlins shock, \nmulti-adjustable \nWheelbase 1,250mm \nLength 1,970mm \nRace weight 71kg \nFront brake \n139 \n\nVOAN IE  EIN WNT @ \nreally matters in   125s. What really matters is \nmaintaining momentum, and that means super-fast \ncorner entry and mid-corner speeds. That's why 125 \nriders are  always bouncing off  each other as  they fight \nfor the  fast  line. The  bikes have so  little power that you \nmust never scrub off  more speed through a  turn than \nabsolutely necessary. In  fact, they have so  little power \nthat 125  riders believe it’s  worth bringing a little bit  of \nfoot power into  the  equation, frantically paddling away \nfrom the  start of each race. \nValentino learned plenty from his  Aprilia 125. He \nspent four years on  different versions of the tiny single, \ninitially with a  Sandroni special in  the ‘94 Italian \nchampionship, then in  the ‘95 Euro and Italian series, \nthen in  GPs, winning his  first World Championship \nsuccess at  Brno in  August ‘96, then dominating the \nfollowing season to  wrap up  his first world title. \nThe 125’s engine internals are  very similar to  the \n250’s with almost identical porting arrangements, but \n140 \nrossi &) \nS WEA PrP  GINS \nAes iS l= \nBly. \nAprilia \nwith only half the  250’s horsepower, so  the  125 rolls \nover and dies if it slips out  of  its  powerband. To  keep \nthe  bike moving well, Valentino had to  play hard and \nfast with the  ultra-close ratio gearbox, trying to  keep \nthe  tacho bouncing around in  the 12  to  13,000rom \nzone. That was agony in  the old  days, because the \nvibration caused havoc with a  certain part of the  male \nanatomy, but  Aprilia generously added a  countershaft \nbalancer before Valentino came along. \nSize is  important in  125s, the smaller the better, \nwhich explains why Valentino’s RSR  tipped the  scales at \na  puny 71kg, less  than half  the  weight of his  RCV four- \nstroke. Everything about the bike is  puny, from the \nminiscule aluminium twin-beam chassis (again, a \nshrunken version of  its  big  brother 250) to  the  skinny \nDunlop slicks. The  RSR  is a  learner GP  bike, so  it’s got to \nbe  easy to  throw around and easy to  dominate. And \nthere can be  no  doubt that the  bike helped Rossi on \nthe  path to  big-bike glory. \n\nVASE EIN IN@ ROSS! QB can \nm \nm \nD \nSa AT hea ties \nMinimoto mayhem \nIn  the early \nnineties.

His  sublime talent to ride a \nmotorcycle faster than anyone on  the  planet is \nconfirmed by a glittering array of prizes —  already _ \nthree world titles and  over 40 Grand Prix wins —  but \nhis genius goes far beyond that. \nIn an  age of identikit motorsports stars, Rossi’s \ngrinning face stands out.

This all-colour book examines the \nRossi phenomenon and charts his  amazing life, \nfrom his earliest days falling off minibikes to his \nrelentless assault on  biking’s dizziest peaks. \nAuthor Mat  Oxley wrote this  biography in close \nco-operation with Rossi and his family.

He’s got  the  capability to  stay \nright on  it week after week, which is where the  other \nguys fall  short. For  sure he’s  fast, but  some of the  others \nare  fast too. It’s  his  mental strength that pulls him \nthrough. If ever he  has  a  problem and a  little doubt \ncreeps in, he pulls through and  he’s  stronger than before. \nEver since he’s been in  GPs he’s been good for  the \nsport. He’s a  colourful character, he  loves life, he  loves \nriding motorcycles and he  wants to  portray that to \neverybody. He  arrived and changed the  way people \nthink about racing. He  proved that you can  have fun, \neven though he’s  very serious and  focused. \nAlso, he's  a team player. He  doesn’t believe he’s  the \nonly guy in  the team and that's really important in \nracing. Sure, he’s lucky to  have Jerry Burgess and the \nteam working with him, like  | was —  because JB's  got so \nmuch experience —  but  he  has  got  a  very good feeling \nfor  the motorcycle. He  understands what's going on \naround him, which is why he tends to  stay on.

In  fact it is the \nfunny old  game of ‘| can  go faster than you’ amplified to \nthe  nth  degree; grown men risking life and  limb for ego. \nThis book is  about a  man who has played this \ngame like few others, achieving an  extraordinary run  of \nsuccesses while wearing a  smile as  wide as  his  extrava- \ngant racing lines. Valentino Rossi just loves racing \nmotorcycles, and his  infectious enthusiasm for  speed \nand two wheels has transported him into the \nmainstream and helped change the way the world \nlooks at  bike racing. As  someone recently said, Rossi is \nnot  your ‘typical motorcycle racing psychopath’. \nValentino skipped into the World Championship \narena seven years ago as  a  mopheaded teenager. \n‘Who's that girl?’ people asked. Now, as  a bewhiskered \nLondon geezer, his  face is  more recognised than any \nmotorcyclist’s in  history. Rossi has  become GP  racing, \nhe’s a  phenomenon, and yet  he’s a  rider on  a  multi- \nmillion pound salary who still  likes to  muck about with \nthe stickers on  his race bike. That's not  normal. \nValentino keeps it simple, stays true to his roots. He's \na rider who thinks deeply about his racing but  never out- \nthinks himself. His  philosophy is straightforward: think \nhard, have fun. He  isn’t a  desperate trier, he’s  a  natural, \ndoing the  right thing comes easily to  him, whether it's \nriding right or  looking right. The  man understands. \nHe  approaches his  racing. both as  boy and man, \nboth as  art  and science. To  him the  art  of  the  racing \nline is  ‘like a  poem’, which is why he  can magic the \nkind of  lines of  which most racers seem incapable. As \npaddock philosopher Dr  Claudio Costa says: ‘Valentino \nabandons himself to  the  creativity of the  mind so  that \nhe  can  play the  game of  life  according to  the  carefree \nrules of the  child.’ \nAnd yet he  is  almost digitally efficient. ‘The \nweirdest thing that happens to  me  when |'m  racing,’ \nhe says, ‘is that | perceive the  race not  as  a unit but  as  a \nsuccession of  fragments that pass before my  eyes in \nslow motion.’ Which may go  some way to  explaining \nhow he  unerringly applied his  relentless two-year \nprogramme to  deal with the  125, 250 and 500 World \nChampionships; one year to  explore each new class, \none  year to conquer. But  this  season he has  ditched the \ntwo-year plan, dominating the new _ four-stroke \nMotoGP class from the  outset. His  touch, it seems, is \nmore golden than that of King Midas. \nValentino is so  good at  racing, so  good at  life,  that \nhe seems almost too  good to  be true, like  the  invention \nof  some Hollywood scriptwriter with a  Superman \ncomplex who writes an  impossible amount of  genius \nand nobility into his  male lead. Of  course, Rossi isn’t \nSuperman, he just likes to  dress that way sometimes... \nMat Oxley \nLondon, England, May 2002"

Standing at  Stowe \nCorner amongst the crumpled beer cans, | watched \nGraziano Rossi lay waste to  the 250 pack, his  extrava- \ngant style and the speed of  his  lovely Morbidelli \nmoving him well clear of  that year’s world champ, \nKawasaki's Kork Ballington. With just three corners to \ngo  he  had stretched his  advantage to  an  unbeatable \n2.5  seconds. Then he crashed. \nAs  a  reckless 20-year-old | thought that was pretty \ncool —  chucking away a  surefire win like  he just didn’t \ncare. Why slow down just because you can almost \ntaste the  champagne? Rossi was a  motorcycle racer \ndoing what he  thought he  was paid to  do:  going as \nfast as  he possibly could, from green light to chequered \nflag.

His  leathers and helmet were white, \nrent through by a  zigzag lightning streak of  red  and \ngreen for  the  Italian tricolor, and his  shoulder-length \nhair whipped around from beneath his  helmet.

In fact, he  was so \nright that | used to  spend evenings doing sketches of \nmy  own Rossi-replica leathers and helmet, which | kind \nof knew I'd  never get around to owning. \nRossi retired a few  years later, a nasty bump on  the \nhead forcing an  end to  a  career that never made the \nmost of  his  intelligence and riding talent.

Twelve years later | \nspotted him off  a  bike for  the  first time, not  counting \nthat moment he’d parted company with his  Morbidelli \nat  Silverstone. During the  summer of  ‘91  | was in  the \nAdriatic resort of  Rimini doing a  story on  Italy's latest \ncraze, minimoto racing, and  there he was, stood by the \ntrack beneath the  floodlights (it was almost midnight), \nwatching intently. | went over to  shake his  hand, to tell \nhim he'd been a  hero of mine and  to  ask  him  what he \nwas doing at some dodgy minimoto track in the  middle \nof the  night. Rossi pointed into  the  gloom, at a  midget \nfigure circulating the midget racetrack on  a  midget \nbike. ‘Is my  son, Valentino,’ he grinned. ‘Good to  meet \nyou,’ | replied, and not  wanting to  cause any  further \nembarrassment to  either of us,  | made my  excuses and \nleft papa and bambino to  themselves, never thinking \nI'd see  them again. \nOf  course, | got to  see plenty of  them, we  all  did. \nOver the  next decade the  little kid  would grow into a \nbig kid,  dazzling pretty much the  whole world with his \nspeed and charisma, his  ever so  slightly eccentric dad \nalong for  the  ride, eschewing flash hotels to  sleep in \nthe  back of his  BMW. \nIt wouldn't be  too  much of an  exaggeration to  say \nthat Valentino Rossi has  changed the face of grand prix \nracing; certainly no  other bike racer has  ever got closer \nto  being a  pop  star.

He’s the \nfourth youngest rider to  have worn the  500  crown, the \nyoungest man to  have won three world titles and at \nthe  age  of just 23  he’s  already well into  the  top ten  all- \ntime GP winners’ list. \nHis  progress has  been so  relentless that it smacks \nof  the automaton sportsman —   grim-faced, head \ndown, no  thought for  anything but  total victory —  and \nyet  each and every one of  his  successes has been \nachieved with a joy that never fails to touch everyone's \nheart. ‘Valentino likes to  win, he’s a  great fighter,’ says \nhis  engineer Jerry Burgess, who's worked closely with \nthe  youngster since the end of  1999. ‘But he  also \nknows we're in the  entertainment business, so  he  likes \nto  entertain.’ \nEven back in  his  125 and 250 days his  infectious \nenthusiasm was breaking the sport to  whole new \naudiences, amongst them the Valenteenyboppers, \ngangs of Italian schoolgirls drawn to  racetracks by their \nheart-throb's pretty blue eyes. Valentino doesn’t appre- \nciate that kind of  attention though because he’s a bit \nof a  biking purist. ‘They’re not  fans of Rossi the  motor- \ncycle racer, but  just because I've  got  blue eyes, | don't \nlike,’ he  says with faint exasperation after years spent \nfleeing these seething ranks of  moist, pubescent Latin \nlovelies. ‘It's  good to  have one  or  two nice girls chasing \nyou, but not one thousand.’ That's what he  says, but \nyou wonder if  he  really means it  once you've been"

Their passion goes back to \nthe  start of the  20th century, to  the  earliest days of the \nmotor industry when Italy fell  head over heels in  love \nwith the  machine and  the  future that machines might \noffer. Futurism was an  Italian cultural phenomenon, \nfuelled by the  birth of the  new technological society, a \nnew age of  noise and speed: aeroplanes, cars, motor- \ncycles and telecommunications. ‘We declare that the \nworld’s splendour has  been enriched by a  new beauty: \nthe  beauty of speed,’ proclaimed Italy's 1909 manifesto \nof  Futurism. ‘A  racing motor car, its  frame adorned \nwith great pipes, like  snakes with explosive breath...a \nroaring motor car,  which seems to  run  on  shrapnel... \nOkay, so  they were getting a  bit  carried away but  you \ncan see  what they meant, and it’s  no  different now; in \nBritain people hate noisy cars and bikes, in  Italy they \nlove ‘em. \nOfficially sanctioned long-distance street races, \nroaring from one town to  the  next, exploded across \nItaly during the  1920s as  the  nation’s big  five motor- \ncycle factories (the so-called Pentarchia of  Benelli, \nBianchi, Garelli, Gilera) and Guzzi) fought for \nsupremacy in the  showrooms by fighting for supremacy \non  the  ‘racetracks’. Such was the  national passion for \nthese often lethal events that Italy was the last \nContinental nation to  ban racing on  public roads. Italy's \npowered two-wheeler industry really took off  after the \nSecond World War when the rapidly industrialising \nnation needed to get the  largely peasant workforce out \nof  the villages and into the factories.

His  attitude \nto  life  and to  racing demands inevitable comparisons \nwith that of  Mick Doohan, the man who dominated \n500 GPs when Valentino was riding 125s and 250s, \nand whose team he  inherited after the  Australian quit \nracing at the  end  of 1999. \nIn fact, ‘The Doctor’ and ‘Mighty Mick’ have little in \ncommon, apart from their blinding talent to  ride a \nmotorcycle faster than anyone else on  this planet. \nDoohan was a driven man, to the  scariest of degrees, he \nused to  go  racing like  there were demons chasing him, \nand  if he ever slowed down, they'd have him. There was \na  terrorised urgency to  his  riding, he  forced the  bike \ndown into corners, hunched over the front like some \nkind of desperado; ‘all  prick and  ribs  like a drover's dog’, \nas  the  Aussies would say. Who knows what drove him, \nbut the  inside of a  racer’s head is a strange place: weird \nforces driving weird psyches to  take weird risks, and \nmaybe the  pain that cut  right through his injury-blighted \ncareer coloured his  temperament. Valentino (so far, \ntouch wood, relatively unscarred by  racing) doesn’t \nseem to  possess that kind of mildly psychotic inner self \nand  really does look like  he’s  having fun  on  the  bike; he \nlooks more natural, more fluid, more smooth. Off  track \nhe appears remarkably well adjusted, with few obvious \nsigns of that often ruinous desperation to  prove himself \nbigger and braver than everyone else, which is  the \ndefining behavioural characteristic of  so  many racers. \nMostly he just seems to be having a ball. \n‘I've always said Mick enjoyed winning and \nValentino enjoys racing,’ adds Burgess, who previously \nguided Doohan to  his five  500  crowns. ‘If Valentino has \na  great race and  finishes second, he’s  disappointed but \nhe’s  not  angry with the  world like  Mick used to  be, he's \nnot  going to tear your head off.’ \nFormer journalist Barry Coleman, who covered the \nWorld Championships when Rossi senior was racing, \nknows from where he  got those characteristics. \n‘Graziano was anything but  a typical motorcycle racing \npsychopath,’ Coleman recalls. ‘He’s a  marvellous man \nand it’s  inevitable that Valentino has  taken a  lot  from \nhaving a dad like that. Valentino recently said: “I'm just \na fan  on  a bike”, and | think that’s exactly how he is.’ \nToo true, Vale (as mates call him, pronounced \n‘Valay’) was a  dedicated GP  anorak long before he \nStarted racing, with an  encyclopaedic knowledge of \nriders’ helmet designs, numbers and liveries. One of  his \nearliest visits to  a  GP  is  burned into his  memory, as  it \nwould be  in the  mind of any  ordinary race fan. ‘The first \nGP  | remember going to  see  was Mugello '91,’ he  says. \n‘| used to  watch all  the races on  TV,  so  | knew all  the \nriders’ numbers, all  their helmet designs, the whole \ncircus. | was with Gibo (Badioli, old family friend and \nnow his manager) and Graziano. We parked the \ncamper at  Casanova Savelli (a  daunting, downhill \nright-left flick where his fan  club now camps out) and | \nremember very well the 125 race with Ueda, with \nnumber 56  and the  green and blue Hero Sports Honda, \nfighting with Capirossi and Gresini.’ This is not  normal. \nMost riders hold zero interest in  other racers, except \ntheir direct competitors, but Valentino really is  an \nenthusiast. He  can  even recognise a  journalist's helmet \ndesign. When | was researching this  book he  grabbed \nmy  lid  and said: ‘Yes, | remember your helmet from \nwhen | was a  boy reading Motosprint [Italy's biking \nweekly], didn't you have a  big accident one day, going \nunder a  truck?’ Well, yes, | did. So  what can we  tell \nfrom this? That he’s bright, that he’s got a  good \nmemory, but  most of all  that he’s  interested in ordinary \npeople, which Is a serious rarity in the  me-me-me world \nof GP  racing. Some top-line racers show less  interest in \npeople like  us  than some folk might in their dustman. \nHe  is even aware that it's  pretty weird having his \nbiography published when he's only 23  (in  fact this is \nthe  fourth Rossi book in  as  many summers). ‘Yes,’ he \ngrins. ‘Is  strange, but | don’t take it serious, it's  not \npossible to  take everything serious, in  life  or  in  racing. \nIf possible | take it with a smile, it makes life easier.’ \nValentino's uncomplicated, unaffected, unpreten- \ntious attitude to   life and racing is  everything. \nNowadays, GPs are more intense, if  less lethal, than \nthey've ever been. Track safety may be better than ever \nbut  the  danger is still  there, and grand prix  riders tend \nto  crash more often these days, because the  demands \nand rewards of World Championship racing drive them \nto  exist on  the outer extremes of  traction.

They take their \nrisks, On  assignment, between dawn and 4.30pm’. In \nGP  racing, it’s Sundays between noon and 3pm. \nThat's exactly what Valentino found when he came to \nGPs in  1996. If  Doohan had raised dedication and \ncommitment to  a  new level, the  Australian’s psychotic \napproach to  racing had transformed paddock atmos- \nphere. Mighty Mick was breaking everyone's balls \n(including his own), he brought withering aggression and \nunrelenting pressure to  his  racing, because that’s what he \nneeded to  win. And he  was so  successful that everyone \nmimicked his  attitude until the  paddock became almost \nunbearably intense. Valentino wanted to  change all that, \nhe  couldn't imagine going racing and not  having fun, \nhe'd hate it, what'd be the  point? So he changed things. \n‘When | came to  GPs all  the  riders were very, very \nserious,’ he  recalls. ‘So  when | started winning, me  and \nmy  friends decided we  should try  to  make some big"

It’s  all  just good fun, \nthough there's little doubt there's an  element of palliative \nhere, as  if to ward off the  round-the-clock stress that gets \nto  many big-time riders. By halfway through a  GP  season \nsome riders look burned out and ground down, but \nValentino counteracts the pressure, even though, or \nperhaps because, he’s the  most sought after of  all,  his \nevery step dogged by a  ravenous pack of  Italian media, \nshades on,  notebooks in hand, pretending to  be his mate. \nNo  motorcycle racer has  ever been bigger than Rossi, \nnot  even glam Seventies’ superstar Barry Sheene who was \nrossi A) 1 mS GuMie Nee AoOrs' SI \nfamously namechecked in  a  top-ten hit.

The ladies, the  Valenteenies \nand  the  kids  love him  too; so  these days whole families sit \ndown to watch GP  racing like  never before. \nValentino arrived at  the pinnacle of  his  sport with \nimpeccable timing, for motorcycle racing needed \nsomeone with mainstream pulling power if  it  was to \nthrust itself into  the  global consciousness. Like any  other \n21st century sport, bike racing is  a commodity that has  to \nbe sold to  as  many consumers as  possible, and  Valentino's \nsweet, smiling face is  exactly what the  sport, and the \ncorporations behind it, were looking for,  the  weapon that \nwould fire  their products deep into the  wish lists of \nconsumers. Indeed, there’ve been times over the  last  few \nyears when it appears that Rossi is grand prix racing, he  is \nits sun, the  rest  of the show just orbits around him. \n21"

Battered by the  incessant demands of the  media, \nhis sweet nature hardened somewhat, the  perma-grin of \nhis  125 and 250 years buckled; it  had to  if he  was to \npreserve his  sanity. And he  gave up  his  more outlandish \npost-race celebrations. This, after all,  is what we  do  to \nthe celebrities we adore. We squeeze out of  them \nexactly what it  is  that we  love within them, as  Oscar \nWilde once observed, we  kill  the  things we  love. \nEven so,  Valentino is still  as  at  ease with his  mind- \nboggling fame as  it's  possible to  be.  And in  that sense \nhe’s the  very opposite of  his  predecessor Doohan, who \ncouldn't help but look agonisingly, but endearingly, \nawkward whenever thrust into the  limelight outside of \nhis  helmet. Doohan, you see, never crossed into the \nmainstream, never ever wanted to.  Roberts again: ‘The \nthings that make Valentino popular are  also the  things \nthat make life  hard for  him.

That's the way the world \nworks, we  didn’t invent it, we  just have to  live  in it.’ \nThe  devastating demands of riding the  fastest bikes \non  earth have also made their mark. Like Doohan, \nEighties’ 500 king Eddie Lawson and many others \nbefore him, Valentino's face has  aged rapidly since he \nmoved on  from 250s: the  cheeks more hollow, the  eyes \nmore sunken, the  look a little more haunted. That's \nwhat 200 horsepower motorcycles do to  you. \nAnd yet despite the  pressurised lifestyle, both on  an \noff  the  track, he  obviously does love what he’s doing, \nand like  Becks, he’s  fully aware of the  Faustian contract \nhe’s  made with fame. ‘For  sure there is more good than \nbad  to  being famous,’ says Rossi with a  glint in  his  eye. \n‘The bad  thing Is the  stress.

Maybe not \nentirely, believes Giampiero Sacchi, the urbane Italian \nmanager who brought the  mop-haired 16-year-old into \nGP  racing back in  1996. ‘The Valentino concept is this,’ \nsays Sacchi. ‘He  wants other people to  think that he’s \njust having fun but  for  sure he’s not  just having fun, \ninside he’s  saying: ‘You think I'm  just crazy but  I’m  not’. | \nthink this is  the  key  to  understanding Valentino; you \nwatch him  and it looks like  he’s  just  having fun, but  if \nyou  watch him  more carefully you  realise there's nothing \ncasual about what he  does, everything happens for  a \nreason, his  is a  very studied performance, he’s thinking \nabout all the  details, all the  time.’ In other words, there's \na fair dose of cunning in his make-up. Of course there is, \nno  guileless rider ever won a world championship. \nNo  wimp ever won a  World Championship either, \nhe’ \nAOS S11 \nso  how come someone so  apparently sweet-natured as \nValentino has  carved such a  swathe through the  sport? \nBike racing is a vicious game, and  while he isn’t  the  kind \nof  rider who strikes fear into rivals by  riding out of \ncontrol, there's no  doubt that he  takes no  shit from \nanyone when he’s on  the  racetrack. Scary aggression, \nintimidation and a  bit  of  argy-bargy are  all  part of \nracing. ‘GP riders don't mind riding into each other,’ \nsays Jeremy McWilliams, a  stubborn rival during \nValentino's ride to  his  first 500 win at  the  2000 British \nGP.  ‘You want to  pass as  cleanly as  possible, but if \nyou're getting frustrated and it’s  the  last  lap, you ride \ninto  the  guy. And it helps if you’ve got a  bit of a  reputa- \ntion for  being crazy. You need to  stamp your authority \non  the  other guys when you're making a move.’ \nPeople love Valentino because he’s capable of \nracing hard, working hard and enjoying himself. His \nrivals also work hard but  most of them have forgotten \nhow to  get their kicks out  of what they're doing. Work \nhard, play hard isn’t a new concept but  it’s  a  concept \nlost on  many of  today’s richly rewarded sports stars, \nwhether they're Formula One drivers, tennis players or \nbike racers. And there's something deeply unattractive \nabout watching someone getting paid serious money \nfor  doing what they love and yet  remaining so  deter- \nminedly miserable. Vale could never do  that, whatever \nthe  hours he  puts into his  racing. ‘And he  really does \nwork at  it, more than | ever did,’ agrees Doohan. ‘He's \nin  the  garage till  all  hours of the  night, going through"

During his  first year in  500s, Valentino badly \noverslept at  the  Catalan GP  missing half of  morning \npractice. ‘When | wake up  | always have a  big confusion \nfor  the  first five  minutes,’ he  says in  mitigation. ‘Then | \nremember: “Oh fack, I’m  at world grand prix!”.’ \nFew club racers are  that laidback and his  horizontal \ndemeanour once again contrasts vividly with Doohan, \nwho, you just know, would've been a  very different \nperson on  race mornings, awakening like  some psycho \nout of  a  dodgy Hollywood thriller, lying rigid on  his \nback, eyes twitching from tight shut to  wild stare in, \nwell, the  blink of an  eye. \nBurgess remembers the Catalunya incident. ‘He \narrived in the  pits in a state of shock, he’d never missed a \npractice session in his life.  When he was  at Aprilia his chief \nmechanic always went down to his motorhome and woke \nhim  up,  So  now it’s me  that goes and  knocks on  the  door.’ \nBurgess has  always known how to  extract the  best \nfrom his  riders. Before Valentino and Doohan, the \nAussie helped Freddie Spencer and Wayne Gardner to \nworld titles during the Eighties. He  expects 100 per \ncent commitment both on  and off  the  track, and when \nhe doesn’t get  it, he  tells them exactly what he thinks. \nSome other crew chiefs won't do that, they're too  wary \nof  destabilising their riders. There's no  doubt that the \nBurgess tough love has  played its  part in  Valentino's \nretire to \nand watc \nworld go by \nof the tov \nalready as \nits home-gr« \nhero. (M \nrecent successes, and yet  Burgess is  clever enough to \nrealise that his  rider wouldn't react well to  regimenta \ntion. ‘Valentino is  Valentino, and if you kill  that off  you \nmay kill  off the  goose that lays the  golden egg,’ he \nsays. ‘You've got to  let  him be  himself, he  certainly \ndoesn’t clown around in  testing and he’s always well \napplied in  practice. In  that way he’s like Mick, you \nnever see  him just riding around, he's on  it  every lap. \nHe  does his  own thing after races, but | don’t think \nthat affects him, he’s  just enjoying himself.’ \nValentino's character still  shines through when he's \ngetting messy at a  Sunday night victory party. At  Rio  2001, \nwhere he wrapped up  the  last-ever 500 title, he  was the \nstar  attraction at  a Honda celebration party. Sharing a  table \nwith mate Marco Melandri, Valentino refused to  hog the \nlimelight, instead turning it on  Honda's even-younger guns \n—  the  Spanish Telefonica Junior team of  teen heroes Toni \nElias, Daniel Pedrosa and Juan Olive. He  invited them to  his \ntable to give them a first  lesson in  heavy drinking, perching \nuncomfortably on  the  corner of  his  chair while Elias \nenjoyed the  comfy part of  the  seat. That's not  normal \nbehaviour for  a World Champion —  most racers are  takers, \nnot givers. They say  that nice guys don’t win World \nChampionships but  Vale does seem to  be  an  exception. \nHe’s  a  giver not  a taker, which is why he takes the  trouble \nto entertain his fans. Cynics may say  that’s all guile to  raise \nhis profile, and sure there's guile in there, but  most of all it’s \nyouthful joie de vivre; boys just wanna have fun... \n27"

When | told \nhim about my  own youthful regard for his  dad, \nValentino wanted to  know why | was  a fan. | said | \nliked the  way Graziano could lead a  GP  by  several \nseconds, then crash on  the last lap. ‘Yes, yes!’ he \nreplied, his  face brightening in  instant recognition. \n‘That’s my father!’. On  balance Valentino has done well \nout of  his  dad, inheriting some good genes and \nbenefiting from an  upbringing rich  in  paternal warmth, \nintelligence and riding tuition. \nValentino had his  first ride on  a  motorcycle when \nhe was two and a bit.  Neither father nor  son  remember \nWhat the  bike was, but  it  came with outrigger safety \nwheels which lasted just three days. Surprise, surprise, \nhe  seemed to  have a  natural gift  for  it.  ‘He  was pretty \ninstinctive from the  start,’ says Graziano, who worked \nas  a  primary school teacher before his  racing career \ntook off.  ‘| was surprised by how little | had  to  explain, \nbut  | now think that kids of that age  have more ability \nthan we  ever imagine.’ \nStefania wasn’t exactly thrilled to  see Valentino \ngetting into bikes but she  too  realised he was a  natural. \n‘| could see  that he  wasn’t dangerous, just from the \nway he was, the  way he  rode and | wasn’t too  protec- \ntive as  a  mother,’ she says. ‘| was a  lot  more worried \nwhen Graziano raced! He  made me  too nervous, so  | \ndidn't go to  many races.’ \nBut  Valentino did  go to  enough races to absorb the \nthrill of speed, colour and noise. Graziano remembers: \n‘After | retired | was friends with riders like (Loris) \nReggiani and (Luca) Cadalora, so  we'd go  to  grands \nprix to  watch them. Valentino's first memories are  of \nthe  paddock and  when he was at  home he played with \nmotorbikes instead of other toys, this  was just  natural, \nhe  was never pushed. Around the  age of four or  five \nhe was very curious and  was surrounded by some great \nriders, so  he’d always ask  2,000 questions to  everyone,"

People would disappear if they \nsaw him coming, he  was a  pain in  the ass  at  those \ntimes, but  in general he was a  bright and lovely kid.’ \nAnd pretty soon Valentino was trying to  emulate \nhis  heroes. ‘|  remember my  first big  crash. It was ‘84 \nand I'd  seen Randy Mamola hanging so  far  off  his \nHonda 500  that his  outside foot was off  the  footpeg. | \nwent home and tried to  do  the  same with my  BMX \nbike and had a  highside. Fack, | had  a  huge bruise and \nvery much pain in the  ass.’ \nSo  he was already getting a  kick out  of risk  taking. \nMost kids take risks somehow, it's  one way of  finding \nout  what they can  get  away with and how they relate \nto  the world. One child might slap the face of  a \nplaymate, another might climb a  tree, Rossi did  daft \nthings on  bikes. \nlf  mum wasn’t much worried about their boy \ngetting into motorcycles, Graziano was concerned. So \nhe  built him a  go-kart, and not  just any old  go-kart. \nThe chassis had been designed to  take a  60cc grass- \ncutter motor and a  ten-year-old driver, so  Graziano \nbolted in a  100cc national kart motor and  gave it to  his \nfive-year-old son. It  was, dad remembers, ‘an evil \nthing’, and so  fast that no  one could stay with \nValentino during their outings to  local gravel pits. Here \nthe  gravel-pit gang —  Rossi, Reggiani, Cadalora & Co.  — \nwould race around in  beat-up rally cars, just  for  kicks. \n‘We had old  Ford Escorts and Opel Asconas. We'd race \naround the  pits  and Vale was always faster in  his  kart. \nPm  OSS @) MAKING \nVOX Ee Nitin G \nThe ground was great for  learning, not  so  much grip so \nhe'd be sideways all the  time.’ \nBoth Rossis have a  passion for  rallying and the \ngravel-pit gang still  hang together today. ‘We still  go \nvery often,’ says dad. ‘Me, Aldo (Drudi, racing's \nfavourite graphic designer and the man behind both \nRossis’ helmet designs), Uccio (Vale’s childhood mate \nand  constant companion) and  others, it’s  a  nice  way for \nfriends to  get  together. Valentino is  the  only pro  there \nand it’s  a  big pleasure for  us  to  watch him  drive and do \nthings. He  grew up  amongst racers, so  it’s  always been \nwith him, but  there was no  future seen in any  of this, it \nwas just fun, though maybe a   bit dangerous.’ \nDangerous, for  sure, but  the kind of  distraction that \ncan  stop kids growing up to  be crackheads. \nMeanwhile Valentino was getting on  with primary \nschool in  Tavullia. Mum wanted him to  grow up  to  be \nan  engineer but while he  was bright, he  wasn’t the \nmost dedicated of  pupils. ‘He  didn’t used to  feel like \nstudying,’ she  remembers. ‘But he  had  a great memory, \nso  I'd  read his  school books to  him  while he  lay on  the \ncouch and he'd get what he  needed from that. He  was \na  good kid,  the  kind that would get  all  the  other kids \ntogether, his teachers always talked about that.’ \nIf bikes and cars were the  core of  his  childhood \nworld, Valentino also showed a  talent for  guitar and \nfootball, although mother's efforts to  take him to \nsoccer school failed to  distract him from his  need for \nspeed.

He  was nine at  the  time, a  year too  young \nfor  his junior kart licence but  that wasn't going to  stop \nthe  family from getting started.

It seemed like  all the  local \nkids had these Lilliputian racers which they'd thrash \naround the  mini racetracks that pockmark the  nearby \nseaside resorts of  Rimini, Riccione and Cattolica.

Any racer who thinks about pulling over when \nhe  sees someone crash obviously has a  bit  of  a \nproblem. To  most racers, though they wouldn't admit \nit,  a downed rider is just one less man to  beat. It’s  a \nhard sport, people die  and get  crippled in  motorcycle \nracing, and most riders have little room within \nthemselves for sympathy or  concern. It’s  a  denial thing, \nif they opened up  to  others’ suffering or  the  possibility \nof  their own, they'd probably end up  quitting. Sure, \nValentino isn’t your average racetrack psycho, he's a \nsweet and charming human being, but  some kind of \ntransformation obviously takes place within him  when \nhe’s on  the  racetrack. \n‘There's one difference between myself and guys \nlike Valentino, Doohan and Biaggi,’ says Graziano. \n‘And that’s the fact that |  never won a  World \nChampionship! Valentino has  this  thing, the  quality of \na World Champion. When he shuts his visor and  starts \na  race everybody becomes his  worst enemy, he  needs \nto fight these people and he needs to win. When | was \nracing | noticed that World Champions have this  ability \nto  shut off  from the  normal world. | didn’t have that \nand  that’s why | don’t have a World Championship.’ \nIn cold psychological speak, Valentino has  a Jekyll & \nHyde character. No  surprise there because there are \nplenty of  nice guys racing motorcycles who are  trans- \nmogrified the  moment they ride down the  pit  lane. \nUntil they return they are  possessed, prepared to  take \nthe kind of  risks, with their own lives and those of \nother people, which they'd never dream of  taking in \nnormal life  (except, of  course, when driving a  rent-a- \ncar). And yet  these contrasting on-track and off-track \ncharacteristics aren't difficult to  reconcile in Valentino's \npersonality. It really is very simple: going fast is a  gas \nand  winning is a laugh, and  while these actions require \ndoing some pretty scary things, there’s no  requirement \nto  bring the  maniac with you  when you climb off  the \nbike. It’s just that some racers get so  wound up in  it all \nthat they forget that. ‘If you  win it's very much better,’ \ngrins Valentino. ‘But | never say  to  myself: “Ah fack, \narriving in  front is all  that matters”, I'm  not  obsessed. \nBut, especially over the  last  two or  three years, | know \nthat | can  win  if | stay relaxed and  concentrated. Maybe \nother riders like  Biaggi are  more angry with the  other \nriders. I'm  not  angry with the  other riders.’ \nSo  whatever Graziano says, it's  obvious that he \nhas  taught his  kid  plenty. ‘For sure | sometimes did \nthe opposite of  what my  father told me,’ admits \nValentino. ‘That's normal between father and son. If | \nmake a  mistake it’s necessary that it's  my own \nmistake. But he  told me  a  lot  of  things and | often \nfollowed his  advice. Whenever someone gives me \nadvice | quickly decide whether it’s  bullshit or  not. If \nit’s  not, | follow it.’ \nAt the  end  of ‘91  father and  son  had  an  important \ndecision to  make. Rossi was still racing karts at  this \nstage, minimotos were just for  fun. He  had finished \nfifth in that year’s national kart championship at  Parma \nand  was ready to  graduate to the  Italian and European \n100cc series in  ‘92; the next step in  a  career that \nmight have taken him all the  way to  F1.  ‘My plan was \nstill  for  Valentino to  race four wheels because | was \nscared he’d get  hurt on  a  bike,’ says Graziano. ‘But \ntwo things changed this. First, he  really, really liked \nminimoto, he  used to  spend all  his  days riding. \nSecond, we  realised that karts were getting too  expen- \nsive for  us,  and we  knew that car  racing Is all  about \nmoney. If you don’t have the best kart or  car, you \ndon't have much chance.’ \nValentino takes up  the  story. ‘We'd arrived at  this \npoint where we'd need 100  million lira  for the  ‘92  kart \nseason, so  | said to  my  father, “Maybe it’s  better we \nrace with the  bike,” and  he say  “Ah, bo,  really?”. | say \n“Yes, So  is it possible we  race bikes?”. He say  “Yes,”.’ \nSo  throughout '92  Vale, concentrating exclusively \non  minimoto racing, continued to  learn the essentials \nof riding a motorcycle on  tarmac just as  fast  as  it'll  go. \n‘But | was still just playing, not  really thinking about the \nfuture. | wanted to  win just like  | wanted to  win in \nkarts, | think that's normal for  a  boy.’ And win he  did, \nall  the  way into ‘93, growing more serious about his \nracing by the  day and growing taller too. It  became \napparent that soon he'd need a real  motorbike. \n45"

Most of all  though, he  likes the  story \nbecause of what happened right afterwards. \n‘When he  got  back to  the  pits  we  were thinking: \n“Are we  doing the  right thing here or  are  we  making a \nbig mistake putting him  on  a proper bike?” It wasn't so \ngood.

We  didn't exchange words \nbut  what I'd  meant with that look was: “Yes, this  can \nstill  be your job  if you  want, don’t give up”.’ There he \ngoes again, teaching without actually saying anything. \n‘You could see  the  disappointment in  Valentino's \neyes, he  was almost crying. But these are  the most \nimportant moments in  a  racer’s career, when you find \nthe strength to  react and to  show whether you're \nstrong or you're weak.’ \nValentino did  indeed bounce back that weekend, \nfinishing ninth in  his  first-ever race on a full-size bike."

In racing there's only one  way \nof locating the  absolute limit and  that’s by tripping right \nover it.  Once you've crashed you've found it, the  next \ntrick is to  remember where it is, and a  lot of racers never \nquite manage that part of the  process. \nPossibly even more miraculous than his  ability to \nlock on  to  the limit, to  the  extent that he  can dance \nalong it all day, like  he’s  taking a walk in the  park, is his \nability to  stay cool when things go  bad. ‘Yes,’ he  says. \n‘This is very important, this is  the key.’ Again, many \nriders don't have this facility.

It’s just \ntoo  easy to fall  into  this  trap because racing is all about \nconfidence and focus, and big, scary crashes tend to \ndestroy both, unravelling even the  greatest of  talents. \nProbably it is only the  real  greats who can  recover from \nsuch situations, but who knows how.they manage that, \nvia  a Zen-like inner state or  sheer bloody mindedness? ‘I \ndon’t know how,’ offers Valentino. ‘Just that I’ve had \nsome difficult periods but  so  far  I’ve  arrived at  all  my \ntargets.’ His  Honda engineer Jerry Burgess begs to \ndiffer: ‘Determination is  the thing that unites the \nchampions, that and a real  fear  of getting beaten.’ \nSo  he was rightly delighted with his  ninth place at \n»  Maggione, although he remembers that crunching first \nday of  practice somewhat differently from his  father, \nand this isn’t the  only time their memories conflict. \n‘Yes, | crashed at the  first corner but  next time | made \nthree or four laps before | crash.’ In mitigation he adds: \n‘It was early morning, very cold, and new tyres.’ \nThe race was the first round of  that year’s 125 \nItalian Sport Production Championship, open to  hotted- \nup  125 streetbikes like Valentino's Cagiva Mito. This \nwasn't the  first man-sized bike he'd ridden though. The \nprevious summer he'd sneaked out  at  Misano, riding a \nmate's Aprilia SP  racer. ‘| was still  too  young to  go  on  a \nreal  racetrack, so  it had  to  be  secret. My friend signed \non,  then | wore his  leathers. This was my  first  time on  a \nproper bike and  a  proper racetrack, it was like  a dream.’ \nValentino didn’t set  the  world alight in  1993. He \nmade more mistakes, of course, but  by season's end he \nwas quick enough to  take pole position at  the  Misano \nfinale and finish the  race third behind Andrea Ballerini \nand Roberto Locatelli. Both these men moved into GPs \nbefore Rossi, Locatelli going on  to  capture the 2000 \n125  world title. \nThe  following year was very different. Rossi had  an \nofficial Mito, supplied by  Cagiva team manager \nClaudio Lusuardi, with which he  recorded his  first \nnational victory at  Monza. By the  Misano finale he only \nneeded a third-place finish to  claim the  title. ‘|  was \nthird into the  last  corner but  Stefano Cruciani arrive \nmuch too  fast  and  knock me  wide because he's  facking \ncrazy. | finish fourth, then they disqualify him, so  | am \nthe  champion.’ Cruciani, by the  way, never made it to \nGPs. During '94  Rossi also became acquainted with life \non  slicks, contesting the Italian 125 GP  series aboard a \nSandroni, an  Aprilia-engined special built by  Pesaro \nengineer Guido Mancini, the engine provided by Aprilia \nrace chief Carlo Pernat, an  old  mate of Graziano’s. \nSo  he  was getting pretty busy with his  racing, \nwhich didn't leave much time for  school. If he  wasn’t \nplaying truant to  go  riding, he  was struggling just to \nget out  of bed  in the  mornings, a habit that would stay \nwith him into his  first  year of  500s when he famously \nslept through morning practice at  the  Catalan GP.  His \nlove of the  lie-in compelled him  to  find a  new way of \ngetting to  school and he  hit  on  the  idea of  using the \nfamily’s Ape car,  a  rather comical three-wheeled pick- \nup  powered by  a  desperately overworked scooter \nmotor. Stefania remembers: ‘Getting the bus  to \nsecondary school meant he’d have to  get  up  earlier, so \nhe'd wake up  at  the  last  minute, grab the  Ape and  fly \n49"

Nothing serious, mind. ‘They \nwere always getting chased by the  cops, and  at one  time \nit was like open war between them, they really hated \neach other. They got  chased down a  dirt  road and the \npolice car  ended up  in  a  ditch.’ You can imagine the \nscene, straight out  of  a Keystone Cops movie: the cop car \nteetering on  its  side, steam rising from beneath the \nbonnet and the  sweating Carabinieri in  their bulging \ntunics and pompous hats, shaking fists and screaming \nobscenities. In  fact, this  is another case of  father's and \nson's memories diverging. Valentino doesn’t remember \nthe incident, but even if this  is Graziano’s memory playing \ntricks on  him again, it’s  too  good a  fantasy to  remain \nuntold. This is  what Valentino remembers: ‘We were \nracing along the  road from Pesaro to  Cattolica on  our \nscooters, like  we  always did,  and  suddenly we  arrived at \nthis  police road block. | tried to escape by diving down a \ndirt  road and  crashed. So  | kept quiet and  waited for the \npolice to  go  away but  they didn’t, so  eventually | came \nThere \nplenty to lee \ncourse. ‘ \nInv \n(Gold \nBAY 'S \nout  with my  hands up.  The  problem was that they were \nlooking for  people with drugs, so  they wanted to  know \nwhy |’d  been so  keen to  get away.’ \nHis  father goes on: ‘That kind of  thing is  prett \nnormal around here. The  good thing was that Valentino \ngroup of  friends were very close, this was just a  b \nadventure for  them. Getting chased by  the cops ar \ngetting tickets was a  downside, but  they looked after \neach other, made sure no  one got into real trouble.’ Vale \ndidn’t survive his scooter days totally unscathed, however. \nIn the  summer of ‘94  he grabbed a lift to the  beach with \na mate, a car  pulled out  in front of them, breaking his  left \nankle and  mangling a couple of toes. \nIf his  racetrack results didn’t yet  put  him head and \nshoulders above his  rivals, he’d done enough to  further \nprick the  interest of Aprilia, who were signing a certain \nMax Biaggi to  their 250 GP  team at  the  same time. \nPernat had liked Vale from their first meeting. ‘I  like \nhim,’ he  says from behind his  rarely removed black-out \nshades, ‘because he  remind me  of  Kevin Schwantz.’ \nAprilia provided a standard RS125R for the  1995 Italian \nand European championships and it was during those \nsix  months that Valentino came of age as  a  roadracer. \nHe  dominated the Italian series from the  outset and \nmade his first  forays abroad. \n‘| think ‘95  was the  best-ever European series because \nthe  races were run  at the  GPs.

They seemed to  come from another world, with \ncrazy helmet designs and  very different leathers. Both me \nand  Haruchika used Diadora boots that  year, that’s how we \ngot  introduced, and  every time we  went to  another track \nhe would take me  around for a  lap and  tell  me  important \nthings. That was fantastic.’ And this  was the  year that \nValentino's first alter-ego was  born. Rossi became Rossifumi, \nafter wild-riding Japanese 500  star  Norifumi Abe. \nAoki’s teachings may have been vital but  they took \na  while to  sink in.  Rossi spent much of his  time abroad \nlimping in and  out  of Dr Claudio Costa’s Clinica Mobile, \nthe travelling hospital that looks after GP racing's \nwalking wounded. ‘In  the Euros | was always racing \nLucio Cecchinello who had  an  HRC-kitted Honda which \nwas impossible to  beat. But  | wanted to  beat him, so  I'd \ngo,  go,  go,  and after, crash, crash, crash.’ Nevertheless \nhe  finished the  series third, enough to  guarantee him \nentry to the following year’s 125  World Championship. \nThis time Rossi did  a  deal with Giampiero Sacchi, \nracetrack kingmaker, collector of old  Gileras and a lyrical \nteller of racing tales. ‘At that time | was Biaggi’s manager \nand  the  idea came to  me  to  make a  team for  the  ‘96 \nWorld Championship,’ says Sacchi, who later guided \nManuel Poggiali to  the  2001 125  title. ‘| couldn't afford \na  big  rider, so  | came to  an  agreement with Valentino \nDAYS \nand his  father. It was a  good team with standard bikes \nbut very enthusiastic and even then Valentino was \nValentino. I'd  never seen a  rider who wanted to  do \nthings like fix all the stickers to  his bike. He’s  always been \nvery careful with the  details, that was the first shock!’ \nSacchi wasn’t the  only one in for  a shock. First time \nRossi shared a  racetrack with his  GP  heroes was during \npre-season tests at Jerez in southern Spain. ‘Fack, it was \nincredible, they were so  fast! It was like  another sport, \nmaybe four seconds a lap faster. | thought | would never \nbe  able to  ride like  that, | needed to  learn another way \nto  ride  the  bike.’ \nAnd learn he did.  The  ‘96  season started at Malaysia’s \nold  GP venue, Shah Alam, a tortuous track that winds its \nway through encroaching tropical jungle. Rossi finished a \ncreditable sixth in  his  GP  debut and  followed that with \nreasonable enough rides to  11th in Indonesia and  Japan. \nBack on  familiar ground at  Jerez for  the  start of  the \nContinental sector of the  championship he was bang on \nthe  pace —  on  the  front row  for the  first  time and  in the \nthick of a  typically crazed ten-man battle for the  lead. ‘I \nwas second out  of the  final corner but  | crossed the  line \nfourth, and  exactly the same happened at the next race at \nMugello. My bike was very slow, | had  many good races \nthat year, but also some big, crazy mistakes.’ \nIndeed, Rossi suffered more than 15 crashes during \n1996. He  was a  young man in  a  hurry, too much of a \nhurry after missing the  podium by a fraction in  Spain \nand Italy. Desperate for  his  first pop at  the  post-race \nchampagne, he  crashed out  of  the  next two races in"

At  Assen it was damp, | started 20th and after \nthree laps | was second, then crash. Crazy!’ \nThat accident brought matters to  a  head within \nSacchi's tightly budgeted little outfit. “You can  imagine \nthat all  these crashes weren't good for the team,’ \nSacchi recalls. ‘Many came from Vale just  not  thinking; \nthe  tyres: cold! Give gas: crash! So  we  take him into \nthe  motorhome and | say: “Vale, how is it possible you \ncrash so  much?”. But  now | understand there are  many \nriders who don’t crash and who never make it.  The \nlesson is this: if a  young rider is very fast, he’s  going to \ncrash. He  needs to  discover the limit, and without \ncrashing it's impossible to find the  limit.’ \nRossi remembers that little chat in the  motorhome \nlike  it was yesterday. ‘| remember Sacchi's words, he say \nto me: “If you  continue like this, the  maximum possible \nis  that you become like Kevin Schwantz [who had \nrecently been forced into retirement by aching injuries], \nbut  if you  want to  become like  Max Biaggi [then riding \nthe  crest of a wave in the  250 class], it’s  necessary you \nchange.” So  | say  to  myself: “Fack, | continue like \nSAY S \nthis!\".’ The Rossi/Biaggi agro may have been far  in the \nfuture, but Valentino already knew he  didn’t like the \n250 champ, Biaggi was too  proud, too  Roman for  his \nliking. You only need to  take a  look at  www.valenti- \nnorossi.com to  guess what he  thinks of  him: Biaggi’s \nname never even appears, just XXX XXXXX. \nDespite all  the tumbles, Valentino’s speed hadn't \ngone unnoticed. Aprilia were impressed enough to  give \nhim  some factory parts; a  better cylinder and a  carbon \nfront disc  brake, because he was shattering the  standard \nsteel discs. The  trick gear made all the  difference: third in \nAustria for  his  first podium, then his  first pole position \nand win  at Brno in the Czech Republic. Rossi had  arrived. \nAt  Brno he  beat veteran 125  champ Jorge Martinez \nby a  fraction after a  frenzied final few laps. Martinez, \nlike  many of the  older GP  racers, greatly disapproved of \nthe kamikaze tactics employed by these crazy \nminimoto-drilled kids. The  Spaniard had  started his  long \nand illustrious World Championship career way back in \n'82  when racing was less  frantic, if only because there \nweren't so  many good bikes around back then. He even \nremembers seeing Graziano’s toddler in  the  paddock, \nand ruefully remarked after his  defeat: ‘|  should've \ntaken my chance then and  run  him  over’. \nSacchi, of course, had seen it all  before. ‘It’s  like a \n57"

He \nDAYS \nwas now sure of  himself inside, he  had  the  conviction, \nsomething that normal riders don’t have.

Even \nwhen he  was beaten he  appeared unbeaten.

Maybe Vale wasn’t \nconscious of  what he  was doing, but  these days he \nseems more aware of  the psychological benefits of \ngrinning when he’s not  winning, denying Biaggi & Co. \nthe  pleasure of seeing him  well and  truly vanquished. \nNinety-seven was the year Rossi mania grabbed \neveryone, when he began the winning that allowed him \nto  indulge his  kink for  dressing up  and showing people \na  good time.

At  times the mane \nwas kept vaguely in  check by a  girl's Alice band, and \nfinally, after he’d secured the  title, it was chopped off, \nthe new and much tidier coiffure dyed blue with a \nblond number 1 at the  back. \nThe  fun  and games began after he  scored his  third \nvictory of the  year at  Mugello.

The doll had been in  its \nwrapping for  nine months: in case of victory, open box. \n‘Gibo and me  bought the  doll before Imola ‘96  but, \nfack, | didn't win  there, so  it stay in  box  until we  win  at \nMugello. But  the  Claudia idea wasn’t mine because this \ntalk about the  Biaggi thing with her  hadn’t happened \nwhen we  got  the  doll, it was my  fan  club’s idea to  write \nClaudia Schiffer on  the  back!’ The gag poked fun  at \nBiaggi’s rumoured liaison with Naomi Campbell. The \nrelationship between Italy’s favourite two racers, such as  it \nwas, had  deteriorated after Rossi had  a  go  at  Max on  an \nItalian TV chat show, Biaggi fronting up to him  in a Suzuka \nBAYS \nrestaurant, saying: ‘Stay quiet, | am  number one.’ Rossi’s \nnew profile had  brought his feelings for Max into the open \nand  the  Italian media were in like  Flynn. Asked by one  shit- \nstirring journalist if he considered himself the  Biaggi of the \n125s, he  cheekily replied: ‘No, Biaggi is the  Rossi of the \n250s!\" From now on  the  pair would be rival  suitors for the \naffections of the  Italian public, the opposing armies of fans \ncolour coded for  easy identification: Marlboro red  for \nBiaggi, yellow for Valentino, his favourite colour. \nNext time out  in Austria Ueda cancelled the  party, by \nfour thousandths of  a  second, but  normal service was \nresumed in  France (minstrel’s hat  on  the  podium) and \nHolland (a  carefully customised plastic Superman-style \nRossifumi cape). At  Imola, where he  achieved his  third \nstraight win, he  left  it to  his  fans to  indulge in  some \nstraightforward crowd anarchy —  the hillside opposite \nthe  pits  ablaze with yellow fan  club T-shirts and giant \ncut-out letters proclaiming ROSSIFUMI COSMICO. From \nhere on  in, it was // fenomeno Rossi all the way. \nMore wins followed in Germany (medieval torturer, \nswinging a  mace), Britain (Robin Hood, brandishing a \nkid's bow and arrow), and Rio  to  make it six  in a  row. \nLate in  August he  wrapped up  the  title at  Brno, three \nraces still  to  go.

Most of these evenings end  up the way they \nalways used to, with the  restaurant getting trashed.’ \nBrazzi was perfect for  Vale: a  dedicated technician \nbut a warm and  gentle human being, so  unlike the  cold- \nblooded, data-fixated brainboxes who populate some \nstretches of pit lane. And he  knew exactly what he was \ndealing with from the word go.  ‘The quality of Valentino \nwas evident from the  first time | worked with him at \nJerez at the  end of '97,’ recalls Brazzi. ‘That was the  first \ntime he rode the 250  and  he broke the  lap record!’ \nSo  right away Valentino had proven that he  was \nmore than just a  125 nutter, and not  just with his  riding \nskill  but  also with his  guile. He  was only 18  at  the  time \nand  yet he  knew the  eyes of the  racing world would be \nupon him  when he  rolled up  for  his  first ride. He  there- \nfore wanted to  make sure he  made a real  impression, a \npsychological impact, so  he  got  on  to  the  Dunlop guys \nand  asked them to bring some super-soft qualifying tyres. \nAt the end  of the tests he comfortably surpassed the 250 \nrecord. All of  a sudden he was  faster than Biaggi. \nFortuitously, Valentino entered the  250 arena when \nAprilia were at  the  height of their powers in the  class. \nThe  RSW had  long been the fastest 250  but that year it \nenjoyed a   greater-than-ever advantage, because \nHonda’s engineers had got  their sums badly wrong \nwith a  brand-new NSR250. The ‘98  NSR was a  dog, \nLeading Capirossi \nand Harada at \nRicard. Aprilia’s \nspeedy threesome \nspent most of 98 \nformation fighting, \nwell ahead of any \nrivals.

And not  only did  Aprilia \nenjoy superior speed, they'd also assembled their \nstrongest-ever team, Valentino lining up  alongside his \nchildhood hero Loris Capirossi and the  similarly experi- \nenced Tetsuya Harada. Harada had  won the  250 world \ntitle at  his  first attempt in  ‘93 and would almost \ncertainly have been further decorated if  he  hadn't \nsuffered some miserable luck. Capirossi had been the \nproto-Valentino, the first of  GP  racing's teen stars, \nwhen he  won the  1990 125 crown at  17.  The toothy, \nhard-riding Italian from Riolo Terme, an  hour's drive \nfrom Valentino's hometown, had retained the  title in \n‘91  and  graduated to 250s the following year. \nThus Vale seemed to  be  in  an  ideal situation: fast \nbikes and fast team-mates, so  no  pressure to  succeed \ntoo  soon. Not  so.  ‘All  the  other bikes were shit but  | \nhad two foxes for  team-mates, both with many years \nof  250 experience, and the  atmosphere in  Aprilia was \nterrible. All  the chief mechanics were fighting, you \nknow, it was an  Italian team: “Ah you have the  best \ncylinder”, this and that and so  on. For  me  it was diffi- \ncult to  ride like Loris and Harada because they have \nmore experience, but | didn’t want to  arrive third \nbehind them, because to  arrive third was to  arrive last.’ \nAnd yet there were reasons to  be  happy he’d made \nthe  move, rather than indulging himself by carrying the \n125 number-one plate. ‘Maybe the best thing about \n250s was that | could get  out  of bed  later! | had  to  get \nup at seven for  125  practice, and  that was a big problem"

Just as  it was Mick Doohan’s injury-wracked ‘89 \nGP season that tempered the  Aussie into  an  indomitable \nracetrack warrior, so  it  was ‘98 that helped make \nValentino the  man he  is today, although his  suffering \nwasn't so  much physical as  psychological. He was having \ntrouble distinguishing his  real mates from an  ever- \nburgeoning gang of  hangers-on and dealing with the \ndeaths of two of his best friends in a car  accident. \n‘It  was the most difficult year for  me, because \neveryone expected so  much and  |  really felt the \npressure. | was fast but | made mistakes because | \nwasn't relaxed. | had some personal problems with \nsome friends who weren't real friends. It  was like  a \nballoon, it got  bigger and bigger, then it had  to  burst. \nThere were too  many people around who only stayed \nwith me  because I’m  Valentino and  | didn’t understand \nthis very quickly because it  was something new. | \nneeded some time to  understand and then | realised \nwhy | wasn’t concentrating on  racing. My  level went \ndown all year, until we  hit the  bottom at  Brno.’ \nThe racing started at  Suzuka, where bike problems \nkept him out  of the  running. He  was quickly realising \nthat 250s were altogether tougher, requiring intricate \nset-up work. ‘Unlike 125s, everything must-be just \nperfect or  you have no  chance of  getting on  the \npodium, let alone winning. Also, | missed my friends in \n125s, though in  my  first qualifying session | saw that \nthere are  just as  many crazy guys in 250s!’ \nValentino would find out  just  how crazy when the \ncircus headed south for  the Malaysian GP,  staged for \none year only at  Johor, just across the  border from \nSingapore. Wearing a  new skinhead cut for the \nsubtropical heat, he  was right on  it, qualifying on  the \nfront row  for the  first  time and racing for the  lead with \nHarada and Honda's Tohru Ukawa. Just a  few corners \nto  go  and he  was ahead but  Harada stuffed it up  the \ninside at  the  final turn, robbing the  youngster of  the \ngrippy line  and forcing him on  to  the  dirtier tarmac. \nThe crash was a  big  one. ‘Maybe | should've let  him \npass but after leading | couldn't do  that. As  the \nJapanese say: “Necessary make win!”.’ The  race wasn’t \nthe  only thing he  lost  that weekend —  a  reckless bet \nwith Capirossi cost him a  further million lira. All  his \nteam-mate had  to  do was risk  his  life  by jumping off a \nhotel walkway into the  pool, a  12-metre drop with no \nrun  up. \nOn  to  Europe and another two crashes during \nSpanish GP  practice suggested that Valentino was \nretracing his  125 GP  learning curve —  fast, furious and \noften floored. But  Jerez also commenced a  strong run \nof results, his first 250 points for  a  hard-ridden second \nbehind Capirossi, and another vital lesson learned. ‘I'd \ngeared my  bike for the  fastest-possible lap;  that's what \n| used to  do  in  125s because you could run  the  same \nspeed all  race. But  that’s not  possible in 250s: the  tyres"

Once again he \ndid  lead, as  he’d done at  Johor, Mugello and Ricard, \nand once again he jumped off.

It’s  like  if you  win  every race of your career you're a \ngenius, but  if you  finish second you're a facking clown!’ \nDespite the  media casino, Valentino was having as \nmuch fun  as  ever between races; playing football and \nracing minimoto, motocross and radio-controlled cars \nwith Melandri, who'd just started his  first 125 GP \nseason. His  weakest point was motocross. ‘So  I'd  ring \nMarco, tell  him we  don’t need to  ride today, then do  a \nA SS: 1  @) \nSO nt TAE \nNIE e es Ger lat et Gass EIN \nfew hours riding in secret!’ \nThe nights were just  as  hectic. ‘The Saturday before \nJarama we  went to a crazy club in  Riccione —  a lot of people \nout  of their minds, really high, it’s incredible what the young \ndo  for  enjoyment!

This guy \nasked me  for a cigarette and | told him | don’t smoke, so  he \nasked me  again, then he  said: “You won't give me  a \ncigarette because you're Rossi,” he wanted a fight!’ \nThere were other reasons he needed bigger \nmuscles. ‘|  never did  any proper training when | was \nriding 125s because the  bikes are  like  bicycles. Then at \nthe  end  of '97  everyone said | need to  go to  the  gym to \nbe stronger for the  250, but  | don’t go  because | don’t \nlike. At  Jarama it’s  very bumpy, | wasn’t in  control of \nthe  bike, that's when | understood | need more power. \nSo  my  mentality changed, | started going to  the  gym \nand now it’s  one of my  passions, if | don’t go  for  some \ndays | get  frustrated. | think I’m  in  good shape now, \nwith very much more power than two years ago.’ \nThe weekend before the Dutch GP  the  season's \nhalfway point, Valentino and some of  his  real mates \nscootered six  miles down the  road to  play the  fan  at \nthe  Misano World Superbike round. ‘It was like  being a \nkid  again, we  just laid  in  the  grass by the  side of  the \ntrack, sunbathed and watched the  racing.’ And in  the \nevening he  joined Yamaha's larger-than-life Supers \nhero Noriyuki Haga for some serious drowning of \nsorrows. The Japanese had crashed out  of  both races \nthat day and  astonished Vale with his drinking ability."

Capirossi and Harada both stopped with \nbike problems. \nBrazzi was impressed: ‘It  took Valentino half a \nseason to  get  used to  the  250. The biggest problem \nthat most riders face when they move up  from 125s is \nthat 250s move around more, they're more nervous, \nboth on  the  power and  in their general handling behav- \niour. Initially, that nervousness gave him some \nproblems; he  didn’t like  it when the bike started sliding \naround, but he  soon understood that’s the way it  is, \nand after a  while he  realised that just because the  bike \nis sliding doesn’t mean he's going to  crash. Then he \nunderstood how to  use  the  sliding to  his  advantage, \njust as  he did  in 500s.’ \nHis  team-mates’ Assen DNFs brought Valentino to \nwithin 19  points of  series leader Harada, although he \nhardly dared believe he  was ready to  race for  the  title. \nJust as  well, because he  crashed again at  Donington, \ncaught out  by a full  tank of gas  and hard race tyres. It \nwas the  end of a  miserable weekend, Italy crashing out \nof the  football World Cup on  Friday night. \nIn Germany, two  weeks later, he was  a chastened third \nbehind winner Harada and  Jeremy McWilliams’s privateer \nHonda. ‘Maybe | could've made second on  the  last  lap, \nbut  after Donington | had very much fear of  crashing \n= ANTS Ye Cri ints: ke Sen \nagain.’ The weekend at  the  tortuous new Sachsenring \nwasn't entirely wasted, however. ‘Il  realised |  was. still \nhaving problems with slow corners on  the  250. They're \ndifficult because you  need to  go  slow mid-corner, then lift \nthe  bike really quickly and give gas  when you're on  the \nfatter part of the  rear  tyre, like  Doohan used to.’  He  was \nalready laying the foundations for his drive to  500s. \nBut  it only took a  few  weeks off to  forget that hard- \nlearned lesson. He  spent the  mid-season break largin’ it \nin Tunisia with Reggiani, Melandri & Co. and returned to \nBrno rested and ready to  race. This time he  lasted just \nfour corners before falling. ‘It  was possible | win but  | \nmade the mistake because the fight between me, \nCapirossi and  Harada was  too  much. Everyone say  again: \n‘Rossi was Okay with the  best 125  but  now he  has  same \n250 as  other guys, it’s another story’. After Brno | took all \nthe negative power and transformed it  into positive \npower. | don’t know how, | think | just understood better, \nso  | became a  lot  calmer. It was a  very bad time, but  | \narrived at the  next races harder and  more focused.’ \nJust  four races remained in which he might prove to \neveryone that he was more than just  a  fast fool;  two in \nEurope —  Imola and Catalunya —  and two outside — \nAustralia and  Argentina. Valentino won the lot,  pushing \nCapirossi into second on  each occasion.

Once again, Valentino and his  crew battled \nset-up problems. ‘We always struggled at.  slippery, \nbumpy circuits because the Aprilia has such a  stiff \nchassis’, but  he won anyway. By now there was a sense \nof the  relentless about the  racing; after a  messy start \nhe  casually brushed aside all  opposition to  head home \nNakano’s easier-handling YZR. If things kept going like \nthis  he’d clinch the  title  at  Rio  in a fortnight. \nThe Italian media could barely contain themselves, \ntheir hysteria tweaked more by rumours that he  was \ndefecting to  Honda than by his genius stroll to the title. \nHe  found the  fuss hilarious: ‘They make a  big  casino \nbecause | will  be racing against Biaggi for the  first  time. \nFor  sure Biaggi will  be  difficult to  beat, especially in my \nfirst year. He’s one of  the  best 500 riders, but  at  the \nend of  the day he’s only another rider.’ The papers \ncould see  exactly what was coming. \nAt  Rio he  came back from another sluggish \ngetaway to  hunt down Capirossi, Ukawa, and Jacque, \nthen saunter past to  take his  ninth win  and collect the \ncrown. Not only that, he  also became the  youngest \n250 world champ, taking the  record away from the \nlate  Mike Hailwood who'd been 21  when he won the \ntitle in  1961. Valentino had  flown 20  members of  his \nfan  club to  Brazil for  the  occasion and celebrated with \na  riotous party at  a  nearby yacht club, where he  was \ntossed fully dressed into  the  swimming pool. That same \nevening he  made another clandestine visit to  a  hotel \nroom, where he  met the  men from HRC once again. ‘| \nsay to the  Japanese: “Okay, we  are  ready” .’ \nAprilia still  had a  bigger pile  of cash on  the  table, \ntheir deal reputedly worth £2.3 million, although he \nrefuses to  talk numbers. ‘I always knew Honda would \nbe  less money but  at  that point in  my  career | never \nthink about money because it’s  necessary to  concen- \ntrate on   racing.’ Although the fine details were \nthrashed out  at  a  later date, Valentino was destined to \nbe  his  own one-man team, outside of  the Repsol \nHonda clique, which allowed him to  run his  own \nsponsors, his  own livery and his  own favourite colour. \n‘When | make this  kind of decision | try to  go  the  way \nthat gives me  the most freedom. So  with Nastro \nAzzurro and my  other sponsors | can make a  yellow \nbike. Yellow is my colour, like 46  is my  number.’ \nIt was back to business the following Sunday for the \nseason finale in  Argentina, where an  incorrect tyre \nchoice left  him third behind Jacque and Ukawa. Or \nmaybe his  mind had been on  other things: Aprilia had \ngenerously granted him an  early release from his \ncontract, so  HRC had  booked Jerez for  his first  500  test \njust four weeks hence.

His  signature is the  flurry of dirt \nkicked up  from trackside as  he carves an  extravagantly \nwide line in  search of  the  fastest launch out of  a \ncorner. It's a  perilous technique, especially on a \nviciously overpowered motorcycle like  an  NSR5OO. It’s \ntempting fate, then giving fate the  finger, and that’s \nexactly why he likes doing it. Plus, of course, going that \nextra centimetre is  a key element in his  ability to  magic \nthe  best out  of a  racetrack. \n‘| always like  to  go to the  edge, because it give me \na  power.

I’ve  always had a big passion for \nthe  line, for  me  the  line is  like a  poem. My  focus is \nalways for  my  lines to  be  within the  same centimetre \nevery time for  20  laps. This feels good, because you \ncan  do  one fast lap all  with your heart, with the  eyes \nshut, but it’s  not easy to  ride 20 laps like that. \nSometimes | crash because of my  passion for  the  line. \nUccio and Gibo say  ‘Fack, stay 50  centimetres inside’, \nbut  it's my passion.’ \nSito Pons Corner, Jerez, December 1999. Valentino \nis riding out  of the circuit's most important turn, a blind \n85mph right-hander that crosses the brow of a hill, \nthen plunges the rider down into the  track’s fastest \nstraight. He  is  looking stiffer than usual, a  little \nhesitant, nothing like he  had looked 30  days earlier in \nSouth America where he’d been master of  a  96hp \nmotorcycle. Now, here he was a few weeks later, a  190 \nhorse motorcycle very much his  master. He's exiting the \nLN M@Ttan \nomer \ncorner, the  revs building fast, then too  fast  as  the  rear \nslick loses traction and smears sideways, driving the \nmotorcycle off  the  tarmac and across the  kerb where \nhe fights a mother of a tankslapper. He  stays on  but  it’s \nhardly poetry in motion. \n‘Valentino looked a  little awkward on  the bike \ninitially, | mean it's  a  big  step,’ says crew chief Jerry \nBurgess who has  vivid memories of that first test  with \nAlex Criville’s title-winning NSR. ‘| wouldn't say  he  was \nawestruck, he  gave the  impression that he  was pretty \nmuch prepared for anything, but  he was  feeling his way \nthat first  time, he knew he had  some learning to  do.’ \nIf anyone was awestruck, it was Burgess and  his ex- \nDoohan crew: Bernard Ansiau, Alex Briggs, Dickie \nSmart and Gary Coleman. After years of  sweating in \nthe  pressure-cooker of Mick's pit box  they could hardly \nbelieve the aura of  calm in  which they found \nthemselves. Burgess: ‘The guys were like: “Jesus, isn’t \nhe  great?” and | was saying: “Yeah, |  know, it's \nfantastic”.

The \ngroup of riders who had been elevated to the  status of \ntitle fighters by  Doohan’s crunching exit from racing \nonly enjoyed the briefest moment of  glory before \nValentino had them done and dusted. His  13  500 GP \nvictories from the next two seasons exceed even \nDoohan’'s win rate; 40.6 per  cent to  39.4 per  cent. \nAfter Jerez, Burgess’s first job  was to  revise the \nNSR‘s riding position for  its  gangly new pilot, then get \ndown to  the  task of  adapting every facet of  machine \nperformance to  suit his  riding style. ‘From the start \nValentino was very open about any problems he  was \nhaving with the  500,’ he  says. ‘And when we  made \nmodifications he  was very open about whether they \nwere an  improvement or  not. We  quickly learned that \nhe’s very good at  working on  set-up. When he  comes \ninto  the  pits  he’s  like  a  computer. He  gives you a list of \nsix  or  eight things he  wants looking at, like a \ndownload. He's more analytical than the  rest  of them. | \nthink we  have a  lot  to  thank his  parents for  because \nthey gave us  a  kid  who can think logically and also \nAprilia, who gave him  the  training so  he  can  say  what \nthe problem is  and whether we're making the bike \nbetter or  worse. But  back at the start we  could see  that \nhe was looking forward more to the  racing.’ \nThere was much to  learn before the season started, \nalthough things were looking pretty rosy. After all, he’d \njust joined the  factory that had  won every 500 riders’ \nand manufacturers’ title since 1994, so  there was. no \ndoubt he'd got  his  hands on  the  best 500. No  doubt, \nat  least, until the  2000 season actually started, when it \nquickly became apparent that something had gone \nvery, very wrong with the  NSR. This was the  year that \nHonda lost  the  riders’ crown to  Suzuki's Kenny Roberts \nand  its manufacturers’ title to Yamaha. \nThe reasons for  the upheaval in  factory fortunes \nwere several. Suzuki and Yamaha were trying harder \nthan ever, and their riders, especially Roberts and \nMarlboro Yamaha's Max Biaggi, were coming nicely to \nthe  boil. Also, Doohan was no  longer around at  HRC, \nwhich put Criville top of  the pyramid. Without the \nAussie’s guiding light HRC were lost  in  the  darkness, \nthe  engineers making the mistake of  listening to  a \n84 \nrider, well, listening to  a  rider who didn’t really know \nwhat he wanted. \n‘It's  like  Honda did  with Wayne Gardner when he \nwon the  title in ‘87,’ explains Burgess, who had  guided \nthe  rodeo-riding Aussie to the  500  crown after working \nwith triple world champ Freddie Spencer. ‘They asked \nwhat Wayne wanted and he  asked for  more power. \nThat's what Alex asked for  too. More power is easy \nenough, so  long as  you  can  open the  throttle, but  the \nnew engine was very different in  terms of  power \ndelivery. Later on  an  HRC engineer told me  that Mick \nwouldn't have done half a  lap with the  2000 engine, \nso  | asked the  guy: “Why the  hell  would you make it \nthen?”, but  it was what Alex wanted. Alex didn’t have \nthe experience, he'd always just followed along in \nMick's slipstream, beating him  from time to  time when \nthings went his way.’ \nIncredibly Valentino clocked the dodgy power \ndelivery the very first time he rode the  new NSR  at Phillip \nIsland in  early 2000. It  took HRC’s more experienced \nmen longer to  realise they’d got  a  serious problem. ‘All \nthe power had been moved to  the top, so  there was \nnothing there when you  were fully leaned over in  the \nmiddle of the corner, so  you'd give it some more throttle \nand there’d be too  much power,’ Burgess explains. ‘He \nsaid it felt  too neutral in  the  middle of  the  corners.’ \nWhich is how Valentino crashed on  that first outing. \nNo  worries; by round one at  Welkom he  was well \nup to  speed, qualifying just a  tenth of a second off the \nfront row. He  also set the fastest lap of  the race, \nmoments before he crashed out, losing his  NSR right in \nthe  middle of  a  turn, like  it just rolled over and died. \nAussie terrier of  slide Garry McCoy won the race, \nCarlos Checa second on  a  Yamaha, and Loris Capirossi \nthird on  a  ‘99  NSR. Same deal at  round two; Valentino \nlow-level flying into  a  heap again, this  time Roberts the \nwinner ahead of  Checa and McCoy. The factory \nHondas were nowhere once more and  within HRC the \naccusations began to fly. \nBurgess could see  from the  computer readouts why \nValentino was crashing and why the  other NSR riders \nwere struggling, but  was unable to  do  much about it \nvia  HRC. ‘Valentino was the  new boy on  the  block, \nfourth in  the  pecking order behind the  Repsol guys:"

While the  media were \nalready wondering If he’d got  what it takes to  cut  it in \n500s, HRC had  some definitive evidence suggesting that \nhe surely would. His  data traces didn’t only highlight the \nNSR’s problems, they also  showed that Valentino already \nhad more refined throttle control, the  essential weapon \nin  a  500 rider's armoury, than other HRC riders like \nCriville, veteran of more than a  hundred 500  starts. \nHRC was also impressed with Valentino's fighting \nspirit. ‘He  was carving through the  pack at Welkom and \nSepang, trying to  do  what he  thought he  could do,’ \nrecalls Burgess. ‘So  they'd seen that he  had the  deter- \nmination to  get  the  bike to  the  front and this is what's \nvery much rewarded at  Honda. Anyone who just rides \naround doesn’t get a  lot of say,  but  there’s always hope \nfor  the  guy  who pushes hard, even if he  falls down, it’s \nlike: “We can  work with this  guy”.’ \nValentino didn't know that at  the  time and the  two \ncrashes had rattled his  cage. He  arrived at  Suzuka for \nround three physically and  psychologically bruised, and it \nshowed on  the  track: 13th on  the  grid, 11th in the  race, \nhis  worst result since his  earliest 125 GP  days. Perhaps \nthis really was a  class too  far.  ‘Valentino was very, very \nbadly spooked by the  two non-finishes and he was very \nspooked by  the 11th place.

The  comeback at  round four in  Spain \nwas as  emphatic as  those he’d managed in  125 and \n250: first front-row 500 start and first podium behind \nRoberts and Checa. New engines parts, or  rather old \n‘99  parts, had arrived for Jerez and Valentino was back \non  a  bike that he could work with. \n‘Once we  got to  Europe we  started to  kick  off,’ says \nBurgess who had quickly established an   excellent \nworking relationship with his  new charge. ‘You didn’t \nhave to  be  Einstein to  work out  what he  was capable \nof.  The  talent was obviously there for  anyone to  see, so \nlong as  he was kept happy and kept in the  right frame \nof mind.

So  the \nnumber one  priority is to  keep him  happy.’ \nRacing Is all  in the  mind, so  Burgess's job is to  ooze \nconfidence, to  instill his  rider with the belief that he \nreally can  go that extra two tenths faster. ‘In  this  game \nit's  80  per  cent in  the  rider's head and 20  per  cent in \nthe machine,’ he  says. ‘So  if your rider wants gold \nhandlebars, you give him gold handlebars.’ Or  you do \nif he  knows what he’s talking about and Burgess had \nalready sussed that Valentino knows exactly what he \nwas talking about. ‘There are  some riders who don’t \nknow what they want, they ask  for  stuff simply out  of \nthe  frustration of  not  obtaining decent lap  times; so \nPs ean, SMO Sree \nyou could move the geometry all  around and then \nnobody knows what's going on.  The  old  KISS principle \ndoesn't work too  badly on  a  motorcycle: keep it simple, \nstupid.’ Burgess is an  arch-pragmatist. While some rival \nengineers vainly attempt to  reinvent the  wheel to  give \ntheir rider an  advantage, he  stays firmly grounded in \nthe  realms of the  possible, his  fundamental attitude to \nhis job  summed up  by his  father's racing principle, the \nfive  Ps:  perfect preparation prevents poor performance. \nBut  Valentino's astounding gift  for  understanding \nand  analysing machine performance was  about to show \nBurgess that the realms of  the possible could be \nexpanded. At  Le  Mans, all  second-gear hairpins, he \nspirited himself through the  pack after a  so-so start, \nsetting a  new lap record as  he  caught leaders Roberts, \nCriville and  Yamaha's Norick Abe. This was his first  time \nproperly up  front and his  first real opportunity to \ncompare himself to  his rivals and their machines. \n‘Valentino really started to  talk about the  bike after Le \nMans. He  said that where Alex had  wheeispin, he  also \nhad wheelspin, but at  that same point Abe’s Yamaha \nwould still  be driving forward with traction. That’s when \nwe  started the ball rolling for  the NV4A, the derivative \nNSR which we  used for  the  last  few races of  2000, \nwhich developed into  the  NV4B he used in 2001.’ \nTwo weeks later was the  biggest day of his  life:  the \nItalian GP  at  Mugello and his  first premier-class race on \nhome tarmac.

Whoever was writing the  script was \ndoing a  great job: two Italian fighters set  for  a home- \ntown brawl, no, make that three, Capirossi was up \nthere too. One nation, three gladiators. \nQualifying was super close, the  trio  split by 0.132 \nseconds: Biaggi second, Rossi third, Capirossi fourth, \nAlex Barros on  pole. The race was even closer, the  trio \ntrading blows out front, no  doubt about it,  this was \ngoing to  end in  tears. One and a half laps to  go  and \nValentino hit  the  attack button, slid  into the  lead, then \nlost the front and fell at  the next turn. Doohan, \nrecently appointed HRC general manager to  keep an \neye  on  Honda's young chargers, had  seen it all coming: \n‘He  started riding the  bike like  a  250, running pretty \ndeep into corners, he  just got in  there too hot  and \nloaded up the front.’ \nBiaggi lasted another lap  before colliding with \nCapirossi and falling, leaving Capirex to  cruise across \nthe  line. Burgess had found the  entire weekend an \nenlightening experience. ‘| was unaware of  what the \nMax/Valentino thing was about, | pretty much thought \nit was a  media thing. | didn't know that Italy only \nbecame a  country in  1871, so  a  lot  of the  regions still \ndon't like  each other.’ Too  right, it’s  Italy's north-south \ndivide, the mezzogiorno, one of  the reasons the pair \nare  apparently irreconcilable. Biaggi is Roman, he’s  old- \nschool Italian, resides in  Monaco and has  tea  with the \nPope; Valentino is from the  Marches region, he’s new- \nskool Italian, hangs out  in  London and goes clubbing \nwith his mates. \nSo their first  clash had  ended nil-all; it wouldn't be \ntheir last. From now on  every time they were in  the \nsame room together, usually only when duty called for \npre- and post-race press conferences, the  air  crackled \nwith animosity. Words would not  be spoken, their eyes \nwould never meet, and  yet somehow they managed to \nkeep a lid on  it for another year. \nAt Catalunya Valentino rode his first  wet 500 race, \neasing home third like  he'd been doing it all  his  life, \nand remember this was the  man who hated riding \n‘under the  water’. Thirteen years earlier three-time 500 \nchamp Wayne Rainey had  ridden his  first  wet 500 GP, \nwatched by his  father. Sandy was awestruck, petrified \nby these meanest of machines, ‘these things that don’t \neven want you  on  their backs,’ as  he called them. True, \nrain tyres and digitally controlled power curves had \ncome a  long way since ‘88  and Catalunya’s designer \nturns aren't the  cold-steel lined sweepers of  Spa, but \nthis was another moment that history seemed to \nwhisper his  name. While all  around people were losing \ntheir heads —  the  race turned into something of a  crash \nfest  —  Valentino kept his,  gleefully juggling the  throttle, \ntwisting his  NSR sideways out  of the  turns. \nAt  Assen he  came in  sixth after threatening the \nleaders before the  rain  came down. Two weeks later at \nDonington, more rain, for this was the year that \nswollen grey clouds followed the circus everywhere. \nUsing wets on  a  drying track, Valentino jostled with \nchampionship leader Roberts and Jeremy McWilliams, \nsmokin’ his overheating rear  tyre as  he  launched out  of \nturns to  win by  a  fraction. His  first 500 victory had \nhardly come as  a surprise. \nHis  next ride, to  second at  the Sachsenring, was \neven more impressive. He  may have been learning the \nart  of  500 riding with astounding speed but he  still \nhadn't acquired the  ability to  launch a  190hp/130kg \nmotorcycle from the grid, a  delicate balancing act \nrequiring immaculate throttle/clutch interaction. Too \nmuch throttle, too much clutch and it's  loop-the-loop \ntime, too  little and you  get wasted on  the  dash to  turn \none. Valentino got  destroyed, 16th at  the  end of  the \nfirst lap, and this at a tortuous track where it’s  reckoned \nthere's little or  no  room for  overtaking. So  he  made \nsome, conjuring lines that others seemed incapable of \nusing, making fools of  500 racing’s great and good as \nhe  picked them off wherever he  pleased. With five  laps \nto  go  he  was ahead, then he  bungled the  final lap, \ncrossing the  line eight hundredths behind Barros. \n‘I'm very used to  coming from the  back because \nI've  never been a  very good starter, it was the  same in \n125 and 250. Like at  Barcelona 2001, | started from \npole but was almost last at  the first corner after | \ncollide with someone. Maybe other riders would have \nthought “Oh  fack, we're lost”, but  | did  the  same in \n250  there in ‘99  and  the  same at Sachsenring in 2000, \njust stay calm and go.

Many other riders say  that it's  very hard to  overtake \nat  the  Sachsenring, okay so  it is,  but  if you try,  maybe \nit’s  not  very hard.’ If only it was that easy for everyone. \nAfter Germany the  little matter of the  Suzuka Eight \nHours. This classic event, acted out in  Japan's high \nsummer of  withering 35° heat and 80  per cent \nhumidity, is the  most important event in  the  world to \nHonda because of  its  influence on the massive \ndomestic bike market. The roll  call  of winners includes \nillustrious names like Doohan, Rainey, Gardner and \nEddie Lawson, all  of them former 500 kings. But  most \nGP  riders loathe the  race, finding it an  awkward distrac- \ntion from the  real  job of winning the  World Champion- \nship. Not  only can  the  switch to  unfamiliar four-stroke \nmachinery affect their 500 riding, but the factories’ \nobsession with winning the  event demands their stars’ \npresence at  pre-event tests. Poor Valentino had  to  go to \nJapan not once but twice during the five weeks \npreceding the  race, delivering two doses of  strength- \nsapping jetlag. Then again, he  had asked for  it.  While \nDoohan had  spent years fighting to  get the  Eight Hours \nscrubbed from his  HRC contract, Valentino had volun- \nteered for  the  job. ‘I  always love Eight Hours from \nwhen | was young because | love the  Japanese colours \nand graphics. When | was at  Aprilia | push very hard \nwith Jan  Witteveen (Aprilia’s technical chief) to  race an \nRSV Mille there. Also | want to  try a  Superbike, | want \nto  ride  with Superbike riders, see  their level.’ \nSo  here was another question: okay, so  he  could \nride 125, 250 and 500 two-strokes but how would he \ncope with the  very different demands of a four-stroke? \nThis wasn't merely idle contemplation, there was a \ncrucial significance to  his  Eight Hour performance \nbecause GP  racing was awaiting a  landmark shift in \ntechnical regulations. From 2002 the premier class \nwould be going four-stroke. \nSurprise, surprise, Valentino had little trouble \nadapting to  the  factory SP-1 Superbike he’d share with \nrace partner Colin Edwards, who went on  to  win the \n2001 World Supers crown. He  found the  softer, heavier \nSP-1 easy to  ride and deceptively quick. ‘The bike is \nincredible, it feels slow but the lap  time is almost the \nsame as  with the  NSR. You can ride the  Superbike at \nNow he’s getting \nthe hang of it, \nleading Roberts, \nCheca, Barros \nand Biaggi at \nMugello. (Gold & \nGoose)"

With 500 you can \nride it  100 per cent maybe three or  four times a \nseason, and when you use  the  500 at  100 per  cent, it’s \nnot  like  different class, it’s  like  different sport.’ Is easy \nbut  not  that easy —  Vale and his  American team-mate \nled  the race, then they had a  crash each. Situation \nnormal: new bike, necessary find limit. \nAlready GP racing’ biggest star, he was \ndowngraded to  non-person for  the next GP  at  Brno. \nVale had left  his  passport at  home, so  he  smuggled \nhimself over the  Czech border, competing as  an  illegal \nalien. Not that anyone seemed to  notice, let  alone care. \nSecond there and  third in Portugal he now found himself \nhauling in  points leader Roberts. With three races to  go \nhe was 46  points behind the  son  of a  legend, a  long call \nbut  not  impossible. Was he about to change the  habit of \na  lifetime and  win  something at the first  attempt? \nIt  seemed unlikely, since he  was happy to  admit \nthat he  was still  struggling to  get  the  hang of  riding a \n500 and even more so  the  labyrinthine art  of  refining \nthe  bike's settings to  suit  his  style. ‘I still  have problems \nunderstanding the  500, | still  can't use  100 per  cent of \nthe  bike,’ he  said in  Portugal. What he  really wanted \nwas to  ride a  500 like his  childhood heroes, the ‘Old \nDogs’ as  he  called them, brave men like Schwantz, \nDoohan, Rainey and Gardner who raced with reckless \nthrottle hands, kicking out the bike’s ass end and \ngetting ‘kinda squirrelly’. ‘They were the true 500  riders \nand  my  dream is to  use  a  500  like  those guys.’ \nHe'd get  there very soon but  not  just yet.  His title \ncharge ended in  the gravel at  Valencia after he'd \nteetered on  the  brink once too  often, asking too much \nedge grip from the front tyre, still  riding the thing like  it \nwas a  250. He  effectively crashed twice in  the  race, \nexcept he  somehow managed to  save the  first. This \nwas Vale in  rare rostrum-or-hospital mode. Burgess: \n‘He  pretty much knew that if he  didn’t beat Roberts \nthere then the  title was gone. If he  had beaten him \nthere he  could've kept the  title open right to  the  last \nrace, that was  the  way he saw it.’ \nDown in  Rio  he  bounced back with his  first dry- \nweather 500 win, dismissing Barros, McCoy, Abe and \nBiaggi with a  new-found confidence —  he'd finally \nmanaged to  kick his  250 habits and start riding the \n930 \nNSR like  a  true 500 rider. ‘In  Rio  we  change my  style \nvery much because |  basically crash two times at \nValencia, the first, whooooa,’ he  says, doing a  very \npassable imitation of  his  big  sideways moment. ‘The \nsecond | crash, so  | speak with Jeremy (Vale is one of \nthe  few people who uses JB’s full  Christian name), we \nwatch the  race and understand | need to  change my \nstyle because | make very much crash with the  front \ntyre. Until this race | was quite fast but | ride like  250, \nSo  | always finish the  front tyre after half  the  race.’ \nSo Valentino adapted his cornering lines. He  reduced \nthe  arc  of  corner entry, lowering his  mid-corner speed \nand  focusing all his efforts into  a straight drive out  of the \nturn. That way he  could lay down as  much horsepower \nas  his  rear Michelin would allow and a little bit  more, \nusing the  wheelspin to  get  sideways, pointing his  NSR‘s \nfront end back towards the  inside of the  corner, tight- \nening his  line  and giving him more room to  get  on  the \ngas, which means more speed down the  next straight. \nIt's  like  using the  handbrake in  a  car,  except he  breaks \ntraction with the throttle, not  the  brake. \n‘The perfect line is stay wide, wide, wide and after \nyou  close the  line  and  go  in inside, slowing a little bit to \nthe  apex. With the  250 it’s possible to  do this  and  if you \nmake like  this  with the  500  you  are  very fast  but  when \nyou go  to  close the  line  after seven laps you lose the \nfront and you crash. So  necessary go  inside a little bit \nearly and a little bit  more, use  less  speed in the  corner \nand after pick up  the  bike and accelerate. So  | change \nvery much the  first  part of the  corner. Not  so  much the \nsecond part because when | ride  250 | already ride a little \nbit like  500, picking up the  bike  to accelerate, more than \nother 250  riders. In Rio  | use  less speed in the corner and \nStart to spin the  rear  tyre very much on  the exit. \n‘For  many years | train for  spinning with motocross \nbike because sliding and spinning is  also very much \nfun. But  spinning was impossible with the  250 because \nnot  enough power, so  when | arrive in 500  | want to try \nand | get  better and better. In winter | still  train on  the \ndirt, using a motocross front tyre and  trail-bike rear  tyre \nwith little grip, so  I’m  sideways all  the  time, this  gives \nme  a  big help for sliding the  500.’ \nLike Donington there were no  comedy post-race \ngags at  Rio, just a  loving hug for  his  NSR.

Valentino's career was appar- \nently evolving into an  implausible plot for  a  cheesy \nHollywood racetrack drama, Days of  Thunder style. \nAnyone could have won Honda's 500th Grand Prix \nvictory and it could have happened in any  class at  any \ntrack, but It didn't, it was Rossi, in  the premier 500 \nclass and  at Suzuka. \nThe  suggestion that greater forces might be at work \nin his  life would keep returning throughout the  next 12 \nmonths or  so,  not  that they’d been entirely absent in \nprevious years.

Once again he was proving himself to  be  recep- \ntive to  new ideas, all  he  wanted was speed, it didn’t \nmuch matter what the bike felt like. ‘After Mick \nstopped the  500 pace was always slow. | hated that, so \nit was time to  raise the  pace.’ \nAnd there were few that could run with him: \nCapirossi a  lone and firmly defeated rival at  Welkom, \nand no  one to  play with at  Jerez after he'd finished \ntoying with Abe. Valentino, like Doohan before him, \nwas going quicker and quicker, the pack scattered \nbehind him, and for  a  while it looked like 500 racing \nmight return to  those oh-so predictable Doohan days, \nwhen everyone awoke on   Sundays with just one \nquestion on  their minds: who'll get second? \nDoohan, a  hard man to  impress but  mellowing in \nretirement, was moved to  fulsome praise by  his \nprotégé’s lightning form. ‘He's riding the  bike like  it \nshould be  ridden and he  doesn’t feel there’s any \nreward in just running around with the  pack. Some of \nthe  other guys have been caught out a little and guys \nlike  Max need to  learn to  ride the  bike when it's  not \n100 per  cent.

Cheeky. \nThis was the  start of  Biaggi’s tilt  at  the  title. The \nRoman's technicians had made a crucial forward jump \nwith machine settings, and when Valentino crashed \nout of  the rain-lashed Italian GP. his  arch-rival took \nanother chunk out  of  his  points lead. In  the  space of \nthree races his  advantage over Biaggi had  shrunk from \n46  to  21  points and tension was building. At  Catalunya \nit exploded, the  pair going for each others’ throats in a \ncramped ante room after the  race, which Vale had  won \nin  masterful style, recovering from a  disastrous start to \npick off  his  rivals and leave them trailing, Capirossi \nsecond, Biaggi third. The  punch up  between these two \npumped up  racers had  been brewing for years, though \nit was more of an  unseemly brawl than a  man-to-man \nduel. There is  no  impartial record of  exactly what \nhappened because the  pair were out  of view when the \nfight kicked off,  on  their way to  the  post-race TV  inter- \nview room with their various hangers-on. \n‘What happened wasn’t very big  and it  wasn't \nimportant,’ insists Valentino. ‘It  was like being at \nschool: “He started it!” “No, he  started it!” “No, he \nStarted It!”. Biaggi said that | started this  facking shit \nbut it's  necessary to  think about what happened \nbefore. | started the race from last position and | \narrived first at  the  flag, | made the  fastest lap  and | \n| \nmade a  fantastic victory, so  why would | want to  make \nall that shit?’ \nAccording to  one witness, Biaggi did  manage to \nheadbutt Valentino's team manager Carlo Fiorani while \nhis  arms were behind his  back. Then he  managed to \nfight free, clocking his  nemesis in the  face. If you  were \nlooking for  a  points decision in  the absence of  a \nknockout you'd probably give the  fight to  Mighty Max \nwho won more cred in  the  post-race press conference \nwhen quizzed about his  grazed face. ‘A  mosquito bit \nme,’ he  replied. The incident uncovered a  streak of \ndignity within the older Italian, who was quick to \nremind everyone that he’d never stoked the  fires of the \nlong-running feud. ‘My only defence is to  say  nothing,’ \nhe  said, well aware of the  difficulties of  a  PR  offensive \nagainst everyone's favourite GP  racer. All  he did  say was \nthat Valentino only whacked him while Fiorani had his \narms behind his back: ‘That wasn’t nice, it was unfair.’ \nBiaggi insists he’s baffled by the  rivalry. ‘We only \nstarted racing together in  2000 but  it feels like  Rossi's \nbeen racing me  ever since he  was in  125s. It's  not \nnormal to  have a  go  at  another rider when you're not \neven in  the  same class. Rossi is clever, he  gets energy \nfrom all  this, but | think people get  tired of  it.’  Of \ncourse, people weren't getting tired of  it.  This was \nmore fun than anyone had had for  years: a  real, \ngenuine confrontation between two riders who hate \neach other's guts. Somehow it makes the  racing more \nreal, more urgent."

Through the right they ride into a  deep dip, \nsuspension fully compressed, before rising out  of  the \ndip  and heaving the bike left  as  the  suspension fully \nextends. A moment of  deathly silence follows, riders \napparently in  cruise mode, unable to  do  anything \nbecause the  bike is just floating across the  tarmac with \nno  grip, SO  any input would almost certainly cause a \nbig, big  crash. But  as  soon as  they descend from that \nfinal wave of camber the  suspension loads up  and  they \n104 \nflick into the  110mph Ramshoek left.

Biaggi had been ahead the  lap  before the  race \nwas stopped and was thus declared the winner, \nValentino second, Capirossi third. \nRobbed of  victory and now only 19  points ahead, \nValentino and crew headed across the  Channel for  the \nBritish GP  where things went from bad to  worse. That \nhuge tumble in qualifying left  him  a  dismal 11th on  the \ngrid, Max sitting pretty on  pole. In the  race he  bided his \ntime, waiting for  the  fuel load to  lighten before relent- \nlessly working his  way toward the  front. Race leader \nBiaggi must've got  the  shock of  his  life  when his  pit \nboard told him  who was behind him  and  within a  few \nlaps he  too  succumbed.

With \nBiaggi’s YZR500 in  the  ascendance, here at  least was \nsomething that might give him some cheer for  the \nfuture. Not so,  Vale declared the  test ‘a  disaster’ and \nreturned home to  psyche himself up  for  the  Czech GP. \nIn  all  kinds of ways this would be  a  crucial encounter. \nBrno commences the  second half of  the  season after \nGP  racing's summer recess and performances at  this \nepic, high-speed circuit are  invariably a  good forecast \nfor the  remainder of the  campaign. During the  summer \nholidays some riders mysteriously fall  out  of the  groove, \nwhile others find the  speed missing from their earlier \noutings. So  from a  purely psychological standpoint it \nwas vital for  both riders that they win  here. No  wonder \nValentino considers it the  most difficult race of his  life. \nEver the master of  the artfully fast one-off lap \nBiaggi claimed pole, just over a  tenth up  on  Valentino, \nthen led  the  race, his  rival quickly slotting in  behind. \nThat's how they stayed for  some while, Valentino \nwatching and  waiting, gathering the  information he'd \nrequire for  an  end-of-race attack. ‘Biaggi was going so \nquick and | was thinking, “Ah, maybe it’s  possible to \novertake him here on  the last lap”, or  “Here |'m  faster, \nthere I’m  slower”, and  when he crashed | thought “Oh \nfack, now it’s  necessary to  change my  plan”.’ Biaggi \nhad skated over the  edge of  the  precipice, losing the \nfront and sliding gracefully to  earth, then remounting \nin a panic to salvage a  handful of points for tenth. They \nhardly mattered. The gap was back to  29  points and \nthe scene had  been set  for the final six races. \n‘|  think Brno is  the masterpiece of  my  career \nbecause the  mental situation was  so  difficult before the \nrace, though after Biaggi crashed it wasn’t very much \nexciting.’ He  followed that with another untroubled \nwin  at Estoril where Biaggi covered himself in dust once \nmore, clambering back on  board to  grimly keep himself \non  the  scoring board. At  Valencia Biaggi got  his  own \nback, beating Valentino by almost three seconds, but \nthey were only racing for tenth place, the  event turned \ninto  a tyre lottery by a pre-race downpour. \nLeaving Europe behind for  the  final four ‘flyaway’ \nraces the  gap had  swollen to  47  points but  Biaggi was \nnot  for  giving in.  He  led  Valentino at  Motegi, only to \nstumble over the limit once more. Biaggi's pride had \nbeen pricked by the  run  of  calamities and turned his \nwrath not  against Valentino but  against Yamaha. The \nYZR chassis, he  announced, had a  ‘structural problem’ \nwhich didn’t allow him  to  ride  as  fast  as  he wanted. He \nhad already complained that Rossi always got lucky, \nalways got  the  best bikes, conveniently forgetting that \nhe  too  had been favoured with NSR500 power in  ‘98. \nBut  that year he  had been in  a  satellite Honda team \nand had  complained once too  often that his  equipment \ndidn’t match up  to  Doohan’'s factory tackle. After that \nHRC weren’t keen to  promote him  to  official team \nduties, so  he switched factories. \nValentino, of course, saw it all  differently. There had \nbeen no  crisis at  Yamaha, rather Vale and his  crew had \nbeen shaken into getting their act  together following \ntheir disastrous Sachsenring weekend. ‘After Germany | \ntold him  we  wouldn't tolerate the  second or  third rows \nanymore,’ reveals Burgess. ‘I  told him he  was making \ngreat entertainment for the  fans but  if he wanted to win \nthe  championship he'd have to  put some pressure on  his \nrival  and  it’s hard to do that from the third row. After that \nwe  were only off  the  front row once all  year. We  also \nchanged a lot during the  next few races: shocks, suspen- \nsion links, geometry, engine bits, everything, which \nallowed us to make big improvements in handling.’ That's \nwhy Biaggi could no  longer hack the  pace. \n‘The better parts from HRC helped but  it was the \nteam that made the  difference because they changed \ntheir way of working to  suit me,’ adds Valentino. ‘| use \nmore corner speed than Doohan and you need more \naccurate settings to  ride with my  style. So  all  the \nsuspension settings changed and the  bike started to \nturn better. The Honda 500 had always had a  turning \nproblem, it would always run wide, but it was better \nafter Germany.’ \nThree races to  go  and the  title would be  his  if he \ncould make the  top  eight at  Phillip Island. Oooh, too \ntough. Indeed it was, of all the  races in which he might \nhave been granted an  easy ride, this wasn’t it.  Phillip \nIsland's fast, swooping curves always encourage elbow- \nto-elbow racing, but  the  2001 Australian GP  was an \n107"

During the \nearly laps Barros and Nori Haga scared the living \ndaylights out  of everyone as  they duked it out  for  the \nlead, Valentino deciding the only safe place was out \nfront after he'd kissed tyres with Barros at  190mph. He \ndidn't stay there long, barging back and forth with \nBiaggi, Capirossi, Jacque, Nakano and Ukawa. On  the \nfinal lap  it  was Max out front by’a smidgen but \nValentino timed his  move to  perfection, diving ahead \nwith three corners to  go. Less than two seconds \nseparated the  first nine riders past the  flag, so  tactical \nriding had  never been an  option and  anyway, riding for \npoints isn't his  style. Roberts and Criville had won their \ncrowns by doing no  more than was absolutely neces- \nsary and he  wasn’t about to  emulate them. Burgess, \nlike  everyone, was mightily impressed: ‘I’ve always said \nthat if you win races the  championships take care of \nthemselves. It's always been that way with the  guys I've \nworked with —  Mick, Gardner and Spencer, they all \nknew how to fight.’ \nBack home in  Tavullia it was almost 6am and the \nexultant locals were painting the  town yellow.

So \nwhat's so  special about these guys? What unites them? \nRiding talent, for  a  start, towering mountains and \nraging rivers of the  stuff, plus total, unfaltering dedica- \ntion.

And dads that raced bikes: Spencer Senior raced \njust about anything —  dirt bikes, drag bikes, sprint cars, \neven powerboats —  while Hailwood’s old man and \nSurtees’ dad raced sidecars before the  Second World \nWar. In  other words, it  all  comes down to  nature \nand nurture. \nAfter watching the  race in  his  pyjamas at  home, \nGraziano may well have been pondering this very \nsubject as  he  popped down the  local barbiere to  have \nhis  pony tail  cut  off  in celebration. The cherished pony \nhad been growing ever since he’d emerged shaven- \nheaded from his  career-ending coma in  September \n1982 and here at last was a good enough reason to get \nrid  of the  thing. ‘It  wasn’t for  a  bet, just a  display of \nappreciation and affection,’ explains Graziano. ‘I told \nhim I'd  cut  it off  if he  won all  three titles.

Not so,  he  made the rest look second- \nrate with a  runaway win, having big  fun  spinning his \nhot and greasy Michelins well ahead of  Capirossi. \nIncredibly, this was the  moment that Valentino reckons \nhe finally mastered the  500: ‘In  Malaysia | finally arrive \nto  go  very fast with the  500.’ And this 38th win took \nhim  into  the all-time top  nine GP winners’ list. \nJust one race to  go  before the  end of the  500 era \nand surely there was only one man who should win it. \nBut  conditions could scarcely have been trickier at  Rio, \nthe rain coming and going, Valentino crossing the \nfinish line second, a  fraction down on  Checa, but still \nwinning.

So  could he  beat the  biggest, baddest of  the \nOld  Dogs? ‘I've seen some of Mick’s data readouts and, \nfack, he was very fast. It was him that made the  differ- \nence, not the  bike. If | was to  race Mick, | think | could \nfight with him, but | don’t know who would win. \nNobody knows!’ Burgess also sits  on  the  fence on  this \none: ‘| wouldn't like  to  say  Valentino's got  more talent \nthan Mick, I've  seen Mick do some pretty special things \non  a  motorcycle.’ \nAnd what if Valentino rode a Yamaha, could he still \nbeat Max? ‘Biaggi gave 120 per  cent to  beat me  in \n2001, so  the  fight was facking hard. In  the  past he \nnever rode the  500  like that. For  me,  | think | could beat \nhim with Yamaha because we're not talking about \nBlagg! winning six  races and me  seven, or  me  scoring \njust ten  points more than him. Of  course, | think my \nbike is very good, but  | also think that | was the  fastest \nrider of 2001, usually. | won 11  races, Biaggi won three \nand he  only won Assen because the  race was stopped \nearly. And when he  won at  Le  Mans and Sachsenring \nhis  team-mate Checa was second, so  for  sure those \ntracks were not  so  bad for  the  Yamaha; at  Sachsenring \nthere were five  Yamahas in the  first  six!’ \nNot that the  relative differences between the  YZR \nand NSR mattered any  more, because 500s were about \nto  be  consigned to  history, although Valentino wasn’t \nhappy about that because he  didn’t reckon the RCV \nwas going to  be  as  fun to  ride. In  fact he  kept \nsuggesting he  might stick with the NSR in  2002, \nalthough he was only kidding himself. Honda had  been \na  prime mover in the  shift to  four-strokes, so  there was \nno  way they were going to  let  their number one rider \ncontinue racing a  ‘stinkwheel’. \nRCV testing began alongside new team-mate \nUkawa at  Jerez in  November, a  whole army of  HRC \nengineers descending on  the  Andalucian track, praying \nthat the  work they'd done since July would be to  their \nchampions liking. It wasn’t. ‘The bike still  wasn't very \ngood but  we  made a  good test at  Jerez. I'm  good at \nunderstanding what | want from the  bike and HRC are \nvery good at giving me  what | want. After Jérez every- \nthing changed: the cowling, the seat, the engine \ncharacter, all  the  electronic parts, it was a  new bike by \n110 \nthe  start of the  2002 season.’ \nIn  other words, maybe the RCV wouldn't have \nbecome the  weapon it did  without Valentino’s unique \ninput. Your average rider works on  machine set-up one \nadjustment at  a  time, so  if the  bike turns better, keeps \nits line  better or  is more stable, he'll know what caused \nthat improvement, so  his crew can  make further adjust- \nments in that direction and perhaps make the  bike even \nbetter. If his crew were to change several things at once \n—  say  one click on  the  front rebound damping, two \nclicks on  the  rear  compression and  a  different construc- \ntion front tyre —  the  rider couldn't be  sure which of \nthese changes affected performance, so  his  crew can’t \ngo  on  from there. Valentino is different. ‘He  has  some \nkind of amazing link  system which allows him  to think \n“Il like  this” and “I don’t like  this”,’ explains Fiorani. ‘So \nhe  can test many different things at  the  same time \nwithout getting confused.’ This is just another part of \nhis  talent for  riding a  motorcycle ridiculously fast  —  it’s \nnot  just riding ability, it’s  his  pit-lane brain that helps \nhim improve the  bike, so  he  can  employ even more of \nhis talent on  the  track. \nDuring the  Jerez tests Valentino did  at  least break \nhis  own 500 record, although recently crowned 250 \nchamp Daijiro Kato was also there, getting into the \nswing of  things with his  NSR500s, and he  went even \nfaster. This was  the  first  hint  that the two-strokes might \nnot  roll  over and die  the  moment the  four-strokes hit \nthe  track. Ever since Checa had ridden Yamaha’s YZR- \nM1  four-stroke to  a  blindingly fast  simulated race time \nduring private tests at  Brno in  August, the  500s had \nlooked dead and gone. But here was evidence to \nsuggest that reports of  their demise had been greatly \nexaggerated. Around tighter and slower tracks the \nfour-strokes seemed unable to  fully exploit their 200- \nplus horsepower engines while the  two-strokes could \ncapitalise on  their lighter weight. \nFour wheels were next, and he  put  on  an  impres- \nsive  display in Michelin's Race of Champions rally event \non  Gran Canaria where he made it to the  quarter finals, \nonly losing out to  World Rally star Alistair McRae. \nPeople were already suggesting he’d quit bikes in  a \nyear or  two to  go  full-time rallying. ‘If  | win with the \nfour-stroke maybe it will  be  necessary to  change sport,"

When you \nbrake and flick, it’s  all  front tyre, which is kinda risky. \nThe advantage rear-wheel steering gave me  was huge. \nAnd it’s just the  same now —  watch Rossi, he’s  getting a \nbit  sideways now. It’s  great when you've a  lot  of  grip \nbecause you  can  use  more throttle than the  other guys, \nand  then when the  grip starts to fade, you know where \nthe  traction is. \n‘To  me  the  throttle was everything. But  when you're \ndoing this  you're talking very small changes in  throttle \nopening because you're at  the limit of  everything — \nthrottle position, chassis flex, tyre  flex, you're feeling all \nthat stuff.

He’s watched so  many races on  video \nthat he  probably knows them better than the  statistics \nguys.

Most riders \nwill  go  faster with slightly less  grip and more feedback. \nOnly the  very best riders can go  fastest with a  huge \namount of  grip and minimal feedback, because their \nskill  allows them to cope with less  of a transition phase.’ \nSuperbike star Chris Walker's fated attempt to \nconquer the  500 class in  2001 was spent in  awe of \nmen like  Valentino. ‘When | followed good 500 guys \ninto corners, | could sometimes run  up  on  them a little, \neven the  best riders out  there. But  by the  time | came \nout of  the turn, they were halfway down the next \nstraight! The good 500 guys seem to  turn the  corner \nmore, then pick up  the  bike and get  on  the  gas  really \nhard. With Superbikes you spend a  lot  more time on \nyour side, so  on  the  500 I'd find | was always leant over \nfurther than anyone else. With a  four-stroke you can \nactually get  on  the  power while the  bike is on  its side. \nA  Superbike weighs more, so  there's more weight on \nthe tyres when it's  leaned over, so  there's obviously \nmore grip, and the power is  less aggressive, much \nsmoother, so  you can  drive out  of the  corner. The 500 \nis very different —  they're so  aggressive when the  power \ncomes on  tap, that you go  from good grip to  zero grip \nvirtually instantly.’ \nThat's the  real  difference between a  hard man and \na  hero, between a  good GP  rider and a  legend: super- \nintricate throttle control that allows the  rider to  unleash \nmaximum horsepower impossibly early out of  every \ncorner. Valentino has dedicated most of  his  life  to \nhoning that skill  and now reaps the  rewards."

The RCV does indeed look seriously \nunaerodynamic but is it?  In  some ways, yes, in  some \nways, no.  The kind of  swoopy bodywork required to \nslice through the  air  in a  straight line  actually compro- \nmises performance in  other areas, causing instability \nduring braking and  cornering, especially in  high-speed \nturns. The  tight, angular fairing therefore improves lap \ntimes and it doesn't matter if the  RCV’s straight-line \nspeed is compromised because Honda have never had \na  problem squeezing more horsepower out of  their \nengines than anyone else. \nThe RCV is a  distillation of everything that Honda \nhas  learned from racing in  almost half a  century of \ncompetition, and yet  the  bike's V5  configuration was \nanything but an  obvious choice for  the new four- \nstroke championship. But  Honda has  always believed \nthat taking the more difficult road can earn them \ngreater knowledge, although this insistence on  being \ndifferent has  sometimes cost Honda dear. Back in the \nlate Seventies they tried to  take on  the  all-dominant \ntwo-stroke 500s with the  NR  and  never scored a single \nworld championship point despite blowing billions of \nyen. Then, in the  mid-Eighties their first NSR500 ran  its \nfuel tank under the  engine, with the  aim  of  lowering \nthe  centre of gravity, but  the  bike was a disaster. \n‘We aim  to  prove that Honda technology is better \nthan the  easy way, like  inline four,’ says Honda Racing \nCorporation director Yasuo Ikenoya. ‘People ask  us  why \nwe  chose the  difficult way but  the  answer is simple: \nracing is  meant to  be  a  challenge, and racing is  in \nHonda's DNA. Of course, we  considered other configu- \nrations. A V4 would be good —  short and  narrow —  but \na V4  is not  interesting to  us!’ \nBurgess reckons Honda are  ahead because they \ndidn't compromise when they designed the  RCV. ‘I really \nthink that it's  better to start with a clean sheet of paper, \nthen you  don’t have to make any compromises,’ he says. \nWEAPONS \n‘Honda started from nowhere when they began work, \nthen they did  enough research to  see  what's the  best \ntool to  work within the  regulations. Yamaha and Suzuki \nboth shoehorned their four-stroke motors into modified \n500  chassis, and that's a compromise.’ \nThe straight-talking Aussie, who's never been afraid \nto tell  his Japanese bosses what he  thinks when they do \nget  things wrong, also believes that HRC were correct in \nchoosing a  five-cylinder engine. MotoGP regs have a \nsliding scale of  minimum weight limits: the  more cylin- \nders, the higher the  minimum. weight, but fours and \nfives share the  same 145kg limit. ‘If  you can run  the \nsame weight as  a  four, you might as  well have a  five,’ \nhe adds. ‘So  the five was definitely the  right way to go.’ \nHonda also considered building a  V6  but  the  new \nfour-stroke regs place a  further 10kg weight handicap \non  bikes using six  or  more cylinders. Honda have \nheavily emphasised the  concept of  total balance with \nthe  RCV. ‘Total balance’ is racing's current buzz phrase \nand isn't difficult to  grasp. Outright horsepower isn’t \nthe way to  win races nowadays, especially in  four- \nstroke GPs, because all  the bikes have more than \nenough horsepower. What counts is how that power is \nmade to  work with the  rest of  the  bike —  the  chassis \nand, most crucially, the  tyres. \n‘The RCV combines all  our racing experience to \nproduce optimum power with good machine control,’ \nIkenoya goes on.  ‘There are  three elements to our  total \nbalance concept: concentration of  mass, minimal \nfrontal area and optimum traction. All  the  riders that \nhave ridden the  bike have been impressed by its power \nand  compactness.’ \nCompactness is a  driving force with the  RCV, hence \nthe  narrowish vee  angle of  75.5°. The more compact \nyou  make the  motor, the  more room you  have to put the \nengine where you  want it, focusing the centre of mass. \nHRC have further followed that concept by \nmounting the fuel tank as  low as  possible. That's \nobviously what Honda were trying to do when they built \nthe  ‘upside-down’ NSR500 in  1984, but  they went too \nfar that time. Instead of gaining from a  low c of g, they \nsuffered for  it, because their engineers didn’t realise that \npitch is crucial for  adjusting traction between the  front \nand  rear  tyres as  the  rider goes in and  out  of a corner. \n131"

He  found the  500  difficult to  turn in  because \nthere's no  engine braking. A  500 doesn’t slow down \nwith stability from the  rear  the  way a  four-stroke does. \nGetting a  500 stopped and turned is difficult because \nthe  bike just wants to go straight on,  and  if you  get the \nfront to  stop, the  rear wants to  come around. With a \n500, there's this transition period when the  rider has \nfinished braking but he’s not opened the throttle, so \nthe  bike's loose, it's  not  taut like  a  four-stroke, it’s just \nrunning free, a  bit  out  of control. That's why guys like \nHaga and  Chris Walker struggled on  500s.’ \nBut four-strokes aren't all  good. According to \nminimum weight regulations the  V5  must weigh 15kg \nmore than a  500, and that’s a  huge difference in \nracetrack terms. ‘And the  weight is  also in  different \nplaces compared to  the 500,’ adds Burgess. ‘So  the \nRCV doesn’t turn as  fast  as  the  500  and  Valentino can’t \nflick it left  and right so  quick, plus it’s  fuel injected, so \nit's  a whole new game.’ \nOf  course, too much engine braking can be  a \nbad thing, but HRC have got that well and truly \nsussed with their four-stroke racers. They developed \nthe  so-called back-torque limiter for  the  high-revving \nNR500, to  minimise rear-wheel hop into corners, \nand have perfected the design in  recent years. \npe em te (i \nBurgess again: ‘The RCV's slipper clutch is  just \nanother setting part for  us,  we  can dial it  out for \nsome tracks, sO  we've no  engine braking, and dial it \nin for  others.’ \nThe RCV's five-cylinder configuration helps here \ntoo. Some of Honda's four-stroke GP  rivals have strug- \ngled with excessive engine braking unsettling their \nmachines as  they hurtle into corners, seriously affecting \nlap  times. ‘The five is  definitely a  help on  engine \nbraking,’ adds Burgess. ‘Way back | had an  old  Honda \nCB750 four road bike and | could kick start it with my \nhand, you couldn't do  that with a  Norton twin. It \nfollows that you're going to  have less  compression at \nany  one time if you've got  five  strokes per  two engine \nrevolutions rather than four, and that's got  to  help any \nengine-braking problems.’ \nIf the RCV gives Valentino an  easier ride on  the \nracetrack, it also gives Burgess and his  crew an  easier \ntime in  the  pits. No  longer do  they have to  fully strip \nand rebuild engines, as  they did  with the  NSR because \nRCV engines are  prepared away from the racetrack. \nAlso, the  bike's fuel injection system means no  more \nfiddling around with carburettor jets, and the four- \nstroke’s wider rpm range means less mucking about \nwith gearbox ratios.

The bike had \nalways been known for  drifting wide through corners, \nand that’s one reason for  Doohan’s famous hunched- \nover-the-front riding style; he was desperately trying to \nget more weight up front. \nValentino, Burgess and HRC also worked at \n136 \nMaking sense of \nquiggly lines, \nWe and Jerry \n2Ss examine \nNSR data. (Henk \nKeulemans) \nimproving the  NSR's already very linear power delivery. \nLike Doohan before him, Valentino prioritised a  user- \nfriendly mid-range over peak horsepower because 500 \nriding is all  about meting out  the  power, and you  can't \ndo that if the  power curve isn’t right. That's why his 2001 \nNSR was equipped with uber-trick magnesium Keihins, \nof which there were only two sets  in existence. No other \nHonda rider was deemed worthy of  them. Of  course, \neven with that kind of help, 500 racing was always like \nriding the  razor’s edge for Valentino, and  that’s why he \nso  loved his  NSR. The  new breed of GP  four-strokes may \nbe quicker but they don’t give that same skating-on-the- \nedge-of-disaster feeling that racers crave. When a rider \ngets it right on  a 500, he's  climbed Mount Everest. \nChris Walker, who had a torrid crash-happy time with \nan  NSR  during 2001, puts it like this: ‘If you  go through a \ncorner on  a 500  and  don’t get it quite right and  you  think \nabout it, you've missed the  next turn! There’s so  much \nthinking, the trouble is that everything happens so  fast. If \nyou  make a mistake, you're generally wearing it, whereas \non  a  Superbike they give you some warning. On  a  500, \nyou miss a  gear going into a  corner and that's it, you've \ncrashed. Do that on  a Superbike and  you'll probably be all \nright, you  bang down the  gears and  find one, run  wide \nand  maybe touch the  grass, but  you  get  away with it.  If \nyou watch a  500 GP  there's not  many mistakes made \nbecause a mistake generally means a crash.’"

The first \nAprilia grand prix bike was built in  1985, a  kind of \nbackyard special using a  Rotax 250 motor, and yet  by \nthe time Valentino won the 1999 250 crown the \nfactory had won ten  world titles and over 100 GPs in \nthe  250 and 125  categories. \nLike Soichiro Honda almost half a  century before \nhim, Aprilia founder Ivan Beggio is well into his  racing, \nand it was Aprilia’s track successes that quickly estab- \nlished the  brand as  a  serious player in  the  Italian and \nthen the world markets. Neither is there any  doubt that \nthe  company’s relationship with the  two highest-profile \nItalian racers of  recent years —  Valentino and before \nhim Max Biaggi —  helped burn the marque into the \npublic consciousness. \nIn  turn, both Valentino and Biaggi have been \nlucky to  have had Aprilia around. It  is  Italy's motor- \ncycle industry that has  helped foster so  many Italian \nstars, and without Aprilia, their climb to  the  top of \nthe sport would almost certainly have been much \nmore difficult. Good machinery is vital in  motorsport, \nwithout it even the  best riders can fail  to  make the \nmost of  their talent, so  it’s  not inconceivable that \nValentino and Biaggi would never have made it \nwithout Aprilia around. \nValentino was also lucky that the  Aprilia RSW250 \nwas the  most competitive 250 when he  graduated to \nthe  class in  1998. In  fact, ‘98  was the  factory's best- \never year in GP  racing, the  RSW winning all  but  one  of \nthe season's 15  races. It  hadn't always been so,  for \nalthough Aprilia’s 250s had always been fast, they'd \nalso been fragile and  fickle. \nWEAPONS \nAprilia RSW250 1989 \nEngine specifications coe \nType liquid-cooled, 90°  V-twin two-stroke, disc \nvalve induction, with adjustable ignition, \nexhaust control \n54 x  54.5mm \n249.6cc \nBore & stroke \nDisplacement \nFuel system two 42mm DellOrto carbs \nClaimed output over 96hp at  12,500rpm \nGearbox six-speed, cassette type \nChassis specifications \nFrame type dual beam aluminium \nTyres Dunlop \nWheels 17in front and rear \nfour-pot Brembo, twin 255/273mm carbon \ndiscs (dry), twin cast-iron discs (wet) \nRear-breake two-pot Brembo, single 190mm disc \nFront suspension 42mm upside down Ohlins, multi-adjustable \nRear suspension carbon swingarm with Ohlins shock, \nmulti-adjustable \n1,270mm \n1,970mm \nFront brake \nWheelbase \nLength \nRace weight 96kg \n137"

It was another \ntwo years before race wins were turned into champi- \nonship wins, Biaggi dominating the  1994, ‘95  and '96 \ncampaigns before defecting to  Honda. \nThe  Aprilia’s winning speed has  always been attrib- \nuted to  one major factor —  its  intake system. While all \nthe Japanese 250s —  Honda's NSR, Yamaha's YZR and \nSuzuki's RGV —  use  reed-valve induction, the  RSW uses \ndisc-valve induction. Disc valves offer the  opportunity \nfor  higher peak power output but  with a  trade-off in \nlower-rpm usability, while reeds do the  opposite, deliv- \nering heaps of user-friendly mid-range but  rather stran- \ngling the  engine at  peak revs. \nIn its earlier days the  Aprilia probably suffered more \nthan it gained from its  uniqueness, for  while the  bike \nwas a  rocketship in  a  straight line, with a  maniacally \nfast pick-up, it was slow out of  the  corners because \nriders struggled to  cope with the vicious power \n138 \nrossi@) Rossi's WE ATP @UNes \ndelivery. But as   electronics developed during the \nNineties, that awkwardness was tamed, thanks to \nmuch-improved ignition systems and exhaust power- \nvalves. GP  racing's switch to  unleaded fuel in  ‘98  also \ncalmed things down. \nNevertheless, the RSW’'s powerband was still \ncrazily narrow —   with the real business tucked \nbetween 12,000 and 13,000rpm —   so  Valentino \ndidn’t find the RSW the easiest of  machines to \nmaster in  ‘98. While he  was immediately fast on  the \nbike, it chucked him off  at  every opportunity in their \nfirst season together. He  crashed out  of  no  less  than \nfour races in  ‘98. \n‘I'm still riding my 250 like it’s  a  125,’ said \nValentino midway through his  debut 250 season. ‘| am \ntrying to  learn something from my  team-mates Harada \nand Capirossi but  it doesn’t work to  change your own \nstyle too  much, everyone has  their own way of riding a \nmotorcycle. |  ride very different from Harada and \nCapirossi.

His  sublime talent to ride a \nmotorcycle faster than anyone on  the  planet is \nconfirmed by a glittering array of prizes —  already _ \nthree world titles and  over 40 Grand Prix wins —  but \nhis genius goes far beyond that. \nIn an  age of identikit motorsports stars, Rossi’s \ngrinning face stands out. He’s a racer who knows \nhow to have a laugh and who wants the  people to \nlaugh with him, which is why he’s bike racing’s \nbiggest-ever star. This all-colour book examines the \nRossi phenomenon and charts his  amazing life, \nfrom his earliest days falling off minibikes to his \nrelentless assault on  biking’s dizziest peaks. \nAuthor Mat  Oxley wrote this  biography in close \nco-operation with Rossi and his family. A former \nracer and Isle  of Man TT winner, Oxley has  been \nwriting about bike racing for 20 years and wrote \nHaynes's acclaimed book on  Mick Doohan. \nUPC \nCODE \nISBN \n1859608914 \n£14.99 \nRAP \n01499 \nCover illustrations \n6 \n99414'00217!!!'7 \nFront, \nmain: \nJamie \nMcDonald/Allsport, \ninset: \nGold \nand \nGoose \n9 \n'781859\"608913 \nBack, left:  Rossi archive, right, top and bottom: Gold and Goose"
