He has won a pile of \nworld titles and wooed millions of fans with his magical ability to wring the \nmaximum out of an  engine and a pair of wheels. \nHe’s the petrolhead who became a pop star, hopelessly addicted to \nspeed and irresistible to fans of all shapes and sizes: bikers and non-bikers, \nguys and girls, young and old. He earns his living from a violent and risky \nbusiness, laying his life on  the  line, week in, week out, usually looking like \nhe’s really just having a bit of a laugh. \nMotorsport in the 21st century is very much a science, a slave to the \noverbearing laws of physics, a digital duel of zeroes and ones. And yet \nValentino races with an  old-school cavalier swagger, his extraordinary \nnatural ability allowing him to do things with a 210mph motorcycle that \nwould take any normal human being deep into the disaster zone. Watching \nhim at the  height of his powers is special —  he’s totally at one with his \nmotorcycle, melding muscle and metal into a seamless whole, a unique \nunion of man and machine. \nWe’re lucky to be witnessing a remarkable moment in bike racing history. \nAs Carlo Pernat -  the man who gave Vale his big break —  puts it like this: \n‘A rider like Valentino is born every 20 years. For me  he’s similar to guys like \nPele, McEnroe, Muhammad Ali or  Maradona, people who tower over their \nsports.’ Pernat isn’t wrong, Valentino’s shadow casts right across \nmotorcycle racing, so that he’s almost bigger than the sport itself. \nOff the  bike he’s equally outstanding, with a lust for life that burns so \nbrightly and a rock ‘n’ roll attitude that distinguishes him from so  many of \ntoday’s ass-kissing sports stars. Valentino is one of those rare people \nwho every day extracts the  maximum out  of life, but  he always gives as \ngood as  he gets... \nMat Oxley \nLondon \nJuly 2011 \n\nMILAGRO \n\n4 \nBEING \nVALENTINO \nIt's  not  just about \nbeing fast... \nValentino Rossi is a fan of the  late  Steve McQueen. There \nare  obvious parallels between the  lives of the World \nChampion bike racer and the  uber-cool Hollywood actor. ; \nValentino likes to live fast and loose, just like  McQueen \ndid. He’s addicted to speed, just like  McQueen was. He \nparties hard, just like  McQueen did. His career is driven by \nan  appetite for fun  and revenge, just like  McQueen’s was. \nAnd he has that same conviction of greatness, that same \nunflinching self-confidence of someone who knows he’s \nreally good, just like  McQueen had. \nMcQueen was an  accomplished dirt  bike racer, good \nenough to race for the  USA's world enduro team. Quite \nsimply, he lived for speed, just like Valentino does. ‘All the \nracers | know race because it’s something that’s inside of \nthem,’ McQueen said. ‘They’re not  courting death. They’re \ncourting being alive.’ McQueen had a term for guys he \n\nDi \n\n<4it's a tough life, this GP racing. \nValentino on  holiday in Tunisia in ’98.  The \nbig grin belies a troubled soul —  he was \nmidway through his first 250 season, \ncrashing too much and  getting eaten \nalive by the Italian media. \nMIE \n®  really respected -—  ‘he’s full of juice,’ he’d say -  and he \nwould certainly have appreciated the fact that Valentino is \nso full of juice he bubbles over, with enough of the stuff to \ntouch the lives of millions. He radiates a lust for life that \nmost human beings can’t help falling for, just like \nMcQueen did  back in the ’60s and ’70s. \nOf course, there are  contrasts between these two gods \nof speed and cool. McQueen spent most of his life acting \nor playing the fool and the  rest of his time racing \nmotorcycles. Rossi spends most of his life racing bikes \nand the  rest of the time acting up or  playing the fool. But \nhad they been able to spend time together they would’ve \nperfectly understood each other. They would’ve spent \ntheir days thrashing around on  dirt  bikes, getting into \ndeep discussions about tyre compounds and suspension \nsettings, and their nights getting drunk and talking \nnonsense. Because that’s what being Valentino is all \nabout: race hard, play hard. \nHe’s certainly no  longer the impish boy racer who had \na smile for everyone, even his most belligerent 125 and \n250 rivals. These days he’s a grown man in a tough \nworld, and perhaps the  McQueen fetish is all about \ngrowing up.  Look at Valentino now, he’s no  longer the j \nplayful kid with the trance cadet hairdo. And on  the \ntrack he’s no  longer a boy wonder, he’s a \nheavyweight fighter. His vicious on-track clashes \nwith arch-rivals Sete Gibernau (Jerez 2005), \nCasey Stoner (Laguna 2008) and Jorge Lorenzo \n(Motegi 2010) prove that. \nBut people who balk at this more macho Valentino \nshould remember that he competes in one of the \ncruellest, most vicious sports —  a world of corporate \noverkill in the  paddock and sudden death on  the \nracetrack. It’s not the  kind of world you pass through \nwithout making enemies, and if you can use your \nenemies for motivation, then why not? \nLike McQueen, Valentino is one of those people who \nalways gets the  maximum out of life.  And like Vale, \nMcQueen was good at making enemies. McQueen was \nalso well-known for taking risky roles at the  height of his \ncommercial powers, just like Valentino. Vale loves laying \nit on  the  line, taking risks, because he’s courting being \nalive. Someone once said of McQueen: ‘He didn’t die \nwondering.’ Neither will  Valentino... \n<The king indeed. Italian \nRolling Stone dressed \nValentino like  Elvis and \nput him  on  its cover in \nDecember 2008. Editor \nMichele Lupi is a mate of \nVale's and  spends much \ntime trying to educate the \nyoungster in the ways of \nthe rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle. \n\nSteve McQueen, \nLeMans \n1971 \n\na rage elena dy \n* \n\nValentino hasn’t had a steady girlfriend for a while. And he hardly ever brings \ngirls to races. They appear occasionally but never for very long -  he seems to be \nenjoying the young, free, single lifestyle. ‘When you make this life is very difficult \nto have a girl,’ he says. ‘If you bring her to  a GP maybe she’s bored, so  | stay \nalone at races, is better. Then when you stay one week at a racetrack, you come \nback home and you have some power to use, you need to have fun, go out with \nfriends, go to the disco, but your girlfriend has just stayed one  week doing all \nthis, so  when | come home, she say  ‘can we  see  a movie?’. So is difficult.’ \nA The Valenteenyooppers go \nnuts at Mugello 98.  He was only \njust beginning to get used to all \nthe fuss. \nNot that that has stopped him from enjoying the attentions of the gentler sex. \n‘We really enjoy having so  many girls around!’ says Vale’s best mate Uccio. \n‘Maybe some top riders or superstars worry “is this girl coming to see  me \nbecause I’m famous or does she really like  me?”, but Valentino doesn’t think like \nthat, he always says “I don’t care why she’s coming to see  me, I’m just happy \nthat she’s coming”.’ \nFormer Aprilia GP boss Carlo Pernat has always been amazed at Vale’s ways \nwith the  ladies. ‘I’ve never seen so  many girls around a rider, maybe Sheene or \nPerera \n> You wouldn't find  many macho bike \nracers happy to hang out with a tranny, \nVale sharing a laugh with notorious \nltalian DU Platinette at Imola 1999. \n\nLucchinelli \n(hard-partying \npremier-class \nstars \nof \nthe  \n’70s \nand \n’80s) \nbut \nnever \nso \nmany,’ \nhe \nsays. \n‘Valentino \ndoesn’t \nlike \nto \nstay \nwith \na \ngirl \nmore \nthan \ntwo \nor \nthree \nmonths. \nHe \nlived \nlike \na \nkid \nthen \nand \nhe \nlives \nlike \na \nkid \nnow, \nwith \nthe \nsame \nfriends, \nthe \nsame \nway \nof \nlife. \nAfter \nthe \nracing \nis \nfinished \nit’s \nimpossible \nto \nfind \nhim, \nno-one \nknows \nwhere \nhe \ngoes, \nmaybe \nhe’s \nin \nLondon, \nmaybe \nhe’s \nin \na \ndisco \nwith \nsome \nfriends \nhe’s \nknown \nsince \nhe \nwas \na \nboy. \nHe \nnever \nchanges, \nhe \ndoesn’t \nwant \nto \nbe \nfamous, \nhe \ndoesn’t \nwant \na \nmovie-star \ngirlfriend, \nhe \ndoesn’t \nwant \nto \nbe \nin \nthe  \npapers \nwith \nfamous \npeople.’ \nv \nA VWVho's that girl?

This is where \nhe goes to escape the stresses of his \nhigh-speed life. \n> Vale never takes himself too seriously, \nwhich is why his personal logo is a \nsuper-slow tortoise. He has a sticker of \nthe tortoise on  the yokes of his M1  and  a \ntattoo on  his belly, \n\n<4 This is what Valentino would've \nended up doing if he hadn't become a \nracer —  goofing around the streets of \nTavullia like any other petrolnead \nscooter kid. \nitll \nBei \nrE \nA He's a real  doctor, you know. \nReceiving a doctorate in \ncommunications and publicity from \nthe ancient university of Urbino, the \ncity of his birth, in May 2005. \n\n\n\n\n\nQUALITY wy, \nK \nA You  could never say 21st century Valentino \nisn't cool.

Nah. \n> A good yawn introduces extra oxygen to \nthe system, which is why some racers yawn \nlike crazy while waiting on  the grid, even \nthough they're most definitely not bored. But \nthis is Valentino being bored... \n<4in the spring of 2008, with the US/UK \ninvasion of Iraq ready to roll, most MotoGP \nriders kept quiet about the coming camage, \nperhaps wary they might upset a corporate \nsponsor or two.

Nothing to do with \nlongevity; it’s how a person lives their life. This chap is very \nindependent. Childhood may not have been an  easy time. \nIt’s not a criticism of parenting; his very strong, independent \nspirit made him someone who wasn’t easy to parent. It \nseems his life has gone in blocks, with some difficulties. \n‘He’s unsure —  not from his lack of commitment but other \npeople’s. With that sorted | see him zooming into the future \nin a controlled way; this chap has control over his life. \nSomething of a temper I’d suggest, but he’s probably only \nlost  it once or twice because he likes to be in control. \n‘| know he’s a racer but  | have to say I’m surprised. It’s \nalmost as  if he got into what he’s doing by default. I’d \nassumed that, because of the strong determination in his \nhands, he’d be very clear about what he’s doing. In fact \nthere seems to be a sort of vagueness. He probably found \nthat he was very gifted and thought “I'll have a go”. One day \nhe’ll wake up and say “I’ve had enough of this”, and do \nsomething completely different. It’ll certainly be creative. \nHe’s a very intelligent chap who could choose any career. \n‘Whatever he does needs movement, people, changes. \nRepetition is like death to him. A very emotional man too; his \nheart line shows more than his share of emotional events, \nsome of which he’s vowed never to repeat. He’s built a \nstrong defensive mechanism around him. \n‘He has a very sympathetic nature, but he likes to get on \nwith it. Money-wise there’s strong financial security.

He may have a lot of acquaintances but very few real \nfriends. If he makes a friend, that’s it, you’ve got him for life.’ \nPORTRAIT OF A  SPEED GOD \nThese are the hands of the master —  the parts of Valentino’s body that interact \nbetween his amazing racing brain and his motorcycle. They’re not the gnarled \nhands of some veteran GP campaigners and they’re not the hands of a builder, all \nsausage fingers and podgy palms. If anything, they’re the hands of an  artist, which \nfits Rossi’s highly graceful style of riding. \nMost \ninteresting \nof \nall, \nVale \nis \nleft-handed. \nLeft-handed \npeople \nare  \nsaid \nto \nuse \ntheir \nbrains \ndifferently \nfrom \nthe \nmajority; \nfor \nexample, \nthey’re \nsupposed \nto \nbenefit \nfrom \ngreater \nintegration \nof \nboth \nbrain \nhemispheres \nin \nprocessing \ninformation. \nThey’re \nalso \nsupposed \nto \nbe \nmore \ncreative, \nwhich \nmight \nexplain \nRossi’s \nability \nto \n\n~~   conjure up unusual racing lines that few rivals seem able to attempt. He’s in good \n—  company here -  football legend Pelé is left-handed, and so were F1  racer Ayrton \nSenna, Jimi Hendrix, Napoleon and Michelangelo. \nSo far (touch wood) Valentino has been pretty lucky injury-wise, so  his hands \naren’t as wrecked as some. He’s one  of those riders with an apparent ability to \nbounce, tumble and roll without incurring major physical damage, with the \nobvious exception of a broken femur at Mugello 2010. Some riders have this \nknack and no-one is really sure why -  is it an  innate talent to crash well, or do \nthese riders have stronger bones and  more flexible joints? \nBut his hands have suffered somewhat in his two decades of minimoto and \nGrand Prix racing. The little finger on  his left hand is a bit of  a mess. He broke the \ndigit when he crashed out of a 125  European championship race at Assen in 1995 \nand the lower two bones have since fused together, leaving a nasty, crooked \npinkie. ‘I crash very much in ’95 and ’96, maybe 20 times.’ \nAnd Valentino’s hands do suffer from the day-to-day rigours of high-speed \nmotorcycle racing. The tops of his palms are  hard and calloused, like the soles of \na barefoot walker’s feet, from gripping the handlebars like his life depends on  it \n(which it does, of course) \n\n\n\nHAIR \nROSSI \nValentino’s history of cool \nand not-so-cool coilffures \nValentino is a master of the  makeover, a one-man boom for \nthe  hairdressing industry. His tonsorial adventures have \nveered this way and that, from red to green, from blue to \norange, from black and white to red, white and green. But \nwhat do they tell  us  about the  man? Does each hairdo \nsuggest the ever-changing moods of a mercurial spirit? \nNah, they all tell  us  the  same thing —  that the  man likes a \nlaugh and that he doesn’t want to be taken too  seriously. \nPhotos: \n\n\n\n29 \nVICTORY \nVALENTINO \nVictory always means one \nthing for Vale —  party time \nThe Mad Hatter and  the crazy little  125  rider get the \nparty started at Bro ’97.  Vale has just won his first \nwonld title and  what better way to celebrate than by \nstrapping a giant numero uno  to his back. Note \nUccio with shades on  head. \n\nValentino’s wacky victory celebrations won \nhim tens of thousands of fans long before \nhis riding genius became fully apparent to \nthe world. Right from the start in ’97, Vale, \nUccio and their mates put serious effort into \ntheir post-race pranks. \nUccio: ‘I was one of ten  people who \nwould meet on  Tuesdays before races to \norganise the gag. Then | would arrive at the \ntrack on  Wednesdays to find a nice place to \ndo the gag. We  bought the  plastic sheeting \nfor the  ‘Superfumi’ cape and made it \nourselves for Assen ’97. At Mugello that \nyear Valentino rode his victory lap with a \nblow-up doll. We had that idea at Mugello, \nsO  we  rang someone from the fan  club to \nbuy a blow-up doll from a sex shop!’ \nVale: ‘The gags are  just a game, just \nsome fun with the  people in my fan  club. \nThe ideas usually came to us  in a bar in \nTavullia at two in the  morning.’ \nGraziano: ‘Valentino’s victory gags aren’t \nso  much for the fans, they’re more for his \nfriends and the fan  club, they’re important \nto improve his relationship with the  people \nwho are  behind him, the  people who love \nhim. The gags show that he’s very different \nfrom other riders. My favourite was Jerez in \n99, when he stopped on  the victory lap and \nwent into a marshal’s toilet.’ \n¥ Valentino had the Jerez crowd in \nhysterics... and  disappeared into this \nPortaloo. He repeated the gag  a decade \nlater when he won the 2009 Jerez \nMotoGP race. \nMALAGA \nFuel & Oils \n> ‘Sorry mate, it may be a little too  late for  a urine \nsample.’ Goggle-eyed on  champagne, Vale gives \nthe Aussie GP official the bad  news.

Well, not  exactly... \n<4 Look into those eyes, look \nright into those eyes. Riding \nshotgun with dad Graziano at a \nPesaro town festival in the \nsummer of 1985, Valentino \nalready knows exactly where \nhe's going... The bike is the \nMorbidelli 500 that papa Rossi \nrode in the  1981 500 World \nChampionship. \nIt’s the summer of ’85, Madonna’s ‘Like A Virgin’ is \npumping out across the town squares of Italy, annoying \nthe  Roman Catholic church, and motorcycle GP racing is \nan  all-American affair, with ‘Fast’ Freddie Spencer and \n‘Steady’ Eddie Lawson duking it out for the 500 World \nChampionship, biking’s biggest prize. Down in the \nAdriatic seaside town of Pesaro they’re putting on a bit of \na fiesta —  riding racing motorcycles and cars around the \ncentre of town, just for the sheer hell  of it, because that’s \nwhat they do in  Italy. \nGraziano Rossi has already been retired from bike \nracing for three years, following a massive crash at Imola, \nbut is asked to take his old  Morbidelli 500 GP bike out for \na spin. Rossi lives only a few miles inland in Tavullia, and \nthe  Morbidelli factory is just down the  road, so this \nmeans something to the  locals. Only one little problem, \nRossi’s six-year-old son  wants to come along for the  ride. \nOf course, Graziano is an  accommodating sort of a guy, \nso  he lifts Valentino onto the 500’s fat aluminium fuel tank \nand trundles off down the road, taking it nice and easy \nbecause the kid’s not even wearing a helmet, just shirt, \nshorts and sandals. \nThe fickle four-cylinder two-stroke, which Rossi raced \nwithout success in the 1981 500 World Championship, \nwasn’t built for cruising around town, so the engine’s \nspitting and cursing and the slick tyres are  dead cold. But \nValentino isn’t worried in the slightest, in fact the serenity \nin his eyes is astonishing. He’s looking ahead, working out \nthe racing line, like he already knows exactly where he’s \ngoing in life. \nExcept it would be wrong to say that Valentino knew \nexactly where he was going. Sure, he grew up surrounded \nby the tools of his dad’s trade -  engines, GP bikes, rally \nCars, race trucks, caravans, leathers, helmets and so  on  — \nbut the only thing of which he was sure was that he \nwanted to go somewhere fast in life.  He could just as \neasily have become a car  racer: indeed that’s what \nGraziano wanted, because he’d been bitten too often in \nnasty motorcycle crashes and didn’t want his son to get \nso  badly beaten up. \nHis  mum, Stefania, wanted Vale to be an  engineer, or a \nguitarist, or maybe even a footballer, anything but a racer. \nShe had already spent too  many anxious hours in hospital \nwaiting rooms, wondering if Graziano would pull through \nfrom his all too frequent accidents. \nBut when Valentino was five, Graziano built hima \ngo-kart, a wildly over-powered go-kart. ‘That first kart was \nan  awful thing,’ dad remembers. ‘The frame was meant for \na ten-year-old, with a 60cc engine, but  | put in a 100cc \nengine, so  it was very fast and also very light, because \nValentino was so  little, so the thing was sliding \neverywhere.’ And this was Valentino’s initiation into speed \n—no wonder he’s so  good at controlling outrageously \npowerful motorcycles. \nThe kid was good at driving, good enough to win  a \nregional kart title in 1990 and have his eyes set on  the \n1992 Italian and European championships. Then along \ncame minimoto, the  pocket-bike craze that swept through \nItaly in the early ’90s. Valentino badly wanted his own \nminimoto bike: ‘I push, push, push and finally Graziano \nbuy me  a minimoto. It was all-black, like  Ron Haslam’s Elf \nGP bike. It was a toy, | wanted it.’ Of course, Graziano \ndidn’t have a clue what he was getting himself into... \n\n‘Evenpals- teachers at \nKindergarten used to \nSAVE WAS  \"cd. |Cadeh: \nStefania Rossi” \nMum and Valentino rocking the early ‘80s \ntyle.  ‘Valentino never gave me  any \noblems as  a kid,’  recalls Stefania. ‘At \nndergarten and primary school he was \nthe kind  of boy who would get all the \nather kids together. He was always bright \nbut he had  more problems at secondary \nschoo! because he didn't feel  like \nstudying. He always had a great memory \nthough, so  I'd read his school books to \nhim while he lay on  the couch and he'd \nget what he needed from that.’ Too  right, \nValentino's acute intelligence is his most \nimportant weapon on  the racetrack. \n(op) \n\n\n\n<4  \nThe \nday  \nthat  \nchanged \nhis \nlife \n—  \nValentino \nis \ntwo \nand \na \nbit \nyears \nold \nand \ndad \nhas \njust \nbot \night \nhim \nhis \nvery \nfirst \nbike. \nThe \noutrigger \nwheels \ndidn't \nstay \nfor \nlong. \n<4Daad's \nold  \nracing \nlid,  \nman \ngoggles \n—  \nbut \nthere's \nno  \ndoubt \nabout \nit. \nRight \nnow \nhe \nthinks \nhe’s \nthe \ncoolest \nkid \nin \nthe \nwhole \ndamn \nuniverse. \nAnd \nhe's \nnot \nentirely \nwrong. \n\nrshift. \nmarque based within a few  miles of the  Rossi's \ntown \nof \nTavullia, \njust \nlike \nroidelli \ncto \nat \nhelped \npapa \nRossi \nto \nhis \ntwo’GP \nwins \n,  \nThe \nHBS \n\\ \nwe \nda  \nC \nQ \nmotor; \nonly \n101  \nwere \nmade. \n<4Graziano \ndidn't \nste  \nany \ntime \nin \ngettin« \nYd \nup.  \nBut \ndad's \ncareer \nwas \nalready \non  \nthe  \ndownward \nslope. \nA \nbig \ncar   \nrallying \ncrash \nbefore \nthe  \n1980 \nseason \nruined \nwhat \nog \nxen  \nthe \nchance \nof \na \nlifetime \n—  \na  \nfactory \nSuzuki \n500  \nnde. \n\ner \n“lana \n\n‘®ienc \na  \nweeweewe \neee \nee \nS7 \n‘| Nat first kart \nwas  an  awful \nl@ec slelge \neverywnerel’ \nGraziano Rossi \nRight foot stamping on the throttle, full opposite lock and a \nface that's all concentration and aggression — this is how. \nValentino leamed his first lessons about throttle versus \ntraction.

He won his first real  minimoto race in \nthe summer of ’91  and quickly realised this was heaps \nmore fun than kart racing. And anyway, karts were getting \ntoo expensive for the Rossis. \nBy ’92 he was local minimoto champ and brave enough \nto make an  under-age and illegal debut on  a man-sized \nmotorcycle on  a proper racetrack. ‘My friend signed on, \nthen | wore his leathers, it was like a dream.’ In March ’93 \nValentino made his race debut at a freezing cold \nMaggione, aboard a Cagiva 125 streetbike: ‘It was the first \npractice and first proper bike race of my life.  | try morning \npractice, first corner | crash. So | come back to the pit, \nstay quiet, restart, make three or four laps and another \ncrash, so we think maybe we  make big mistake.’ \nPretty soon he got the hang of it, however. That \nsummer he took third in the Italian 125 streetbike \nseries and won the crown the following year. In ’95 \nhe took the Italian 125 GP title and ventured abroad \nfor the first time, taking third in the European 125 \nchampionship, enough to guarantee himself a ride \n‘in the '96 125 World Championship. lI \nPORTRAIT OF A SPEED GOD \n\n\n\nA You  little  show-off... performing a \nperfect one-handed wheelie in dad's \ndriveway.

This is the Cagiva \nMito 125 he crashed twice within a few  laps during his first proper track \nouting at Maggione in the spring of 93. \n& On the podium at Misano with Andrea Ballerini (left) and winner Roberto \nLocatelli, who went on  to capture the 2000 125 world title. \nV Proud dad, or what?

Vale poses aboard his fully painted-up \nCagiva Mito at the start of the ’94 Italian Sport Production \nchampionship. He won it, of course. \nVv On areal GP bike at last,  Valentino raced this Sandroni-framed \nAprilia to third in the '95 European championship, good enough \nto guarantee him a start in the following year’s 125 world \nchampionship. \nMS 5 +4 \nShroot = Fe to) e \n0c; ov), \n‘a \nDISTRIBU Z), ONE \n\npee \nIsa \nsite neering \nseabed \nBEV \n\n67 \nAnd so  the legend begins. Having \ngrandly outfoxed former world chamjo \nJorge Martinez, Vale swoops towards the \nchequered flag to win  his first GP on  the \naftemoon of August 18  1996. Note lack \nof interest from pit lane. \n125s \nIN  THE \nBEGINNIN \nValentino Rossi was just \nanother crash-happy \nteenager when he \ncame to GPs in 1996 \nOh yes, back then he had a real knack for falling off \nmotorcycles, as well as a huge appetite for fun and an \noutrageous mop of girlie hair, as  friend and former 125 \nrival Nobby Ueda remembers: ‘Valentino came to stay at \nmy house in Nagoya before the  96 Japanese GP.  | \nintroduced him to my friends as the  next World Champion \nand they thought he was a girl! His hair was very long...’ \nVale’s hair stayed long throughout ’96, just like he \nstayed a crash-happy teenager. During that season’s 15 \nGPs he threw his little Aprilia down the road something \nlike  18 times and he only won a single race, his debut \nvictory at Brno during August. So Rossi was no  overnight \nsensation —  by the end of ’96 no-one had any idea of the \ngreatness that lay ahead. However, by the end of ’97  he \nwas 125 World Champion and a bona fide superstar. \n\nDuring that second 125 season he won 11  GPs from 15 \nstarts, all the while developing the talent that would allow \nhim to go on  to dominate every GP category -  from 125s \nto 250s and from 500s to MotoGP. But what really \ngrabbed everyone’s attention that summer was Rossi’s \nhilarious post-race theatrics. One weekend he would take \na blow-up doll for a ride on  his victory lap, the next he’d \narrive on  the podium dressed like superman. ‘When | \ncame to GPs all the riders were very, very serious, so \nwhen | started winning, me  and my friends decided we \nshould try to make some big fun,’ Vale recalls. These \ncomic displays made him  much, much more than just \nanother fast man ona motorcycle. They turned all kinds of \npeople on  to Valentino Rossi, ultimately transforming him \ninto the  biggest bike racing star the world has ever seen. \nOf course, it was no  real surprise that Vale crashed a lot \nwhen he started GP racing. Most fast racers crash a lot \nwhen they start out, because they’re hurrying to find the \nlimit and, in finding it, they invariably overstep it. ‘Il make \nsome good races in ’96 but also some big crazy \nmistakes,’ Vale remembers. Most importantly, he was \nlearning all the time and that Brno win  reinforced his self- \nconfidence, so  when Aprilia equipped him with factory- \nprepared bikes for ’97  he knew he was in with a chance of \nthe world title. With a better bike, he crashed much less \nand won much more: ‘I changed because when you \nunderstand your power you become more confident and \nwith a faster engine you can be more relaxed.’ \nAnd if his growing self-confidence changed his racing, \nhis burgeoning popularity changed his life.  Ueda again: ‘At \nthe end of ’97  | went to the Milan bike show and was \nsurprised there were so  many girls after Valentino. He had \nseven or eight security around him —  big macho men — \notherwise he wouldn’t have been able to move. He arrived \nsaying ‘Incredible, what can | do? | want to get away,’ so  | \nhelped him escape out the back.’ \nmini \ni 2 \nV Getting messy with the bubbly after \nbeating Masaki Tokudome at the ‘97 \nBritish GP.

Not that the  racing was the  hardest (he \nwon 14 of his 30 races in the class) but this was when \nhe began to learn the  heavy price of fame, when his \nbeaming teenage naivety was rudely snuffed out  by the \nbig, bad world. Not only that, two of his  best mates died \nin a car  crash. \nWhen he first climbed on  to a 250  at the  end of ’97, \nValentino was still a wide-eyed 18-year-old, loving all \nthe  attention from the  media and his fans, loving \neverything about life, about racing. He hadn’t quite \nrealised that he had unwittingly signed a Faustian pact \n-  make the  people and the  press love you and you’re \n\nin for a rollercoaster of a love affair. Even when \neverything was sweet, sometimes there was just too \nmuch love: ‘Now everyone in Italy recognises me,’ he \nsaid. ‘It’s “Rossi! Rossi! Rossi!” all the time, | don’t like!’ \nNo wonder that by the time he’d won the  250 title in \nOctober ’99 he was already making plans to escape his \nhomeland for the anonymity of London. \nSo ’98 and ’99 were all about coming of age, about \nleaving his carefree teenage years behind. And about \nlearning to ride bigger bikes, of course: 250s were an \nimportant staging post on  his journey to  MotoGP \ngreatness, not that there was any certainty that he’d even \nmake it that far. All Valentino had done so  far was win a \nsingle 125 world title: there had been no  conclusive \nevidence that this kid  might be the  most gifted bike racer \nto have walked this planet. \nFrom the  get-go he was fast on  250s, but also flawed. \nHe crashed out of four of the first ten  races of ’98, then \nbounced back to win  the final four, only missing the title \nby three points. In theory, the  ’99 championship \nshould’ve been a walkover but a few bike problems in the \nearly races plus a miserable ride in the soaking-wet \nJapanese GP  (‘I don’t like to ride under the water’) gave \nhim a mountain to climb. After that Vale got his  head \ndown to win  eight of the  last 12 races, finally alerting the \nworld to the fact that he might be a bit special after all. \n‘Very much was expected of me  when | came to 250s \nin 1998, so  it was the  most difficult period of my career, | \nreally felt the  pressure,’ explains Vale, who had full- \nfactory Aprilias for both his seasons in the  class. ‘I was \n» From boy to man. He was a sweet- \nfaced 19-year-old kid when he fronted up \nfor pre-season testing in ‘98.

It’s merely another step on  the journey towards the \nmain prize -  the  premier league. \nWhen Valentino joined bike racing’s premier division in \n2000 there were just two years left in which he could win \nthe 500 title, the  class that had been the  Big Deal ever since \nthe  birth of World Championship bike racing way back in \n1949. The sport’s governing body had decided that from \n2002 the  scary old two-stroke 500s would be replaced by \nanew breed of more sophisticated 990cc four-strokes, \nmore relevant to the  machines sold on  the street. Vale \nhad spent half his childhood dreaming about winning \nthe 500 crown, now he had just two seasons in which \n\n¥v The  men who made him \nking. From left:  Rossano \nBrazzi, who guided Vale to \nthe  1999 250 title; Mauro \nNoccioli, who helped him  to \nthe  1997 125 crown; and \nJeremy Burgess, who \nmasterminded his successful \nassault on  the 500 World \nChampionship in 2001. \nto master the scariest motorcycles known to man... \nAnd there was no  certainty that he’d ever make it as  a \ngreat 500 rider. If someone had told you in April 2000 that \nValentino wasn’t half as  good as  he was cracked up to be, \nyou would have struggled to disagree with them. The \n21-year-old hadn’t made the  greatest of starts to his \n500  career, and in fact his entry into the premier league \nhad been an  unmitigated disaster. His first three races \nproduced two crashes and one 11th-place finish. \nValentino, some people opined, could handle a puny 125 \n> The winning secret: a plate of pasta \nand  a bottle of ice-cold Nastro.

He had battled for a \nfront-row start at his very first 500 GP and set the fastest \nlap of the  race before his 190 horsepower Honda NSR500 \nrudely ejected him  on  to the tarmac. And, anyway, it didn’t \ntake too  long to prove that he really could ride a man’s \nbike: first podium in his third outing, first win  after just \neight races, in tricky, damp conditions at Donington Park. \nBy the end of the following season no-one was in any \ndoubt. Valentino had won two 500 GPs during 2000 to end \nthe year second overall and he grew to dominate in 2001, \nwinning 11  out  of 16 races. In just two seasons he had \neclipsed the victory rate of Mick Doohan, the rock-hard \nAussie who dominated premier-league racing in the  ’90s \nwith 54 GP victories and five  back-to-back titles. \nVale had also taken on  and defeated his first serious \nrival, Max Biaggi. While most of his 125 and 250 \nopponents had also been mates, he enjoyed a \nrelationship of mutual hatred with the  Roman Emperor. \nTheir rivalry threatened to spiral out of control after their \nnotorious punch-up in June 2001, but Valentino stayed \ncool to soundly defeat his compatriot. \nAnd while Vale’s more recent MotoGP achievements \nseem to overshadow his 500 successes, he still  believes \nthat the 500 is the apogee of racing motorcycles, an \naltogether nastier beast than a cuddly four-stroke MotoGP \nbike. ‘The 500’s power was more wild, so the  bike was \nmore difficult to ride,’ he says. ‘But if you took risks, you \ncould make the difference against the others.’ © \nbe Valentino became an  ex-pat in \n2000, moving to London to escape the \nattentions of his omnipresent Italian \nfans. He rented a flat in St James \nSquare, London, then bought a place \nin Mayfair.

The knife-edge \n500cc two-strokes that had ruled the  premier class for \nthree decades were consigned to the dustbin of racing \nhistory, replaced by rip-snorting 990cc four-strokes. \nEverything changed -  the  bikes were much faster, much \npricier and the two-strokes’ spine-chilling yowl was \ndrowned out  by the four-strokes’ ear-splitting boom. But \nthe song remained the song —  Valentino Rossi was still  king \nof the racetrack. \nFive months after he’d won the  last-ever 500 GP at Rio \nin November 2001, Vale won the first-ever MotoGP event \nat Suzuka in April 2002. By the end of his two seasons \non  the  RC211V V5 he’d won another 20 GP victories to \ntake him into motorcycling’s hall  of fame. Only racing \n\n> Valentino and  Honda's brand-new RCV \ndistract Spanish builders, working on  the \nnew Jerez pits complex, during their first \nEuropean outing in November 2001, \nVale's input played a large part in the V5's \namazing performance. \n\nValentino and his Repsol Honda \nhenchmen ambush passers-by with \nbuckets of water in the  Bmo paddock, \nAugust 2003. It’s all part of an  Italian \nsummer water ritual, apparently. \n<4 Racing for Honda took Valentino too \ndeep into his comfort zone —  after easily \ndestroying his rivals in the first MotoGP \nseries in 2002, he got bored. \nlegends Mick Doohan, Mike Hailwood and Giacomo \nAgostini were still  ahead of him. \nBut Vale’s two seasons on  the stunningly effective \nRCV were very different. He ruled 2002 with awesome \nprecision —  winning 11-of the 16 races, including a mid- \nseason run  of seven back-to-back victories, and never \nfinishing lower than second. He won the title with four \nraces still to go, despite recording a DNF at the Czech \nGP, where he suffered tyre problems. It was an  impressive \nrecord for a rider on  a brand-new bike in a brand-new \nWorld Championship. \nIf anything, 2002 had been too easy, because during \n2003 Valentino seemed to run  out of juice. He won just two \nof the season’s first nine races, beaten on  three occasions \nby new rival Sete Gibernau, now on  a Honda instead of \nSuzuki’s dog-slow GSV-R. But after the  Italian media had \nsavaged him, suggesting he was a spent force, Vale got a \ngrip on  himself to win  all but one of the last seven races. \nThe first of those six victories came at Brno, where he beat \nGibernau with a daring end-of-race attack: ‘After making \nstupid mistakes at the last two races —  just from thinking \ntoo  much —  | changed my tactics —  ride 100  per cent and if \nanyone comes past, attack them immediately!’ \nHe maintained that aggressive attitude for the remainder \nof the season, falling out with Honda after months of very \npublic wrangling over a new contract. So he finaliy decided \nto walk away from MotoGP’s most powerful factory to ride \nfor the  struggling Yamaha outfit. ‘Maybe my choice seems \na little bit crazy,’ said Vale. ‘But we  will  see  next year.’ \nOf course, those who know Valentino weren’t surprised \nby this apparently suicidal career move: he simply wanted \nanother challenge because he loves a challenge. As Carlo \nPernat, the former Aprilia team boss who gave him his first \nGP ride in 1996, says: ‘Two qualities make Valentino \nspecial. First, his sense of balance on  the motorcycle is \nunbelievable, I’ve never seen anything like it. Second, he \nhas fun, he amuses himself by racing. That’s all he does, \nhe amuses himself.’ Which must be just a little depressing \nfor his rivals... \n\n1104. \n“VWvnen \nValentino \nshuts \nhis \nvisor \nand \nSiac \na \nface, \nSveryoody \nbecomes \nhis \nworst \nenemy’ \nGraziano Rossi \nSlowly, slowly, catchy monkey.

As Italian opera \nlegend Pavarotti is fond of saying: ‘When \na journalist write about the positive, he \nwrite five lines, when he write about the \nnegative he become a poet.’ \nBARSHON \n\n\n\nV Groowy, baby! Vale wigs out after his \nfinal  win for Honda. At this  stage the \nworld’s biggest bike brand had  no  idea \nhow much it was going to miss him. \n> Receiving his leaving card from Repsol Honda \nboss Carlo Fiorani. Many insiders reckoned he was \ninsane for leaving Honda but does he look the \nslightest bit worried? \n\nA Hard on  the gas and  all \ncrossed up, Vale shows \nHonda rival  Sete Gilbemau \nhow it’s done at Valencia. \n\n\n\n111 \nStanding on  his M1’s seat, Vale conducts \nthe pit-lane worshippers after his stunning \n2004 Malaysian GP victory. This was \npossibly the first  ‘angry’ win of his career. \nHe had  scores to settle after he’d been \nrelegated to the back row  of the grid at \nthe previous weekend's Qatar GP —  and \nhe settled them well. \nMotoGP Yamaha — \nBECOMING \nGOD \nWhen Valentino quit Honda \nhe took the  risk of his career. \nHe would either end up a \nfool  or a deity... \nIn fact Valentino wasn’t becoming God at all, even if it rather \nseemed like it. Asked in an  interview why he’d stopped \ncelebrating his wins in madcap style, he answered ‘I am \nbecoming old’, but his Italian accent obscured his words \nand the  headlines rattled out  across the world: ‘Rossi: | am \nbecoming God!’. \nOf course, Vale’s against-all-odds success on  Yamaha’s \nM1  did  make him something more than mere genius. There \nare  riders of a certain ability, like  Max Biaggi, Sete Gibernau, \nAlex Criville and Kenny Roberts Junior, and there are  riders \nof a certain nobility, like Giacomo Agostini, Mike Hailwood, \nKing Kenny Roberts, Mick Doohan and Rossi. After his \nstunning 2004 World Championship success Valentino was \nin the  pantheon, no  doubt about it. \n\nAnd yet it could all have gone so  wrong. Yamaha wasn’t in \ngreat shape when Rossi signed with Honda’s old  rival in \nautumn 2003. And Honda was bound to up the ante to ensure \nthat the world’s most powerful bike manufacturer wasn’t \nembarrassed by this turbulent young upstart. At first, the  RCV \nwas way faster than the  M1, but somehow Valentino managed \nto demolish the  Honda hordes at the 2004 season-opening \nSouth African GP to start his Yamaha years the same way he’d \nfinished his days at Honda. And that Welkom win  made \nhistory —  in more than half a century of bike GPs no-one had \never won back-to-back premier-class races on  different \nmakes of bike. \n«Valentino continued to defy the odds throughout 2004. \nDown on  speed, he had to dig deeper than ever before, which \nis why he tumbled twice during the first few months of the \nseason, as  often as  he’d crashed during his previous two \nyears with Honda. Crew chief Jeremy Burgess had some \nstraightforward advice at faster tracks like  Mugello: ‘Valentino, \nyou’re on  the straight for a long time here, so  keep your \nshoulders tucked in and your toes up’. JB’s wise words \nworked because Vale won at Mugello and at other fast tracks. \nFor 2005 it was a very different story. Informed by Vale’s and \nJB’s input, Yamaha built a much-improved M1. Honda bosses \nsuffered in silence as Valentino rubbed more salt  into their \nself-inflicted wounds. But like he says, ‘life  isn’t a movie’, so \nmaybe he wasn’t too surprised when everything went pear- \nshaped in 2006 and 2007: engine blow-ups, tyre disasters, \nphysical injuries, a multi-million euro tax bill, even girlfriend \ntrouble. Which only made his 2008 and 2009 MotoGP crowns \n—  his eighth and ninth world titles —  feel  all the better. \nV Like a schoolboy motocrosser with his first trophy, \nValentino beams with  delight after his defbut win on  the \nYamaha at the 2004 South African GP.  He scored this \nhistoric victory after a race-long duel with Max Biaggi, \nwhose Honda was way faster. \n> Giving his vital  first  impressions of the  M1  to JB, Yamaha \nMotoGP chief Masahiko Nakajima (background) and engineer \nKen Suzuki (who died from a brain tumour in April 2005 —  RIP). \n‘The \nbike \nis \na \ntool, \nSo \nwe \nhave \nto \nwork \nto \nget \nthe \nbest \nout \nof \nthe \ntool,’ \nsays \nValentino. \n‘If \nwe \nhave \na \nproblem \nwith \nthe \nfront \nend, \nwe \nmodify the front end —  it’s like mathematics!’ \n\n<The start of a brave new adventure —  striding out  into the \nSepang pit lane for a photo call  before his first ride on  the M1, \nJanuary 2004.

Valentino's and \nteam-mate Hayden's GP11s were \nhelicoptered to the summit. \nTHE FINAL \nFRONTIER \nValentino and Ducati — \nit’s the  Italian dream \nteam, but  it’s a big \nmountain to climlo \nValentino’s move to Ducati —  officially announced at the \n2010 Czech GP  but known about many months earlier - \nhad been a long time coming. \nThe moment Lorenzo arrived at Yamaha at the end of \n2007, life started getting difficult for Valentino. He \ndemanded a wall to divide the Yamaha pit into two, telling \nthe world that this wasn’t a team in the  normal sense of the \nword. Valentino did  go on  to win  the  2008 and 2009 world \ntitles, but  by the end of 2009 —-  when Lorenzo was \nchallenging and beating Valentino on  a regular basis - it \nwas obvious that Yamaha would have to choose between \nthe two of them. \nValentino also knew the writing was on  the wall, \nannouncing that ‘there isn’t room for both of us  at \n\n\n\n<4 Hanging off more than ever, pulling the \nhandlebars more than ever, Vale bends \nthe GP11 to his will  at Jerez, \nYamaha’. He started talking with Ducati early in 2010, \nbut  in fact the two parties had been interested in each \nother for much longer than that. \nDucati’s genius engineer Filippo Preziosi had dreamed \nof working with Valentino ever since he created the \noriginal Desmosedici MotoGP bike that achieved Ducati’s \nhistoric first premier-class win just ten  weeks after its \nrace debut in 2003. No wonder that Rossi, then falling out \nof love with Honda, was casting amorous glances in \nDucati’s direction. \n‘Valentino was really interested in racing with us  and, \nof course, we  were very interested in having him,’ says \nPreziosi. But  it took another seven years before the \nrelationship would be consummated. During that time \nDucati won its first MotoGP world title, with Casey Stoner \nin 2007, but at the same time the 800cc Desmosedici \nbecame known as a fickle, tricky motorcycle. Only \nStoner, with his dirt-track background, could get the  best \nout of the bike. \nThe Valentino/Ducati marriage was finally \nconsummated at 12.23pm on  9 November 2010, when \nthe nine-time world champion rode down the Valencia \npitlane aboard the GP10 that had proved difficult for even \nStoner to master. After two days on  the  bike Valentino \nwas a lowly 15th fastest, 1.7  seconds behind Stoner, who \nwas having his first ride on  a Honda RCV after defecting \nfrom Ducati. \nSo there is no  doubt that the  big red  Duke is a difficult \nbeast to master. It will  need all the  brain power of \nPreziosi, Rossi and Burgess to get it right. But Valentino’s \narrival can only be good for the  Bolognese marque, as \nhis new team-mate Nicky Hayden remarked. ‘Valentino \ncoming to Ducati will  put a lot of pressure on  the \nfactory,’ said Hayden, Vale’s team-mate at Honda in \n2003. ‘I mean, if he’s not winning, the fans are  gonna \nburn the factory down!’ \nThat first Valencia test proved two things: that Ducati \nwere going to have to change the  bike and that \nValentino was going to need to modify his riding style, \neven though he could never ride like Stoner. \n‘Casey rode the  Ducati in an  oversteer situation \ngoing into the corner, so  the  bike would start to slide, \nwhich made it start to stand up, then he squared it up \nand he went,’ explained Burgess. ‘He was getting it \nturned with brake and throttle, but that’s an  awful risky \nway to do it.’ \nValentino at least did  his best to meet the  Ducati \nhalfway. ‘The Ducati is different from the  M1  —  it must be \nridden with a more dirty style,’ he said. “You have to \nslide the  bike in the  middle of the corner and then pick \nit up as  soon as  possible to accelerate. With the  M1 \nyour lines are  more a round, like a 250. We cannot try \nand turn the  Ducati into a Yamaha because the two \nbikes are  on  the opposite side of the world! We can \nimprove the  Ducati and adapt it to me, but it will  always \nbe different to the  M1.’ \nValentino expects to finish his career with Ducati and \nhe has already said that once he’s had enough of \nMotoGP he would like to have a shot at the World \nSuperbike crown, on  the factory’s booming v-twins. \n\n¥ Ihe pressure is on  as Vale prepares for \nhis Ducati race debut in Qatar. JB,  Bemard, \nBrent, Gary and  new mechanic Mark Elder \n(back to camera) have never worked so \nhard in their lives to get a bike right. \nMe  Ducat must be ridden \nwith  a more airy style’ \n\nVv Rossi with Ducati’s genius engineer Filippo Preziosi at their first \ntest  together. ‘Valentino is very impressive at giving feedback,’ \nsays Preziosi. ‘Bike behaviour is so  complex that we  cannot \nunderstand it just by what we  get from the sensors.’ New team- \nmate Hayden is on  the  left. \ney - \na \n<4 Vale, scared? This Aldo Drudi mudguard sticker illustrates the \n‘dirty’ riding style demanded by Ducati's ferocious Desmosedici. \n\n\n\n<A rare  moment of respite in his \ntoughest year yet. Vale scored his first \nDucati podium at Le Mans, but it was a \nlucky result and  he finished a long way \nbehind winner Stoner, \nVv Racing with Dovizioso and Edwards at Estoril. Despite regular \nbeatings in 2011, Vale kept his sense of humour. After finishing sixth \nat the recently resurfaced Mugello, more than a second a lap off the \nwinners, he joked: ‘If we  race with the  new surface and the others \nrace with the old surface then maybe we  can  win!’ \n<4 The weight of history on  his shoulders. \nIn his pit at Le Mans, Vale examines a \nposter of legendary Ducati rider Paul \nSmart riding a Desmo 250 single at \nOulton Park in 1968. \n\n\n\n177 \nPapa Rossi on  his way to victory, \nDutch TT, Assen 1979. \nPAPA \nROSSI \nTo  know Valentino, you \nneed to  know his  dad... \nGraziano’s Assen victory was the second of his three 250 \nwins in 1979. ‘Assen was my favourite because Assen is the \ntrue theatre of bikes,’ he recalls. ‘I start in third place, pass \nKork Ballington’s Kawasaki after half a lap, then some laps \nlater | arrive behind Greg Hansford’s Kawasaki. We are  going \ndown the straight side by side, we  both decide to brake at the \nlast metre, but | brake even later. Was fantastic! | make my \nfirst win  at Rijeka, one week before. | qualified between the \nKawasakis, who won everything in those days, so when | \narrive on  the grid between them they look at me  like |ama \nUFO. That was the  beautiful thing, it was a surprise, and \nsurprises are  always important in life.  Maybe I lose the \nchance of the World Championship at Silverstone, two races \nlater. | crash on  the last lap when | come across a slow rider \nhalfway through a fast right. | decide to pass him on  the \noutside but this was a bad decision, very bad...’ \n\nV He could ride fourstrokes \ntoo —  Graziano at speed on  a \nBimota Honda, Imola, 1981. \nA And just like Vale, dad loves anything \nwith an  engine and  wheels. Here he \nentertains the crowd with some sideways \nantics in his clapped-out Opel rally car at \nthe Pesaro town fiesta, summer 1985. \n> The definition of Latin cool? Even with \nhis leather dungarees, Graziano manages \nto cut a dash in the Misano pits with mate \nand 1981 500 world champ Marco \nLucchinell, summer of 84. \n\n¥ This little  Fiat was Graziano’s ‘hospitality \nunit’  at the  1981 Imola GP.  Rossi senior was \ndefinitely an  eccentric motorcycle racer. \nA Graziano was a bit wacky, just like his \nson, wacky enough to wear this \nhallucinatory fantasy helmet. The paint \nwas done by artist friend Aldo Drudi, who \nalso does Vale's graphics. \n\n\n\n181 \nMETAL \nROSSI \nThe bikes that have \ntransported Valentino \nto premier-class World \nChampionship Success \nValentino has ruled the  premier class pretty much \nsince he first turned up at the start of the 2000 \nseason. He didn’t quite win the title that year but he \nhas won it every year since and has achieved that \nremarkable run  of success on  three very different \nmotorcycles. First, the harum-scarum Honda NSR, \nthe  last of the  man-eating two-stroke 500s; then \nHonda’s wondrous RCV four-stroke, possibly the \nmost intelligently created race bike in history, then the \nYamaha YZR-M1, the  machine that Vale turned from \nloser to winner in a few months, and finally the trickier \nDucati GP11. Motorcycles don’t come any more trick \nthan these four: they’re all fabulous works of art, a \ntestament to the greatest engineers on  this planet. \n\nHONDA NSRSOO \nThis is the Honda NSR500 two-stroke that took Valentino to his \nfirst premier-class title in 2001. It’s a history-making machine, \nbecause that year’s 500 World Championship was the last \nbefore new technical regulations admitted the 990cc four- \nstrokes that dominate the sport today. It’s also an evil machine — \nfickle, fiery and ferocious compared to the more rider-friendly \nfour-strokes. Nevertheless the 2001 NSR was the apogee of \nhigh-performance two-stroke engineering, a science now \nrestricted to the 250 and 125 GP classes. \nHonda built its first NSR500 in 1984, so almost two decades \nof development went into the bike that Valentino rode. \nThroughout its time on the tracks the NSR was always a tower \nof power, rocketing American legend Freddie Spencer around \nthe Daytona banking at 190mph on  its 1984 race debut. By \n2001 the NSR V4 was pumping out almost 200 horsepower but \nwith superb throttle linearity. It was this remarkable usability that \nmade it the bike that every GP racer wanted, so when Valentino \nbegan considering his move to 500s during 1999, he knew that \nonly an  NSR500 would do. \nOf course, compared with a big, soft four-stroke, the NSR \nwas never easy to ride, which is why Vale loved it so much. \nGiven the choice, he would rather be racing 500s now, but \nsmoky ol’ two-strokes (nicknamed ‘stinkwheels’ by some) were \nconsigned to history because they’d become marginalised by \nenvironmental concems. \nDuring its 17 years of GP racing the NSR won no fewer than \n21  World Championships (ten riders’ and 11  constructors’). \nMassive carbon-fibre airbox delivers air to the NSF's \ngreedy Keihin cars, no  hi-tech fuel  injection on this \n‘stinkwheel’. \nMonster \naluminium \nchassis \njust \nabout \nkeeps \nthe motor under control. \n\nHonda NSR500 2001 \nType: liquid-cooled V4 two-stroke, reed valve induction, \nwith adjustable ignition, exhaust control, etc \nBore & stroke: 54 x 54.5mm \nDisplacement: 499cc \nFuel system: four 36mm magnesium Keihin carbs \nClaimed output: 195 horsepower at 12,500rom \nGearbox: six-speed, cassette type \nFrame type: dual beam aluminium \nTyres: Michelin \nWheels: 1 7in front, 16.5in rear \nFront brake: 4-pot Brembo, twin 320mm carbon discs (dry), twin cast iron  discs (wet) \nRear-brake: 2-pot Brembo, single 196mm disc \nFront suspension: 47mm upside-down Showa, multi-adjustable \nRear suspension: Pro-link with Showa shock, multi-adjustable \nWheelbase: 1400mm \nLength: 2010mm \nRace weight: 131kg \nTop speed: around 195mph \n\nHONDA RC211V \n2003 pac \nmb ee \n\n\n\nWhichever \nway \nyou  \nlook \nat \nit, \nHonda's \nRC211V \nlooks \nsquat, \nmuscular \nand \ncompact. \nNot \nan \ninch \nor \nan \nounce \nwasted, \nthis \nis \nthe \nvery \npinnacle \nof \nthe \nart \nand \nscience \nof \nrace-bike \ndesign. \nHONDA RC 211V \nHonda’s RC211V is probably about as  close as you'll get \nto a perfect racing motorcycle. The V5 four-stroke ruled \nMotoGP’s first two seasons, winning all but three of 32 \nraces in 2002 and 2003, then Honda went and made their \nonly mistake, somehow allowing Valentino to walk away \nand sign for Yamaha. The fact that they’ve had two lean \nyears since Valentino defected reinforces that well-worn \nracetrack axiom: in motorcycle racing the man matters \nfore than the machine. \nGenerally regarded as the most rider-friendly of the \ncurrent generation of 250 horsepower MotoGP bikes, the \nRCV is the embodiment of Honda’s five decades of \nmotorcycle racing know-how. Squat, lean and muscular, the \nV5 was created to be a totally balanced motorcycle, so  its \nengine, chassis and aerodynamics enhance each other for \nmaximum all-round performance. It was the first race bike \nto properly realise the concept of ‘mass centralisation’, \ngathering as  much weight as  possible around the bike’s \ncentre of gravity for improved handling characteristics. \nHonda designed its V5 motor for the same reason, with a \nrelatively narrow 75.5 degree vee, because it would be \ncompact. The engine’s power characteristics are  as cool, \ncalm and collected as they can be, and if things do go \nwrong, there’s a traction-control system that should prevent \nthe rider losing control. So the  RCV is a very manageable \nmotorcycle, at least in relative terms, because no  machine \nthat can nudge 215mph is going to be a doddle to ride. \n\nHonda RC211V 2003 \nType: liquid-cooled 20-valve 75.5 degree V5 four-stroke \nDisplacement: 990cc \nFuel system: PGM fuel  injection \nClaimed output: around 240 horsepower \nGearbox: six-speed, cassette type \nFrame type: dual beam aluminium \nTyres: Michelin \nWheels: 17in front, 16.5in rear \nFront brake: 4-pot Brembo, twin carbon discs (dry), twin cast iron  discs (wet) \nRear-brake: 2-pot Brembo, single disc \nFront suspension: Upside-down Showa, multi-adjustable \nRear suspension: Pro-link with Showa shock, multi-adjustable \nWheelbase: 1440mm \nLength: 2050mm \nRace weight: over 145kg \nTop speed: up to 215mph \n\n\n\neae \n= \neee \n\nThe  \nM1  \nlooks \nsharp, \nlike \na \nrazorblade, \nand  \nthat's \nthe \nway \nit \nhandles \ntoo. \nElectronic \ntrickery \nincludes \ntraction-control \nsystem \nand \na \nfull \nLCD \ndash \nwith \n15,000rom \ntacho \nand \ninbuilt \nlap \ntimer. \nYAMARA YZR-Mi1 \nThis is the  bike that cemented Valentino’s legend. When \nVale quit Honda at the end of 2003, Yamaha’s YZR-M1 was \ngoing through grim times, with just two wins from two \nseasons of MotoGP racing. By taking the 2004 title aboard \nthe M1, Vale proved that he can win even when he doesn’t \nhave the best motorcycle beneath him. Prior to that —  in \n125s, 250s, 500s and MotoGP -—  he’d always had fully \ncompetitive machinery. \nBut Valentino did  more than merely win the title for \nYamaha. His special development abilities also helped the \nfactory to drastically improve its M1. Vale’s sensitivity to a \nbike’s behaviour, his intelligence in understanding what’s \ngoing on  and his ability to communicate those thoughts \nand feelings to his engineers are  as  vital to his success as \nhis instincts as a racer. The 2004 M1  was obviously not as \ngood a motorcycle as  Honda’s RCV, but with a year of \ninput from Valentino and his crew chief Jeremy Burgess, \nthe 2005 M1  looked as good as  the  RCV, especially during \nthe  late stages of races, when bike behaviour is so  crucial. \nThe Yamaha may seem less high-tech than the \nHonda, with its inline four motor (like the  marque’s R1 \nstreetbike), but in fact it features some very clever \ntechnology. The M1’s traction-control electronics inhibit \nwheelspin via engine and chassis sensors that monitor \nfactors like lean angle and slip angle (via gyros and triple- \naxis sensors) to control wheelspin according to tyre wear \nand track conditions. \n\nYamaha YZR-M1 2004 \nType: liquid-cooled 16-valve inline four-cylinder four-stroke \nDisplacement: 990cc \nFuel system: fuel  injection \nClaimed output: over 240 horsepower \nGearbox: six-speed, cassette type \nFrame type: dual beam aluminium \nTyres: Michelin \nWheels: 16.5in front, 16.5in rear \nFront brake: 4-pot Brembo, twin carbon discs (dry), twin cast iron  discs (wet) \nRear-brake: 2-pot Brembo, single disc \nFront suspension: Upside-down Ohlins, multi-adjustable \nRear suspension: Ohlins with rising-rate linkage, multi-adjustable \nRace weight: over 145kg \nTop speed: over 210mph \n\nA \nTi \nira, \nfost Marches, \n\n\n\nYAMAHA YZR-M1 \nMotoGP changed again in 2007, the new 800cc machines \nreplacing the 990s, now deemed too fast to be safe. The \n190cc capacity reduction was supposed to reduce speeds \nbut such is the engineering genius in MotoGP that the 800s \nsmashed the lap record at their very first race! \nReason for the 800s’ remarkable pace was their huge \ncorner speed. The engines are  smaller and lighter (compare \nthe 2004 and 2008 photos), allowing engineers to design \nnimbler, better-handling machines. The engines also have \nless torque, requiring riders to use more corner speed for \nfaster corner exits. \nThe new regulations also blew MotoGP’s status quo to \nsmithereens. !n 2007 Ducati’s GP7 was by far the fastest 800 \nwhile Yamaha’s M1  handled superbly but was well down on \nhorsepower, so  much so that Valentino threatened to walk if \nthe factory didn’t turn things around. Yamaha worked so \nhard that in 2008 the  M1  was the  best bike, a superbly rider- \nfriendly package that defeated the fast but fiery Ducati. \nMain improvements were the all-new 19,000rpm \npneumatic-valve engine, which increased power by 12 per \ncent, and revamped electronics. The M1’s engine \nmanagement system used two gyroscopes, a Magneti \nMarelli Marvel 4 ECU and radical vehicle dynamics software \nto calculate tyre contact patch and deliver exactly the  right \namount of torque at any lean angle, regardless of how much \nthrottle the rider uses. \nAlso crucial, Valentino switched from Michelin to \nBridgestone tyres in 2008. The Japanese tyres use a stiffer \nconstruction which allows higher corner-entry and mid- \ncorner speeds. \nElectronics are  the prime growth area in MotoGP \ntechnology, which is why the M1’s front end is  a mass of \ncables and  little black boxes. Left handlebar includes \nbuttons for launch control and  engine mapping, adjusted \nmid-race to suit tyre and track conditions. \n\nYamaha YZR-M1 2008 \nType: liquid-cooled 16-valve inline four-cylinder four-stroke \nDisplacement: 800cc \nFuel system: fuel  injection \nClaimed output: 210 horsepower \nGearbox: six-speed, cassette type \nFrame type: dual beam aluminium \nTyres: Bridgestone \nWheels: 16.5in front, 16.5in rear \nFront brake: 4-pot Brembo, twin carbon discs (dry), twin cast iron discs (wet) \nRear-brake: 2-pot Brembo, single disc \nFront suspension: Upside down Ohlins, multi-adjustable \nRear suspension: Ohlins with rising rate  linkage, multi-adjustable \nRace weight: over 148kg \nTop speed: over 210mph \n\n\n\nLUCAT| \nDESMOSEDICI \n\nDUCATI DESMOSEDIC! GP11 \nDucati’s MotoGP bike has never been an  easy machine to \nmaster, but the 800cc variant has a bad reputation. It has \ndefeated many talented riders including several world \nchampions. No doubt, it is the biggest challenge of \nValentino’s career so far. \nThe Desmosedici is unique in several ways, most notably \nthrough its desmodromic valve system and its carbon-fibre \nchassis. But these aren’t the factors that make the bike so \ntrieky to ride. Casey Stoner, who took the Duke to world \ntitle glory in 2007, used a genius combination of rear brake, \nthrottle control and body positioning to tame the bike. But \nhe also fell off quite frequently, because he had to ride on \nthe very edge of control. \nVarious experts have various opinions on  the causes of \nthe  Ducati’s ills, but no  one is really certain. Engine \ncharacter is certainly a factor. The V4 has always been \nwilder than its rivals, so  most riders find it too  risky to get \non  the throttle early in the corners, which is where the \nwinning difference can be made. Thus early in 2011 Ducati \nequipped Valentino with a revised engine featuring a \nheavier crankshaft, which makes the power friendlier at the \nfirst touch of the throttle. \nThe GP11’s chassis was also revised soon after Vale’s \narrival and then replaced by a new chassis, taken from the \nGP12 being readied for MotoGP’s 2012 1000cc regulations. \nThe new chassis was designed to reduce corner-exit \nproblems and increase front-end feel, but it too may be \nreplaced by yet another redesign, a conventional alloy \nbeam frame. \nThe Desmosedici requires a lot of hard work, from the  rider \non  the track and from the mechanics in the pits. Ducati \nintroduced the GP12-framed GP11.1 (main photo) \nmidway through 2011 but it didn’t prove to be an  instant \nfix.  Desmodromic valve actuation allows revs peak not \nmuch shy of 20,000rom. \n\nRee uy \na. \n| | \nae ; =. 1s \noom \n— \na villas S HO a, \n_ e \nTe \nNAR oa \nBS \ng \nas =) \n> aay nl \nDucati Desmosedici GP11 2011 \nType: liquid-cooled 16-valve 90 degree V4 four-stroke \nDisplacement: 800cc \nECU: Magneti Marelli \nClaimed output: around 220 horsepower \nGearbox: six-speed, cassette type \nFrame type: carbon-fibre monocoque \nTyres: Bridgestone \nWheels: 16.5in front and  rear \nFront brake: 4-pot Brembo, twin carbon discs (dry), twin cast iron  discs (wet) \nRear-brake: 2-pot Brembo, single disc \nFront suspension: Upside down Ohlins, multi-adjustable \nRear suspension: Ohlins shock, multi-adjustable \nRace weight: over 148kg \nTop speed: over 210mph \n\n200 \nSETE GIBERNAU \n‘I’ve always said you can only ever aspire to being the \nbest rider of your time.

This is Bmo \n2002, which Biaggi won on  the Yamaha M1. \nThat's the  late  Daijiro Kato in the  background. \n‘I’ve never been friends with him. | just go my own way, \nat least | don’t pretend to be his friend like some guys, \nwhich is just theatre, like fake friends. | always say it’s \nimpossible to have a friendship with a rival.

If \nyou like  me, okay, if you don’t like me, okay, but at \nleast I’m true. \n‘What do | think about his riding technique? | don’t \nsee anything very particular, but  he’s the man to beat. \nWhen | see him it just seems he works very well with \nthe  package. In 2001 | was the only one who could \nfight with him. He was very good on  the  brakes but  I \nthink that was because the Honda was always so \nstrong on  braking, while we  had some front-end \nproblems with the Yamaha. Even so,  we  gave 100 per \ncent to be fastest and sometimes we  were.’ \nThe self-styled Roman Emperor was Rossi's first \nbig, bad rival, as  opposed to the mates he’d played \nwith in 125s and 250s. The two hated each other’s guts \neven before they raced each other. After their \ninfamous punch-up in 2001 the imperious Biaggi \nexplained away a graze on  his face with the immortal \nwords: ‘A mosquito bit me.’ \n\nNICKY HAYDEN \n‘One thing | noticed when we  were team-mates is that he \nlooks like  it’s fun, fun, fun, but once you’re in the garage \nthat dude is so  serious, so focused. Everything seems \nperfect, right down to the windscreen sticker and the \ncolour of his boots. He doesn’t overlook anything and \nthat’s a big part of it. \n‘More than anything it’s the racer in him that makes him \nso  strong, it’s obvious he wants to win. He’s got a lot of \nnatural talent but  | Know a lot of guys with natural talent \nand it gets some guys in trouble. It’s the whole package \nthat makes him strong: the desire, the focus, the talent. \n‘| think sometimes maybe he’s not as  laidback as  he \ncomes across. He knows what to say and when to say  it to \nmake it look like things aren’t really getting to him. He \nknows how to play it, on  the  bike and off the  bike. \n‘On track he’s aggressive but totally clean and he \ndefinitely has a lot of tactics. He knows when he wants to \nrace just one guy, how to separate groups, how to slow \nguys down. I’d say his biggest strength is that he can \nadapt. If the tyres go off he can slide, when the bike need \nto be ridden in line he can  ride in line.’ \nFormer US Superbike champ Hayden was the first man \nto steal the MotoGP title from Valentino in 2006.

He started racing as  a young boy, just doing \nwhat he liked doing, playing around, and now he’s doing the same but in a \ndifferent way. He has everything you need to win -  courage, sensitivity with the \nbike, and so  on. \n‘He’s fantastic and he’s the  best rider out there. He proved that to everybody \nby changing factories. But it’s stupid to ask  if he’s the  best ever. How can you \nsay he’s better than Mike Hailwood?

The Italian heartthrob \nalso starred in some movies, then went into team management. \nKING KENNY ROBERTS \n‘The biggest problem with beating Valentino is that he doesn’t mind getting \nbeat. To be a good winner you’ve got to be a good loser. Some days he'll take \nthird, if there’s any chance of overcooking it. What keeps him  winning is the fact \nthat he loves it all: racing, practice, testing. But is he the greatest? | don’t know, | \ndon’t think you can classify anyone like that. \n‘He rides a bit too close to the  limit sometimes, but if he can get away with it, \nmore power to him. It’s just his natural ability coming through more than thinking \nabout it: “Okay, I'm  going to win  this”.’ \nKing Kenny Roberts was the first American to win the 500 World Championship, \nin 1978, using tail-sliding dirt track techniques.

He doesn’t get too flustered, \nhe gets going when he needs to, then pulls off the fastest lap on  the  last  lap to \nwin. But if it’s the  last lap and he’s going to finish second, that’s where he \nfinishes, he doesn’t pitch it down the  road. He’s well ahead of the  bike while \nthe other guys are  struggling to keep up with them.

      "text": "Valentino Rossi is arguably the  best and certainly the most famous \nmotorcycle racer who has ever walked this planet. He has won a pile of \nworld titles and wooed millions of fans with his magical ability to wring the \nmaximum out of an  engine and a pair of wheels. \nHe’s the petrolhead who became a pop star, hopelessly addicted to \nspeed and irresistible to fans of all shapes and sizes: bikers and non-bikers, \nguys and girls, young and old. He earns his living from a violent and risky \nbusiness, laying his life on  the  line, week in, week out, usually looking like \nhe’s really just having a bit of a laugh. \nMotorsport in the 21st century is very much a science, a slave to the \noverbearing laws of physics, a digital duel of zeroes and ones. And yet \nValentino races with an  old-school cavalier swagger, his extraordinary \nnatural ability allowing him to do things with a 210mph motorcycle that \nwould take any normal human being deep into the disaster zone. Watching \nhim at the  height of his powers is special —  he’s totally at one with his \nmotorcycle, melding muscle and metal into a seamless whole, a unique \nunion of man and machine. \nWe’re lucky to be witnessing a remarkable moment in bike racing history. \nAs Carlo Pernat -  the man who gave Vale his big break —  puts it like this: \n‘A rider like Valentino is born every 20 years. For me  he’s similar to guys like \nPele, McEnroe, Muhammad Ali or  Maradona, people who tower over their \nsports.’ Pernat isn’t wrong, Valentino’s shadow casts right across \nmotorcycle racing, so that he’s almost bigger than the sport itself. \nOff the  bike he’s equally outstanding, with a lust for life that burns so \nbrightly and a rock ‘n’ roll attitude that distinguishes him from so  many of \ntoday’s ass-kissing sports stars. Valentino is one of those rare people \nwho every day extracts the  maximum out  of life, but  he always gives as \ngood as  he gets... \nMat Oxley \nLondon \nJuly 2011"

He’s addicted to speed, just like  McQueen was. He \nparties hard, just like  McQueen did. His career is driven by \nan  appetite for fun  and revenge, just like  McQueen’s was. \nAnd he has that same conviction of greatness, that same \nunflinching self-confidence of someone who knows he’s \nreally good, just like  McQueen had. \nMcQueen was an  accomplished dirt  bike racer, good \nenough to race for the  USA's world enduro team. Quite \nsimply, he lived for speed, just like Valentino does. ‘All the \nracers | know race because it’s something that’s inside of \nthem,’ McQueen said. ‘They’re not  courting death.

      "text": "<4it's a tough life, this GP racing. \nValentino on  holiday in Tunisia in ’98.  The \nbig grin belies a troubled soul —  he was \nmidway through his first 250 season, \ncrashing too much and  getting eaten \nalive by the Italian media. \nMIE \n®  really respected -—  ‘he’s full of juice,’ he’d say -  and he \nwould certainly have appreciated the fact that Valentino is \nso full of juice he bubbles over, with enough of the stuff to \ntouch the lives of millions. He radiates a lust for life that \nmost human beings can’t help falling for, just like \nMcQueen did  back in the ’60s and ’70s. \nOf course, there are  contrasts between these two gods \nof speed and cool. McQueen spent most of his life acting \nor playing the fool and the  rest of his time racing \nmotorcycles. Rossi spends most of his life racing bikes \nand the  rest of the time acting up or  playing the fool. But \nhad they been able to spend time together they would’ve \nperfectly understood each other. They would’ve spent \ntheir days thrashing around on  dirt  bikes, getting into \ndeep discussions about tyre compounds and suspension \nsettings, and their nights getting drunk and talking \nnonsense. Because that’s what being Valentino is all \nabout: race hard, play hard. \nHe’s certainly no  longer the impish boy racer who had \na smile for everyone, even his most belligerent 125 and \n250 rivals. These days he’s a grown man in a tough \nworld, and perhaps the  McQueen fetish is all about \ngrowing up.  Look at Valentino now, he’s no  longer the j \nplayful kid with the trance cadet hairdo. And on  the \ntrack he’s no  longer a boy wonder, he’s a \nheavyweight fighter. His vicious on-track clashes \nwith arch-rivals Sete Gibernau (Jerez 2005), \nCasey Stoner (Laguna 2008) and Jorge Lorenzo \n(Motegi 2010) prove that. \nBut people who balk at this more macho Valentino \nshould remember that he competes in one of the \ncruellest, most vicious sports —  a world of corporate \noverkill in the  paddock and sudden death on  the \nracetrack. It’s not the  kind of world you pass through \nwithout making enemies, and if you can use your \nenemies for motivation, then why not? \nLike McQueen, Valentino is one of those people who \nalways gets the  maximum out of life.  And like Vale, \nMcQueen was good at making enemies. McQueen was \nalso well-known for taking risky roles at the  height of his \ncommercial powers, just like Valentino. Vale loves laying \nit on  the  line, taking risks, because he’s courting being \nalive. Someone once said of McQueen: ‘He didn’t die \nwondering.’ Neither will  Valentino... \n<The king indeed. Italian \nRolling Stone dressed \nValentino like  Elvis and \nput him  on  its cover in \nDecember 2008. Editor \nMichele Lupi is a mate of \nVale's and  spends much \ntime trying to educate the \nyoungster in the ways of \nthe rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle."

They appear occasionally but never for very long -  he seems to be \nenjoying the young, free, single lifestyle. ‘When you make this life is very difficult \nto have a girl,’ he says. ‘If you bring her to  a GP maybe she’s bored, so  | stay \nalone at races, is better. Then when you stay one week at a racetrack, you come \nback home and you have some power to use, you need to have fun, go out with \nfriends, go to the disco, but your girlfriend has just stayed one  week doing all \nthis, so  when | come home, she say  ‘can we  see  a movie?’. So is difficult.’ \nA The Valenteenyooppers go \nnuts at Mugello 98.  He was only \njust beginning to get used to all \nthe fuss. \nNot that that has stopped him from enjoying the attentions of the gentler sex. \n‘We really enjoy having so  many girls around!’ says Vale’s best mate Uccio. \n‘Maybe some top riders or superstars worry “is this girl coming to see  me \nbecause I’m famous or does she really like  me?”, but Valentino doesn’t think like \nthat, he always says “I don’t care why she’s coming to see  me, I’m just happy \nthat she’s coming”.’ \nFormer Aprilia GP boss Carlo Pernat has always been amazed at Vale’s ways \nwith the  ladies. ‘I’ve never seen so  many girls around a rider, maybe Sheene or \nPerera \n> You wouldn't find  many macho bike \nracers happy to hang out with a tranny, \nVale sharing a laugh with notorious \nltalian DU Platinette at Imola 1999."

Well, not  exactly... \n<4 Look into those eyes, look \nright into those eyes. Riding \nshotgun with dad Graziano at a \nPesaro town festival in the \nsummer of 1985, Valentino \nalready knows exactly where \nhe's going... The bike is the \nMorbidelli 500 that papa Rossi \nrode in the  1981 500 World \nChampionship. \nIt’s the summer of ’85, Madonna’s ‘Like A Virgin’ is \npumping out across the town squares of Italy, annoying \nthe  Roman Catholic church, and motorcycle GP racing is \nan  all-American affair, with ‘Fast’ Freddie Spencer and \n‘Steady’ Eddie Lawson duking it out for the 500 World \nChampionship, biking’s biggest prize. Down in the \nAdriatic seaside town of Pesaro they’re putting on a bit of \na fiesta —  riding racing motorcycles and cars around the \ncentre of town, just for the sheer hell  of it, because that’s \nwhat they do in  Italy. \nGraziano Rossi has already been retired from bike \nracing for three years, following a massive crash at Imola, \nbut is asked to take his old  Morbidelli 500 GP bike out for \na spin. Rossi lives only a few miles inland in Tavullia, and \nthe  Morbidelli factory is just down the  road, so this \nmeans something to the  locals. Only one little problem, \nRossi’s six-year-old son  wants to come along for the  ride. \nOf course, Graziano is an  accommodating sort of a guy, \nso  he lifts Valentino onto the 500’s fat aluminium fuel tank \nand trundles off down the road, taking it nice and easy \nbecause the kid’s not even wearing a helmet, just shirt, \nshorts and sandals. \nThe fickle four-cylinder two-stroke, which Rossi raced \nwithout success in the 1981 500 World Championship, \nwasn’t built for cruising around town, so the engine’s \nspitting and cursing and the slick tyres are  dead cold. But \nValentino isn’t worried in the slightest, in fact the serenity \nin his eyes is astonishing. He’s looking ahead, working out \nthe racing line, like he already knows exactly where he’s \ngoing in life. \nExcept it would be wrong to say that Valentino knew \nexactly where he was going. Sure, he grew up surrounded \nby the tools of his dad’s trade -  engines, GP bikes, rally \nCars, race trucks, caravans, leathers, helmets and so  on  — \nbut the only thing of which he was sure was that he \nwanted to go somewhere fast in life.  He could just as \neasily have become a car  racer: indeed that’s what \nGraziano wanted, because he’d been bitten too often in \nnasty motorcycle crashes and didn’t want his son to get \nso  badly beaten up. \nHis  mum, Stefania, wanted Vale to be an  engineer, or a \nguitarist, or maybe even a footballer, anything but a racer. \nShe had already spent too  many anxious hours in hospital \nwaiting rooms, wondering if Graziano would pull through \nfrom his all too frequent accidents. \nBut when Valentino was five, Graziano built hima \ngo-kart, a wildly over-powered go-kart. ‘That first kart was \nan  awful thing,’ dad remembers. ‘The frame was meant for \na ten-year-old, with a 60cc engine, but  | put in a 100cc \nengine, so  it was very fast and also very light, because \nValentino was so  little, so the thing was sliding \neverywhere.’ And this was Valentino’s initiation into speed \n—no wonder he’s so  good at controlling outrageously \npowerful motorcycles. \nThe kid was good at driving, good enough to win  a \nregional kart title in 1990 and have his eyes set on  the \n1992 Italian and European championships. Then along \ncame minimoto, the  pocket-bike craze that swept through \nItaly in the early ’90s. Valentino badly wanted his own \nminimoto bike: ‘I push, push, push and finally Graziano \nbuy me  a minimoto. It was all-black, like  Ron Haslam’s Elf \nGP bike. It was a toy, | wanted it.’ Of course, Graziano \ndidn’t have a clue what he was getting himself into..."

His hair was very long...’ \nVale’s hair stayed long throughout ’96, just like he \nstayed a crash-happy teenager. During that season’s 15 \nGPs he threw his little Aprilia down the road something \nlike  18 times and he only won a single race, his debut \nvictory at Brno during August. So Rossi was no  overnight \nsensation —  by the end of ’96 no-one had any idea of the \ngreatness that lay ahead. However, by the end of ’97  he \nwas 125 World Champion and a bona fide superstar."

But what really \ngrabbed everyone’s attention that summer was Rossi’s \nhilarious post-race theatrics. One weekend he would take \na blow-up doll for a ride on  his victory lap, the next he’d \narrive on  the podium dressed like superman. ‘When | \ncame to GPs all the riders were very, very serious, so \nwhen | started winning, me  and my friends decided we \nshould try to make some big fun,’ Vale recalls. These \ncomic displays made him  much, much more than just \nanother fast man ona motorcycle. They turned all kinds of \npeople on  to Valentino Rossi, ultimately transforming him \ninto the  biggest bike racing star the world has ever seen. \nOf course, it was no  real surprise that Vale crashed a lot \nwhen he started GP racing. Most fast racers crash a lot \nwhen they start out, because they’re hurrying to find the \nlimit and, in finding it, they invariably overstep it. ‘Il make \nsome good races in ’96 but also some big crazy \nmistakes,’ Vale remembers. Most importantly, he was \nlearning all the time and that Brno win  reinforced his self- \nconfidence, so  when Aprilia equipped him with factory- \nprepared bikes for ’97  he knew he was in with a chance of \nthe world title. With a better bike, he crashed much less \nand won much more: ‘I changed because when you \nunderstand your power you become more confident and \nwith a faster engine you can be more relaxed.’ \nAnd if his growing self-confidence changed his racing, \nhis burgeoning popularity changed his life.  Ueda again: ‘At \nthe end of ’97  | went to the Milan bike show and was \nsurprised there were so  many girls after Valentino. He had \nseven or eight security around him —  big macho men — \notherwise he wouldn’t have been able to move.

Rossi! Rossi!” all the time, | don’t like!’ \nNo wonder that by the time he’d won the  250 title in \nOctober ’99 he was already making plans to escape his \nhomeland for the anonymity of London. \nSo ’98 and ’99 were all about coming of age, about \nleaving his carefree teenage years behind. And about \nlearning to ride bigger bikes, of course: 250s were an \nimportant staging post on  his journey to  MotoGP \ngreatness, not that there was any certainty that he’d even \nmake it that far. All Valentino had done so  far was win a \nsingle 125 world title: there had been no  conclusive \nevidence that this kid  might be the  most gifted bike racer \nto have walked this planet. \nFrom the  get-go he was fast on  250s, but also flawed. \nHe crashed out of four of the first ten  races of ’98, then \nbounced back to win  the final four, only missing the title \nby three points. In theory, the  ’99 championship \nshould’ve been a walkover but a few bike problems in the \nearly races plus a miserable ride in the soaking-wet \nJapanese GP  (‘I don’t like to ride under the water’) gave \nhim a mountain to climb. After that Vale got his  head \ndown to win  eight of the  last 12 races, finally alerting the \nworld to the fact that he might be a bit special after all. \n‘Very much was expected of me  when | came to 250s \nin 1998, so  it was the  most difficult period of my career, | \nreally felt the  pressure,’ explains Vale, who had full- \nfactory Aprilias for both his seasons in the  class. ‘I was \n» From boy to man. He was a sweet- \nfaced 19-year-old kid when he fronted up \nfor pre-season testing in ‘98.  The  next \nfew months would have a huge effect on \nhis character, hardening him for the \nchallenges ahead. \nfast but  | made mistakes because | wasn’t calm, \nbecause | had some personal problems with some \nfriends who | realised weren’t friends.

From left:  Rossano \nBrazzi, who guided Vale to \nthe  1999 250 title; Mauro \nNoccioli, who helped him  to \nthe  1997 125 crown; and \nJeremy Burgess, who \nmasterminded his successful \nassault on  the 500 World \nChampionship in 2001. \nto master the scariest motorcycles known to man... \nAnd there was no  certainty that he’d ever make it as  a \ngreat 500 rider. If someone had told you in April 2000 that \nValentino wasn’t half as  good as  he was cracked up to be, \nyou would have struggled to disagree with them. The \n21-year-old hadn’t made the  greatest of starts to his \n500  career, and in fact his entry into the premier league \nhad been an  unmitigated disaster. His first three races \nproduced two crashes and one 11th-place finish. \nValentino, some people opined, could handle a puny 125 \n> The winning secret: a plate of pasta \nand  a bottle of ice-cold Nastro. This is \nWelkom, South Africa, 2001, one  of \nthose flyaway races where the \nMotoGP paddock roughs it in \nPortakabins, rather than the five-star \ntransporters and motorhomes they \ninhabit at European races. \nor 250 but  he couldn’t ride a real man’s motorcycle. \nOf course, the signs of greatness were there for anyone \nbothered to look carefully enough. He had battled for a \nfront-row start at his very first 500 GP and set the fastest \nlap of the  race before his 190 horsepower Honda NSR500 \nrudely ejected him  on  to the tarmac. And, anyway, it didn’t \ntake too  long to prove that he really could ride a man’s \nbike: first podium in his third outing, first win  after just \neight races, in tricky, damp conditions at Donington Park. \nBy the end of the following season no-one was in any \ndoubt. Valentino had won two 500 GPs during 2000 to end \nthe year second overall and he grew to dominate in 2001, \nwinning 11  out  of 16 races. In just two seasons he had \neclipsed the victory rate of Mick Doohan, the rock-hard \nAussie who dominated premier-league racing in the  ’90s \nwith 54 GP victories and five  back-to-back titles. \nVale had also taken on  and defeated his first serious \nrival, Max Biaggi. While most of his 125 and 250 \nopponents had also been mates, he enjoyed a \nrelationship of mutual hatred with the  Roman Emperor. \nTheir rivalry threatened to spiral out of control after their \nnotorious punch-up in June 2001, but Valentino stayed \ncool to soundly defeat his compatriot. \nAnd while Vale’s more recent MotoGP achievements \nseem to overshadow his 500 successes, he still  believes \nthat the 500 is the apogee of racing motorcycles, an \naltogether nastier beast than a cuddly four-stroke MotoGP \nbike. ‘The 500’s power was more wild, so the  bike was \nmore difficult to ride,’ he says. ‘But if you took risks, you \ncould make the difference against the others.’ © \nbe Valentino became an  ex-pat in \n2000, moving to London to escape the \nattentions of his omnipresent Italian \nfans. He rented a flat in St James \nSquare, London, then bought a place \nin Mayfair. Getting about the posh \npart of town was easy —  aboard a \nblagged Honda SP-2,"

He ruled 2002 with awesome \nprecision —  winning 11-of the 16 races, including a mid- \nseason run  of seven back-to-back victories, and never \nfinishing lower than second. He won the title with four \nraces still to go, despite recording a DNF at the Czech \nGP, where he suffered tyre problems. It was an  impressive \nrecord for a rider on  a brand-new bike in a brand-new \nWorld Championship. \nIf anything, 2002 had been too easy, because during \n2003 Valentino seemed to run  out of juice. He won just two \nof the season’s first nine races, beaten on  three occasions \nby new rival Sete Gibernau, now on  a Honda instead of \nSuzuki’s dog-slow GSV-R. But after the  Italian media had \nsavaged him, suggesting he was a spent force, Vale got a \ngrip on  himself to win  all but one of the last seven races. \nThe first of those six victories came at Brno, where he beat \nGibernau with a daring end-of-race attack: ‘After making \nstupid mistakes at the last two races —  just from thinking \ntoo  much —  | changed my tactics —  ride 100  per cent and if \nanyone comes past, attack them immediately!’ \nHe maintained that aggressive attitude for the remainder \nof the season, falling out with Honda after months of very \npublic wrangling over a new contract. So he finaliy decided \nto walk away from MotoGP’s most powerful factory to ride \nfor the  struggling Yamaha outfit. ‘Maybe my choice seems \na little bit crazy,’ said Vale. ‘But we  will  see  next year.’ \nOf course, those who know Valentino weren’t surprised \nby this apparently suicidal career move: he simply wanted \nanother challenge because he loves a challenge. As Carlo \nPernat, the former Aprilia team boss who gave him his first \nGP ride in 1996, says: ‘Two qualities make Valentino \nspecial. First, his sense of balance on  the motorcycle is \nunbelievable, I’ve never seen anything like it. Second, he \nhas fun, he amuses himself by racing. That’s all he does, \nhe amuses himself.’ Which must be just a little depressing \nfor his rivals..."

After two days on  the  bike Valentino \nwas a lowly 15th fastest, 1.7  seconds behind Stoner, who \nwas having his first ride on  a Honda RCV after defecting \nfrom Ducati. \nSo there is no  doubt that the  big red  Duke is a difficult \nbeast to master. It will  need all the  brain power of \nPreziosi, Rossi and Burgess to get it right. But Valentino’s \narrival can only be good for the  Bolognese marque, as \nhis new team-mate Nicky Hayden remarked. ‘Valentino \ncoming to Ducati will  put a lot of pressure on  the \nfactory,’ said Hayden, Vale’s team-mate at Honda in \n2003. ‘I mean, if he’s not winning, the fans are  gonna \nburn the factory down!’ \nThat first Valencia test proved two things: that Ducati \nwere going to have to change the  bike and that \nValentino was going to need to modify his riding style, \neven though he could never ride like Stoner. \n‘Casey rode the  Ducati in an  oversteer situation \ngoing into the corner, so  the  bike would start to slide, \nwhich made it start to stand up, then he squared it up \nand he went,’ explained Burgess. ‘He was getting it \nturned with brake and throttle, but that’s an  awful risky \nway to do it.’ \nValentino at least did  his best to meet the  Ducati \nhalfway. ‘The Ducati is different from the  M1  —  it must be \nridden with a more dirty style,’ he said. “You have to \nslide the  bike in the  middle of the corner and then pick \nit up as  soon as  possible to accelerate. With the  M1 \nyour lines are  more a round, like a 250. We cannot try \nand turn the  Ducati into a Yamaha because the two \nbikes are  on  the opposite side of the world! We can \nimprove the  Ducati and adapt it to me, but it will  always \nbe different to the  M1.’ \nValentino expects to finish his career with Ducati and \nhe has already said that once he’s had enough of \nMotoGP he would like to have a shot at the World \nSuperbike crown, on  the factory’s booming v-twins."

It’s also an evil machine — \nfickle, fiery and ferocious compared to the more rider-friendly \nfour-strokes. Nevertheless the 2001 NSR was the apogee of \nhigh-performance two-stroke engineering, a science now \nrestricted to the 250 and 125 GP classes. \nHonda built its first NSR500 in 1984, so almost two decades \nof development went into the bike that Valentino rode. \nThroughout its time on the tracks the NSR was always a tower \nof power, rocketing American legend Freddie Spencer around \nthe Daytona banking at 190mph on  its 1984 race debut. By \n2001 the NSR V4 was pumping out almost 200 horsepower but \nwith superb throttle linearity. It was this remarkable usability that \nmade it the bike that every GP racer wanted, so when Valentino \nbegan considering his move to 500s during 1999, he knew that \nonly an  NSR500 would do. \nOf course, compared with a big, soft four-stroke, the NSR \nwas never easy to ride, which is why Vale loved it so much. \nGiven the choice, he would rather be racing 500s now, but \nsmoky ol’ two-strokes (nicknamed ‘stinkwheels’ by some) were \nconsigned to history because they’d become marginalised by \nenvironmental concems. \nDuring its 17 years of GP racing the NSR won no fewer than \n21  World Championships (ten riders’ and 11  constructors’). \nMassive carbon-fibre airbox delivers air to the NSF's \ngreedy Keihin cars, no  hi-tech fuel  injection on this \n‘stinkwheel’. \nMonster \naluminium \nchassis \njust \nabout \nkeeps \nthe motor under control."

The \n190cc capacity reduction was supposed to reduce speeds \nbut such is the engineering genius in MotoGP that the 800s \nsmashed the lap record at their very first race! \nReason for the 800s’ remarkable pace was their huge \ncorner speed. The engines are  smaller and lighter (compare \nthe 2004 and 2008 photos), allowing engineers to design \nnimbler, better-handling machines. The engines also have \nless torque, requiring riders to use more corner speed for \nfaster corner exits. \nThe new regulations also blew MotoGP’s status quo to \nsmithereens. !n 2007 Ducati’s GP7 was by far the fastest 800 \nwhile Yamaha’s M1  handled superbly but was well down on \nhorsepower, so  much so that Valentino threatened to walk if \nthe factory didn’t turn things around.

No doubt, it is the biggest challenge of \nValentino’s career so far. \nThe Desmosedici is unique in several ways, most notably \nthrough its desmodromic valve system and its carbon-fibre \nchassis. But these aren’t the factors that make the bike so \ntrieky to ride. Casey Stoner, who took the Duke to world \ntitle glory in 2007, used a genius combination of rear brake, \nthrottle control and body positioning to tame the bike. But \nhe also fell off quite frequently, because he had to ride on \nthe very edge of control. \nVarious experts have various opinions on  the causes of \nthe  Ducati’s ills, but no  one is really certain. Engine \ncharacter is certainly a factor. The V4 has always been \nwilder than its rivals, so  most riders find it too  risky to get \non  the throttle early in the corners, which is where the \nwinning difference can be made. Thus early in 2011 Ducati \nequipped Valentino with a revised engine featuring a \nheavier crankshaft, which makes the power friendlier at the \nfirst touch of the throttle. \nThe GP11’s chassis was also revised soon after Vale’s \narrival and then replaced by a new chassis, taken from the \nGP12 being readied for MotoGP’s 2012 1000cc regulations. \nThe new chassis was designed to reduce corner-exit \nproblems and increase front-end feel, but it too may be \nreplaced by yet another redesign, a conventional alloy \nbeam frame. \nThe Desmosedici requires a lot of hard work, from the  rider \non  the track and from the mechanics in the pits. Ducati \nintroduced the GP12-framed GP11.1 (main photo) \nmidway through 2011 but it didn’t prove to be an  instant \nfix.  Desmodromic valve actuation allows revs peak not \nmuch shy of 20,000rom."
