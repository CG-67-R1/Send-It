Crowds regularly run  into  six figures, \nmaking it the  best-attended one-day sporting event in \nthe  UK. \nRewind to  1988, and  the first-ever World Superbike \nrace, and  an  optimist might have counted 10,000 people \ninside Donington Park. Take today’s spectator back to \nthat first  race and  they would have trouble recognising it \nas  a World Championship event. Then it was privateers \nin rusty vans; now it’s factory teams, corporate \nhospitality and huge crowds. \nThe  road from those humble origins to today’s \nprominence hasn’t been an  easy one. World Superbike’s \n8  World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nfirst problem was explaining exactly what the word \n‘Superbike’ meant, because it implied different things \nin different parts of the world and  had  been used to \nlabel virtually anything that  wasn’t a Grand Prix  bike. \nAmerican racer turned promoter Steve McLaughlin \nwas the  driving force behind the  birth of the World \nSuperbike Championship and  the  man mainly \nresponsible for drawing up the  first  set  of rules. He  did \nsuch a  good job that it was years before they needed \nmodifying. \nThe initial concept was simple: keep the  main frame \nand  engine castings untouched from the  street bike \non  which the  racer was based, allow race suspension, \nwheels and brakes, but  keep the  original bike's \nsilhouette.

It \nworks as  well as  any  explanation, but the  indisputable \nfact  is that no  touring car  has ever come anywhere near \nan  F1  car's lap record, while Superbikes have regularly \nencroached on  the  lap times of Grand Prix  bikes. That's \nthe  attraction of the  Superbike class: the  bikes that \nanyone can  buy in the  showroom are  raced by some of \nthe  best riders in the  world. \nNo  factory has  benefited more than Ducati. When \nthe World Championship was born, Ducati was a tiny \nItalian factory in protective receivership. They gambled \ntheir future on  success in World Superbike, and  three \nworld titles in the early 1990s certainly helped, but the \ncritical event was Ducati’s launch of the  916  in  1994. \nIt turned out  to  be one  of the  most successful racing \ndesigns ever, carrying Carl Fogarty to the  first  of his \nfour titles. In no  time at all, the  Ducati brand was  a \nworldwide style icon. \nThe  World Superbike Championship has  come a  long \nway in two decades, but  it hasn't always been an  easy \nride. Earlier attempts to  promote World Championships \nbased on  production bikes —  TT  F1  and  Formula 750 \n—  were short lived. There were times when it looked as \nif World Superbike might go the  same way, for  reasons \nranging from simple lack  of cash to  a  major fall-out \nbetween the  organisers and  the Japanese factories. \nThe  World Superbike Championship has weathered all \nthe  storms and, in its first 20 years, has  become solidly \nestablished as  the  most successful series of its type. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 9 \n\nao Apa: « \nShee aS \npee Sess \nSeale em \n\nhe creation of the  World Superbike Championship is \ndown to  the  vision of one man, former racer turned \npromoter, Steve McLaughlin. In  1985 the  American \nbased himself in  Paris, linking up  with an  old  friend, \nFrench journalist Philippe Debarle, and together they \ncame up  with the  idea that there should be  a  World \nChampionship for  four-strokes. It took some time, but \nafter consultation with the  FIM, particularly with the \nsupport of Luigi Brenni, President of the  Road Racing \nCommission, Mitsuo Itoh of Suzuki, Ed  Youngblood, \nVernon Cooper, Bill  Smith and Colin Armes, the \ndetails and rules were drawn up  and the  basis of the \nchampionship was laid  down \nIt wasn’t just a matter of getting the  rules right \nMcLaughlin also had  to  get the  practicalities sorted. His \norganisation had  secured from the  FIM  the  rights to  run \nand promote the  championship when he  got a call  from \nthe  New Zealand-based media conglomerate Global \nSports & Promotions, part of the  Madison Corporation \none of their directors was in  Los  Angeles and would \nlike  to  talk  to  him. They met, they talked, the  Kiwi flew \nhome. The next call  said come to  Auckland —  ‘the first of \nabout 14  trips to  Sheep City’ \nThe New Zealanders wanted the  championship \nand bought a  controlling share in  McLaughlin's \noperation, which was transferred to  a  company set  up \nfor the  purpose called Sports Marketing. It was this \ncompany that organised TV  coverage for  the  nascent \nchampionship and came up  with a  travel fund for  riders, \nthanks in  large part to  the  behind-the-scenes efforts \nof  Keith Jones, MD  of Sports Marketing and Global \nSports & Promotions, and the  perfect detail-obsessed \nworkaholic counterpart to  McLaughlin’s flair anc \nhowever, the  very public face of  the \nAt  one point McLaughlin had 19 \nhold a  round of the championship, but the \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 11 \n\nto  \nnine \nfor  \nthe  \nstart \nof \nthe  \nseason. \nSome \ncountries \nwere \nmuch \nmore \ndifficult \nthan \nothers. \nGetting \nHungary \non \nboard \ntook \na \nlot \nof \nwork, \nas \nthe \nsponsoring \ngovernment \ndepartment \nhad \nlost \na \npacket \non \na \nTT \nF1 \nrace \nthe \nyear \nbefore. \nMcLaughlin \nhung \naround \nfor \ndays \nin \nBudapest \ncalling \nthe \nministry \ntwice \na \nday. \nFinally \nhe \ngot \nto \nmeet \nthe \nmain \nman, \nwho \nturned \nout \nto \nbe \na \nbit \nof \na \ndrinker \nA \nbottle \nand \na \nhalf \nof \nwhisky \nlater, \nMcLaughlin \nwas \ntold \nthat \nthere \nwere \nsome \nFinnish \nfriends \nwho \nmight \nhelp \nout \nwith \nsome \nsponsorship. \nSure \nenough, \nMcLaughlin \nlater \nmet \nup  \nwith \ntwo \nFinns \nin \none \nof \nHollywood's \nmost \nexpensive \nhotels. \nThey \nwere \nstereotypical \nhard-drinking, \nsilent \nFinns, \nunt \nMcLaughlin \ntold \nthem \nthat \nhe \ncould \nget \nthem \ninto \nthe \nback \nlot \nof \none \nof \nthe \nbig \nmovie \ncompanies. \nSuddenly \nthey \nwere \nlike \nkids \nin \na \nsweet \nshop. \nThe \nsponsorship \nduly \narrived \nand \nthe \nHungarian \nrace \nwas \non \nthe \ncalendar. \nThere \nwere \ndates \nin  \nEurope, \nJapan, \nAustralia \nand \nNew \nZealand \n—  \nand \nnot  \na  \nclosed-road \ncircuit \namong \nthem. \nThe \nonly \nserious \nloss \nwas \nAssen, \nwhich \nhad \nbeen \ngoing \nto  \nswitch \nits \nSpoeedweek \nF1  \nrace \nto  \nSuperbike, \nbut, \nsays \nMcLaughlin, \nunder \nthe \ninfluence \nof \nhis \nenemies \nswitched \nback. \nThis \ngave \nF1 \nenough \ndates \nto \ncontinue \ncalling \nitself \na World \nChampionship, \nnot \nthat \nthis \nwas \nseen \nas  \na  \ngreat \nproblem \nfor  \nSuperbike. \nGrands \nPrix, \non  \nthe \nother \nhand, \nstill \nhad \nGardner, \nLawson, \nRainey, \nSchwantz, \nMamola \nand \nSarron \n— \na \nveritable \nbattle \nof \nthe \ntitans \n—  \nand  \nthat \nwas \njust \nthe  \n500s. \nIn \nthe  \n250s \nthere \nwas \nan \nepic \nstruggle \nbetween \nGarriga \nand \nPons, \nwith \nsupport \nfrom \nMang, \nCadalora \nand \na \nwhole \nhost \nof \nothers, \nplus \na \nbrash \nnew \nAmerican \nkid  \ncalled \nJohn \nKocinski. \nSuperbike \nwould \nhave \na \nhard \ntime \ntaking \nspectators \nand \nsponsors \naway \nfrom \nthat \nlot. \nThe main weapon in the  sponsorship war was \ntelevision, \nand \nSports \nMarketing \nbroke \nnew \nground \nin contracting a  part of the  giant CBS organisation to \nprovide \ncoverage. \nSuperbike \nwould \nbe \nshown \nat \nsome \nodd \ntimes \nand \non \nsome \nminor \nstations, \nbut \nit \nwould \nbe \nshown. \nThis \nwas \nbefore \nthe \nsatellite \nrevolution \nin \nEurope \nand \nat \na \ntime \nwhen \nthe \nGrands \nPrix \ngot \nno \nregular \ncoverage \nin \nimportant \nmarkets \nlike \nthe \nUK. \nLooking back, the  original TV  coverage seems flimsy, \nbut  at the  time it was a  major breakthrough for  the \nsport \nof \nmotorcycle \nracing. \nThe \ntravel \nfund \nof \n$25,000 \nper \nmeeting \nattracted \na \nclassy \nhard \ncore \nof \nriders \nwho \nwould contest the  whole championship. Thus the \nproduct they were selling looked good, but  despite \nall their efforts Sports Marketing did  not  secure the \nmajor sponsor that would defray their considerable \nexpenditure \nand \nguarantee \nthe \nfuture \nof \nthe \nseries. \nFor  \nthe  \npromoters \nthe  \nchallenge \nhad  \nbeen \nto  \nfind \nthat \nelusive \nbacker, \nbut \non \n3 \nApril \n1988 \nat \nthe \nUK's \nDonington \nPark \nattention \nfocused \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \non  the  riders and  the  racing. Just before the  first race, \nMcLaughlin was called to  the  International Jury's \nroom: \n‘That's \nit,’ \nhe \nthought, \n‘it \nain't \ngoing \nto \nhappen \n— \nsomething's \ngone \nhorribly \nwrong.’ \nInstead \nhe \nfound \nhimself on  the  receiving end  of a  couple of generous \nspeeches \nfrom \npeople \nhe \nwouldn't \nhave \nthought \nof \nas \nhis  friends. \n\nThere were a  couple of hiccups, though. First there \nwas a  skirmish on  the  grid when the  Clerk of the  Course \nwould not  let  mechanics help riders push-start the  bikes \nfor the  warm-up lap.  Lucchinelli shrugged and leaned \nthe  Ducati —  ‘You need at  least six  Italians to  start that \nthing’ —  against the  pit wall. Other riders made more \nvociferous protests until McLaughlin negotiated a truce \nby pointing out  to  officials the  cost of the  TV  cameras \naimed at them. More significantly, the  $100,000 \nguarantee that Sports Marketing was supposed to  have \npaid to the  FIM  before the  first race had  not  arrived. \nIt was, says McLaughlin, the  first inkling he  had  that \nsomething was wrong. \nBut  his efforts had  brought together an  interesting \ncast  of characters and  an  intriguing mix  of machinery. \nThe  Japanese factories stuck to their promise not  to \nfield works teams, and  the  smaller Italian manufacturers \nsaw a  chance to  grab the  limelight. Bimota didn’t even \nconsider defending their TT  F1  title, sacked their rider \nVirginio Ferrari and  sent out  a two-man team of ex-GP \ncrasher Stephane Mertens of Belgium and  Italian Davide \nTardozzi, whom many saw as  the  pre-season favourite. \nBimota’s YB4EI was within the  letter, if not  the  spirit, \nof the  technical laws; its beautifully crafted aluminium \nchassis made at  Bimota’s Rimini factory housed a  heavily \ntuned and  fuel-injected Yamaha FZ750 motor. Because \nof the  size  of the  company, the  homologation limit was \n200 units. Bimota said  that they’d made them, with the \nmajority going to  ‘Japanese collectors’, but  McLaughlin’s \nopinion was that Giuseppe Morri, Bimota’s boss, played \na very clever game and  never made anywhere near the \nrequired number of bikes. \nMost people thought that the  factory flouting the \nrules most flagrantly was Ducati. They fielded the  1981 \n500cc GP World Champion Marco Lucchinelli. It is an \nopen secret that the  first Ducati 851  that raced at the \nBol  d’Or in ‘87  was illegal under the  prevailing TT  F1 \nregulations in that it was well over the  750cc limit, \ndespite being billed as  a  750. The  Superbike paddock . \nsuspected that there were not  many more than the  two \nnew 851s at  Donington in existence, let alone the  200 \nrequired. McLaughlin was adamant that on a visit  to \nBologna he  personally counted 207  851s in production. \nTrue, it was after the  first homologation date, but  it was \nbefore the  second cut-off date, so  again there was no \ndoubt that Ducati were operating within the  spirit if not \nthe  absolute letter of the  law. \nThe  Japanese factories were represented by \ncomparatively low-profile operations. Embarrassingly, \nthe  aluminium-framed homologation special Yamaha, \nthe  FZ750R, was almost absent and the  quick Yamahas \nwere standard steel-framed FZs. The quickest of them \nwas piloted by a tiny  Italian, Fabrizio Pirovano, an  ex- \nmotocrosser with just a couple of seasons of road racing \nunder his  belt. Kawasaki and Suzuki were not  really in \nthe  frame; their GPX and GSX-R 750 sportsters were \nnot  readily adaptable to the  race track. The  American \nYoshimura Suzuki team of Doug Polen and Scott Gray, \nin  the  UK  for the  Eurolantic (née Transatlantic) Challenge \nthat was wrapped around the  first World Superbike \nmeeting, \ndid  \nnot  \nenter \nat  \nDonington. \nEven \nF1  \nace  \nand \nPrevious \nspread: \nFred \ntechnical wizard Anders Andersson of Sweden had Merkel and  the  Honda \nRC30, the combination \nproblems making the  1988 Slingshot CV  carbs work ihatwould-dominate Warld \non  his GSX-R.

Very few  American \nracers have been able to  cope with Europe's strange \nhabits, strange food and strange languages, but  Merkel \nremoved himself to  Italy, where he  restarted his  career in \nItaly's new Superbike Championship with help from local \nsponsor Oscar Rumi. \nCharisma is  a very over-used word and you  only really \nAbove: The  lettering on \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 13 \n\n\n\nunderstand what it is when you meet someone who \nhas  it, someone who walks into  a  crowded room and \nis instantly the  centre of everyone's attention. Merkel \nhad  it in spades. In  Italy he would send the  crowds \nwild with dare-devil riding, then, having won, march \nout  on  to the  track brandishing an  enormous Stars \n& Stripes at them, ignoring the  hail  of boos, whistles \nand more solid protests aimed at  him. To  describe him \nmerely as  Californian would be  guilty of the  wildest \nunderstatement. He  looked every inch the  surfer with \nhis long blond curls and  bandannas. His  riding style \nwas  wild and  he affected enormous knee-sliders that \ncovered most of his shins, which spent most of the  time \non  or  just above the  tarmac as  Fred slid  the  Honda in  a \nmanner that Europeans had  yet to come to terms with. \nFred was fast, Fred was glamorous, Fred was a Star, and \nlike  all Californians seemed to  know instinctively what \nto  say  when a  microphone was pointed at  hirn. And he \nwas keen to  remind any  commentator he could corner \nthat it was he,  Flyin’ Fred Merkel, who had  started \nthe  fashion for the  standing-on-the-pegs flag-waving \nair-punching slow-down-lap celebration, not  Kevin \nSchwantz. He  was just what Superbike needed. \nThe  struggle for the  title  was a  season-long war \nbetween the  speed of the  Bimotas and  the  consistency \nof Merkel and  the  Honda, with the  occasional significant \ninterruption. The  honour of winning the  first-ever World \nSuperbike race went to  Davide Tardozzi, but  for the  only \ntime in the  championship’s history the  results of the  two \nraces held each day were combined to  give an  overall \nwinner. Lucchinelli won the  second leg and, when \nTardozzi crashed while lying second, took the  overall \nvictory as  well. He  wasn’t that sympathetic to  his fellow- \ncountryman: ‘Tardozzi eez  a  square ‘ed,’ he announced \nto a  puzzled group of journalists, before adding, ‘First he \nfall  on  that side’, while theatrically striking the  left  side \nof his face, followed by a whack on  the  right side  and \n‘then he fall  on  that side!’ \nThe  two-race formula turned out  to  be a stroke of  . \ngenius. If a  rider crashed or  had  a  mechanical problem \nin the  first race, he  had  a chance to  redeem his day in \nthe  second. And the  Superbike guys didn’t have to  share \nthe  prize money, which was the  responsibility of the \norganising circuit, with too  many support-class racers. \nThe  paying public got value for  money, too  —  although \nin some places the  undercard was a little short on \nquality. Steve McLaughlin felt  that, with TV  in mind, \nthere was also  the  possibility of showing a  race on  either \nside  of an  F1  car  GP. \nThe first unexpected win came in  the  second race at \nHungary when, in front of a  massive crowd, Frenchman \nAdrien Morillas gave Kawasaki their first  World \nSuperbike win  on a steel-framed GPX750 prepared by \nendurance legends Godier-Genoud; he then survived an \namazingly petty protest from Bimota about the  shape \nof his bike’s seat. The  first  double came next time out \nat the  superfast Hockenheimring, where Tardozzi took \nboth wins as  Merkel’s Honda blew up  trying to  keep \npace. \nUnexpectedly, Suzuki took a win  in Japan, although it \nwas more down to  the  tactical nous of Gary Goodfellow \nthan the  bike. On  a  drying track the  expatriate New \nZealander riding under a  Canadian licence did  what \nbike racers very rarely do;  he  pitted to  change wheels \nThe  slick tyre he  put on  the  back of the  GSX-R enabled \nhim  to  hold off  Merkel and win. The second race saw a \nlittle bit of history, although no-one knew it at the  time. \n“he  race was stopped and restarted after an  oil  spill \nbought down a  bunch of riders, including the  leader, \nMarco Lucchinelli. At the  second time of asking the \nwinner was a  young Australian by the  name of Michael \nDoohan on  a  Yamaha. He’d been a  promising hotshot \nin domestic 250cc production racing and, in the  usual \nAussie racer production-line method, had  been picked \nup  by the  Yamaha importer’s Superbike team. It was \nthe  exact route travelled by Wayne Gardner and Kevin \nMagee, who'd also had  to  prove themselves in  Japan \nand  on  four-strokes before graduating to  500 GPs. The \nAustralian press was already predicting a stellar future \nfor  Doohan, although not  even the  most enthusiastic \nOcker could have realised just how good he'd be.  To \nslightly less  acclaim, a  quiet young Kiwi called Aaron \nSlight scored points in both races on  a  Bimota. \nLeft: Davide Tardozzi and \nthe  factory Bimota —  fast  but \nfallible. \nBelow: Marco Luccinelli and \nthe  new Ducati 851 brought \na  certain Latin something to \nSuperbike. \n\n16 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \n\nThe  speed of Tardozzi’s Bimota kept him  at the  head \nof the  championship table from Hockenheim onwards, \nwith one interruption from Pirovano, so  when the \nSuperbike paddock decamped to the  Antipodes for \nthe  last  two rounds in  Australia and New Zealand the \nItalian was odds-on for the  title, especially when Ducati \ndecided not  to  make the  trip. Ostensibly the  reason was \nlack of budget, but  as  they’d been able to  go to Japan \nthis  didn't ring quite true, especially as  Lucchinelli was \nstill  in with a chance of the  title. The  conspiracy theorists \nhad  an  explanation. They reckoned that the  Australian \nscrutineers, used to  policing the  ultra-strict regulations \nfor the  Castrol 6 Hours, the  world’s most important box- \nstock production race, would throw Ducati out. It was \ncommon knowledge that since the  Austrian round the \nfactory 851  was in fact an  888 thanks to  a 94mm bore. \nThis  was confirmed by the  capacity of the  Lucky Replica \nlaunched later in the  year at the  Cologne Show —  888cc. \nBut  in Japan the  Duke's motor was allegedly measured \nat 998cc; as  the  rules forbid altering the  motor’s stroke, \nthis  meant a  bore of 99.5mm, and the scrutineers would \nobviously have measured the  stroke to  calculate the \ncapacity. But, said the  men who'd worked on  eight- \nvalve Ducatis, you  can't bore the  standard barrels out \nto  99.5mm —  you'd be through the  metal and into  the \nwater jacket. \nAnd there was more. Ducati claimed that Lucky's \nbike weighed 152kg, but  Stefano Carrachi’s semi-works \nNCR 851, with its carbon-fibre bodywork and  titanium \nfasteners, tipped the  scales at  166kg. This, said the \nspecialists, meant weight must have been lost  from \nthe  motor, and  that meant magnesium castings, so  the \noriginal material had  been changed, again contrary to \nthe  regulations. This surreptitious development work \nwould probably have got  past the  scrutineers in most \ncountries, but  the  ultra-sharp Aussie scrutineers would \nhave spotted it a  mile off. \nDucati must have regretted their decision when \nTardozzi crashed in qualifying at Oran Park and  could . \nonly manage 10th and 11th in the  races. Merkel took a \nthird and  fourth to  close to within 2.5  points of Tardozzi \nand level with Pirovano. The  final round at  Manfeild \nPark was wet, stretching already taut nerves to  breaking \npoint. The coolest man was Fred Merkel, who won the \nfirst race from Pirovano, until then reckoned the  rain- \nmaster, with Tardozzi fifth. \nThe  track was drying for the  second race, the  worst \nof all circumstances. Merkel and Pirovano both went \nout  on  wets, while Tardozzi contrived to crash on  the \nwarm-up lap.  Much arm-waving followed as  the  Bimota \npeople tried to  get  Mertens off  his  bike to  give it to \nTardozzi. Mertens, who already knew that Bimota didn’t \nwant him  next year, was having none of it. The  track \ndried rapidly, and  to  add insult to  Bimota’s injury the \nBelgian, who'd gambled on  slicks, cleared off for the \nwin  as  Merkel wobbled round in  fifth. Pirovano lost \ntouch and in a  last  desperate throw of the  dice tried to \ndo a  Goodfellow and pitted for slicks. It was too  late. \nFred Merkel was the  first World Superbike Champion. \nThe question was, would there be another one? \nTop left: Kawasaki's first \nwinner: Adrien Morillas. \nBottom left: Suzuki's first \nwinner: Gary Goodfellow. \nBelow: Terry Rymer showed \nhis  promise with a  rostrum \nfinish in  Portugal on  a  very \nwell-used RC30. \nRight and above: Fabrizio \nPirovano and the  steel- \nframed Yamaha were \nsurprisingly competitive. \nWorld Superbikes: \nPema \nThe First 20  Years \n17 \n\nStephane Mertens, \nBimota’s other \nrider. \n1988 \nSEASON RESULTS \nRound 1 —  Great Britain \nDonington Park, 3 April \nRace 1 & 2, aggregate result \nMarco Lucchinelli, ta,  Ducati \nFred Merkel, USA, Honda \noey  Dunlop, GB,  Honda \nRoger Marshall, GB, Suzuki \nFabrizio Pirovano, Ita,  Yamaha \nKenny Irons, GB,  Honda \nari  Suhonen, Fin,  Yamaha \nAndy McGladdery, GB,  Suzuki \nSteve Williams, GB, Bimota \n10 ark  Farmer, GB, Suzuki \n11 Dave Leach, GB, Yamaha \n12 Tom Douglas, Can, Yamaha \n13.

The  first  year of the  new \nchampionship had  been a success. Superbike had \ntaken over from TT  F1  as  the  premier four-stroke \nchampionship thanks to  getting the  right mix  of men \nand machines on  to the  right circuits. TV  coverage had \nbeen good compared to  anything that had gone before, \nand  the  big Japanese factories were now starting to  take \nan  interest in supporting the  series. \nUnfortunately, the  single big series sponsor hadn't \nmaterialised, but talks with Japan’s largest advertising \nagency, Dentsu, had  looked promising —  not  least \nbecause all four major manufacturers were clients. \nBut  McLaughlin and  Jones didn't get the  chance to \ntry for the  big prize. The bosses at  Madison had  seen \nthe  best part of a  million pounds sterling spent on \nSuperbikes with no  sign yet of a  return. They decided \nthat enough was enough and  pulled the  plug, leaving \nthe  World Superbike Championship without an  organiser \nand  without TV  coverage. Just  six days before the  first \nround of the  year, Sports Marketing ceased trading. \nThe FIM’s Management Council was informed at  a \nmeeting on  Good Friday, three days before the  first race. \nThere seemed a very strong possibility that the  World \nSuperbike Championship would not  happen. \nOf immediate concern to  the  riders was the  promised \ntravel fund for the  top 25  riders of the  previous year. \nAny rider who'd planned his  season around the \nSuperbike Championship had  just  lost a major chunk \nof his guaranteed income and  was faced with the \nprospect of telling his sponsors that all the  TV  coverage \nthey'd been promised wouldn't be  happening. The \nFIM  guaranteed payments for  the  first round only, \nand  Joe  Zegwaard, President of the  FIM  Road Racing \nCommission, was deputed to  try and sort out  the  mess \nNot  that you’d have known that the  championship \nwas in  crisis from the  quantity and quality lined up  for \nthe  first round. Champion Merkel returned to  defend \nhis crown, but  with more backing from Honda head \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 21 \n\noffice than he’d enjoyed the  previous year. His  RC30 \ncame from HRC, the  Honda Racing Corporation, and \nwas  fielded by the  Italian Rumi team with some useful \nsponsorship from an  underwear manufacturer. The  only \nhelp Fred had  received the  previous year had  been an \nengine for the  Austrian round supplied not  by HRC but \nby Honda R&D (these distinctions are  important when \ndealing with something as  big as  the  Honda Motor \nCompany). That motor had  been slower than the  ones \nhis team built, as  was the  motor from the  same source \nsupplied to Virginio Ferrari, but  this  time Flyin’ Fred could \nexpect the  best kit available. \nThere was one big imponderable in  his  campaign, \nhowever —  his tyres. The  Rumi team of Merkel and \na  young Italian called Piergiorgio Bontempi had  an \nexclusive deal to  use  Pirellis. The  Italian tyre  company \nhad  always been a  big player in  the  supersport classes \nthat use  treaded road tyres, but  had never provided \nslicks for  a front runner at  World Championship level. \nOver in the  500 GPs, Pierfrancesco Chili was also using \nPirellis, but  both he and  Fred were on  their own trying \nto  develop their equipment while the  Michelin and \nDunlop factories had  years of experience and  feedback \nfrom all their teams. Looked at  optimistically, Fred \nhad  Pirelli’s undivided attention and  must therefore \nhave a  magic tyre. The  alternative view was that he \nwould be struggling with lack of experience and  an \nunderdeveloped product. The  analogy with Kenny \nRoberts's arrival on  the  GP  scene ten  years previously \nas  Goodyear’s only runner seemed a  good one. When \nKenny won his titles everyone assumed that his  tyres \nwere very special. Only later did  the  truth emerge \n\n—  they were usually awful. Fred, said the  paddock \nsages, would have similar problems. Peter Ingley, the \nvastly experienced tyre engineer brought in  by Pirelli \nto  run  their operation, maintained the  truth was, as \nusual, somewhere in  the  middle. ‘There was one track \n—  Canada —  where we  were at  a  definite disadvantage \nand  one  where we  were at  a  definite advantage.’ \nCrucially, neither Dunlop nor  Michelin were yet taking \nWorld Superbike seriously and, said Ingley, ‘By the  time \nMichelin hit the  panic button we  were on a roll.’ \nIngley also claimed to  have introduced the  true \nqualifying tyre to  bike racing in  1989. Some racers need \nto  set  pole position as  part of their psychological war \nwith the  opposition —  Merkel was one  of them —  while \nsome racers simply want to  be  on  the  front row. ‘! built \nMerkel a true one-lap qualifier and used the  tactic |’d \nobserved Senna using in  F1,  setting pole at  the  last \nmoment, leaving no  time for  anyone to  beat it.’  Merkel \ntook pole four times in  the  season, as  did  Ducati’s \nRaymond Roche, but  Fred also started from second \n—  usually behind local heroes in Australia or  the  States \n—  four times compared to  Raymond's twice. \nThere was more than one HRGsupplied RC30 on \nthe  grid. Stephane Mertens left  Bimota to  run  his own \nteam with ace  tuner Jean d’Hollander, another Belgian, \nfettling his  motors. But  the  lanky Belgian missed the  first \nrace of the  season after a  dreadful crash at  Brands Hatch \non  Good Friday during the  Eurolantic Challenge when \nhe tangled with Joey Dunlop at  Paddock Hill  Bend. \nCourageously, he  returned for  Round 2 in  Hungary, but \n7 \ni \ncouldn't race with the  front men and dropped more \nvital points. Dunlop came off  worse and, much to \nthe  displeasure of Irish fans who raked over Mertens’s \nreputation as  a  crasher, missed the  Isle  of  Man TT \nAt  Ducati, Marco Lucchinelli gave up  full-time \nriding and  instead managed the  team of ex-500 GP \nStar  and 1981 World Endurance Champion Raymond \nRoche with virtually unknown Baldassarre Monti as \nback-up. The Frenchman, now 32  years old, was a \nnotorious hard case —  even by the  standards of his  tough \nhome town of Toulon —  and also a  rider of proven \nworld class. His  major problem would be  the  lack of \nreliability that had  also plagued Lucchinelli the  previous \nyear. Not  only was the  851 a  new bike, but  the  use  of \nelectronic fuel injection was also new to  motorcycle \nracing applications and gave rise  to  many of the \nmechanical failures \nBimota suffered as  well, leading to  all  sorts of \nunlikely rumours, such as  the  Air  Traffic Control radar \nat  East Midlands Airport two miles up  the  road from \nDonington interfering with the  electronics. Which didn’t \nexplain why the  motors also stuttered on  tracks miles \nfrom airports. However, when the  Ducati kept going \nit was very, very fast. Fast enough for  Roche to  post \ndouble wins at the  two fastest tracks in  the  calendar, \nHockenheim and Brainerd —  it was the  shape of things \nto  come. \nBimota moved Tardozzi to  a  privateer team and \nsigned ex-GP privateer Fabio Biliotti, plus a  total \nunknown, an  ex-motocrosser with the  looks of an \nPrevious spread: Flyin’ \nFred Merkel at  the \nHungaroring. \nAbove left: The  riding style \nand celebrations were as \nvivid as  the  colour scheme: \nMerkel in  action. \nBelow left: Merkel’s crew \nsignal to  him that Mertens \nis out  and he  is World \nChampion again. \nBelow: Giancarlo Falappa \ngets a  good talking to  from \nhis  team. \n\nAbove: Falappa’s \nriding style was, er, \nunconventional. \nRight: Merkel and  team \nsize  up  the  opposition \n—  from pole position. \nangry bull  terrier —  Giancarlo Falappa. It was an  inspired \nsigning. Biliotti would fail  totally to  come to terms with \na  big four-stroke, while Falappa’s wild riding style would \nendear him  to fans everywhere, if not  his  competitors. \nBimota’s bikes were as  beautifully crafted as  ever and \nright on  the  four-cylinder bikes’ minimum weight limit \nof  165kg thanks to  lavish use  of carbon-fibre, but  the \nnew generation of Japanese machinery negated any \nadvantage that the  hand-built aluminium chassis used \nto  give. \nBoth Yamaha and  Kawasaki had  new bikes in the \nshowrooms, the  OW01 and ZXR/50R, homologated \nfor  Superbike racing with aluminium chassis, close- \nratio gearboxes and  —  vitally —  flat-slide carbs. Fabrizio \nPirovano got  an  OWO01 and sponsorship from the  Italian \nimporter, Anders Andersson deserted Suzuki for the \nfirst time in his career and  turned up  with a  beautifully \nprepared Yamaha with very trick Ohlins suspension, and \nyoung English hope Terry Rymer would do  most of the \nchampionship on  the  UK  importer’s Loctite-sponsored \nbike. Terry's season would be  interrupted by domestic \ncommitments and hampered by Dunlops that didn’t \nseem able to  last a World Championship-length race, \nbut  here at  last  was a  genuine championship hope for \nBritish fans to  get  behind. \n24 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nKawasaki didn’t have any  full-time challengers, \nbut  the  French endurance squad of Patrick Igoa and \nChristophe Bouheben put  in some useful rides at the \nbeginning of the  season, as  did  the  Kawasaki Australia \nduo of Rob Phillis and  Aaron Slight at the  end. Their \nmain problem was that the  ZXR homologation bike \nwas much more of a  roadster than a racer, certainly \ncompared to  the  Yamaha and  especially the  Honda, and \nneeded considerable development and a lot of weight \nto  be shed before it would be a competitive Superbike \nracer. Suzuki's French endurance team dabbled but  soon \nrealised that their GSXRs were still  less  than competitive. \nThey didn’t even contest their home round at  Circuit \nPaul Ricard. Suzuki got  a win, though, and again It was \nin Japan and in the  wet  where Doug Polen coped best \nwith monsoon conditions. \nBut  once again the  championship would be fought \nout  between a  hard core of regulars —  Merkel, Mertens, \nPirovano and Roche —  with the  local heroes confusing \nthings in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. \nDespite all the  political activity going on  behind the \nscenes, the  championship ran  smoothly. Joe  Zegwaard \nturned up  at  every race and  took a lot  of flak  for \na  situation that was not  of his  making. His  hostile \nreception was not  helped by the  fact that he’d been \n\nEs \n@ \nE \n\\ \n\nBelow: Robbie Phillis had \na very special Kawasaki for \nthe  last  two rounds: the \ntaped-up rear light shows it \nwas built for the  Suzuka \n8 Hour endurance race. \nBottom: Doug Polen’s first \nWorld Superbike win, in the \nrain in Japan. \none \nof \nthe  \nmain \nenemies \nof \nMcLaughlin, \nand  \ntherefore \nSuperbike, \nin the \nFIM’s \ninternal \npoliticking. \nThe big surprise of the  opening round at  Donington \nPark was Giancarlo Falappa on  the  Bimota. In  Race 1 \nhe  ran  with a  fraught bunch including Roger Burnett \n(on  a third HRC-supplied Honda RC30), eventual winner \nPirovano, Rymer and Merkel at the  front before tangling \nwith a  backmarker and dropping right down the  order, \nbut  not  before he thoroughly outraged most of the \nopposition. ‘Who's the  wanker on  the  Bimota?’ asked \nBurnett after the  race. ‘He  doesn’t know what he’s \ndoing —  he’s  got fuel  blowing on  his tyre  and  he doesn't \nknow why it’s  sliding!’ Falappa then won Race 2 and \nlooked almost composed, not  bad  for  his first meeting \noutside Italy. Photographs of him  in among other riders \nshow all the  bunch bar  one  leaning off the  bike to the \ninside of the  corner in the  usual fashion, but  Falappa is \nsitting almost upright pushing the  bike down into  the \ncorner motocross-style. Giancarlo smoothed his style out \n26 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \na  little without compromising his  aggression and  won \ntwo more races. He  also became a star. The  contrast \nbetween the  on-track psycho and  the  off-track teddy \nbear was wonderful. Asked if he was married to  his \ngirlfriend Paula, he searched his  English vocabulary and \nreplied, ‘We are  for  life  ...  she  is my  life.’ Only an  Italian \ncould have got away with a line  like  that. \nThe  other new star  was Terry Rymer, a gangling 22- \nyear-old South Londoner who'd performed wonders \nin  ‘88  on  a very standard RC30. As  one  of the  UK \nYamaha importer’s riders, his  priority was really the \ndomestic championship, so  as  well as  missing two World \nSuperbike rounds he  had  very little time for testing, and \nit showed. That and Dunlop's season-long problems \nconspired to  hold him  back, but  at  least he won a  race \nright at the  end  of the  season and  redeemed his year. \nDucati’s new boy Baldassarre Monti also shone, but  the \nfactory didn’t have a  bike for  him  at the  start of the  year \nand  didn’t send him  to Australia or  New Zealand. \nSuperbike’s first excursion to  its spiritual homeland, \nNorth America, was a success —  at  least with the  fans. \nRounds 3 and  4 were at  Mosport in Canada and \nBrainerd in the  USA, and  attracted 30,000 and  20,000 \nspectators respectively. But  the  barrier-lined Mosport \ntrack was obviously dangerous by the  standards to \nwhich the  European riders were accustomed. It is in \na  beautiful part of the  world, but  the  Armco barriers \nand  concrete walls that line  it caused the  regular \nriders to warn that they would expect some heavy \nmodifications if they were to  return the  following year. \nThe North American races also saw the  return to top- \nlevel competition of the  American ex-500 GP  star  Mike \nBaldwin on a private Bimota. With Biliotti yet to  score \na  point, the  paddock wondered if he was being lined \nup  as  a  replacement, and  when the  Italian quit before \nthe  Austrian round the  wondering was over. Baldwin \ncouldn't get to  Europe for Austria, but  made it for \nFrance and  the  rest  of Bimota’s season. With no  travel \nmoney available and  the  championship gone, Bimota did \nnot  go to the  final two rounds. \nUnbelievably, the  championship went down to  the \nwire again. Roche had  won most races but  had  also had \nhis  Ducati break down far too  often. This  time Merkel \nhad led  since the  second round with only one break \nwhen Mertens got  his  nose in front after Hockenheim, \nbut when they went to the  final two rounds in Australia \nand  New Zealand Flyin’ Fred led  by just two points. It \nwould be another test  of nerve, but  the  regulars would \nbe outshone in the  final two rounds by the  locals. The \nYamaha Australia team fielded Mike Dowson, already \na winner in Japan, and  their new hope Peter Goddard, \nwho had  won his first international race in Japan the \nprevious week, on  full  factory machines. Kawasaki flew \nin a full  factory bike from Japan for  Rob  Phillis who, \nwith team-mate Aaron Slight, was preparing for a full- \ntime assault on  the  championship in  1990. A promising \nyoung man called Daryl Beattie, the  Australian 250 \nchamp, was given an  RC30. Dowson and Goddard split \nthe  wins and legend has  it that the  latter’s win in  the \nfirst race on  a track that started wet  and  dried came \n\n*  «sib Be \nabout because the  team-manager simply decided to Above: Ducatis and  Hondas \nput one  of his  riders out  on  slicks and  the  other on lead  the charge into  the \nwets! Well behind the  locals, Mertens scored eighth and slalesliien \nfourth places compared to  Merkel’s eleventh and  fifth to \ngo top  of the  table by just three points. Right: Terry Rymer scored \nAnd  so  to  new  Zealand for the final  showdown. his debut win  in New \nQualifying hardly separated them: Merkel got the  pole graee Hee baie \nposition he needed for  his self-confidence, but  Mertens ° \nwas also on  the  front row. The  race was  wet  and  Terry \nRymer got the  holeshot and  pulled away from a pack of  — Below: Flyin’ Fred. \nfive  riders that included Merkel. Mertens started badly \nbut  easily forced his way up to  sixth when the  season \nwas  decided by a freak accident. On  lap 22  Mertens \nwas approaching Higgins Bend when his front wheel \nappeared to  lock up  and he crashed heavily, lucky to \nescape unscathed; the  bike meanwhile cleared the \ngravel trap and  went through a  row of trees before \nsmashing into  a  low  wall and  bursting into  flames. ‘For \ntwo laps before | felt  a vibration when | braked,’ said \nStephane, ‘and | nearly lost  the  bike at the  hairpin. | was \nbraking for the  bend just before the  back straight and \nthe  next thing | know | was on  the  ground. We  think the \nfront disc broke up  and locked the  wheel.’ \nThe  Belgian bravely climbed on  to  his spare bike \nfor the  second race and  won it by a  country mile, but \nMerkel, who had  stormed through to third in Race 1 \ndespite knowing Mertens was out, took third again and \nretained his championship —  Pirelli’s first at world level \n—  by the  meagre margin of seven points. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 27 \n\nMertens and \nMerkel face off \ndown under. \n1989 \nSEASON RESULTS \nRound 1 -  Great Britain \nDonington Park, 27  March, \nRace 1 \nFabrizio Pirovano, Ita,  Yamaha \nRoger Burnett, GB,  Honda \nTerry Rymer, GB,  Yamaha \nFred Merkel, USA, Honda \nThierry Crine, Fra,  Suzuki \nAnders Andersson, Swe, Yamaha \nCarl Fogarty, GB,  Honda \nBrian Morrison, GB,  Honda \nAndreas Hofmann, CH, Honda \n10 ‘Patrick Igoa, Fra,  Kawasaki \n11 Ernst Gschwender, Ger, Suzuki \n12 ark  Phillips, GB,  Yamaha \n13 ~+~Peter Rubatto, Ger, Bimota \n14 Hervé Moineau, Fra, Suzuki \n15.

Zegwaard says that he \nwas strung along for  nearly the  whole season without \ngetting a  firm answer from Japan. What he  didn’t \nknow was that Dentsu was embroiled in  negotiating \nthe  biggest TV  deal ever for the  rights to  the  Barcelona \nOlympics, so  a  little old  Superbike championship was \nway down their list  of  priorities. Of  course Zegwaard \ncouldn't let the  teams know about these negotiations, \nwhich meant that he  was still  the  target for  frustration \nwithin the  paddock. His  mood wasn’t helped when \nMcLaughlin made the  occasional appearance and was \ntreated like  a  visiting deity \nIn the  face of continued procrastination from Japan \n—  or  Zegwaard’s inability to  close the  deal, depending \non  who you talked to  —  the  FIM had to  make a  decision \nRight from the  first meeting after the  crash of Sports \nMarketing there had  been an  offer on  the  table fron \nthe  Flammini Group to  take over the  championship \nThere was also an  offer from McLaughlin in  partnership \nwith an  un-named Japanese backer, but  Zegwaard made \nit quite clear within the  FIM that this  offer would be \naccepted over his  dead body. After one last  plea to  his \nDentsu contact failed to  elicit a  decision, Zegwaard felt \nthat he  had to  recommend acceptance of the  Flammini \nGroup’s offer \nThis Italian concern, fronted by ex-Formula 3000 \ncar  racer Maurizio Flammini, already ran  Italian national \nraces plus several Grands Prix. They quickly put in  place \na  deal with Dentsu for  the  TV  rights and secured a  high \nprofile series sponsor, Diesel Jeans, thanks to  Francis \nBatta, later to  become Alstare team owner \nMcLaughlin, meanwhile, fetched up  in  Germany \nwhere he  started another Superbike series, the  Pro- \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 31 \n\nPrevious spread: Roche Right: Diesel Jeans turned \nand  the  Ducati team out  to  be  a  popular series \ncelebrate the  company’s sponsor ... \nfirst  Superbike World \nChampionship. Below right: No  team \norders at  Ducati! Falappa \nLeft: Practising for  dealing leans on  Roche. \nwith officialdom. \nSuperbike Championship. Ironically, he  had a lot of \nhelp from a TV  producer he  had  once thrown out  of \nthe  Hockenheim paddock for filming a  news item with \ntoo  many cameras. ‘That's not  a  news item, that’s a \nprogramme —  get the  **** out  of here; you're dealing \nwith CBS! They've got  more damn lawyers than there \nare  people in  Munich!’ Pro-Superbike was a  great \nsuccess thanks in no  small part to TV  coverage financed \nby the  large subscription that teams had  to  pay  to join \nthe  series. \nMcLaughlin took the  separation from his creation \nphilosophically —  outwardly at  least. There was one  time \nwhen he got  upset, though. An  American magazine \nprinted a feature on  the  most important men in the \ndevelopment of Superbike; they named Jim  France, \nDaytona track owner, as  the  most important, with \nMcLaughlin only fourth behind Kawasaki team boss Rob \nMuzzy. That one obviously rankled. \nFlammini built well on  the  foundations laid  over \nthe  first two years of World Superbike, and  the \nchampionship got  its first fully fledged Japanese \nworks team in the  shape of Rob Phillis and the  Shin- \nEtsu Kawasaki. Basically, the  Team Kawasaki Australia \noperation, which had  helped Rob to  sixth overall in \n1988 from just four rounds and  seen him  finish no  lower \nthan sixth in three events in ‘89, moved to  Germany \nfor the  season. Although in reality a  dedicated family \nman, outwardly Phillis was a very abrasive character, \nand  very much a  party animal —  with the  emphasis on \nanimal. He  was already 33  years old  with six Australian \nSuperbike Championships under his  belt, and here at  last \nwas the  chance of a crack at a world title  that he  had \nlonged for.  He  had  the  tools for the job:  a works ZXR \nwith fully kitted motor plus an  array of trick suspension, \nsix-piston brakes and lightweight parts that put  it bang \non  the  minimum weight limit for four-cylinder bikes. \nAt  last  Kawasaki had  a  competitive runner with a \nrealistic shot at the  championship, but  Phillis had  a  bad \ncrash at  Hockenheim, ironically bringing down fellow- \ncountryman Mal  Campbell in the  process, and didn’t \nmanage to win a race until the  penultimate round in \nAustralia, but  then promptly backed it up with a win in \nNew Zealand. \nThere were few  changes elsewhere to either men \nor  machines with the  significant exception of Bimota’s \nwithdrawal from the  championship, which gave \nDucati the  chance to  sign up  Giancarlo Falappa as \nRoche's team-mate. Monti moved to  Rumi as  Merkel’s \nunderstudy. Apart from Phillis, the  only other full-time \nnewcomer of note was experienced 500 GP  man Rob \nMcElnea alongside Terry Rymer in  the  Loctite Yamaha \nsquad, but  once again the  team would not  do  a \nfull  season as  they struggled to  cope with domestic \n\ncommitments alongside the  World Championship \nThe tyre situation got more interesting as  Michelin \nfavoured Phillis, Roche, Mertens and Pirovano with \ntheir A-grade tyres, Merkel stuck with Pirelli, and  the \nBritish Loctite Yamaha squad were the  only top-flight \nrunners on  Dunlop. Michelin were obviously taking the \nSuperbikes seriously now, and  their A-grade men ended \nup  as  the  top  four in  the  championship \nRaymond Roche's Ducati didn’t look very different \nfrom the  previous year’s model, but  one  significant new \ncharacteristic had  been built in  over the  winter: reliability \nHe  had  won more races than anyone else the  previous \nseason but  had  ended up  third in  the  championship, so \nRaymond made his wishes very clear before the  start of \nthe  1990 season, and  when Raymond made something \nclear there was very little option but  to  listen. In  ‘89  he \nhad  carried an  officious Canadian security guard on  the \nbonnet of his  hire  car  for  most of the  pit  lane, and this \nyear he  had  an  altercation with a  female marshal in  the \nUSA after he'd crashed in  qualifying. He  apologised to \nher  after the  meeting and presented her  with one  of his \ncrash helmets. This didn’t save him  from a  1000 Swiss \nfrancs fine imposed by the  FIM  jury, so  Raymond wrote \n‘Lam not  Roche-Child’ (as  in  Rothschild) on  another of \nhis  crash helmets. Interviewing him  after a  bad race was \nnot  a job journalists looked forward to.  After his  team- \nmate Falappa beat him  with a wild last-lap overtake at \nDonington, Raymond gave three one-word answers to \nthe  circuit’s commentator before the journalist gave up \nand  ran  away. \nThe Ducati’s reliability problems were all  down to \ntrivial factors, mainly electrical. Roche reckoned that they \n\note I VU AL \nith  \nNOVEMBER \n1990 \nee | Vring, GF   ee : \nastjo! ative, Wee \n; ‘   pisos 7 \nm \nij \nwe \nTop: A rostrum full  of happy \nAussies at  home.

His \nwasted. The Ducati only failed to  get \ntwice —  in  Germany, when he  blew t \nthe  last  race of the  year, when the  o \nNg  to  suffer another \nefforts weren't \nhim to  the  finish \nne  motor, and in \n| filter fell  off  —  but \nas  he’d secured the  title  with two cautious rides at  the \nprevious round it didn’t matter \nThe low  point of the  year was the  serious injury \nsuffered by Giancarlo Falappa in  qualifying for  the \nAustrian round on  his  return from breaking a  wrist in \nCanada. Ducati team-manager Marco Lucchinelli did  not \nwant him to  ride, but  Giancarlo was chasing pole-setter \nMertens’s blistering time with just a few minutes of final \nee ale \nii Ky  ‘ o tas! \n; 1a ‘ ‘oat ote = RELA oe a \nqualifying left  when he went down in  the  very  fast  left- ere gti te  Pitas Bape he  og \nhand kink at  the  top of the  circuit, hit the  200-metre wats Sc sak ek \nboard and, in the  words of a shocked Rob  McElnea, age Re Ne os \n4 \n‘Lay there in  a  big  **** heap’, with his  legs bent up \nunder his  back. He’d broken both femurs, shattered his \nleft  shoulder blade with accompanying muscle damage, \nand  rebroken his  left  wrist. Davide Tardozzi had  been \nfirst on  the  scene and may have saved Falappa from \nstrangulation by his  helmet strap. Like all  other witnesses \nto  the  accident, Tardozzi was very shaken; he was still \nmuttering ‘Stupido, stupido!’ to  himself in  the  paddo \nas  Falappa was helicoptered to  hospital and  out  of th \n1990 World Superbike Championship. \nHis  team-mate Roche's view was that It was simply a \nmatter of experience. ‘The problem with a young rider \nlike  Falappa is he crashes because he says “I want to  be \nin front”, but  thinks “I want to  be  in  front immediately”.’ \nReminded of his own wild youth, Raymond would say, \n‘Lam an  old  man now, | don’t want to  crash.’ His  views \non  the  rest  of the  opposition were also enlightening. \nMerkel and Phillis were ‘good riders’, as  was Mertens \nwho was also ‘very aggressive’. McEInea was ‘very fast’ \nand  so  was Pirovano, but  only for ten  laps. The  rest  of \nthe  grid wasn’t very fond of Fabrizio either; the  little \nItalian was the  usual culprit when the  racing became a \ncontact sport. Stephane Mertens’s team felt  aggrieved \nenough after a  coming together in  Australia, which \ncaused their rider to  crash, to  put in  an  official protest \nBut  Roche reserved the  description ‘completely crazy’ for \nBaldassarre Monti. \nRoche embodied some of the  schizophrenia of \nthe  Superbike World Championship itself. He  was in \nthe  veteran class with a  distinguished 500 Grand Prix \ncareer behind him. He  was good enough to  be third in \nthe  World Championship in  1984 but  he  never won a \nGP,  and  that always rankled. He  approached racing In \nSuperbike as  a job, and his  heart was obviously still  with \nthe  500s, but  he was realistic: ‘It’s  better to  have a  good \nbike in  Superbike than a  slow one in  GPs.’ Neither was \nhe very impressed with the  disjointed calendar or  the \nlack  of adjustability on  his  bike: ‘With Superbikes, after \ntyres, suspension, that’s it.’ \nNevertheless, Roche was obviously more motivated \nthan he’d been in  1989. His  win at  the  Hungaroring \nand getting pole at  Sugo, both circuits to  which the \nDucati was unsuited, were, for  him, the highlights of  the \n\n\n\nyear. ‘When | drive the  first laps at  Sugo | say  “Ooooh | \ncannot win\", but  we  work a  very long time and we  try \nto  set.’ It was the  same in  Hungary, where some more \nhard work on  suspension settings, gearing and tyres \ngave Raymond the  chance to  win. \nAgainst that there were cases when the  motorcycle \nsimply worked from the  beginning. ‘In  Spain | have only \nseven laps practice and pole position.’ The main problem \nwas the \ndifficulty of changing the  888 Ducati’s internal \ngear ratios. Because the  bike didn't have a  quick-change \ncluster gearbox, the  team would change the  whole \nengine, not  just  the  gears, choosing from one of three \nengine/gearbox combinations taken to  each meeting \nRoche a \nso  preferred to  use  taller gearing, because a \nbigger rear sprocket would have an  effect on  the  rear \nSuspens \non, and so  condemned himself to  slow starts \nBut  it worked and Raymond would admit that the  bike \nwas the \nbest out  there, although he  was worried about \nKawasaki's new ZXR/50R. \n‘Now | think Ducati has  a  small advantage because \nthe  eng \ndrive. If they don’t do  something with the  bike then they \nne  is  very fast but  the  frame is  very difficult to \nwill  be  ruined when the  Japanese make their changes.’ \nThe problems were all  due to  the engine, which was \nvery long and therefore dictated a  long wheelbase and \nheavy, slow steering, but there was very little chance of \nDucati changing their hallmark V-twin motor \nAs  tt \nworry — \nturned out, Raymond really did  not  need to \nwell, not  about Ducati’s ability to  win, anyway \nLeft: Giancarlo Falappa just \nbefore his  near-fatal crash \nAbove: Rymer saved the \nbest to  last  again, winning \nin  New Zealand. \nNSE Caper ee \nmem \nBelow: Roche had an \naltercation with a  lady \nmarshal after a  practice \ncrash at  Brainerd.

But  what \nhappened in  1991 threw into stark relief the  inherent \nproblems of the  Superbike class. \nWhat happened was Doug Polen and the  Fast by \nFerraccl 888 Ducati. \nThe  Texan's domination was utter and  total —  he \nwrapped the  title up  with five races to  spare, and up \nto  then had only been beaten once in  a  straight fight \nwhen he  had no  machinery problems. Polen had  a \nworks Ducati 888 but  he  didn’t ride for the  factory \nteam. Instead, the  veteran Italian-American tuner Eraldo \nFerracci prepared his  bikes to  great effect, Dunlop \nproduced a steady flow of new tyres that Polen seemed \nto  be  able to  assess and use  instantly, and —  last  but  not \nleast —  he  rode brilliantly. From the  12  rounds and 24 \nraces (excluding the  Canadian round that was boycotted \nby all  the  regular riders on  safety grounds), Polen was \non  pole an  astounding ten  times, and wasn’t lower than \npole position on  the  grid until the 11th round when Rob \nPhillis went faster at  Magny-Cours. Doug set  the  fastest \nlap of the  day  14  times and  won 17  races, including no \nfewer than six  double wins. No-one has  yet  managed to \nbetter those marks for  a  season's racing \nIt was also the  first example of  a phenomenon \nthat would crop up  regularly in  the  future, that of  a \nnominally private Ducati often being quicker than the \nfactory bikes. Ferracci’s rider Jamie James had  gone we \nin  the  USA the  previous year and showed well in  the \nNorth American rounds of  the  World Championship, \nPolen’s style could sometimes \nlook awkward, but  in  1991 it was \noverwhelmingly effective. \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 41 \n\nRight: Doug and  Dianne \nPolen —  note her  name on \nthe  sleeve of his  leathers. \nAbove: Giancarlo Falappa \nmade a welcome return \nafter injury, but  he was \nnot  yet back to  his fighting \nweight. \nBelow: Hockenheim: \nPirovano hits  the  deck, \nFalappa takes to the \ngrass, Mertens carries on \nregardless. Shortly after this, \nFabrizio hit a  marshal. \nand  for  his  1991 campaign he  linked up with two Italian \nex-works mechanics, Giorgio Nepoti and Rino Carrachi, \nwhose tuning firm Scuderia NCR (literally Team Nepoti \nCarrachi Racing) had  built the  factory's racers since the \nmid-1970s in their Bologna workshop a stone’s throw \nfrom Ducati’s factory. Their endurance racers, based on \nthe  original 900SS, were works of art,  but  the  bike of \ntheirs that everyone remembers is the  one on  which \nMike Hailwood made his  legendary comeback to the \nIsle  of Man TT  in  1978, which was prepared by Steve \nWynne of the  British company Sports Motorcycles. \nThis event was as  significant for the  fortunes of the \nfactory as  Paul Smart's Imola 200 win  in  1972 on  the \nfirst-ever racing Ducati V-twin, for  more than any  other \ncompany Ducati’s commercial fortunes were always \ninextricably linked with their racing success. Incidentally, \nthere was another British rider on  an  NCR-built, Sports \nMotorcycles-prepared Ducati: one George Fogarty, who \nhappened to  have a young son  named Carl. The  firm's \nWorld Superbike Championship successes would push \nsales of their road bikes to  undreamed-of levels. \nPolen’s domination was underlined by the \nperformances of the  other factory Ducatis, which, now \ndown on  or  very near the  class's 140kg minimum weight \nlimit for twins, won every race that Polen didn’t until ex- \nGP  star Kevin Magee popped up on  a factory Yamaha in \nAustralia. They also set  the  fastest laps that Polen missed \nout  on  (although Aaron Slight shared that honour at \nthe  Australian round on  a  Kawasaki). Raymond Roche \ngot the  only other double win  that anyone managed \nin  1991, in Malaysia, but the  man who beat Polen in a \nstraight fight was Stephane Mertens, who'd abandoned \nhis  Honda RC30 for a factory Ducati and  Pirelli tyres. \nThis was the  year when Superbike racing became like \nmost other forms of road racing, in that any  rider, no \nmatter how gifted, had  to  have a factory bike to win. \nAnd not just any  factory bike, but  the  right factory bike. \nThe  statistics show that you  needed a  Ducati, despite \nRobbie Phillis’s heroic efforts to  keep on  terms with \nthe  very promising ZXR75OR. The  Aussie, now 35 years \nold, managed to  beat the  other Ducatis fairly regularly, \nespecially towards the  end  of the year as  the  bike got \nmore trick bits, but  he  rarely bothered Polen. \nIt could have been worse —  he could have been on  a \nworks Honda or  Yamaha. Even Fred Merkel struggled; \nhe only got on  the  rostrum once all year, as  it became \nclear that the  RC30 was now very long in the  tooth. \nAgainst all expectations, Carl Fogarty ended up  as  top \nHonda rider after a season of consistent top-ten finishes \nand  no  crashes; his one  DNF was  the  result of a  broken \ngear linkage. This did  not  fit with Foggy’s (undeserved) \nreputation as  a crasher and  machine-breaker, and  the \nfact  that he was riding for the  Honda Britain team on \nrelatively standard machinery and  had  real  problems \nwith front suspension set-up made his season all the \nmore praiseworthy. The  career of his team-mate and \nfriend James Whitham was nearly ended by the front- \nend  problems he suffered. \nThe  highlight of Fabrizio Pirovano’s Yamaha year was \npunching a  German marshal about twice his size  when \nhe attempted to  dissuade the  diminutive Italian from \nrestarting after a crash. On  the  race track he  managed \n\n\n\nAbove: Blast-off at \nDonington. The  front row \nis Polen (53), Roche (1), \nMonti (8),  Rymer (7) and \nMerkel (27); the  second \nrow is Phillis (4), Pirovano \n(2),  McElnea (19). \nRight: Stephane Mertens \nenjoyed his first  year on  a \nDucati. \nBelow: Fabrizio Pirovano \nseen through the  armco. \nonly one second place and  three thirds. \nThere was one  new machine on  the  grid, Bimota’s \nhub-centre-steered Tesi  with Ducati V-twin power, but \nit didn’t make much of an  impression. The  Zimbabwean \nRussell Wood was its regular pilot, although the  British \nprivateer Steve Manley was in the  saddle at  Round 1 \nand  scored a World Championship point for  15th in the \nbike’s first  World Championship race. \nPolen’s flying start to  the  season was aided and \nabetted by Dunlop, who took the  Superbikes very \nseriously right from the  start of the  year. Michelin, who \nshod the  works Ducatis of Roche and Falappa, again \ntook too  long to fully commit the  resources needed \nee \n44 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nto  fight for the  title. Pirelli's new tie-up with Stephane \nMertens bore fruit with a win  in the  second race of \nthe  first  round, but  it was  significant that the  Belgian \ncrashed in the  first race trying to  keep up with Polen. \nEqually significantly, Roche hurt himself in a qualifying \ncrash trying to  match the  Texan's time, and  would do \nSO  again at  Round 3. The  pattern was set  that early. \nThe  other factory Ducati rider, Giancarlo Falappa, was \nstill  recovering from his Austrian crash the  previous \nseason, and  was not a realistic candidate for victory. \nMost teams wouldn't have given a  man in his condition \na factory bike, but  the  Ducati team likes to  think of itself \nas  a family and  this  was a way of helping a  much-loved \nfamily member get  better. \nWith hindsight it is now possible to  say  that Kevin \nMagee’s races in Japan and  Australia were significant \nevents in the  Superbike World Championship. Here was \na  man who had  won a  500 Grand Prix  appearing in the \nnew championship, the  first  GP  winner to  do so  after \nLucchinelli. He  was obviously fully recovered from the \nserious head injuries that had  curtailed his  GP  career, \nand he was anxious to  prove a  point or  two. In Japan he \ngot on  the  rostrum just once, with third in  the  second \nrace, so  those Superbike regulars couldn't be that \nshabby, could they? In Australia he won one race, as  we \nnow expected the  locals to  do,  but  lost  the  second to \nPolen. Another landmark: the  first win  for  a  foreigner in \nan  Australian round of World Superbike, and more proof \nof just  how quick Doug Polen was. \nPolen’s domination brought the  issue of the \nSuperbike formula to  a  head. Right at the  birth of the \n\nexay \nbeeen \nvent \n\nTop: Robbie Phillis and  the \nKawasaki threatened Ducati \ndomination late in the \nseason. \nAbove and right: The \nreasons why the  regular \nchampionship contenders \ndidn’t enter for  Mosport \nwere terribly obvious —  and \nvery close to  the  track. \n& i Nl \nsiaahelal \nPa \nclass, the  regulations had  been skewed to encourage \nsmaller manufacturers —  and  back then Ducati was a \nvery small manufacturer —  to  go  racing. How can  you \ncomplain, said  the  Italians, when we  try harder and \nbuild a good bike; if V-twins have such an  advantage \nyou  should build one  too. The  Japanese camp didn't \nquite see  it like  that. To them the  double whammy of \nthe  capacity advantage and  the  25kg minimum weight \ndifference was simply unfair, and it wasn’t just a  matter \nof top  speed. Well, they would say  that, wouldn't they, \nbut  it was most definitely a fact  that you  needed a \nworks Ducati to win. Even a  good private 888 couldn't \nget  near the  carbon-fibre-bedecked Fast by Ferracci or \nLucchinelli bikes. The  Ducati’s lighter weight allowed its \nriders to  brake later for corners and  give their tyres an \neasier time than the  four-cylinder guys, while the  extra \ncapacity and  the  nature of the  big twin motor launched \nthe  bike out  of low  and medium speed corners on  a \nwave of mid-range power and  torque as  if it had  been \n46 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nfired from a  gun. This was the  route to works bike \ndomination that had  led  to  a  crisis of sorts in  the  500 \nGP  class, and  while there was no  doubt that Ducati \nwere doing nothing against the  letter of the  law, there \nwere grounds for  worrying about the  future viability of \nthe  class. \nSome years later Steve McLaughlin had  an  interesting \ninsight into  the  minimum weight differential. He  said \nunequivocally that it was a sop  to  Ducati to  get them \nto  commit to  Superbike. However, the  way he wrote \nthe  first set  of rules the  differential was 25  pounds, and \nsomewhere along the  way to the  FIM’s headquarters in \nSwitzerland pounds got turned into kilograms without \nbeing divided by any  conversion factor. What was \nmeant to  be a token gesture was turned into  a  major \nadvantage for the  V-twins. \nThere were also the  perennial worries about some \nof the  venues and  the  gappy, disjointed calendar. The \nfirst of these problems came to  a  head at  Mosport \nPark in Canada where improvements for which the \nregular riders and  teams had  asked had not  been done. \nThe  track had  always been dangerous and  over the \nprevious two years improvements had  been requested \nand  carried out. But  this  time, in a  display of unanimity \nunusual for  motorcycle racers, the  event was boycotted, \nwhich is why the  names Pascal Picotte and  Tom Kipp \nappear on  the  roll  of World Superbike race winners. \nAlong with the  cancellation for the  third time running \nof the  Brazilian round, this  avoidable situation appeared \nto  be totally ignored by Joe  Zegwaard and  the  FIM, \nwhich was now doing its best to  pretend that Superbike \ndidn’t exist. But  the  vast majority of the  paddock was \npreoccupied with what to  do about Polen and Ducati if \nthe  combination returned for  1992. \nDoug Polen and his wife Dianne appeared to  lead a \nblameless life:  they donated money to  their local police \nforce to  help them buy mountain bikes for chasing \ndrug dealers (honest), and  they were both always more \nthan happy to talk  to the  media. In fact, the  problem \nwasn't getting Doug to talk, but  to  stop him. Behind \nthis  squeaky-clean facade there was a very astute \nbusinessman as  well as  a calculating racer. He’d always \nraced in classes that paid the  best, and had  banked a \nlarge amount of Suzuki contingency money for winning \none-make series races on  that company’s GSX-R/50 \nand 1100s. He’d then gone to Japan to  race Yoshimura \nSuzukis, effectively works bikes, and  won both the  TT \nF1  and  F3  (400cc) titles, the  first  time anyone had  won \nboth —  and a foreigner as  well! There was also the  small \nmatter of  a World Superbike Championship race win. \nAnd all this  after he’d missed almost a whole season \nin the  late  ‘80s when a gory accident at  an  American \nchampionship race tangled his  foot with the  rear chain \nand sprocket and he  lost  all the  toes from it. \nNot  only couldn’t they cope with him  on  the  track, \nbut  he also wasn’t the  usual Superbike rider off  it. After \nthe  buccaneering Merkel and  the  tough-as-nails Roche, \nwhat do you  make of a  guy  who races with his  name \non  one  sleeve of his  leathers and  his wife Dianne’s name \non  the  other? \n\nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 47 \n\n1991 \nSEASON RESULTS \nRound 1 -  Great Britain \nDonington Park, 1 April \nRace 1 \nDoug Polen, USA, Ducati \nTerry Rymer, GB,  Yamaha \nFabrizio Pirovano, Ita,  Yamaha \nRob Phillis, Aus, Kawasaki \nRob McElnea, GB,  Yamaha \nBrian Morrison, GB, Yamaha \nNiall Mackenzie, GB,  Honda \nRay  Stringer, GB,  Yamaha \nJeffry de Vries, NI,  Yamaha \n10 John Reynolds, GB,  Kawasaki \n11.

The \npersonnel were much the  same as  the  previous year, \nas  was the  machinery. And the  result was the  same, too, \nalthough Doug Polen had  to  work a  lot  harder to  retain \nhis title  than he  did  to  win  it. \nThe  most noticeable absentee wasn’t a  rider, but  a \nteam-manager. Marco Lucchinelli had been caught in \npossession of a  substantial quantity of cocaine in  1991 \nand  was now behind bars, so  the  Ducati teamsters \nhad  to  be  reshuffled. Doug Polen was now part of the \nofficial factory team alongside the  almost completely \nrecovered Giancarlo Falappa, with another ex-500 GP \nWorld Champion, Franco Uncini, as  team-manager. \nRaymond Roche ran  his own bike on  Michelins and  a \nshoestring budget, while Mertens and  the  Spanish rider \nDaniel Amatriain got full  factory bikes. Davide Tardozzi \nalso got factory equipment, but  he was usually acting as \ntest pilot for  development parts. \nAs  usual, Ducati built a small number of 888 Corsa \nreplicas of the  previous year’s works bike for  sale  to \nprivateers, but  unusually they were only 7kg  heavier \nthan the  new works bikes and  very competitive. Both \nthe  factory bikes and  the  Corsas retained the  1991 \nframe and bodywork —  it was obvious that the  888 \nwas approaching the  end of its  development life. \nThe question was, could the  Japanese factories take \nadvantage? \nHonda certainly couldn't. The RC30 was now well \npast It, but  Team Rumi soldiered on  with Baldassarre \nMonti on  what was essentially Fred Merkel’s bike from \nthe  previous season. Merkel himself surfaced in  the \nnew factory Yamaha team alongside Pirovano run  by \nBYRD, the  racing arm of Belgarda, the  Italian importer \nHowever, a  testing crash shattered his  heel and put  him \non  the  sidelines for  most of the  year \nSuzuki had  a  new bike, the  GSX-R750WN, cooled \nby water rather than oil,  but  it was handicapped by \nthe  Slingshot carburettors fitted to  the  road-going \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 51 \n\n\n\nhomologation version. The French rider Hervé Moineau, \nfour times World Endurance Champion, put  in  some \nsolid rides on  it, but  never looked like  getting on  the \nrostrum. \nOnce again the  Japanese challenge was left to \nKawasaki, and  again the  only man who regularly got \nin among the  ruling Ducatis was the  indomitable Rob \nPhillis, although Pirovano underlined his  rain-master \nreputation with a  double at a very wet Monza. But \nit was Phillis’s team-mate Aaron Slight who won the \nopening race in Spain on  the  newly and  appropriately \nnamed Moving Kawasaki. \nFive  rounds into  the  year, Phillis was leading the \nchampionship thanks to wins at  Spa and  Jarama \nand  solid points-scoring finishes everywhere else. \nUnfortunately, this  splendid form rather undermined \nhis argument that the  Ducatis had  an  unfair advantage. \nLater in the  season, when he was again holding forth in \nhis caravan on  the  injustices of the  regulations, his wife \nCarol casually remarked, ‘You didn't say  that when you \nwere leading the  championship...’ Ouch. \nPhillis’s motivation wasn’t helped when news leaked \nout  at the  last  European race of the  season that his \nservices would not  be  required on  the  works team next \nyear, but  he still  finished third in the  championship and \nprevented a  Ducati clean sweep of the  top  three places. \nAs  usual, Rob  fought to the  end  —  the  adjective ‘gritty’ \ncould have been coined just for  him  —  but this  was the \nend  of his full-time World Superbike career. His  role  in \nestablishing the  credibility of the  series should not  be \nunderestimated, but  if the  World Championship had \ncome about when he was in  his  twenties instead of \nhis  mid-thirties, history —  and the  record books outside \nAustralia, where he will  always be  a  hero —  might have \nbeen a little different. \nOne works Ducati rider didn’t do  himself justice \n—  Stephane Mertens. For  the  first  time in  the  history of \nthe  championship he  didn’t score a  race win and ended \na  lowly seventh. The lanky Belgian had  been second, \nthird and  fourth in  the  championship in  the  previous \nthree years, but  now it appeared that his  challenge \nwas over. He  was always a fearsome competitor on  the \nfast  tracks, but  his  introverted nature meant that this \nvery likeable racer never stamped his  personality on  the \nchampionship. \nDoug Polen didn’t score a victory until the  first race \nof Round 3, at  Hockenheim, but  he  made up for  lost \ntime with a  double and  went joint top  of the  points \ntable with Roche. This wasn’t going to  be easy. Other \nriders, notably his team-mate Falappa, used Dunlop- \nshod Ducatis to their full  potential. Roche stayed injury \nfree, benefited from Michelin's increased interest in the \nchampionship, and his  bike was the  quickest thing out \nthere. This was another case of the  non-factory-tuned \nDucati being quickest thanks to the  attentions of tuner \nRolando Simoneti, whereas the  factory squad wasn't \nallowed to  interfere with their motors. \nPolen didn’t just have trouble in the  World \nPrevious spread: Polen’s \nstyle was still  strange, but \nhe was still  quick as  well. \nLeft: Number one  again. \nBelow: Polen leads the \nplunge down to  Eau  Rouge \nat  Spa, followed by Pirovano \nand Russell. \n\n\n\nChampionship \n—  \nhis \ncampaign \nback \nhome \nin  \nthe \nLeft  \nand  \nabove: \nScott \nBelow: \nKevin \nMagee \nturned \nStates \nwas \ndogged \nby \na \nnew \nstar, \nan \nintense, \nlanky \nRussell \nonly \ndid \nfour \nup \nlate \nin \nthe \nseason \nto \ngive \nyoung man  called Scott Russell who'd beaten Polen at rounds but he  made a  big Yamaha a win  in Australia. \n: : impression. \nDaytona and  would eventually beat him  in  the  American \nChampionship. Russell, who'd been lured away from \nthe  American Yoshimura Suzuki team by Kawasaki team \nowner Rob Muzzy, returned home after just  four rounds \nof the  World Championship, but  the  paddock had  seen \nenough to  know that here was a  new star. \nRussell was on  the  rostrum twice at  Donington \nPark in  the  UK,  the  second round of the  season, but \nnot  too  many people noticed because another relative \nyoungster, Carl Fogarty, announced to  the  world outside \nof British closed-road racing that he would be a force \nto  be  reckoned with. Desperately short of money and \nconsidering giving up  the  Ducati 888 Corsa that his \nfamily was helping to  finance, Fogarty fell  while leading \nthe  first race, then won the  second going away. Here \nwas proof that a  privateer could still  win  a  World \nSuperbike Championship race on  an  over-the-counter \ncustomer bike. \nIt was the  first act  in  a year of miracles for  Fogarty \nthat would see  him set  an  Isle  of Man TT  lap record \nwhich would stand for  many years and win the  World \nEndurance Championship with Terry Rymer. He  got  on \na  Superbike rostrum once more, at  Assen, a  circuit he \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 55 \n\nhad dominated in  TT  F1  competition and would come to \ndominate in  Superbike, but  his  record of six  mechanical \nfailures shows how difficult and expensive it was to  keep \na  private Ducati on  the  track. Nevertheless, that debut \nwin at  Donington was the turning point in  the career \nof the  racer who would go  on  to  beat many of Doug \nPolen’s records. \nDonington was an  emotional moment for  Fogarty, \nhis  family and British bike fans in general. But  for the \nSuperbike paddock the  most emotional moment of the \nyear was Giancarlo Falappa’s double win in  Austria at \nthe  Zeltweg track where he  had  been so  badly injured \nin  1990. They were also his first wins since the  accident, \nand  the  Italian would be an  ever more formidable \nopponent through the  second half  of the  season, as  not \njust  his  race fitness but  also his  confidence returned. \nAmazingly, he  still  had  all  his  old  aggression, but  it was \nnow tempered with precision and tactical awareness. \nHis  fans were more than glad to  see  that the  trademark \nstanding wheelie was still  in his  slow-down-lap \nrepertoire, though. \nDoug Polen’s slow start to the  season was mainly \ndown to a lack  of winter testing. He  didn’t sit on  the \nbike until Daytona in  March, by which time the  Kawasaki \nteams had  done a  good deal of testing. Although his \nDucati was basically the  1991 bike with new suspension, \nit still  took a  lot of time to  get dialled in; the  double win \nin Hockenheim was the  turn-around point for  his  season \nand  came about when Doug reverted to  his  1991 \nsettings. Not  long before he’d won his first race of the \nyear, an  American Championship round, he  had  made \nmassive changes in one  hit —  ‘16  clicks on  that, 24  clicks \n\nLeft: Polen wasn't riding Right: Carl Fogarty \nfor  Ferracci in  1992 but  the impressed everyone on  his \nItalian-American still  tuned private Ducati. \nhis  bike. \nAbove: Fogarty’s debut \nBelow left: Rob Phillis got World Superbike win \na  new team-mate for  1992, came on  home ground at \nAaron Slight. Donington —  Roche \nand  Russell shared the \nvictory lap. \non  that’ —  and  they worked. It was  the  first  time \nall year that the  bike had  been anywhere near \nright, and  in typically nerveless style he then \nhunted down early-season leaders Roche and \nPhillis to  retain his championship at the  last \nround in New Zealand. \nHe  went there with a 26-point lead \nover the  Frenchman, quite enough to  cruise \nround and  let Roche win. But  he didn't —  he \nwon the  first race with Roche back in  third and \nequalled Fred Merkel’s achievement of retaining the \nchampionship. He  also scotched any  ideas that his \nfirst  title  had  been won purely because he  had  a \nsuperior machine or  that he was simply a  mercenary \nriding for the  money and not  prepared to  step close \nto the  edge. He  could go  back to  the  States for a \nyear safe in the  knowledge that the  marks he  had  set \nwould take a  long time to  be surpassed. \nAs  for the  championship, it hadn't really progressed. \nThe riders’ elected representatives, Polen and Phillis, \nweren't at  all  happy with some of the  tracks on  which \nthey had  to  race, notably Monza, where a concrete \nwall just  20  feet  from the  edge of a  150mph corner \nwas a  disaster waiting to  happen. Surprisingly, Spa- \nFrancorchamps didn’t come in  for  too  much criticism, \nalthough it had  long since been abandoned by the  GPs \nas  too  dangerous. This stagnation in  the  championship \n—  no  new bikes, no  new riders, no  new sponsors —  didn’t \nmatter too  much because the  GPs  were in  the  throes \nof their Bernie Ecclestone/Dorna/IRTA revolution and \nall the  critical analysis was focused on  the  500 class. \nBut  Superbike’s easy ride  with the  fans and  media was \ncoming to  an  end —  it had  to  shape up  quick or  go  the \nway of F750. \n\nBelow: Polen and \nthe  team crowned \nchampions for \nthe  second year \nrunning. \n1992 \nSEASON RESULTS \nRound 1 -  span \nAlbacete, 5 Apri \nRace 1 \nAaron Slight, NZ,  Kawasaki \n] \n2 Doug Polen, USA, Ducati \n3 Fabrizio Pirovano, Ita,  Yamaha \n4 Giancarlo Falappa, Ita,  Ducati \n5 Daniel Amatriain, Spa, Ducati \n6 Baldassarre Monti, lta,  Honda \n7 Raymond Roche, Fra,  Ducati \n8 Takahiro Sohwa, Jap, Kawasaki \n9 Rob Phillis, Aus, Kawasaki \n10 uan Lopez Mella, Spa, Honda \n11.

Most worrying of all,  TV  coverage \nhad been patchy, but  Dentsu’s three-year contract was \nnow over and the  Flammini Group took the  brave step \nof guaranteeing coverage of every round. Up to  now, \na  race only got  on  air  if a  local TV  station decided to \ncover it and provide a  so-called world feed for  stations \nin  other countries. This meant that there were gaps in \nthe  coverage, a  major disadvantage when trying to  sell \ncoverage of the  whole title race. Imagine not  being able \nto  watch a  couple of rounds of the  car  F1  championship \nbecause, say,  Hungarian TV  didn't have the  budget to \ncover the  race. Flammini now took the  decision to  put  in \ntheir own crews if they couldn't contract a  local station \nto  be  host broadcaster. The championship could now \nguarantee consistent coverage and the improvement \nwas instant and impressive \nOf  course these things don’t happen overnight; they \nwere the  result of a  lot  of work over the  preceding \nmonths and  years, which helped to  explain the  seeming \nStagnation over the  previous two seasons. British fans \nbenefited from a  last-minute deal with Sky TV  to  show \nthe  Superbikes after the  UK-only satellite channel had \nlost the  GPs to  the  pan-European station Eurosport. At \nthe  time it seemed like  a  piece of useful opportunism for \nall  concerned, but  by the  end of  the  season Carl Fogarty \nwas being hailed as  Britain’s first nationally Known \nmotorcycle racer since Barry Sheene \nFogarty —  ‘Foggy’ to  every British biker —  replaced \nRaymond Roche in  the  factory Ducati squad while Roche \nhimself moved up  to  become a very laid-back team- \nmanager. The Italian factory restricted itself to  supplying \njust  two teams, Roche's official squad and the  Grottir \nteam, managed by another recently retired racer, Davide \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 61 \n\n\n\nTardozzi.

Nobody noticed any \ndifference. \nTardozzi kept Stephane Mertens and, in what was \nseen as  a  politically significant coup, signed up the \nSpaniard Juan Garriga, who had  been in 500 GPs  for \nthree years after a  sparkling career in the  250s. Here \nWas a  man coming to  Superbike who was good enough \nto  get on  the  rostrum in  500 GPs, so  he would provide \nan  interesting yardstick. It wasn’t as  strange a choice as \nit first  seemed. Garriga wasn’t just a two-stroke rider, \nbut  also had  a good Ducati CV,  having ridden NCR \nendurance racers and  been one  of the  riders for the  first \n851  Ducati’s debut at the  Bol  d’Or alongside Virginio \nFerrari and  Marco Lucchinelli. \nOnce again it looked as  if the  main opposition to \nthe  Red  Bullets would come from Kawasaki. The  old \nad  hoc  arrangement of the  Australian team running \nout  of Kawasaki Germany's premises, where the  riders \nlived in caravans, changed.

Scott \nRussell replaced Rob Phillis as  the  team’s number-one \nrider, with Slight again playing the  role  of loyal number \ntwo, a  part with which he would have more and more \ndifficulty as  the  year wore on. \nHonda still  didn’t have their RC30 replacement ready, \nbut  the  Rumi team soldiered on  with the  American Tripp \nNobles as  rider. More significantly, Ducati decided not  to \nlaunch their new bike until Honda did,  so  the  only new \nbike on  the  grid was the  YZF750 Yamaha, which would \nagain be  ridden by Pirovano and Merkel. Terry Rymer \nalso rode a  Yamaha in a  private team with a  Portuguese \nrider and  the  backing of that country’s Pepsi importer. \nAll  the  behind-the-scenes progress was fine, but  the \nchampionship had  lost  its top three riders from last  year: \nPolen went back to the  States to  ride  for  Fast by Ferracci, \na 25    A  See \niF \ncad \na \nRy? \nate \n64 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nRoche was now Ducati’s team-manager, and Phillis was \nalso back on  domestic duty. The infrastructure was \ngetting better, but  what would the  show be  like? There \nwas no  need to worry. Fans at the  trackside and  at \nhome in  front of their TVs  were treated to  the  first  year \nof an  epic confrontation that would dominate Superbike \nfor  two seasons —  Carl Fogarty and Ducati versus Scott \nRussell and Kawasaki —  a  script with plenty of sub-plots: \nthe  little Italian factory versus the  might of Japanese \nindustry, the  taciturn Brit  versus the  flashy American, \nLancashire versus Georgia, you name it. \nNot  that it looked that way at the  start of the  season. \nFoggy fell  on  the  very first  lap of the  first  race at  Brands \nHatch (the Irish round!), putting himself out  of the \nsecond race as  well, and  destroying his wet-weather \nconfidence for years. His  team-mate Falappa belied his \nwild-man reputation with two beautifully controlled \nwins in appalling conditions and promptly backed them \nup with a win  in the  dry at  Hockenheim. The  German \nround also saw Juan Garriga’s only visit  to the  Superbike \nrostrum with a second behind Russell in Race 2, but \nhe only lasted two more meetings before his obvious \ndisenchantment with racing led  to  his  replacement in \nthe  Grottini team by Mauro Lucchiari, a young Italian \nrider held in high regard by the  factory. \nFogarty didn’t post a win until the  third round in \nSpain, where he then made up  for  lost  time with a \ndouble victory and  went on  to  dominate the  middle \nof the  season with doubles in Sweden, Malaysia \nand  Holland. But  to the  increasingly exasperated \nFoggy it seemed as  if every time he won, Russell was \nsecond. Scott was also exasperated by what he saw \nas  the  Ducati rider’s machinery advantage, and  even \nthough he was racking up  the  points he was unhappy \nthat he wasn’t winning. As  it became clear that the \nchampionship was between the  two of them, a  small \namount of personal needle crept into  the  proceedings. \n\nFirst it was Russell refusing to  shake Fogarty’s hand on \nthe  rostrum, then it was Fogarty making disparaging \ngestures at the  American, all grist to the  tabloids’ mill. \nThe  Austrian round provided a  couple of landmarks. \nOn a rapidly drying track at Zeltweg, local man Andreas \nMeklau used his  local knowledge to fit slick tyres and \nromp home an  easy winner, the  last  time a  genuine \nprivateer would win  a World Superbike race. Just  to \nshow that it wasn’t a fluke, he also notched third place \nin the  second race. This was also the  last  appearance on \na World Championship rostrum for  Fred Merkel, who \nhad  split with the  works Yamaha team. He  brought \na  private Ducati home in second place in  Race 2 in \nconditions bad  enough for the  race to  be shortened. \nFogarty only actually led  the  championship for \nthe  three hours between the  two Japanese races \nat the  end  of August. He  won the  first  race in front \nof two local Kawasaki riders with Russell back in \neighth on  a  motorcycle that was plainly well down \non  power compared to  the  Japanese Kawasaki riders’ \nbikes: a strange way to  go about winning a World \nChampionship. Harsh words were exchanged behind \nlocked garage doors, and new motors were fitted to \nAti RE See? \nthe  Muzzy bikes. In the  second race Fogarty and Russell \nduelled at the  front until Carl crashed heavily while \nlapping a tail-ender; Scott then led  home a  Kawasaki \nclean sweep of the first four places and retook the \nchampionship lead. Even Fogarty’s Assen double next \ntime out  didn’t dislodge the  American, who finished \nsecond both times. \nSo,  with a slim seven-point lead, Russell went to \nMonza where the  first race was wet. The  two Muzzy \nKawasaki riders led,  and  when Aaron Slight slid  past \nhis  team-mate on  the  front straight everyone expected \nthat he’d be signalled to  let Russell through for those \nvital extra points. But  it didn’t happen, and  when Foggy \nthen fought back to  beat Russell for fourth place in  the \nsecond race, they went to  Donington just nine points \napart instead of twelve. \nSeveral significant events took place at the  British \nround, where a  large crowd expected Fogarty to \nput the  pressure on  the  American, who was rapidly \nassuming the  status of folk  devil for Carl’s fans. When \nRussell committed the  classic Donington Park mistake of \ntrying too  hard on  cold tyres going down the  fast  and \ntreacherous Craner Curves in  qualifying, it looked as \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 65 \npat TT ai sal \nsence tiene te incl ‘ - \n\nee ee \n—t \n\nif the  fans were going to  get their wish. Such was the \nferocity of the  crash that Russell had  to  be carried up  the \nsteps of his  motorhome when he got out  of the  medical \ncentre. A journalist asked if he could get anything for \nhim, and received the  laconic reply: ‘Yeah, the  race put \nback to  Monday.’ \nOn  race day Russell put  in one  of the  gutsiest \nperformances the  championship has  ever seen, beating \nFogarty in the  first race, then drawing Carl into a crash — \nironically on  Craner Curves —  early in Race 2. All this  on  a \nmotorcycle that the  Muzzy crew had  to alter significantly \neven to  let Scott sit on  It, so  badly beaten up was he. \nAaron Slight and  Russell then fought for the  lead until \nthe  Muzzy crew signalled Slight, who was leading, to \nlet his team-mate through. The New Zealander was not \namused and  gesticulated angrily next time round. \nlt would have been an  easier decision to accept if \nhe’d had  to drop back at Monza, but  now that both \nriders knew that Fogarty was on  the  floor it was almost \nimpossible. With those extra three points Russell went \ninto  the  last  two rounds with a  lead of 32  points. Was \nit worth depriving Slight of what would have been only \nhis third World Superbike win  for three points? The \nKawasaki people said that it was very easy to  see  a \nscenario in which Fogarty might win  the  title  by three \npoints, so  of course it was. Which didn’t explain the  lack \nof a signal at Monza. \nSo  Donington turned into Scott Russell's first double \nwin; it was now the  American’s championship to  lose \nrather than Fogarty’s to win. \nWhat had  been a triumphant season for the  series \ndegenerated into  near farce over the  last two races \n—  scheduled for the  Estoril circuit in Portugal, and \nMexico —  and  undid a  lot of the  good work that had \ngone before. The Portuguese track had  been brought \nup to the  required length by adding two new bends \nat the  far side of the  circuit. Unfortunately, these \nnew-section bends were so  tight that  they made the \nwalking-pace Governor's Bridge hairpin on  the  Isle  of \nMan TT look like  Hockenheim’s super-fast Ostkurve. \nThe result was inevitable —  dominoes on  the  first lap. \nAnd then there was  the  small matter of the  lack  of \nrun-off on  some corners, notably Turn 2. Theoretically \nthe  championship was still  up for grabs, and  when the \nstarter held them on  the  line  for an  age  before the  first \nrace, Scott Russell’s clutch cooked itself and he pitted \nafter a  handful of laps. Unfortunately for  Fogarty, he \ncrashed before his pit crew could signal him  the  news. \nThe removal of the two top  men let  Fabrizio Pirovano in \nfor his only win  of the  season and  what would be the \nYamaha YZF750's only win  until the  end  of 1997. \nFogarty duly won the  second race from Russell, and \nmade his feelings known with a series of explicit hand \ngestures aimed at  his  rival. Foggy’s total of  11  wins \nmade him  by far the  most successful rider of the  year. \nRussell, by contrast, had  only won five  races, and  that \nwas  the  source of Foggy’s frustration: he  had  trouble \ngetting his  head round the  fact  that although he  had \nwon more than twice as  many races as  his  rival, he \nwasn't champion. ‘I just can’t believe Russell’s luck,’ was \nthe  mantra repeated to  any journalist who enquired. \nMaybe the  truth of the  matter lies  in  another statistic: \nFogarty crashed four times and  Scott Russell just  once, \nand that was when he was torpedoed by Giancarlo \nFalappa in Spain. \nRussell, meanwhile, who had  backed up  his wins with \nmany more lower rostrum finishes than Fogarty, further \ninfuriated the  Englishman by being so  laid-back that he \nwas almost horizontal, and implying that you  had  to  use \nyour brains to  be a champion. \nThe championship should have gone down to  the \nwire in Mexico, but  a  bizarre set  of circumstances saw \nthe  race cancelled. The  Circuito Hermano Rodrigues was \npart of a giant complex that hosted a  diverse range of \nevents as  well as  motorsports. The Superbike race was \ntangled up with preparations for a  Michael Jackson \nconcert, and  there were typically convoluted Latin \nAmerican political rivalries involved. The  riders knew that \nthey had  a  problem when stray dogs and  footballs were \nseen on  the  track during qualifying, but  the  last  straw \nwas  when Scott Russell, flat  out  on  the  long straight, \nSaw a pick-up truck cross the  track in front of him. \nIt would be easy to  blame the  Flammini Group for \nscheduling a  race at a track that wasn’t ready for World \nChampionship racing, but there had  twice been post- \nseason internationals held there as  shake-down events. \nIndeed one of these races, at the  end of 1990, had \nbeen the first  time that Doug Polen had  sat  on  a  Ducati. \nHe  had  won both the  non-championship races and  set \nhimself up for  his first  World Championship campaign. \nNo,  scheduling a  race in Mexico was a perfectly valid \nand  well-planned attempt to  broaden the  horizons \nof the  series. Unfortunately it backfired and  left the \nchampionship and  its organisers looking less  than \nprofessional at the  end  of what had  otherwise been \nSuperbike’s most competitive and  highest-profile year yet. \nFar  left: The  last  Yamaha \nvictory in World Superbike \nfor  four years: Fabrizio \nPirovano in  Portugal. \nLeft: Falappa’s T-shirt says \nit all  —  he was really a  big \npussycat. \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 67 \n\nBelow: They think \nthere’s a  round \nleft; there isn’t. \nRussell, Fogarty \nand Pirovano on \nthe rostrum for \nthe  second race in \nPortugal. \n1995 \nSEASON RESULTS \nRound 1 -  Ireland \n9 April, Brands Hatch \nRace 1 \nGiancarlo Falappa, Ita,  Ducati \n1 \n2 Scott Russell, USA, Kawasaki \n3 Brian Morrison, GB, Kawasaki \n4 Adrien Morillas, Fra, Kawasaki \n5 Aaron Slight, NZ,  Kawasaki \n6 Stephane Mertens, Bel, Ducati \ni Fred Merkel, USA, Yamaha \n8 Mark Farmer, GB, Kawasaki \n9 David Jefferies, GB, Yamaha \n10 ‘Tripp Nobles, USA, Honda \n11 Juan Garriga, Spa, Ducati \n12 Valerio de  Stefanis, Ita,  Yamaha \n13.

La   Neen R a oe \nve a \nnek \nit \nsam. \npane \n\nGe know when a race series has  really achieved \nglobal significance: Honda enters a  factory team \nHaving made the  RC30 for  the  first year of World \nSuperbike, the  planet's biggest motorcycle manufacture! \nfinally launched its  replacement, the  RC45, for  1994 and \nsent a  full  works team with Castrol sponsorship to  do \nbattle for  the  title. Now when Honda enters —  as  their \nadvertising slogan used to  say  —  Honda wins, so  the \nnew set-up was the  most lavish in  the  paddock. The \nfactory's official team ran  out  of  the  Louth, Lincolnshire, \nworkshops of  Honda UK  alongside the  GP  motocross \nteam, with Neil Tuxworth as  manager, although it’s \na  mistake to  think that he  had  a  massive amount of \nnfluence on  the  choice of  riders. Japan recruited Doug \nPolen to  lead their comeback —  and why not? He  was \nhe  most successful rider in  the  championship’s history, \nand the  men at  Honda head office had  seen his  All- \nJapan TT  F1  and F3  championship wins on  unfancied \nSuzukis at  close quarters, and had noted the fact that he \nhad defeated Honda's supposedly superior machinery on \nthe way. Polen, meanwhile, had filled his  year off  trom \nWorld Superbike productively, winning the  American \nSuperbike Championship on  a  Ferracci Ducat \nThe RC45 didn’t look too different from the old  RC3 \n—  an  aluminium-framed V4  with single-side swinging \narm —  but as  is  usual with Honda, every component was \nnew and improved. The only obviously new feature \nfuel injection, a  major escalation of  the technologi \nwar between the Japanese factories. As  the Ducat \n851/888 was the only other World Superbike \nto  have electronic fuel injection, the natura \nwas that the RC45 would be  not only competitive \nprobably also the bike to  beat \nAaron Slight, happ \nKawasaki but destined, so   everyone thougnt \nanotner season as nis  teams second rider \nDucati had he 8  & \nyear in  order to meet Hondas T \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 71 \n\nPrevious spread: There \nwas a  British fan  with a flag \nfor  Carl at  every track. \nAbove: Fogarty and  the \nnew Ducati 916  were in \ncommand right from the \nstart. \nRight: Honda’s new works \nteam featured Superbike’s \nmost successful rider, Doug \nPolen... \n...  and  Aaron Slight \n(below), poached from \nMuzzy Kawasaki. \nmoruil \nMm   SPOly \nei dbedil \nWiLTON \nsrolly \natiany \nwas the  916, a  bike so  beautiful that it instantly became \nan  object of desire featured not  only in the  motorcycle \npress but  also in car  and  style magazines all over the \nworld. It looked very different from its predecessors, but \nwasn’t that different. The modifications were all aimed \nat  making the  bike more of a  racer; any  concessions \nto the  comfort of customers who bought a  Ducati \n916  for  road riding were forgotten. The  engine had its \nstroke lengthened by 2mm, a vital step as  Superbike \nregulations prohibited any  alteration to  a homologated \nengine's stroke, and  it was canted forward in the  frame \nto  get  more weight on  the  front wheel. This allowed the \nall-new chassis to feature a  shorter wheelbase, variable \ngeometry was built into  the  steering head, and a single- \n72 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nsided swinging arm was used. But  it was the  shark- \nnosed looks of the  thing that set  the  pulse racing as \nonly a  machine conceived and produced by Italians can. \nThe  factory’s only problem would be  building enough of \nthem to  meet demand. \nThe  minimum weight differential between the  fours \nand  twins had  been shrunk by 5kg  in  1993 by raising \nthe  twins’ minimum limit  to  145kg, still  leaving a  gap \nof 20kg. For  1994 the  gap  was reduced by a further \n5kg, this  time by reducing the  fours’ minimum weight \nto  160kg. Ducati’s response was to  overbore the  916 \nfactory race bikes by 2mm for a capacity of 955cc, \nechoing the  way they'd increased the  capacity of the \nfirst  851  to  888cc, then to  919  and  finally 926cc. As \nalready mentioned, this  was all within the  letter of the \nlaw,  which imposed a  limit of  1000cc on  twins, but \narguably not  within the  spirit of the  rules. \nThe  only comfort for the  opposition was that Ducati’s \nhard-pressed race shop could only make and maintain \na very limited number of 955cc racers. The  factory's \npriority was the  works team of Fogarty and Falappa, \nnow under the  management of Virginio Ferrari, who \nbrought with him  a  much more professional-looking \nset-up than Roche’s down-home team, complete with \ngiant transporters, hospitality unit, and  all the  other \nrequirements of the  modern paddock. Only Honda’s \nencampment was bigger. Davide Tardozzi replaced \nStephane Mertens with Fabrizio Pirovano, who'd finally \ngiven up  on  Yamaha. There was one  other works \n916  run  by Moto Cinelli, Ducati’s UK  importer for \ncompetition bikes, for  fans’ favourite James Whitham. \nKawasaki stuck with Scott Russell as  their number \none and replaced Slight with Terry Rymer, happy to \n\nae \nSLED \nBa \nx \n_ \nONT \n\nAbove: Fogarty highsides at \nHockenheim, breaking his \nwrist in the process, but  he \nwas back in action for the \nnext round. \nTop right: Aaron Slight \nbears the  scars of a  close \nencounter with his  own \nfront disc brake. \nBottom right: It was the \nFogarty versus Russell battle \nof  1993 all  over again: here \nthey lead Yasutomo Nagai \nat  Sugo’s chicane. \nget  back on  a works bike after a frustrating year as  a \nprivateer. Belgarda Yamaha fielded an  all-Italian line- \nup  of young chargers Massimo Meregalli and Mauro \nLucchiari, the  latter poached from Ducati, although the \nrelationship would only last  three races before Lucchiari \nreturned to  Ducati and the  experienced Paolo Casoli \nreplaced him. \nOne extra factory 955 Ducati would make an \noccasional appearance in the  hands of Troy Corser. The \n22-year-old Australian was already champion of his \nown country and  would concentrate on  winning the \nAmerican Superbike title for the  Fast by Ferracci team, \nbut  he still  found time for three European races plus \nthe  Australian round. Corser was the  first of  a new \nphenomenon in Superbike, an  up-and-coming racer \nusing the  series rather than GPs to  hone his  skills and \nraise \nhis \nprofile, \neven \nthough \nthe \n500s \nmight \nhave \nbeen \nhis  ultimate objective. He  qualified on  the  front row in \nhis first race at  Donington and got on  the  rostrum in \nRace 2.  Clearly he would be a  force to  be  reckoned with \nwhen he joined World Superbikes full  time in  1995. \n74 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nDown among the  privateers, it was immediately clear \nthat the  Ducati was still  the  bike to  have, even in  Corsa \ntrim. Two rising stars, Jose Kuhn of France and Michael \nPaquay of Belgium, tried to  make their mark with RC45s \nand  had  dreadful seasons. Only Simon Crafar, one  of \nthose New Zealanders who raced anything anywhere, \ncould do anything with one. He  took the  Team Rumi \nRC45 to  top  privateer slot  and  fifth in  the  championship \nwithout the  benefit of significant factory help, just \nbeating Andreas Meklau’s Ducati despite the  fact that \nthe  Austrian made the  rostrum twice and  Crafar could \nfinish no  higher than fifth all year. \nMuch of the  season was confused by events that \nfollowed fuel  tests from the  first  round at  Donington \nPark. Fogarty, Russell and Slight left  the  UK  neck and \nneck with 35,  34  and 33  points respectively, and  went \nto  Hockenheim where Russell took control after Foggy \nbroke his wrist in  qualifying and Slight crashed in  the \nsecond \nrace. \nThat \nincident \nwas \nexplained \naway \nas \npilot \nerror, but  was in  fact  that rarest of things, a factory \nHonda engine blowing up.

Russell also crashed heavily twice in \ntesting between the  Spanish and Austrian rounds, once \nin Europe and once in Japan, while team-mate Rymer \nwas growing disenchanted with the  penny-pinching \nattitude of the  Muzzy team. Would you  believe they \nbought wheels second hand —  from the  works Kawasaki \nendurance team? \nHonda had  the  lawyers wound up  by now and \nsuccessfully appealed to  the  FIM’s International \nDisciplinary Court on  a variety of technicalities, not  least \nthat Slight was being punished for  using illegal fuel in \ntwo races despite having only been tested after one. \nSlight had  all  his  34  points returned and went back on \ntop  of the  championship, where he stayed up  to  Round \n9 at  Mugello. However, between Rounds 8 and 9 a \ncounter-appeal by Virginio Ferrari on  behalf of Ducati \nand, bizarrely, Oriol Bulto on  behalf of the  FIM’s own \nTechnical Commission, finally ended the  affair and  saw \nwhat most people thought was justice done. Slight had \nhis  17  points for  second place in  the  Donington race \n76 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nafter which he  had  been tested taken away again, but \nwas allowed to  keep his  points from the  other race. The \nresult was that Fogarty left  Round 8 at Assen second in \nthe  championship, and  arrived for  Round 9 at  Mugello \nleading! \nThe  legal wrangling all  but  overshadowed a  near- \ntragedy at Albacete. In  untimed practice Giancarlo \nFalappa highsided the  factory Ducati out  of a  slow \ncorner and was rushed to  hospital with severe head \ninjuries. The prognosis was not  good; local doctors \nwarned us  to  expect the  worst, but  he was flown back \nto  Italy where he teetered on  the  brink before making a \nmiraculous recovery. Giancarlo never raced a  motorcycle \nagain, but  he was alive, although some people who \nSaw him a year or  so  after the  accident were upset \nby his  appearance —  he was limping and had  lost  a \nlot of weight. Part  of the  problem was that non-life- \nthreatening injuries had been ignored in  the  battle to \nsave his  life,  and he  needed a series of operations to  get \nback unrestricted movement. \nWe lost a  great racer, the first true star to  emerge \nsolely in  Superbike, but  we  still  have that charming \nteddy bear of a  man, and  for that we  should be grateful. \nHis  factory ride  was taken over by Mauro Lucchiari. \n\nWith \nboth \nthe  \nHonda \nand \nDucati \nteams \nstruggling \nto  \nget \ntheir \nnew \nbikes \nto  \nhandle \n—  \nDucat \nwith \nrear \nsuspension \nproblems, \nHonda \nwith \nchronic \nundersteer \nand \na \nfront \nend \nthat \nwouldn't \ntrack \nover \nbumps \n— \nKawasaki \nshould \nhave \nbeen \nable \nto  \ncapitalise, \nand \nat  \nthe \nstart \nof \nthe  \nseason \nit \nlooked \nas  \nif \nthey \nwould. \nRussell \nled \nthe  \nchampionship \neven \nafter \nhis  \ndouble \nDNF \nin  \nAustria, \nbut  \ndidn’t \nwin  \nagain \nuntil \nJapan. \nUnfortunately, \nthe  \nbike \nthe  \nfactory \ngave \nhim  \nfor  \nSugo \nwas \nrepossessed \nafter \nrace \nday \nand \nhe \nhad \nto \nsoldier \non \nwith \nhis \nMuzzy \nbike, \nwhich \nwas \nstarting \nto  \nsuffer \nfrom \nlack  \nof \ndevelopment \nas  \nthe  \nyear \nwore \non  \nand  \nthe  \nopposition \ngot  \ntheir \nact \ntogether. \nJust  \nwhen \nRussell \nlooked \nlike  \nhe \nwas  \nwresting \nthe \ninitiative \nback \nfrom \nFogarty \nand \nSlight, \nhe \nsuffered \na \nmechanical \nfailure \nin \nthe \nsecond \nrace \nat \nMugello \nas \nhe \nwas \nlooking \nset \nfor \na \ndouble \nwin. \nWhat \nlooked \nlike \na  \nchampionship \nlead \nturned \nto  \nthird \nplace \nas  \nFoggy \nwon. \nBritish \nfans \nflocked \nto  \nDonington \nfor \nthe  \nrearranged \nEuropean \nround \nonly \nto \nsee \nRussell \nagain \nwin \ntwice \nin \nthe \nwet \nas \nCarl \nstruggled \nwith \na \nbad \ntyre \nchoice \nin \nthe \nfirst \nrace \nand \ntoo \nmany \nDucatis \nin \nfront \nof \nhim \nin \nthe \nsecond. \nThose \nBritish \nfans \nnow \nbit \ntheir \nnails \nfor \nfour \nweeks \n(that \ncalendar \nagain) \nuntil \nthe \nfinal \nround \nin \nAustralia, \nwhere \neither \nSlight, \nRussell \nor \nFogarty \nwould \nwin \nthe \ntitle. \nWhen \nthe  \nregulars \ngot \nto  \nPhillip \nIsland \nthey \nfound \nthat \na \nnew \nstar \nhad \njoined \nthem. \nA \nchunky \nteenaged \nex-motocross \nchampion \ncalled \nAnthony \nGobert \nhad \nwon \nthe \nAustralian \nSuperbike \nChampionship \nfor \nHonda \nand \nwould \nobviously \nbe \na \nhot \nproperty, \nbut \nRob \nMuzzy \ngot \nthere \nfirst, \nputting \nhim \non \nTerry \nRymer's \nbike. \nAmazingly, \nyoung \nGobert \npromptly \nput \nthe \nKawasaki \non \npole \n— \nand \nhe'd \nnever \neven \nsat \non \na \nZXR750 \nbefore. \nHe \ndid \nthe \ndecent \nthing \nin \nthe \nfirst \nrace, \nletting \nhis \nteam- \nmate \nScott \nRussell \nthrough \non \nthe \nline \nfor \nsecond \nplace \nbehind \na \ncharging \nCarl \nFogarty, \nthen \nwon \nthe \nsecond \nrace. \nThe \nEnglishman \ncould \nafford \nto \ntake \nit \neasy \nin \nRace \n2 \nand \nshadowed \nRussell \nuntil \nthe \nAmerican's \nrear \nDunlop \ndisintegrated \nand \nhe \nwaved \nFogarty \nthrough \nto \nsecond \nplace \nand \nhis \nfirst \nWorld \nSuperbike \ntitle. \nBritish \nfans, \nstarved \nof \nsuccess \nin \na \nchampionship \nthat \nmattered \nto \nthe \nworld \nat \nlarge, \nelevated \nFoggy \nto \nthe \nstatus \nof \ndemigod. \nHis \nstunning \nwild-card \nrides \nin \nthe \n1992 \nand \n'93 \nBritish \nGPs \non’a \nprivate \nYamaha, \nthen \nthe \nfactory \nCagiva, \nconvinced \nhis \nfans \nthat \nSuperbike \nwas \njust \nas \ngood \nas \nthe \nGPs. \nAttendances \nat \nthe \nBritish \nGP \nwent \ninto \na \nsteep \ndecline, \nwhile \nthe \nSuperbikes \nwould \nget \ntwo \nUK \nraces, \nboth \nof \nwhich \nwould \npull \nin \nmore \npunters \nthan \nthe \nGP. \nFor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nsince \nthe \ndays \nof \nBarry \nSheene \nBritain \nhad \na \nbike \nracer \nwho \nwas \nrecognised \noutside \nthe \nnarrow \nconfines \nof \nthe \nspecialist \npress \nThe \nUK  \nwas \nthe  \nmost \nextreme \nexample \nof \nthe  \nnew \npopularity \nof \nthe \nchampionship, \nbut \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nIts \nfinal \nacts \nwere \nplayed \nout \non \nthe \nworld \nstage, \nand \nwith \njust  \nthe  \nright \namount \nof \npersonal \nacrimony \nbetween \nthe \ntop \ncontenders, \nsomething \nthat \nhad \nbeen \neliminated \nfrom \nGPs \nby \nthe \ndead \nhand \nof \nmajor \nsponsors. \nThe \nbarely \ndisguised \nmutual \ndislike \nof \nFogarty \nand \nRussell \nfrom \n1993 \nmatured \ninto \na  \nmore \nhealthy \nrespect \nfor  \neach \nother;

Very much a  Yamaha man throughout \nhis career and  now 29  years old,  Nagai had  been \nsufficiently highly thought of to  partner Eddie Lawson \nin  the  Suzuka 8 Hour race and to  be sent to  Europe for \nthe  first time at  the  end of  1994 to  help Yamaha win \ntheir first Bol  d‘Or with the  Sarron brothers. His  reward \nfor that high-profile win and his work developing the \nYZF750 was the  chance to  go for  a world title. All  that \nthe  Superbike paddock knew of him  was that he fitted \nthe  old  stereotype of the  win-or-crash kamikaze when \nthey'd seen him  at  Sugo the  year before. He  set  pole \nand got on  the  rostrum in the  first race, then went from \nsecond to fifth on  the  last  corner of Race 2 attempting \nthe  impossible for a win. His  win in the  Bol,  a  24-hour \n% \\ race, contradicted that image, and  so  would his  riding \nHORSE im” 4 /   when he got to  Europe full  time. \nENT AGY+/ORINK \nPrevious spread: Fogarty \nsalutes the  Brands Hatch \nfaithful. \nAbove: Troy Corser’s \nchallenge was blunted \nby frequent machinery \nproblems. \nRight: Aussie parentage \nbut totally Texan: Yamaha's \nColin Edwards. \nFar  right: The  Foggy/ \nDucati/Michelin \ncombination was \ndevastating in  1995. \n82 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nThe  Yamaha team still  ran  out  of Belgarda’s Italian \nworkshops, but  with Christian Sarron as  team co- \nordinator and  ex-GP mechanics Davide Brivio and \nFiorenzo Fanalli looking after the  bikes. It was an \nimpressive set-up, and the  CVs of the  men in charge \nmade excellent reading. Fanalli had  worked with Lawson \nat Yamaha and  had  then been chief mechanic for \nCagiva’s GP team, while Brivio was similarly experienced \nwith top  Yamaha teams. \nVirginio Ferrari kept Lucchiari as  Foggy’s team-mate \nand recruited ex-racer turned suspension guru Anders \nAndersson from Ohlins to work full  time for the  Ducati \nteam. As well as  the  Promotor squad, there was another \nSignificant Ducati outfit in the  shape of the  Gattolone \nteam and  their rider Pierfrancesco Chili, a 250  and  500 \nGP winner as  well as  an  ex-European 125  champion. \nOstensibly this  was not  a works team, but  by the  middle \nof the  season he was admitting to  getting some help \nfrom Bologna —  again the  phenomenon surfaced of a \nprivate 916  (or rather 955 Corsa) being quicker than the \nworks bike. Ferrari’s and Inzinger’s teams received sealed \nengines from the  factory, whereas the  Gattolone team’s \ntuner could work on  their motors. Chili quickly became \na favourite with the  fans  thanks to  his habit of making \na  bad  start then charging through the  pack. When he \ngot to the  front he  usually either crashed or  won. He \ndid  both at  Monza, where the  victory of an  Italian rider \non  an  Italian bike at an  Italian race produced one  of the \nmore emotional celebrations seen at a  Superbike round. \nThe other new privateer outfit was the  British Revé \nKawasaki team. This was set  up  by businessman Ben \nAtkins for  his friend John Reynolds, with David Jefferies \nas  second rider and  machinery equal to that of long- \ntime Superbike contender Piergiorgio Bontempi, who \nrode for the  Italian importer. World Championship \nmotorcycle racing also returned to  the  USA with the  first \nAmerican World Superbike round for four years; in the \nabsence of an  American GP  it was the  most significant \nroad-racing event of the  year in North America. \nOn  the  technical front, carbon-fibre disc  brakes were \nbanned as  a  gesture to  reducing costs (replacing Ducati \n916  crankcases at  regular intervals cost a  damn sight \nmore) and  the  minimum weight limit for  both twins \nand  fours was raised by 2kg to  compensate. None of \n\n\n\nTop: This is Misano. \nLucchiari leads Fogarty and \nCorser. \nInset: Dramatis personae: \non  the  left  Fogarty, Slight, \nReynolds and Meklau; on \nthe  right Russell, Corser, \nLucchiari and Bontempi. \nAbove right: James \nWhitham added to  the  fun \nboth on  and off the  track. \nBelow right: Bontempi, \nReynolds, Edwards, Corser \nand Nagai in typically close \ncompany. \nthe  bikes altered significantly, but  there was a  major \nhiatus in tyre supply. A massive earthquake devastated \nthe  industrial city of Kobe where Dunlop made their \nrace tyres; the  damage was comprehensive and  would \nmean that the  Yamaha and Kawasaki factory teams \nwould suffer severe problems for the  first half  of the \nseason. On  the  political front, the  increasingly fractious \nrelationship between the  Flammini Group and  the \nGP  establishment resulted in  a  slanging match at  the \nstart of the  season when it was announced that a \n600cc four-stroke championship called Thunderbikes \nwould run  as  a support class at  GPs with a view to \nbecoming a  full  World Championship. As  Flammini was \nrunning the  Open Supersport Championship alongside \nSuperbikes, the  Italians regarded this  as  an  intrusion \non  their territory. The  fact that Flammini had run  the \n250cc European Championship at  Superbike meetings, \nand the  movers and shakers in  GPs had previously \n84 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nregarded anything with a four-stroke motor as  an  oil- \nspewing device of the  devil, was conveniently forgotten. \nThe inevitable compromise was that Thunderbikes \nexcluded the  new 748cc Ducati while Open Supersport \nallowed them. In the  event, Thunderbikes would only \nlast  one  year, while Flammini would go  on  to  develop \nthe  Supersport class as  a  natural accompaniment to \nSuperbikes. \nThere was  yet another shock before the  start of the \nseason: Honda and Doug Polen had  parted company. \nThe  announcement was made only a week before the \nfirst race, leaving the  Castrol Honda team no  time to \nrecruit a second rider. Polen had  been half-way through \na two-year contract and the  strange timing of the  split \nwas thought to  be down to  some high-level arguments \nas  to who signed the  cheque that paid Doug off.  He \nwas always a  very astute businessman and  would not \nhave taken kindly to  the  brush-off, but  this  being Honda \nthe  press release said that the  parting was amicable and \nany  investigation was met  with a  discreet silence. \nThe  result was  the  mighty Honda works team \nfielding just one bike and giving Polen’s to  Simon \nCrafar, who ran  it in his  Rumi team’s colours. Aaron \nSlight had  to  carry the  whole burden of development \nand try to  make the  still  recalcitrant RC45 competitive \non  his own. Given the  situation in which he found \nhimself, his achievements this  season were remarkable. \nThey included the  RC45’s first pole position at  Monza \nfor  Round 4, then its  first win at  the  next round in \n\nAlabacete, \nwhere \nAaron \ncraftily \nconserved \nhis  \ntyres \nand  \nfought \noff  \na  \nlate  \nchallenge \nfrom \nFogarty. \nHe  \nalso \ndemonstrated \nthat \nthe \nHonda \nwas \nprobably \nthe \nquickest \nbike \non  \nthe  \ntrack, \nbut  \nputting \nthe  \npower \non  \nthe  \ntarmac, \nespecially \non  \nbumpy \ntracks \nlike  \nMisano \nand \nLaguna \nSeca, \nwas \nstill \na \nmajor \nproblem. \nSlight \nhad \na \nnightmare \nat \nMisano \nwhere \nhe \ncould \nonly \nmanage \n16th \nand \n13th \nplaces. \nHonda's \nproblems \nwere \nnothing \nnext \nto  \nMuzzy \nKawasaki's. \nTheir \nnew \nbikes \nmanaged \nto \nbe \naround \na \nsecond \na  \nlap \nslower \nthan \nlast  \nyear’s, \nand  \ntheir \nbest \nfinish \nin \nthe  \nfirst \ntwo \nrounds \nwas \nGobert'’s \nsixth \nat  \nMisano. \nWorryingly, \nAnthony \nwas \ncrashing \nregularly \nin \nqualifying \nas  \nhe \nstruggled \nwith \nthe  \nunfamiliar \ntask \nof \nsetting \nup \na \nSuperbike. \nRussell’s \nform \nwas \nstrangely \nsubdued, \nand \nwhen \nhe \narrived \nat \nDonington, \nlimping \nas \na \nresult \nof \nwhat \nhe \nsaid \nwas \na \nmountain-bike \naccident, \nthings \nlooked \neven \nworse. \nUnbelievably, \nthey \ndeteriorated \neven \nfurther \non \nrace \nday, \nand \non \nhis \nbest \ncircuit \ntoo. \nIn \nthe  \nfirst \nrace \nhe \nled  \nearly \non  \nbut  \nended \nup  \nsixth, \nthen \nretired \nignominiously \nin \nthe \nsecond \nwhen \na \nhastily \nfitted \ncarburettor \ncomponent \nworked \nloose. \nOnly \nafter \nthe \nrace \ndid \nthe \ntruth \nemerge. \nRussell \nwas \nlimping \nas \na \nresult \nof \nbroken \ntoes \nsustained \nwhile \ntesting \nthe \n500cc \nSuzuki \nGP \nbike \nat \nBrno \nin \nthe \nCzech \nRepublic. \nKevin \nSchwantz’s \ndecision \nto \nretire \nmid-season \nhad \nthrown \nboth \nGP \nand \nSuperbike \npaddocks \ninto \na \nfrenzy \nof \nspeculation. \nEvery \ntop \nSuperbike \nman \nwas \nlinked \nat \none \ntime \nor \nanother \nwith \nthe \nride, \nbut \nit \nwas \nRussell \nwho \ngot \nthe \njob. \nGobert \nand \nCorser \nwere \nthe \nother \nmen \nin \nthe \nframe. \nThe  \ndisarray \nof \nthe  \nnon-Ducati \nteams \nled  \nto  \na  \nunique \nevent, \na \nrule \nchange \nin \nmid-season. \nDucatis \nwon \nevery \nrace \nat \nthe \nfirst \nthree \nrounds \nand, \njust \nafter \nScott \nRussell's \ndefection \nto \nthe  \nGrands \nPrix  \nbecame \ncommon \nknowledge, \nthe \nFIM \nannounced \nanother \nrevision \nof \nthe \nminimum \nweight \nlimits. \nThat \nfor \nthe \ntwins \nwas \nrevised \nupwards \nby \n8kg \nand \ndownwards \nfor \nthe \n750cc \nfours \nby \n2kg \nto \nreduce \nthe \ndifference \nto \nJust \nSkg. \nAccording \nto \nCarl \nFogarty’s \nchief \nmechanic \nand \nfriend, \nAnthony \n‘Slick’ \nBass, \neven \nthe \nfactory \n916s \nweren't \non \nthe \nminimum \nweight \nlimit, \nbut \nthey \nstill \nhad \nto \nhave \n7 \nor \n8 \nkilos \nof \nlead \nbolted \non \nto \nmeet \nthe \nnew \nlimit. \nIn \npractice, \nthe \nnew \nlimits \nmade \nvery \nlittle \ndifference \nto \nDucati’s \ndomination;

Hale’s performance was \nimpressive enough to  get  him  a  Promotor Ducati for \nthe  last  two meetings as  a try-out for a full-time ride \nin  1996. The  American round was also the  only really \nbad meeting Fogarty had  all year. He  could not  get to \ngrips with the  circuit and  only finished fifth and  seventh, \nbut  even that wasn’t enough to  deprive him  of the \nchampionship lead that he’d held since the  opening day \nof the  season. \nThe next venue was Brands Hatch for the  European \nround, giving the  UK  two championship rounds, a \nprivilege normally reserved for  Italy and ‘San Marino’. \nDespite all Fogarty’s successes, he  had  never won a  race \nat the  Kent circuit at any  level of competition, and  this \nextra home round put  pressure on  him, coming as  it did \nright after the  setback of Laguna Seca. Foggy fever now \nhad  the  UK  firmly in its grip, and  45,000 fans turned up \nat  Brands, the  largest-ever crowd for a World Superbike \nrace. They were rewarded with a weekend of total \ndomination —  pole and  two wins in an  atmosphere that \nany  British fan  too  young to  remember the  heyday of \nBarry Sheene had  never experienced. \nHome fans were further cheered by what they \nthought was a  brace of fourth places from John \nReynolds, but  a  protest converted his second race result \nto  third when Yasutomo Nagai was deemed to  have \n86 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nmade a  pass under a yellow flag and  was penalised \nby one  second. Reynolds thus achieved the  dubious \ndistinction of finishing in the  top three at  his  home race \nbut  not  getting to stand on  the  rostrum. Yamaha were \nnot  amused —  they thought that it was a home-town \ndecision and said Nagai would get  his  revenge at Sugo. \nHe  nearly did,  for Fogarty, who could have won the  title \nat the  Japanese round, crashed out  of the  first race in \nwhat was almost a  carbon copy of his  1994 highside. \nNagai tried an  impossible move at the  last  corner of \nthe  first race and  ended up third. In the  second race he \nblocked Fogarty more than once on  the  first lap before \nthe  Englishman forced his way past and, visibly annoyed, \npulled away for a  remarkable win  given the  cracked \nbones in his wrist and  ankle. \nFogarty had  two weeks to  recover before he went \nto Assen, where he was now a racing certainty to take \nthe  title thanks to  an  astonishing lead of  128  points over \nCorser and 154  over Slight. It was like  a third British \nround, there were so  many Foggy fans in the  crowd \nand  so  many Union Jacks on  display. Carl duly retained \nhis title by winning the  first race from surprise package \nSimon Crafar. The  extent of his  lingering Sugo injuries \nwere demonstrated on  the  slow-down lap when he \nasked a fan  to tie a flag around his  neck as  his wrist \nwasn't strong enough to  support a  makeshift flagpole. \nEntertainingly, the  fan  misheard and leapt on  the  back \nof the  Ducati for the  pillion ride  of a  lifetime. Fogarty \nduly extended his  unbeaten Assen run  in Race 2, with \nJohn Reynolds actually getting to  stand on  the  rostrum \nin  third place. \nTragically, the  celebrations were overshadowed by \na second-race crash that would lead to  the  death of \nYasutomo Nagai. Superbike’s first  fatality was the  result \n\nof \nan  \ninnocuous \ncrash \non  \noil  \nleft  \nby \na  \nblown \nengine. \nAny \nracer \nwould \nexpect \nto \nwalk \naway \nfrom \nsuch \nan \nincident \nseveral \ntimes \na  \nseason, \nbut  \nas  \nYasu \nwas \nabout \nto  \nget  \nto \nhis \nfeet \nafter \na \ngentle \nslide \non \nto \nAssen’s \ngrass \nhis \nbike \ndug \nin, \nflipped \nin \nthe \nair \nand \ncame \ndown \non \nhim. \nHe \nsuffered \nmassive \nhead \nand \nchest \ninjuries. \nHis \nbreathing \nwas \nmaintained \nartificially \nuntil \nhis \nparents \nand \ngirlfriend \ncould \nget \nto \nHolland \nfrom \nJapan, \nwhen \nthe \ndecision \nwas \ntaken \nto \nswitch \noff \nhis \nlife-support \nmachine. \nIt \nwas \na \nreminder \nof \njust \nhow \ndangerous \nmotorcycle \nracing \ncan \nbe, \neven \non \none \nof \nthe \nsafest \ncircuits \nin \nthe \nworld \nYamaha \npulled \ntheir \nteam \nout \nof \nthe \nrest \nof \nthe \nseason \nas \na \nmark \nof \nrespect, \nalthough \nthere \nwas \none \nother \npoignant \ngesture \nwhen \nYamaha's \n125 \nGP \nrider \nYoshiaki \nKatoh \nwore \nNagai’s \nspider’s \nweb \ncrash-helmet \ndesign \nfor \nthe \nrest \nof \nthe \nseason. \nThe  \nremaining \ntwo \nrounds \nwere \nabout \nSlight’s \nand \nCorser’s \nbattle \nfor \nsecond \nplace, \nwhich \nwas \nwon \nby \nthe \nAustralian. \nTroy \nalso \nemphasised \nhis \nclass \nby \nbecoming \nthe \nonly \nman \nto  \nqualify \non  \nthe \nfront \nrow  \nof \nthe  \ngrid \nfor \nevery \nrace \nof \nthe \nyear. \nOff \ntrack, \nthe \nannual \ngame \nof \nmusical \nsaddles \nwas \nmore \nspirited \nthan \nusual. \nFogarty, \nhaving \nturned \nwhat \nwas \nsupposed \nto \nbe \nthe \nclosest \nSuperbike \nseason \never \ninto \na \ncakewalk, \ndecided \nthat \nhe \nneeded \na \nnew \nchallenge. \nSo \nhe \nsigned \nto \nride \nfor \nHonda \nIn \n1996. \nAbove & left: Yasutomo \nNagai became the  first \nfatality \nin \nWorld \nSuperbike \nat  Assen, one of the \nchampionship’s safest \nBelow: Gobert made a  big \nimpression \nin \nhis \nfirst \nfull- \n\nRound 1 -  Germany \nHockenheim, 7 May \nRace 1 \nCarl Fogarty, GB,  Ducati \nFabrizio Pirovano, Ita,  Ducati \nJochen Schmid, Ger, Kawasaki \nYasutomo Nagai, Jap, Yamaha \nKeiichi Kitagawa, Jap, Kawasaki \nAaron Slight, NZ, Honda \nColin Edwards, USA, Yamaha \nScott Russell, USA, Kawasaki \nSimon Crafar, NZ, Honda \n10 Troy Corser, Aus, Ducati \n11 Piergiorgio Bontempi, Ita, Kawasaki \n12 Massimo Meregalli, Ita,  Yamaha \n13.

Even more significantly, one  of the  most talented \nriders of recent years —  an  ex-GP World Champion, no \nless  —  arrived on  the  scene. John Kocinski had  taken a \nyear off  racing in  1995 when it became obvious that no \n500 GP  team, or  more likely their sponsors, was willing \nto  risk  taking on  the  troubled genius. How could a  man \nwho had  won the  250  title  and  four 500cc GPs  on \ntwo different makes of bike not  be  a  hot  property? His \nreputation was that he caused teams to  implode and \nwas difficult if not  impossible to  deal with. There were \nalso rumours of strange behaviour, a  cleanliness fetish \nand  other personal problems. None of which altered the \nfact that he was a  genius of a  racer. Kocinski had  very \nmportant fans in  the  shape of Maurizio Flammini and \nthe  Castiglioni brothers, bosses of the  Cagiva Group \nwhich owned Ducati, so  his  path to  the  works Ducati \nteam as  Fogarty’s replacement was a  smooth one. His \nteam-mate was Fogarty’s friend and fellow-Lancastrian \nNeil  Hodgson who was signed first on  the  strength of \nhis  impressive performances as  a  500 GP  privateer. He \nirst  realised who his  team-mate would be when he  saw \nJohn in  the  restaurant across the  road from Ducati’s \nneadquarters one lunchtime \nStill, the  22-year-old managed to  give every \nmpression of enjoying his  new status as  a  works rider, \nand  would engagingly confide how he  couldn't believe \nhe was being chauffeured to  circuits in  the  Cagiva \ncompany helicopter: ‘Me, just  a  lad  from Burnley. And \nthey‘re \npaying \nme \nwell!’ \nHe \nwas \nalso \nloyal \nto \nhis \nteam- \nmate in  public, although in  private he  would wonder \nwhy the  American would ‘let  himself down with some \nof \nthe \nthings \nhe \nsays’. \nKocinski \nsaid \nall \nthe \nright \nthings \nIn \npublic, \nprofessing \nhimself \nhappy \nto \nbe \nin \nSuperbikes \nand \nready to  enjoy his  racing again. It wouldn't last \nSuzuki's first factory team in  Superbike was run  by \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 91 \n\nPrevious spread: Troy \nCorser was smooth, stylish \nand  the  class act  of ‘96. \nAbove: By mid-season \nKocinksi wasn’t talking to \nteam-manager Virginio \nFerrari. Engine man lvo \nBertoni and mechanic Mike \nWatt consult in Sugo. \nBelow: Team-manager \nDavide Tardozzi was a vital \nelement of Troy Corser’s \ncampaign. \nRight: The  champ had \na  spectacular line  in \ncelebrations. \nthe  English Harris Performance operation, with Lester \nHarris as  manager and  John Reynolds and  Australian \nSuperbike Champion Kirk  McCarthy as  riders. The \nnew GSX-R750 turned out  to  have power and  good \ntop-end speed but  was  afflicted by a strange high- \nspeed instability that took most of the  season to  iron \nout. Along the  way both riders, the  even-tempered \nEnglishman and  the  tough little  Aussie, became very \ndisenchanted. The  other bikes stayed much the  same, \nalthough the  minimum weights for fours and  twins \nwere now equalised at  162kg which meant the  Ducatis \nhad  to add  7kg. The  Thunderbike series run  at GPs \ndidn’t manage a second season, so  Flammini reacted by \nrunning a  Supersport round outside Europe for the  first \ntime as  part of the  gradual move towards the  objective \nof a  second World Championship series. \nThe  Promotor team again fielded Troy Corser, most \npundits’ pre-season tip for the  title, alongside American \nMike Hale who'd impressed at  Laguna last year, then \nbacked that up with impressive guest rides in the  last \ntwo rounds. Frankie Chili again had  what was alleged \n92 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nto  be  a  private bike, but  he obviously had  the  key to  the \nfactory's back door. \nOver at  Honda Fogarty had  to  come to  terms with \nthe  RC45, a  bike that was still  all  but  impossible to  set \nup  for  bumpy tracks, a  task complicated by wet  winter \ntesting and  the  fact  that the  first  round was at  Misano, \nwhere the  Castrol Honda team had  had  a  nightmare in \n1995. Foggy promptly made it even more difficult by \ncrashing heavily in  qualifying, although he scored useful \npoints in both races. Much attention was focused on \nhow the  relationship with his team-mate Aaron Slight \nwould develop. Fogarty had  not  been charitable about \nSlight in the  past —  he always seemed to  need one \ncompetitor to  focus his efforts on  —  but  they did  a  good \njob of hiding whatever mutual dislike was left. \nFogarty’s early season was dire. He  had  the  worst \nweekend of his career at  Donington, where he simply \ncouldn't get the  bike to work and  felt  he’d let  his  home \nfans down badly. Then his friend and  mechanic Anthony \n‘Slick’ Bass was sacked from the  Honda team on  the \nMonday after racing. Surely things couldn't get worse? \nThey did. \nHis  team-mate Aaron Slight won the  first  race at \nHockenheim with Carl  a distant fifth. New mechanic \nNick Goodison and  Carl decided on a radical move, \njacking the  back end  of the  bike up to throw more \nweight onto the  front wheel. It worked and  Fogarty won \nhis first  race on  an  RC45. It was  also  the  first  time the \nbike had  won both races at a  round. Carl’s spectacular \ndouble at Assen was the  first  time one  rider won both \nraces on  an  RC45. It was also the  point at which Foggy \nannounced he was going back to  Ducati in  1997. He \nreckoned he  had  proved his  point, that he could win  on \na  four-cylinder bike, but  he obviously hadn't found the \nBritish-based Honda team as  homely as  he thought he \nwould. \nAaron Slight made a conscious attempt to  change \nhis  image as  the  nice guy  —  and  we  all  know that nice \nguys come second —  by dyeing his  hair  different colours \nfor every round, and  when he  ran  out  of colour options \nhe went in for  outrageous Mohicans and  a variety of \nsculptured goatee beards. He  was still  a nice guy, and \nhe still  racked up the  points with a  hatful of podium \nplacings, but  he still  only won once. \nThe  Honda was obviously an  improved bike \ncompared to  the  previous year but  it still  had  major \nproblems on  bumpy tracks. You  wouldn't have known it \nat  Sugo, though. The  local Honda men gave the  regulars \nthe  same sort of lesson they used to  get  in Australia in \nthe  early days of the  championship. Yet  another talented \nyoungster, Yuichi Takeda, won the  first race and  Takuma \nAoki romped away with the  second race and into  the \nRepsol Honda Grand Prix  team. It was obviously possible \nto  get the  RC45 to  both go fast  and handle on  tight \ntracks. \nYamaha and Kawasaki were again reduced to  the \nrole  of bit-part players. Muzzy Kawasaki backed up the \nprecocious Anthony Gobert with Simon Crafar, the  New \nZealander at  last  getting the  works bike his talent and \ndedication deserved, but  the  bike was still  obviously \n\n\n\n\n\nnot  on  a  par  with the  opposition. The  season started \nwith Gobert giving an  astonishing display of machine \ncontrol as  he slid  his way around Misano to  beat John \nKocinksi in  Race 2, only to  have the  victory taken away \nfor a technical infringement. A carburettor part had \nbeen modified, which is illegal. The  team said it was \npart of the  inlet tract not  the  carb and the  modification \nwas therefore legitimate, but  the  FIM  didn’t agree. \nGobert didn’t win  again until Laguna Seca, when an \nelectrical fault made Kocinski’s Ducati run  rich  and  run \nout  of fuel  on  the  last  lap. After he  broke his collarbone \nin qualifying for  Indonesia in August he didn’t appear \nagain until the  final round in Australia at the  end  of \nOctober, prompting dissatisfied mutterings from his \nteam and  fuelling rumours of a  move to  500 GPs  which \nwould be  proved correct. \nYamaha draughted in  Wataru Yoshikawa alongside | \nColin Edwards to  replace the  late, lamented Nagai and \nslimmed the  team’s structure down. Christian Sarron \nwas no  longer in charge, leaving Davide Brivio to front \nthe  team. Along with Dunlop tyres being back to  normal \noperating level, this  helped the  team to  threaten the  top \nmen everywhere and score a lot  of points —  Yoshikawa \neven set  a  new lap record at  Laguna Seca —  but  never \nquite manage to win. Edwards was as  personable as \never and smiled for the  cameras but  in  private he was \ngetting very frustrated with seconds and  thirds. \nOver at  Ducati Virginio Ferrari was getting more than \nfrustrated with his  star rider's behaviour, and by Sugo \nhe and Kocinksi weren’t communicating at  all  but  were \ncomplaining about each other to  anyone who'd listen. \nThankfully for  Ducati, the  Promotor team were In \nbetter shape and  Troy Corser was riding superbly. Not \nthat you  could always tell  from his  smooth, unhurried, \nalmost classical style. When he was a  youngster his  dad \nhad  worried about it, saying he  looked like  he was out \nfor  a  Sunday ride not  a  race. His  mum pointed out  that \nTop: Fogarty stalks Corser \nand  Chili at  Monza. \nLeft: Enigmatic? Difficult? \nContradictory? Probably. A \nbrilliant rider? Definitely. \nBelow: Kocinksi tries in vain \nto  bump start his  Ducati \nafter it ran  out  of petrol on \nthe  last  lap of Race 2 at \nLaguna. \nInset: Fogarty took the \nHonda’s first double win at \nAssen. Here he  leads Chili \non  the  run  from the  chicane \nto  the  flag. \n\nRight: Suzuki's first season \nwas dogged by a high- \nspeed stability problem; \nJohn Reynolds did  not  have \na  good year. \nBelow right: Fi \nalways comf \nHonda \nBelow: rates his \nwin at  Mc \ning  it  didn't matter, did  it?  So  Troy's style \nnged — you needed a  stopwatch to  see  if \neally trying \nonington Park he  really was trying. His  pole- \nime  was under the  absolute lap record set \nby   Kevin Schwantz on  a  500 Suzuki —  a  landmark \nachievement for  a  bike based on  the  916  you  can  buy in \nhe shops. It was one  of Troy's good weekends, when \neverything worked for  him  and  he set  pole, won both \nraces and  set  the  fastest laps. He  did  it at  Donington \nt might have been more but  for  a worrying recurrence \nof the  engine problems that had  dogged him  the \nprevious season at  three consecutive races: Brands, \nSentul and Sugo. As  Kocinski’s bike was conspicuously \nreliable, Alfred Inzinger, Corser’s team owner, started to \nbelieve in conspiracy theories. \nTroy did  have two bits  of luck, though. He  crashed \ntwice at  Hockenheim, both times at the  fast  and \nand he  also doubled at  the  Czech Republic and in  Spain. \nfearsome Ostkurve, and both times he walked away. \nAll  of which meant that Corser never pulled away \nat  the  top  of the  championship until the  last  couple of \nrounds. In Albacete everyone except Troy suffered from \ntyre problems while the  Australian stormed away to  a \nconvincing double and  took a  26-point lead to  the  last \nround at  home in  Australia. \nFour men went to  Phillip Island with a mathematical \nchance of the  title  —  Corser, Slight, Fogarty and Kocinski \n—  although it would have taken an  act  of God for \nanyone except Troy to  win. The  title was settled in  the \nfirst race, the  act  of God happened in  the  second, too \nlate  for the  others. Aaron Slight didn’t care about the \nsums and  lived up to  his  haircut by charging after Corser \nand  the  returning Gobert, who'd dyed his own unruly \nmop of hair red  for the  occasion. Aaron's hope was \nalive until lap 13  when he  lost  the  front end  and  slid \nout  at the  splendidly named Siberia corner. To  the joy \nof the  home crowd Corser cruised round to third place \nand  the  title. At the  start of Race 2 the  flock of seagulls \nthat inhabit Phillip Island failed to  get out  of the  way on \nthe  first  corner and  Corser, who'd made the  holeshot, \nhad  his fairing smashed and his clutch lever broken. \nThe remains splattered all over Colin Edwards, who \ncontinued to  a  blood and  feather smeared third. \n\nTroy pitted for  repairs, then rejoined to  pull  wheelies for \nthe  fans until the  flag went out  and he  treated them to \nenormous standing wheelies. Gobert celebrated his  first \ndouble win  by taking his  clothes off  on  the  rostrum. \nAt  24  years old  Troy was Superbike’s youngest World \nChampion and the  first Australian to  take the  crown. \nAs  befits one  of the  young lions, he  looked on  the \nSuperbike title as  another step on  the  career ladder \ntowards his  objective of a  500 GP  title. The plan was \nthat the  whole Promotor team would move into the  GPs \nwith works Yamahas and Luca Cadalora as  lead rider \nalongside Troy. It was also an  open secret that Anthony \nGobert would go  to  GPs in  1997. It  was to  the  World \nSuperbike Championship that GP  team-managers now \nlooked first  when they needed a  new rider. On  the  one \nhand this proved the  status of Superbikes and the  worth \nof the  title, but  on  the  other it meant that good young \nriders were likely to  move on.  Success, as  ever, Was a \ndouble-edged sword. There were obviously going to \nbe  a  lot  of changes in  the  Superbike paddock in  1997 \nWhat no-one knew at  the  end of  1996 was that the \nGPs would give back just as  much as  they got  and that \nthe  riders who left  Superbike were going to  suffer very \nmixed fortunes. There were already rumours about \nthe  financial status of  Alfred Inzinger’s Power Horse \ncompany which would drastically affect Troy Corser’s \ncompetitiveness in  GPs and eventually lead to  his  return \nto  the  World Superbike Championship \n\nBelow: Neil \nHodgson scored his \ndebut rostrum at \nLaguna Seca, and \nwas much relieved. \nBottom: Corser, \nhis  crew and the \ntrophy. \n1996 \nSEASON RESULTS \nRound 1 -  San Marino \nMisano, 14 April \nRace 1 \nJohn Kocinski, USA, Ducati \nTroy Corser, Aus, Ducati \nPierfrancesco Chili, lta,  Ducati \nSimon Crafar, NZ, Kawasaki \nAnthony Gobert, Aus, Kawasaki \nAaron Slight, NZ,  Honda \nCarl Fogarty, GB,  Honda \nChrister Lindholm, Swe, Ducati \nWataru Yoshikawa, Jap, Yamaha \n10  Piergiorgio Bontempi, Ita,  Kawasaki \n11 Colin Edwards, USA, Yamaha \n12 Neil Hodgson, GB, Ducati \n13.

It Is \na  mystery quite why the  Lucky Strike Suzuki GP  team \nwanted to  get  rid  of the  rider who had kept their team \ncredible in the  absence of their chosen number one \nand had  got an  increasingly uncompetitive bike on  the \nrostrum twice in  his  first full  year. It resulted in  a man \nreckoned to  be a  potential GP  winner being welcomed \nback to  Superbike not  just  by his  new Yamaha team, \nbut  by the  fans. Russell had  always had  their respect, \nnow they actually liked him  too. The  American is  a \ncomplex man who has  coped with a  great deal of pain | \nin his  personal life,  but  he  now came across as  a  more \nsympathetic person whose brave and undervalued \nperformances in  500 GPs proved to  anyone who ever \ndoubted it that a good Superbike rider could also be a \ngood 500 rider. \nlf Russell was the  good American, John Kocinsk\\ \nswiftly became the  baddie in  the  black hat. He  couldn't \nget away from Ducati quickly enough and finally got  his \nwish, a  Honda ride. Fogarty happily returned to  the  laid- \nback family atmosphere of the  Ducati team: no  more \ntwo-hour debriefing meetings after qualifying to  decide \non  suspension settings. \nThere were big changes at  Suzuki and Kawasaki. \nBoth John Reynolds and Kirk McCarthy went back to \ntheir own domestic championships with sighs of relief to \nbe  replaced at  Suzuki by James Whitham and Mike Hale \nSince Whitham had left  World Superbike he’d been \ndiagnosed with, and cured of, cancer of the  lymphatic \nsystem and made a  successful comeback in  the  British \nChampionship. As  cheerful as  ever, he  was now even \nmore philosophical about racing. ‘I’m looking forward to \ngoing back to  hospital with something nice and simple \n—  like  a  broken leg.’ \nKawasaki parted company with Rob Muzzy’s \norganisation and replaced it with the  German set-up \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 101 \n\n102 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nPrevious spread: Kocinksi \ndives through Laguna Seca’s \ninfamous Corkscrew. \nAbove: Wet wet wet.

The approach \ncame from Kawasaki Germany, but  Eckl took his time to \nmake his  mind up.  He  had  no  experience of four-strokes, \nhaving been a  250 GP  rider, but  he  saw the  opportunity \nas  a  good one  for  himself and  his staff. Simon Crafar \nkept his  ride and Japan sent over the  relatively unknown \nAkira Yanagawa. He'd been the  fastest Kawasaki \nqualifier at Sugo in  1996 but  had never been a  Japanese \nChampionship contender so  his  CV  didn’t prepare \nanyone for the  impact he would make. The  pace of \nthe  green bikes was just as  surprising. The team had \nvery few new parts at  pre-season testing but, when it \ncame to  the  first race, the  factory had magicked up  an \nastonishing amount of new power. \nAll  the  other factory-supported riders kept their seats: \nChili with his semi-detached Gattolone Ducati team, \nSlight at  Honda, Edwards at Yamaha and Hodgson at \nDucati. On  the  technical front, the  most significant move \nwas Honda quietly homologating a  new fuel-injection \nsystem with two injectors per  cylinder which added \nmid-range flexibility to  the  outright top  speed the  RC45 \nalready had. \nThe new season opened where the  old  one had \nfinished, on  the  glorious curves of Australia’s Phillip \nIsland circuit, and  revealed several new truths that would \nset  the  pattern for the  season. The  most striking new \naspect of the  grid was  that the  Kawasakis had  found \nnot  just extra speed but  a  new star  in Akira Yanagawa. \nThe  Japanese rider started the weekend as  a  nervous \nnewcomer but  by the  end  of qualifying his  grin was so \nwide that, to  quote the  editor of Australian MotorCycle \nNews, ‘| thought the  bottom of his face was  going \nto fall  off.’ He  qualified second, scored a  solid fourth \nin the  first very wet race and  then ran  with the  front \ngroup until getting nudged off  line  by a  backmarker and \nrunning out  of road in Race 2. \nIf Kawasaki had  leapt forward over the  winter, the \nreverse was true of Suzuki. Not  only were their bikes \nslower than the  previous year, the  works team was \nsoundly beaten by the  local importer’s team as  well. ‘| \ncould have kicked my  hat  round faster,’ said Whitham. \nTeam-manager Lester Harris was realistic: ‘It was a \ndisaster.’ Honda had  a good day. Kocinksi won the  first \nrace in the  wet  and  Slight the  second in the  dry,  out- \ndragging Edwards to the  line. The  American came out  of \nthe  last  corner in the  lead with his front wheel in  the  air \nand  the  rear  tyre  spinning —  he couldn't have done any \nmore —  but  he still  got  beaten. Two things about Honda \nwere now evident: Kocinksi was going to win if it rained, \nand the  team was rapidly curing the  old  problem of how \nto  get all that power to the  ground. \nWhen it rained at  Misano, Kocinski won one race and \ncame second in the  other. Fogarty led  out  of the  last \ncorner at  Monza in  Race 1 but  found himself beaten to \nthe  line  by both Hondas. The  days when the  Ducati 916 \nwas the  power king appeared to  be over. \nFogarty and Slight seemed to  have swapped \ncharacters over the  winter. The  Briton —  for whom \nwinning was all, and second meant first loser —  only \n\nomen \nSoe \nrs \nof \na \nae \nate \nwe \nsieve \n: \npe \ngn \n\nwon one of  the  first  six  races. Slight won three races in \nthe  first four rounds, more than he  had ever managed \nin  a  season, but  also  fell  off  twice. Aaron’s tactics now \nmatched the  ever more ferocious haircuts as  he tried to \nshake off  the  tag  as  Superbike’s Randy Mamola —  the \nbest guy never to  win the  title. But  the  king of the \nrostrum-or-straw-bales school of racing was still  Ducati \nveteran Pierfrancesco Chili, now firmly established as \neveryone's favourite. He  ruined his  chances of the  title \nby crashing hard enough in  the  very first race to  put  him \nout  of the  second. He  then won the  first  race of the \nsecond round and  broke down in  Race 2.  In the  UK,  at \nDonington, where the  only more popular Italian was  the \njockey Frankie Dettori, Chili fell  in Race 1, then overtook \nSlight on  the  final bend of Race 2 to finish second. You \ncould hear the  cheer in Bologna. \nThere was the  odd scrap of comfort for  Suzuki and \nYamaha. Jamie Whitham used the  Suzuki's undoubted \npower at  Hockenheim and Monza, the  two fastest \ntracks on  the  calendar, to  get two third places, although \nthe  GSX-R was still  conspicuously unhappy over the \nslower, bumpy circuits like  Laguna Seca and Brands \nHatch. Scott Russell followed up  Edwards's Aussie \nrostrum finish with a fighting third at  Hockenheim and \na second at  Brands Hatch. The  German race was a little \ngem: Scott got away with the  leaders, vital on  the  long \nStraights of Hockenheim, then gleefully outbraked, \nblocked and  otherwise harried the faster bikes, finally \nputting himself in the  right place on  the  right-hander \ninto the  stadium section on  the  last  lap.  In the  second \nrace, Whitham did  much the  same but  it was a  race that \nshould have been won by Neil  Hodgson. He  had  a two- \nsecond lead at  one point but was mugged by Fogarty, \nhis team-mate, on  that same right-hander, with enough \nforce to  rattle him  into  running wide on  the  next \nleft  and losing any  chance of a  rostrum. Fogarty was \ncelebrating on  the  slow-down lap when James came \nalongside him  and  a wonderful pantomime of jabbing \nfingers followed until Foggy realised his friend would be \non  the  rostrum with him. \nHaving ridden the  best race of his Superbike career, \nHodgson then broke a  kneecap in a training accident. It \nwas symptomatic of the  way his  luck had  run  over the \npast couple of years and ruined what was a vital season \nfor the  youngster just as  it looked as  if everything was \ncoming together. \nMonza also saw the  end  of Colin Edwards's Superbike \nseason. He was hit  by fellow Yamaha man Jean-Philippe \nRuggia in  untimed practice with enough force to  break \nthe  American's wrist. After trying to  come back at \nLaguna Seca, Edwards decided to  have everything fixed \nat  once. As well as  the  wrist he would have a collarbone \nreplated and  both sets  of cruciate knee ligaments \nRight: Superbike welcomed _ Inset: Fogarty on  his way \nScott Russell back with open to winning the  first  race in \narms —  he appeared to  be Austria in front of Yanagawa, \nenjoying himself too. Chili, Slight, Crafar and \nKocinski. \n104 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \n\n\n\n\n\nrepaired so,  not  surprisingly, he  didn’t reappear and \nwas replaced by British young gun  Chris Walker for the \nnext four meetings and  Noriyuki Haga for the  last  two \nrounds. Edwards left  Superbike with some prophetic \nwords: ‘The championship is Fogarty’s to  lose.’ \nKocinksi, meanwhile, was making a stealthy start \nto the season. The  atrocious weather at the  first  two \nrounds undoubtedly helped him  and  he scored two \nwins and  a second in the wet, but  in the  dry he only \nmanaged seventh in the  second race at Australia and \nthen tenth and  fifth at Donington. Things changed at \nthe fast  tracks, though: he was  second in Hockenheim’s \nfirst race but  claims he was bumped by Fogarty on  the \nfirst lap of the  second race and  could only manage 14th. \nKocinski was also living up to  his  reputation for \nbeing difficult. Aaron Slight and  he didn't exchange any \ninformation and  Aaron said publicly that he wouldn't \naccept team orders. The  American also decided that \nhe wouldn't talk  to certain journalists and  avoided \nthe  cameras of some photographers. He  even got the \nHonda team’s PR man to fire off a three-page letter of \ncomplaint to one  American magazine. No  matter what \nquestion he was  asked he would answer by telling you \nhow happy he was  to  be on  a  Honda —  so  often that \nit became a  paddock and  press-room joke. Journalists \nwould go  up to each other and  ask  in mock seriousness: \n‘Did you  know Kocinski was happy to  be on  a  Honda?’ \nIt was also noticeable how close he was to Japanese \nmembers of the  Castrol Honda team. The  rumour mill \nsaid  that Kocinski’s objective was  to get a  ride  in 500 \nGPs  with Honda and  that he had  to win  the  Superbike \ntitle  first, although it seemed more likely that Honda \nwould want to see  the  number-one plate on  the track in \nSuperbike in 1998, the  50th anniversary of the founding \nof the  Honda Motor Company. \nOne thing was certain. The  two men who looked \nlikely to contest the title  now heartily disliked each \nother. Carl Fogarty likes to  have a  hate figure with \nwhich to whet his will  to win. First it was Scott Russell,. \nwho Foggy enjoyed sniping at, then Aaron Slight, but \nthat was all kindergarten stuff compared to the  intense \ndislike he and Kocinski developed for each other. Before \nthe  Brands Hatch round, Kocinski used one  of the \ntabloids to  refer to the  Ducati team as  ‘the  Mafia’, a \nphrase he'd also used about his old  employers in Kenny \nRoberts's Yamaha GP team. Foggy retaliated in another \ntabloid by calling Kocinski ‘a freak of nature’. This was \nnot  the  slapstick of Foggy and  Russell playing to the \ngallery: it was  genuine hostility. \nCarl Fogarty’s very untypical start to the  season —  in \nwhich he seemed to  be happy with points rather than \nwins —  gave way to a crisis of confidence after Kocinski’s \ndouble win  at home in the  USA. At  both Brands Hatch \nand  the  A1-Ring Carl  crashed soon after Kocinski had \ncome past him. In the  UK  he took Simon Crafar down \nwith him, in Austria he punted Kocinski into  a sand trap, \nalthough the American was  able to  rejoin and  finish \nthird. That incident, plus Chili crashing and  taking down \nthe  luckless Crafar (‘if he  had  a duck it’d  sink’ —  Steve \nParrish), gave Yanagawa a clear run  to the  flag and \nhis debut win. The  Japanese rider broke new ground \nby taking his  pet  miniature terrier Mew to the  rostrum \nand  announcing that the  hound liked the  taste of \nchampagne so  he must win  more races. \nThe next round was at Assen, where Fogarty hadn't \nbeen beaten since 1992, surely a vital test  for  his  mental \ntoughness. In the  first  race Kocinski was nothing short \nof awesome. He  made an  appalling start, then swept \nthrough the  field overtaking every other works bike \nas  If it wasn't there and  ghosting past Fogarty on  the \npenultimate lap.  Fogarty fans were relieved to  see  that \nat least he coped with the  sight of Kocinski in front of \nhim. In the  second race Kocinksi made another dreadful \nstart and  could only carve through to third this  time, as \nChili shepherded Foggy home. Assen was a  one-all draw \nbut  Kocinski got another boost when it was announced \nthat Niall Mackenzie was likely to  lose his third place \nfrom Brands Hatch following a fuel  test. As  Kocinksi had \nfinished one place behind the  Scot, that meant an  extra \nthree points if the  FIM  confirmed the  finding. \nAll  of which made the  Spanish round crucial. Fogarty \nhad  done the  double there twice for  Ducati and  said \nthat, with only the  Far  Eastern rounds left, he had  to win \nboth races to stand a chance of the title. Kocinski took \npole as  he had  done at Assen, his first of the  season, \nwith Foggy second, but  ominously for the  British rider \nthe  next Ducati rider was Frankie Chili back in seventh \nand over a second slower. The  writing was on  the  wall. \nAlbacete is a difficult place to  pass except, according \nto  Kocinski, if you’re on  a  Honda. He  delivered this  gem \nto a TV  reporter, but for once there was a ghost of a \nsmile and  a  hint  of irony. He  had  been notably nicer with \nthe  press since Brands Hatch when, according to  one \nAmerican insider, John had  been told by the  men from \nhead office to  lighten up;  but this  was different, the  guy \nwas positively relaxed and  enjoying himself. He  enjoyed \nthe  first race even more when Fogarty crashed out  of \na safe second place. That, said Carl, was  what you  got \nfor  riding a  bike  over its limits, before adding that  the \ntitle  was now gone. While the  Honda team hadn't just \nkept Kocinski happy but  developed the  RC45 into  the \nbest bike out  there, the  Ducati team appeared to  have \nstood still. Chili was the  first Ducati home in fifth. In the \nsecond race a wayward Gregorio Lavilla punted Foggy \ninto  the  sandpit on  the  second corner; Carl  got  back on \nthe track dead last  and  was  up to  ninth when he again \nlost the  front end. The  first  Ducati? Chili again, this time \nin seventh. \nKocinski, now with a  55-point lead, lost  no  time \nrubbing salt  into  his old  team's wounds. ‘The next race \nis in Japan, | think Ducati'’ll feel  far from home.’ He  was \nright. No  Ducati rider made the  rostrum, and Foggy \nfell  again. Kocinski’s third place in the  second race was \nenough. He  became the  first rider to win  both a  Grand \nPrix  and  a Superbike World Championship. He was \nobviously very happy to  be on  a  Honda. However, two \nvery risky manoeuvres in Indonesia lost  him a lot of the \nBrownie points he  had  gained with Honda over the \nseason. It looked like  the  leopard had  not  changed his \nspots after all. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 107 \nLeft: Noriyuki Haga \nwon at  Sugo and  saved \nYamaha's face. \nInset right: James \nWhitham gave it a \nhundred per  cent, as \nusual, on  the  recalcitrant \nSuzuki. \nInset left: At the  Al-Ring \nAkira Yanagawa became \nthe  first  Japanese rider \nto win  a  round of the \nchampionship outside \nJapan. \nA \n\nBelow: Akira \nYanagawa’s dog \nMew makes friends \nwith John Kocinski \non  the  Austrian \nrostrum. \n1997 \nSEASON RESULTS \nRound 1 -  Australia \nPhillip Island, 23  March \nRace 1 \nJohn Kocinski, USA, Honda \nCarl Fogarty, GB,  Ducati \nSimon Crafar, NZ,  Kawasaki \nAkira Yanagawa, Jap, Kawasaki \nTroy Bayliss, Aus, Suzuki \nMarty Craggill, Aus, Kawasaki \nScott Russell, USA, Yamaha \nAndreas Meklau, Aut, Ducati \nShawn Giles, Aus, Honda \n10 Pere Riba Cabana, Spa, Honda \n11 Jason Love, Aus, Ducati \n12 Igor Jerman, Slo, Kawasaki \n13.

He  departed for  GPs without a  backward \nglance, leaving behind him  a  motorcycle that was now \nprobably the  best package out  there. Aaron Slight \ncontinued with Castrol Honda but  at  last  had  a  team- \nmate with whom he could get  on  —  Colin Edwards \nThe  young American had  abandoned the  allegedly \nuncompetitive Yamaha without a  win to  his  name, but \nno-one doubted that he was a  winner \nThere was also the  small matter of  1998 being the \n50th anniversary of the  Honda Motor Company. That's \nthe  sort of landmark the  Big  H took very seriously \nPre-season, the  smart money was on  Aaron and \nthe  RC45, not  just  because of the  V4’s improvement \nbut  because of what was happening at  Ducati. As  Carl \nFogarty had  found on  his  return to  the  Bologna team in \n1997, the  996 Ducati was very different from the  955 \nhe’d left  behind in  ‘95,  and  the  bike still  wasn’t to  his \nliking when the  season got  under way. There was also \na  lot  of politics to  contend with. Ducati had contracte \nthree riders —  Foggy, Frankie Chili and Troy Corser, \nreturning to  Superbike after an  abortive year in  GPs \nThey solved this  embarrassment of  r \ntwo works teams. Virginio Ferrari's flagship Ducati C \nteam took Chili and Corser, while Foggy was har \nto  be  the  only rider in  the Ducati Performance team \nmanaged by Davide Tardozzi —  who'd taken Corser to \nhis  title \nDucati’s assurances that all  three factory riders would \nbe  treated equally were soon being doubted, not  least \nby Tardozzi, who complained that the flow of  testing \ninformation went one only. By  mid-season Ducati’s \nAmerican owners had decided that there would be \nonly one works team in  1999, and that it  would have \nonly two riders, which cranked inter-team tens \nanother notch. The fact that Ferrari and Tardozz \nhardly be  described as  bes \nfire, but it wasn’t until Assen that the general put \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 111 \n\nPrevious spread: Carl \nFogarty, a  master of \ncontrolled aggression. \nRight: He  was in the  single- \nrider Ducati Performance \nteam but  had Davide \nTardozzi as  his  manager. \nMiddle right: Gregorio \nLavilla demonstrated that \nhe  was far  and away \nthe  championship’s best \nprivateer. Here he’s on  his \nway to  third place at  home \nin Spain. \nBottom right: Foggy with \nthe  spoils of victory. \nBelow: Honda’s new boy \nColin Edwards prepares \nto  experience another \nnewcomer —  Superpole. \nbecame aware of the  friction. \nSuzuki continued with the  carburetted version of \ntheir GSX-R750, despite having a fuel-injected model \nin  the  shops, but  at  least their fortunes improved \nover the  season. And they didn’t suffer the  sort  of \nhumiliation at  the  hands of importer teams that had  so \nembarrassed them at  Phillip Island in  1997 when Troy \nBayliss outperformed the  works team by a  distance. \nAussie Peter Goddard replaced Mike Hale in the \nWorld Superbike team, bringing with him  a wealth of \nexperience, not  least in bike development. The fact that \nhe’d won the  Australian Superbike Championship and \nthe  World Endurance Championship on  GSX-Rs didn’t \nhurt either. James Whitham, who'd scored Suzuki's \nonly rostrums the  previous year, retained his  place. For \nthe  first half  of the  season Goddard outperformed his \nteam-mate, but  Whitham came on  strong in the  second \nhalf. The highlight was his  race-long pursuit of Fogarty \nat  Brands Hatch in front of 82,000 people, which ended \nwith James setting a  new lap record on  his way to  third \nplace, Suzuki's only rostrum of the  year. \nThe  four-cylinder bike everyone thought would do \nthe  business was the  Kawasaki. Akira Yanagawa was \nmany people’s tip for a  hatful of race wins and  a shot \nat the  title, and  surely Neil Hodgson would at  last  live \nup to  his  potential on  a bike he  immediately seemed at \nhome on.  But  the  Green challenge never materialised. \nThe  team's 1998-spec motors blew up  in their final pre- \nseason tests, Yanagawa struggled in  Round 1 at  Phillip \nIsland, where he'd been a contender in ‘97,  and  it took \nthem half  a season to  regain their momentum. Akira \nwas competitive in  Round 7 at  Kyalami, however, setting \nthe  fastest lap of the  second race. \nThen came Laguna Seca. Yanagawa and Doug \nChandler —  still  fast, still  wearing green —  trailed a \nrunaway Troy Corser, with the  American closing fast \non  the  Japanese. Going into  the  Corkscrew something \nhappened on  Doug's bike —  probably a  clip-on broke \n—  and he fell  under braking. The bike slid  straight on \nand scooped up  Akira as  he arrived at the  apex. It was \na  horrible-looking crash, a  cartwheeling blur of dust, \nmen and machines, with Yanagawa doing a sickening \nimpersonation of a  rag  doll  before ending up crumpled \nand  motionless on  the  far side  of the  track. His  team- \nmate Neil  Hodgson was one  of the  first  to stop and \nstood waving on  the  track, trying to  get the  authorities \nto  put the  red  flag out. The race was restarted, but \nan  equally horrible start-line pile-up that badly injured \nBontempi and  —  crucially —  Slight meant another red \nflag, and  the  result was  taken from the  lap before the \nChandler/Yanagawa crash. With cruel irony, that gave \nthe  lower two rostrum places to the  Kawasaki riders (the \nfirst  Green rostrums of the  year) while they were both \non  their way to  hospital. \nThe  four-cylinder team that wasn’t supposed to  do \nwell was Yamaha, yet they confounded all expectations \nthanks to  the  arrival of a  new star  —  no,  make that \nsuperstar —  Noriyuki Haga. Nori-chan (he prefers the \ninformal mode of address usually used for children \nrather than the  customary Haga-san) had  saved much \n\ncorporate face in  the  penultimate round of  1997 by \nwinning the  second race. It wasn’t just  Yamaha's \nonly win  in  Superbike, it was the  factory's only win  in \nany  World Championship road-racing class that year, \nincluding all  three GP  formulae and  World Endurance. \nFrankly, no-one expected anything more this  season, but \nNoriyuki astonished the  world by leaving the  first round \nlevel on  points with Fogarty at  the  top  of the  table, with \na third place and a win. \nBetween the  first  two Superbike rounds he took \ntime out  to  debut on  a  500 as  a wild-card entry in  the \nJapanese GP.  With apparent ease he  ran  with the  top \nmen and ended up  third —  and it should have been \nsecond, but  for the  vastly experienced Tady Okada \nmugging him  at the  chicane last  time round. Jaws \ndropped in  both Superbike and GP  paddocks. When \nHaga went to  Donington (for the  first  time, don’t \nforget), won both races and  stormed to  the  top  of the \ntable, chins hit the  floor Tom and  Jerry style. \nThe  flip side to the  instant deification of Haga was \nthe  descent into personal hell  for  Scott Russell. He’d put \na  price on  his  return to  the  team —  a  switch to  Michelin \ntyres. Uniquely, the  team let  him change to  the  French \nrubber, but  Haga stayed with Dunlop. The  sight of the \nnew boy comprehensively outperforming him  on  the \ntyres he'd rejected cannot have been comfortable for \nthe  ex-champ. There followed a succession of mystery \nretirements and  lacklustre races. The  nadir came at \nLaguna Seca, where Scott led  the  second race after the \nmost blatant of jump-starts only to  crash half-way round \nthe  first lap.  He  arrived back at the  Yamaha pit grinning \nsheepishly where he was pointedly ignored by his crew. \nThe  sight of a  great champion in decline wasn't made \nany  more palatable by the  fact that he’d started the  year \nwinning a  record fifth Daytona 200. \nThe major innovation for  1998 was Superpole, an \nidea lifted from the  Suzuka 8 Hours and  some American \nfour-wheeled racing in an  attempt to  spice up  qualifying \nfor the  TV  cameras. In Superpole, the  top  16 from \nregular qualifying go forward to  do  one  flying lap that \ndecides their grid position; one mistake, and  that fastest \ntime in regular qualifying mutates into  the  fourth row \nof the  grid. Not  surprisingly, the  riders were unanimous \nin disliking the  system intensely. Even Troy Corser, by \nfar the  best qualifier of the  year, said on  every possible \noccasion how much he disliked the  concept. \nThe trouble with Superpole is that it’s  fine until \nthe  weather refuses to  co-operate, as  at  Donington, \nAlbacete and Assen. British wild card James Haydon \nbecame the  first man to  crash in Superpole when he \nfell  on  his out-lap at  Donington. He’d been kept waiting \nfor over 30  seconds in  near-freezing conditions and his \ntyre had  cooled off so  much —  probably by 30°  —  that he \nknew he was in  trouble as  soon as  he  left  the  pit lane. \nThe riders’ insistence that Superpole might endanger \ntheir safety seemed to  have some basis in  truth, but  it \nwas the  farce at Albacete that was really embarrassing. \nRain half-way through Superpole saw the  top  16 split \ninto two groups, with the  result that the  top  eight \nwere slower than the  second eight. Try explaining that \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 113 \n\nAbove right: Noriyuki Haga \nalways liked to  put  on  a \nshow for  the  fans. \nBelow right: Corser and \nHaga added considerable \nentertainment value \n—  although Troy was \nunamused by this  attack at \nLaguna Seca. \nBelow and bottom: \nFrankie Chili loses the \nfront end at the  final \nchicane and  precipitates the \nBattle of Assen. \nto  TV  viewers or  newspaper readers. And that’s the \nnub  of  the  matter. Superpole was designed for TV,  yet \nthere’s nothing visually exciting about one bike going \nround a  track on  its  own, no  matter how fast it’s  doing \nt.  Superpole can  seem exciting when the  hour-long \nprocess is  edited down to  a  five-minute highlights \npackage, but  live  it’s  right up  there with watching paint \ndry.  Thankfully the  wet-weather rules were changed \nafter Albacete to  a  system almost identical to that \nused by Formula 1 —  that is,  a 50-minute final session \nfor the  fastest 16 from regular qualifying, which, like \ndry Superpole, discounts all that has  gone before. \nt was used twice and both times provided brilliant \nentertainment in totally different ways. Let’s face it, \nf the  F1  cars use  this  system it must be TV-friendly; \nBernie’s boys don't arrive at their procedures by chance. \nOver the  20-year history of the  championship, the \ntwo perennial complaints have been the  disjointed \ncalendar and the  quality of the  supporting races. This \nseason started out  with two races a  month from March \nthrough to  October, with one race in  both April and \nSeptember. It was the  best-planned schedule yet, but \nthe  collapse of the  Tiger Economies of the  Pacific Basin \nsaw the  opening round in  Indonesia and  the  final round \nin  Malaysia cancelled. The  result was a  month of waiting \nbetween the  penultimate round at  Assen and  the  finale \nin  Sugo. Not  ideal, but  on  this  occasion unavoidable. To \nno-one’s surprise, the  Brazilian round was also cancelled, \nbut  this  cloud had a silver lining: Superbike became the \nfirst motorsport World Championship to  return to  South \nAfrica after the  fall  of apartheid and  the  election of \nNelson Mandela. \nThe Supersport World Series that supported \nthe  Superbikes was supposed to  receive full  World \nChampionship status, and even though it didn’t get that \npromotion the  class went a  long way towards answering \ncriticisms of the  support classes. Works teams from \nDucati, Suzuki, Honda and  Yamaha gave the  class real \nstrength in  depth, and  the  fans full  value for  money. \nTragically, the  class lost  its finest exponent when Michael \nPaquay died at  Monza after a  qualifying accident. The \nBelgian had  been European Supersport Champion in \n1993 on  a  Honda, and  again in  ‘95  on  a  Ducati, and \nwas leading the  Castrol Honda team as  they prepared \nfor the World Championship due in  1999. As  well as \nbeing a  superb rider —  the  best yet  produced by the  class \n—  he was also a thoroughly decent person. \nNoriyuki Haga’s impact on  Superbike was immediate \nand  impressive, but  two big crashes in qualifying for \nRound 3 at  Monza slowed him  down. He  had  to  be \ncarried to  his  bike, but  still  managed to  race and scored \nenough points to  keep the  championship lead. Monza, \nthough, was really noticeable for the  maiden victory of \nColin Edwards. It had been a while coming, and when \nhe  backed it up  in  Race 2 to  score a  double we  were \n\ntreated to  the  unusual sight of  a works Honda blowing \nup.  In all  his years in  World Superbike Aaron Slight \nhad  never scored a  double win, something that really \nbugged him. The sight of his  new team-mate heading \nfor the  double caused Aaron to  over-rev the  RC45 \nfor  longer than the  prescribed ten  seconds riders are \nallowed to  use  in  emergencies. The  result was a very big \nbang indeed. \nHappily Aaron didn't have to  wait long to  score his \nown double, and  the  fact  that it came at  Misano made \nit doubly sweet. The  Italian track has  historically been \nDucati country —  the  only non-Ducati win had  been John \nKocinksi’s, in  his  championship year in  1997 —  but  most \nteam personnel remembered 1995 when the  Castrol \nHonda team suffered its  most humiliating weekend \nas  Aaron struggled to  16th and 13th places. Aaron's \ndouble was proof positive that the  RC45 was now the \nbest all-round package on  the  grid. Revenge, the  Italian \nsaying goes, is a  dish best eaten cold. \nFrankie Chili also got  his first-ever double at the  new \nKyalami venue in South Africa, and  to the  amazement \nof many it was in the  dry! This was also the  race where \nGregorio Lavilla backed up  his wet-weather third place \nat  home in Spain by taking third place in the  dry,  in \nRace 1, and proved he was a cut  above the  rest  of \nthe  privateers. The  fact  that he was also Spanish was \npolitically useful. \nWell into  the  season four men had  pulled away from \nthe  field. The usual suspects —  Slight, Fogarty and  Corser \n—  were there, but  surprisingly so  was Frankie Chill. Three \nof them had  had  bad  meetings —  Fogarty in the  wet  in \nGermany, Chili at  home in Misano, and  Slight at  Laguna \nSeca, where the  injury he  picked up  threatened to  put \nhim  out  of Brands Hatch as  well —  while Corser plugged \naway, and  although he didn’t win  a  lot  he always \nseemed to  be on  the  rostrum. Not  that his achievements \nshould be  underestimated; after all,  he’d hardly sat  on  a \nbike all through 1997. He  did  win  two races, but  more \noften faded in mid-race only to  push hard at  the  end, - \ngiving rise  to  serious doubts about his  level of fitness. \nFit or  not, Troy led  the  championship going into \nthe  penultimate round in  Holland, but  only by the  slim \nmargin of  1.5  points from Slight, with Foggy 17.5 points \nfurther back and  Franki Chili still  in  touch another \n13  points in arrears. The  scene was now set  for the \nBattle of Assen. \nThe  first  shock came in Race 1 after the  three Ducati \nmen broke away from Slight. First Troy drifted off the \npace of the  other two. Chili was faster on  the  back of \nthe  circuit but  Foggy seemed to  be able to  retake first at \nwill  at the  chicane. Clearly it was going to  come down \nto the  last  lap, or  even the  last  corner. Sure enough, Chill \nshadowed Carl into the  last  lap and took him  on  the \nsweeping turns behind the  paddock. Carl shaped to  pass \nat the  chicane but  made a slight mistake and  couldn't \nget through. Afterwards, Foggy did  a  passable imitation \nof Mick Doohan moaning about acting as  a  tow-truck \nfor  riders who couldn't get  round on  their own. It was \nmerely a  warm-up for what was to  come. \nRace 2 was a  replay of Race 1, and  again it looked as \n_ a \n— ee ee \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 115 \n\nBelow: The three men \nwho went to  Sugo with a \nchance of  the 1998 title \nFoggy, Aaron Slight and \nCorser. \nRight: Cors \nthe battle be é \nstarted — he   « d  his \nribs and s! \nup  crash \nwarm- \n15  Waiting to  mug Foggy on  the  last  lap.

At  no \npoint did  the  two Ducatis touch, but  while Foggy was \ncelebrating in  the  pit lane an  incensed Frankie arrived \nand  tried to  attack Carl. The Italian was hustled away \nand  everyone assumed that was the  end of events, but \nhalf  an  hour later Frankie, wearing a  blue towelling \ndressing-gown, invaded the  winner's press conference \nand  accused Foggy of dangerous riding in  the  fast \ncorners and said he fell  because he was so  angry. Once \nagain he tried to  land a  punch on  Fogarty. No-one could \nunderstand why Chili had  flipped out, and Carl didn’t \ncare. He  was now in with a  genuine chance of the  title, \nas  the  top  three in the  championship would go  to  the \nlast  round just six  points apart. \nWhat caused Chili's outburst? After all,  no-one could \nsee  anything out  of the  ordinary about Fogarty’s riding. \nOver the  next few weeks more information leaked \nout  about the  political situation at  Ducati. It transpired \nthat to  secure one  of the  two seats in  the  1999 works \nteam Frankie had  to  finish in  the  top  three in  the \nchampionship, and his  fall  had  effectively scuppered any \nhope of that. His  team-manager Virginio Ferrari was also \nimplicated in  fanning the  flames as  part of his  fight with \nTardozzi. \nEveryone had  a  month to  calm down before the \nshowdown in  Sugo and the  closest finish to  a World \nSuperbike Championship since Tardozzi rode and  fought \nwith Fred Merkel in  the  late  1980s. Corser and  Slight \nstarted the  weekend half  a  point apart, with Foggy \n5.5  points further behind in third. Superpole showed \nthat the  whole works Honda squad was in trouble \nas  Slight dropped from third to tenth, with All-Japan \nChampionship leader Itoh’s RC45 one place further back \nand  Edwards in  15th. Somehow, Honda and  Michelin \nhad  failed to  give Aaron the  tools to  do the job. \nBut  the  big drama came in  Sunday morning warm- \n\nup.  Troy Corser, who'd been fastest \noff  at  the  end of  the  front straight, \ncogging down one gear too  many. He \nelbow under his  body and broke three rit \nwas going to  race. Then his  temperature rocket \nhe  was taken to  hospital with suspected spleer \nThe championship leader was out  of  the  race after \nooking stronger than he  had  all  season \nWhen the  green lights came on  Haga disappeared \neaving Fogarty fighting with two local Suzuki men, Ryo \nand Kitagawa. When Haga threw away a  certain win \nthe  Suzuki men went past Carl and took the  factory's \nirst  ever one-two finish, leaving the  Englishman to  fret \nabout his  rear tyre and a  late  charge from Yanagawa \nSlight could only manage seventh compared to  Carl's \nthird place, so  the  arithmetic was now simple. Carl led \nthe  championship for  the  first time since the  start of \nthe  year but  with the  slimmest of  margins —  1.5  points \nAssuming they ran  at  the  front of the  field, whicheve \nof them crossed the  line  first in  Race 2 would be  Wo \nChampion. \nThis time Haga didn't make any  mistakes and no-one \nsaw which way he  went. Fogarty got  away in  second, \nwith Slight in  touch in  fourth, but  that was as  close as \nthe  Kiwi got. Carl reeled off  the  laps to  finish fourth, \nwith Slight four seconds behind in  sixth. Carl Fogarty \nbecame the  first man to  win  the  title  three times and \nthe  first to  regain (as  opposed to  retain) the  crown. On \nthe  slow-down lap he  stopped the  bike and slumped \nover the  tank in  tears. It was a  title won by sheer \nbloody-mindedness on  a  bike that wasn't to  his  liking at \nthe  start of the  year. \nWith hindsight, it was obvious really. When it comes \ndown to  a  fight the  man you want on  your side is  Car! \nFogarty. If the  top  of the  championship was  full  of \nfamiliar names, it looked as  if the  political landscape was \nabout to  change. The  first suggestions that the  500cc \nGP  formula be altered to  accommodate four-strokes \nemerged from the  factories, and alarmist statements \nappeared in  some Spanish and Italian magazines to  the \neffect that there would be  no  works bikes in  World \nSuperbike after the  2000 season \nWhat actually happened was that a  big meeting \nheld before the  Austrian round between the  FIM, SBK \nInternational and senior engineers from all  four Japanese \nfactories, plus Ducati and Aprilia, decided that for  the \n2001 World Championship each manufacturer would \nproduce at  least 30  race kits  for  their homologated \nmachinery for  sale at  a fixed price of around £23,000 \nfor  four-cylinder machines. All  entrants would have to \nuse  only original homologated parts or  these new kit \nparts, the  idea being to  make competitive machinery \navailable to  privateers. The meeting also decided that \nld \ni‘ manufacturers entering the  championship for  the  first \nY \ntime \nwould \nbenefit \nfrom \na \nrelaxation \nof \nthe \nproduction \ni requirement for  homologation. This could be  interpreted \nas  a  Slight move towards the  more stringent Supersport \nregulations, but in  no  way could it be  seen as  the end of \nfull  works bikes. If, of  course, it  happened \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 117 \n\nBelow: Kitagawa \nand  Ryo celebrate \nSuzuki's first  ever \none-two. \nSEASON RESULTS \n9938 \nRound 1 -  Australia \nPhillip Island, 22  March \nRace \nWOANDUBWN—S \nrs) be} a o \nOBNADMNRBWN— \n1 \nCarl Fogarty, GB,  Ducati \nTroy Corser, Aus, Ducati \nNoriyuki Haga, Jap, Yamaha \nPierfrancesco Chili, Ita,  Ducati \nAkira Yanagawa, Jap, Kawasaki \nark  Willis, Aus, Suzuki \nColin Edwards, USA, Honda \nNeil Hodgson, GB,  Kawasaki \nAaron Slight, NZ,  Honda \nScott Russell, USA, Yamaha \nGregorio Lavilla, Spa, Ducati \nPiergiorgio Bontempi, Ita,  Kawasaki \nLucio Pedercini, Ita,  Ducati \nMal  Campbell, Aus, Ducati \ngor  Jerman, Slo, Kawasaki \nN \noriyuki Haga, Jap, Yamaha \nAaron Slight, NZ,  Honda \nCarl Fogarty, GB,  Ducati \nPeter Goddard, Aus, Suzuki \nAkira Yanagawa, Jap, Kawasaki \nTroy Corser, Aus, Ducati \nColin Edwards, USA, Honda \nScott Russell, USA, Yamaha \nMark Willis, Aus, Suzuki \nSteve Martin, Aus, Ducati \nGregorio Lavilla, Spa, Ducati \nJames Whitham, GB,  Suzuki \nShawn Giles, Aus, Honda \nCraig Connell, Aus, Ducati \nAlessandro Gramigni, Ita,  Ducati \nStandings —  1 Haga & Fogarty 41; \n3 Corser 30; 4 Slight 27; 5 Yanagawa 22; \n6 Edwards 18 \nRound 2 -  Great Britain \nDonington Park, 13  April \nRace \nONUHDURWN=F7 FRON=BoSOCWVHDUAWN— \nfal © \n1 \nNoriyuki Haga, Jap,  Yamaha \nTroy Corser, Aus, Ducati \nPierfrancesco Chili, Ita,  Ducati \nAaron Slight, NZ,  Honda \nAkira Yanagawa, Jap,  Kawasaki \nColin Edwards, USA, Honda \nCarl Fogarty, GB,  Ducati \nJames Whitham, GB,  Suzuki \nPeter Goddard, Aus, Suzuki \nSteve Hislop, GB,  Yamaha \nChris Walker, GB,  Kawasaki \nNeil  Hodgson, GB,  Kawasaki \nScott Russell, USA, Yamaha \nPiergiorgio Bontempi, Ita,  Kawasaki \nJames Haydon, GB,  Suzuki \n2 \nNoriyuki Haga, Jap,  Yamaha \nTroy Corser, Aus, Ducati \nCarl Fogarty, GB,  Ducati \nAaron Slight, NZ,  Honda \nPierfrancesco Chili, Ita,  Ducati \nNiall Mackenzie, GB,  Yamaha \nColin Edwards, USA, Honda \nJames Whitham, GB,  Suzuki \n9 Steve Hislop, GB,  Yamaha \n10 Peter Goddard, Aus, Suzuki \n11.

With the  number-one plate on  his  Ducati, he \ntook a  double win in the  first round and  was never \nheaded in the  points table in either year. If anything, this \ntitle  was even more impressive than those that had  gone \nbefore, but  if you  think that  would make the  season, \nwell, boring, think again. Superbike got a full  quota of \nworks teams with the  arrival of Aprilia to join the  big \nfour Japanese factories and Ducati and, like  their fellow- \ncountrymen, the  Noale company opted for a V-twin. \nAdmittedly, this  was a development year for the  team, \nwith just one regular rider —  the  veteran Aussie Peter \nGoddard —  with the  occasional help of factory test  rider \nAntonello, but  no  other two-wheeled motorsport could \nboast the  official involvement of six factories. Crowds \nwere also up —  massively in the  case of both Italian \nraces and  the  USA. The  average increase was 30  per \ncent, with an  astonishing 41  per  cent being the  biggest \nimprovement. \nThe  old  problem of the  supporting races was well \nand truly solved with World Championship status for \nthe  Supersport class and European Championship for \nthe  new Superstock class for  under-24s only. British \nfans were also pleased to see  that the  sidecars soldiered \non,  with the  evergreen Steve Webster MBE at  the  front \nagain. There were lots  of new motorbikes, too. As  well \nas  the  new-from-the-ground-up Aprilia, there was \nYamaha's R7  in Superbike and  the  equally new R6  in \nSupersport. But  yet again it was the  Honda RC45 that \nstarted the  season as  favourite. Now Colin Edwards had \na  season on  the  V4  under his  belt he would surely give \nteam-mate Aaron Slight the  hurry-up to  the  benefit of \nthe  whole team. It didn’t quite work out  like  that, for \nAaron's form faded and  he  fell  out  drastically with Colin \nElsewhere there had been some shuffling of \npersonnel over the  close season, and true to  their word \nDucati fielded just  one  works team, Ducati Corse. The \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 121 \n\n\n\nmanagement struggle from 1998 was well and  truly \nwon by Davide Tardozzi, leaving a  disgruntled Virginio \nFerrari on  the  sidelines conferring with his  lawyers. \nTroy Corser stayed in the  team and  was reunited with \nTardozzi, who had  taken the  Aussie to  his title  as \nmanager of the  Power Horse Ducati team in  1996. \nFrankie Chili, the  man who made way for  Foggy at \nDucati Corse, signed for the  Suzuki team under its new \nmanagement by Francis Batta’s Alstare organisation and \nwith high-profile sponsorship from Corona, the  Mexican \nbeer company. Japan insisted that Katsuaki Fujiwara \nbe the  second rider. Things did  not  look good at the \nstart of the  year. A despondent Frankie was  33  seconds \nbehind the  winner in Round 1, but  hard work with his \nDunlop tyre  technicians reaped dividends, starting with \na  morale-boosting Superpole at  Round 3.  By Round 5 at \nMonza he was able to finish under a  second behind the \nwinner, then win in the  rain in Austria —  Suzuki's first- \never World Superbike victory outside Japan —  and  finally \nwin  a dry race in Germany. \nThat German win may have come after Foggy had \nwrapped up  his title, but the  battle with Carl and  Aaron \nSlight on  the  last  lap was as  fine  a piece of racecraft as \nyou  could hope to see. Unfortunately, Fujiwara was no \nhelp to Chili, despite being good enough to  get on  the \nrostrum at Sugo when he was a Japanese Championship \nrider and  was thought to  be a  prospect for the  Grand \nPrix  team. But  after the first-corner crash he instituted in \nthe  1998 Catalan GP,  Superbike was meant to  be akin \nto  rehabilitation. At least he stopped crashing, but  in ‘99 \nhe appeared to take more trouble over his haircut and \nclothes than his  racing and  looked like  he was  enjoying \nhimself too  much, given the  paucity of his  results. What \ncould Chili have done with more solid back-up from his \nteam-mate? Nevertheless, Frankie's heroics endeared \nhim  not just to the  team but  also  to the fans, not  least \nthe  Brits, who'd taken no  time at all in forgiving him  for \nhis attacks on  Foggy at Assen the  previous year. \nNeil  Hodgson’s place in the  Kawasaki team was taken \nby Gregorio Lavilla, who had  impressed everyone with \nhis form on  a  private Ducati in  1998. Unfortunately, the \nswitch to  Dunlops didn’t suit  him  and he  had a rash of \ncrashes in the  second and  third rounds that severely \ndented his confidence. Akira Yanagawa continued \nas  the  number one at Team Green, managing two \nsecond places in Spain before he started crashing. It \nwas  debatable whether he was  fit to  race in Austria \nand Holland but  race he did,  and  then got  back on \nthe  rostrum at  Hockenheim where his  bike was at a \ndefinite disadvantage. When he won the  last  race of \nthe  year everyone in the  paddock smiled. However, the \nKawasaki was now the  last  carburetted, as  opposed \nto fuel-injected, bike in  the  paddock and  looked to \nbe struggling against the  V-twins and  even the  newer \nSuzuki and  Yamaha fours. \nThe  other new boy on  a works bike, Vitto Guareschi, \nalso struggled early on  as  Haga’s team-mate on  the  new \nR7,  although he was rewarded with a  rostrum finish in \nthat wet  Austrian race behind Fogarty. The big question \nin the  Yamaha camp was how would Haga cope not \nPrevious spread: Carl \nFogarty on  his way to  victory \nat  Donington. \nBelow: Another chance to \nprove that he was at the  top \nof the  WSBK food chain. \nLeft: Aprilia made their Above: Yamaha had  a  new \nfirst  foray into Superbike bike, the  R7, with Haga and \nwith the  beautiful RSV Guareschi riding. \nMille.

Typically he came out  with \nall guns blazing at  Kyalami and  put the  R7  on  the  front \nrow, rode the  wheels off  it to finish fourth in the  first \nrace, and  then crashed it at the  chicane in  Race 2. When \nhe  got  onto the  rostrum it was as  the  victor in Race 1 \nat Albacete —  this  time he blew it up  in  Race 2!  His  only \nother visit  to the  podium was at  Brands Hatch, his  least \nfavourite circuit. Nori-chan never ceased to  amaze all \nseason, although it was plain that he sometimes grew \nweary of fighting against the  odds and  sometimes didn’t \nshow among the  leaders all weekend. \nSo  it was left  to  the  usual suspects —  Slight, Corser \nand  Edwards —  to  battle Foggy for the  title, with the \n124 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nwo ws \nother factory riders getting the  occasional rostrum but \nnever truly being in  the  hunt for the  crown. Yet,  just  as \nin  1995, each of the  pretenders to  the  throne suffered \ninjury or  misfortune, real  or  imagined, that held them \nback. Edwards started the  season with torn shoulder \nmuscles from a testing accident at  Laguna Seca barely \ntwo weeks before the  first  round in  South Africa; he \nthen had  his  machine fail  in Spain when he  looked \na  good bet  for the  win in  Race 1.  His  tendency to \ndisappear from view at  some tracks was less  noticeable \nbut  still  afflicted him  at  a couple of places, noticeably \nLaguna Seca. \nTroy Corser suffered a  similar shoulder injury in \nSuperpole warm-up at Albacete, but  it was his  ever \nmore pronounced tendency to  fade in  the  middle of a \nrace that worried observers most. Give him  a sniff of \nthe  rostrum, though, or  specifically the  top  step of it, \nand  he was his  old  self. A scintillating double at  home \nin  Phillip Island reminded us  just why Troy had  won a \nWorld Championship, and  when Foggy fell  from the \nlead of Race 2 in  the  first German round a previously \ndisinterested Corser awoke to  put  a  stunning move on \nSlight and  take the  win. Ducati were not  happy and  told \nTroy so  —  this  despite the  fact that he was second overall \nafter every race of the  year bar  two. Unfortunately \nfor the  Aussie one of the  two was the  final round, \nsomething the  bosses in  Bologna didn’t appreciate. \nThe  falling out  between the  two Castrol Honda \nriders happened at  Donington Park when they came \ntogether on  the  exit  of the  Melbourne Loop, after Slight \noutbraked Edwards and Chili but  got  in  the  corner too \nhot. He  ran  wide on  the  exit  and Edwards cut  back \nunderneath him, they touched, and Slight went down. \nMost observers saw it as  a  racing incident but  the \nKiwi was on  his  feet and gesturing at  the  disappearing \nAmerican in  a manner that made it clear that he  saw \nit very differently. After a visit  to  the  pits, Slight got \n\nback on  track and let  Edwards through when he  lapped \nhim  but, as  Colin said, ‘flipped me  off’  (made a  rude \ngesture). Slight tucked in  behind his team-mate, but \nin  trying to  run  at  Colin's pace fell  at  Coppice and \ncompounded the  damage to  his  right little finger \nfrom the  first crash. When Edwards went to  Slight’s \nmotorhome afterwards to  check on  his  team-mate’s \nhealth he  quickly found he wasn’t welcome. ‘The only \nreason anyone's interested’, said a  puzzled Edwards, ‘is \nbecause we're on  the  same make of bike.’ \nAaron never really returned to  his  old  form, spending \nmuch of the  middle of the  season complaining of \nobscure problems with his  machinery. Little did  anyone \nknow that we  were seeing the  evidence of a  medical \ncondition that would threaten his  life. \nColin also got  to  play a  supporting role in  what was \ndefinitely the  race of the  year, and  a  strong candidate \nfor the  race of any  year. It happened at  Monza. Both \nraces came down to  three-man dices for the  rostrum \nbetween Edwards, Foggy and  Chili, although it was \nobvious that the  Italian's Suzuki could stay in  the \nSlipstream of the  twins but  couldn't pass. In  Race 1 \nFoggy somehow magicked extra speed through the \nawesome Parabolica turn that ends the  lap to  pass \nEdwards on  the  line  to win  by a tenth of a  second. \nAtypically, Colin threw his toys out  of the  pram and \nwater over a TV  camera. \nRace 2 was even closer. This time they went over \nthe  line  side by side, with Fogarty riding the  greatest \nlast  lap the  championship had  ever seen in  which he \nfirst dropped to  third, repassed Chili, got through the \nAscari chicane at  impossible angles of lean, then took \nan  improbably wide line  out  of the  Parabolica that took \nhim out  onto the  old  circuit. Even the  electronic timing \nsystem was confused, giving the  race to  Edwards, with \nthe  marshals at  the  first chicane signalling to  Foggy \nthat he was second. Then the  timing screens changed \nWhen Foggy got  back to  the  pit  lane he found his  crew \necstatically celebrating his  win  —  by five-thousandths of a \nsecond. Carl's first  words to  Tardozzi could serve as  the \nmotto for  his  coat of arms: ‘Never give up!  Never give \nup!’ Shown a  photo of the  finish, Carl was his  normal \ndry self: ‘Nah, won by miles!’ Colin was much happier \nthis  time and  even had  the  guts to  apologise for  being \nBelow: Frankie Chili got  his \nfirst win on  a  Suzuki at  the \nA1-Ring.

Italian magazine Moto \nSprint’s race report called Foggy ‘a force of nature’ and \n‘the perfect racer’. After those two races, it didn’t seem \nlike  hyperbole. \nEdwards was also central to another major drama, \nthis  time at the  Nurburgring in Germany. The meeting \nstarted under the  pall of a  personal tragedy for  Car! \nFogarty after the  two-year-old daughter of close friends \nhad  a fatal accident at  Fogarty’s home nine days before \nthe  meeting. Little Hannah Walsh's parents told Carl to \nwin  for  her.  He  did, pointing to the  sky and  collapsing \nover the  tank after taking the  chequered flag  in Race \n1.  ‘| had  to win  that at  all costs,’ said a sombre Carl. \n‘There’s a little girl who isn’t with us  any  more. Her  dad \ntold me  to win it.’ There was no  champagne on  the \nrostrum. \nThe  race had  provided drama of a  different type, and \nit was only by luck that another tragedy was avoided. \nIt started with Igor Jerman’s Kawasaki blowing up  on \nthe  run  to  Turn 1.  It was a  comprehensive bit of self- \ndestruction; coolant and oil were literally flowing out \nof the  belly-pan as  the  Slovenian pulled off  the  track. \nAstoundingly the  marshals did  not  display the  oil  flag  or \neven the  yellow flag. \nLeader Fogarty went through okay but  Yanagawa \nwent down, still  without bringing out  the  flags. Next \ntime round Haga lost  it on  the  oil,  saved the  crash, but \nran  across the  gravel for  100  yards before toppling off \nthe  Yamaha. Still  no  flags, despite the  crowd shouting \nat  the  marshals. Team-managers were going berserk in \nthe  pit  lane, with Tardozzi leading the  charge to  Race \nControl. Then Chili fell,  still  without the  flags coming \n126 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nout, and  headed straight for  Race Control, where he \nthreatened to  sue  everyone in sight for  loss  of earnings. \nTardozzi was screaming for the  race to  be stopped, \ndespite his  riders leading. Then Colin Edwards fell. \nUnlike the  more stoical Japanese and the  litigious \nChili, Edwards leapt to  his feet in  a  rage, waved his \narms, flung gravel on  to  the  track and  yelled at  the \nmarshals. He’d assumed the  spill had been cleared \nup  and  was livid. The marshals did  reluctantly put the \nflags out  now, in response to the  crowd rather than \nanything happening in front of their eyes. Edwards's \nanger didn’t subside and  for a few  weeks he  lost  faith \nin the  championship and its organisers. It wasn’t just the \nloss  of a  rostrum finish: there were echoes of the  crash \nthat had  fatally injured his team-mate Nagai-san back in \n1995, and  although Colin never mentioned it in  public \nhis  racing lost  its  edge for some weeks. \nThe  second race also looked to  be going Foggy’s \nway until he fell  as  his concentration understandably \nwavered. But  how many World Champions would have \ndone what he did  next? He  kicked the  bike straight, \nrejoined the  race and  just  snatched the  final available \npoint for  15th place. The  World Superbike Championship \nhas  never been back to  the  Nurburgring. \nLaguna Seca Is  a  track that usually creates controversy \nbut  this  time all  the  talk  was about the  racing, as  local \nriders dominated the  championship regulars for the  first \ntime. Actually, local isn’t quite the  right word, because \nthe  man who won Race 1 was'racing’s wild child, the \nAustralian Anthony Gobert. Superbike had last  seen \nhim in  1996 as  a  leery, permanently sideways Kawasaki \nrider, yet  here he was riding a  Ducati as  smoothly and \n\nconsistently as  any  of the  regular men but  a  good deal \nfaster on  his  Dunlops. Even his  post-race interview was a \npolished performance. \nNo-one took enough notice of Gobert's Vance & \nHines team-mate who finished second —  reigning AMA \nSuperbike Champion Ben Bostrom. When Gobert \ncrashed under pressure from Chili in  Race 2, Bostrom \nupheld local honour by taking the  victory. Amazingly, it \nwas his  first win on  a  Superbike. Consistency had  given \nhim  the  American title, not  race wins. As  a  Californian, \nBen looked and talked the  part with his  Evel Knievel \ncrash-helmet design, designer facial hair  and large \ncollection of classic American motors. His  riding was \neye-catching too, featuring a  wildly snaking entry to  the \nfinal turn. This man was obviously cool enough to  be the \nnext Scott Russell. \nThe end of the  season was a carnival for  British \nbike fans. First, over 120,000 of them turned up for \nthe  European round at  Brands Hatch and Carl Fogarty \npromptly had his worst weekend of the  year with a  non- \nscoring ride in  Race 1, thanks to  a  chunking tyre, and \njust a fourth place in  Race 2.  Carl felt  he’d let everyone \ndown and  asked them to  come to  Assen, where he'd do \nthe  double for them. Instead of their hero dominating at \nBrands as  he  had in  ‘95, the  massed ranks saw Castrol \nHonda finish one-two in both races, the  first  time the \nteam had  achieved that feat, and  they got  to  cheer \nheroic third places from Chili and Haga —  who hates the \nKent track. \nA wet weekend in  Austria saw Chili notch up  Suzuki's \nfirst-ever win outside Japan, the  first for  Suzuki under \nAlstare management, and his  own first  on  a  four- \ncylinder bike. Then came Assen —  and it turned into \nBritish bike racing's best day out  since Foggy’s Brands \ndouble of  ‘95. At  the  most conservative estimate \nthere were over 30,000 British fans in  the stands, and \namazingly they saw not  just the  double that Foggy had \npromised them at  Brands —  which almost assured him \nof  his  fourth title —  but  British winners in  every support \nrace. lain  MacPherson won the Supersport race, Karl \nHarris was victorious in  Superstock and the  evergreen \nSteve Webster won the  sidecars \nFogarty's growing understanding with Davide \nTardozzi and the  team gave him faith in  his  own \njudgement on  machine set-up, never previously Carl’s \nstrong point. Tardozzi also had  other methods of \nmotivating his  charge and getting him  to  do  the  testing \nwork he wasn’t keen on:  ‘| ask  him why he  not  want to \nwin; | kick his  ass.’ Dad George Fogarty had  no  doubts \nabout the  situation. He  described Tardozzi as  Carl's ‘gift \nfrom God’ \nFoggy himself was sure he  was riding better than \never —  including his  runaway 1995 World Championship \nseason.

It was the  damage to  his  son’s \nshoulder that was most worrying and likely to  prevent \nhim being competitive in  the  millennial World Superbike \nChampionship. \nt was a  brave man who mentioned the  words \nFogarty and retirement in  the  same sentence, but  the \nman himself occasionally let  slip  that it was a  subject \nhe  had  considered.

Just  before the  season started \nhis  condition deteriorated suddenly and he went for \na  brain scan in  Australia. On  the  way there his wife \nMegan ventured to  suggest ‘| hope they don’t find \nanything’; Aaron's reply, minus the  expletives, was a \nvehement ‘I hope they do.’  They did. A congenitally \nweak blood vessel had bled and could have catastrophic \nconsequences. At  least it explained the  problems he’d \nbeen having, but  it was obviously serious. He  was \noperated on  immediately. No-one knew when he'd be \nback on  a  bike; in fact nobody knew if he’d ever be \nback. But  exactly twelve weeks later he was on  the  grid \nat  Donington Park and  scored two top-ten finishes. \nTough, these Kiwis. \nThe  enforced absences of Slight and Fogarty meant \nthe  field had  an  odd look for  much of the  year. The \nimmediate consequence of Fogarty’s crash was a  game \nof musical saddles involving Ducati teams everywhere. \nTroy Bayliss, the  Aussie who was reigning British \nChampion, was riding for Vance & Hines in the  AMA \nChampionship and was drafted in for  Round 3 at  Sugo, \nonly to  be  knocked off  his  bike on  the  first lap of both \nraces. Luca Cadalora, the  factory’s official test  rider, was \non  Foggy’s bike for  Donington but  could only manage \none paltry 17th place, an  embarrassment for a  man \nof his talent. Ducati went back to  Bayliss for  Round 5. \nHis  brace of fourth places confirmed him  as  Fogarty’s \nfull-time replacement in the  World Championship, but \nhis erstwhile new team-mate Ben  Bostrom, who had \nbeen struggling with the  Michelin-shod Infostrada \nbike, was shipped off to the  semi-works NCR team. \nThe  championship rookie was at  least reunited with \nfamiliar Dunlop rubber as  Spaniard Juan Borja went \nthe  other way to  the  full  works team. The  seemingly \nhumiliating exchange worked better for  Ben  Boz, who \npromptly beat Borja in  both races, then went on  to  his \nfirst  rostrum finish of the  year next time out  in  Misano. \nThis was also the  first appearance of Ben’s Evel Knievel \nleathers in Europe. The  young Californian had  just \navoided career meltdown and  was now Starting to  enjoy \nhimself. \nHonda also  went the  substitute route, with Simon \nCrafar deputising for  his countryman for the  first two \nrounds but  never overcoming his  dislike of Michelins. \nManabu Kamada took over at  Sugo before Slight \nreturned —  almost from the  dead —  at  Donington. \nIt wasn't just the  faces that were new on  the  grid. \nHonda had  a  new bike, the  VTR1000SP-W. As  it was a \nV-twin there were a  few  snide remarks about copying \nDucati. While it’s  true that the  Big  H  had never built a \nsporting V-twin before, the  SP was shorter of stroke \nan  the  Duke and  featured Honda’s usual twin-spar \naluminium frame, not  Ducati’s trademark steel lattice \nor  their desmodromic valve-operating system. Winning \nwith a  new bike first time out  had become very, very \ndifficult, as  Honda had  found out  with the  RC45, and \nthey weren't about to  make the  same mistake twice. \nMassive resources were poured into  pre-season testing \nand  the  bike arrived for  competition so  light it even \nretained the  roadster’s starter motor! Colin Edwards duly \n+ \n— dD \n\n\n\nAbove: Aprilia signed Troy \nCorser —  and he won five \nraces. \nRight: Haga’s season was a \nmix  of the  spectacular and \nthe  tragicomic. \n—_ \nwon the  first  race of the  year on  it. \nThe  other Italian V-twin, the  Aprilia, got  serious \nthis  year after its  shakedown season. In the  black- \nand-red livery of the  factory's GP  bikes and  with Axo \nsponsorship, the  bike looked the  part —  and  so  did  the \nrider. Troy Corser had  found himself unemployed when \nDucati signed Ben Bostrom and wasn’t happy about tt. \nThe  Aprilia ride  came along just at  the  right time, with \nthe  team now being run  by the  factory using mechanics \nfrom their GP  efforts. Motivation wasn’t a  problem for \nTroy. He  duly gave Aprilia their first Superpole in the  first \nrace of the  year, their first  rostrum in Race 2, and  their \nfirst  win  in  Round 2. And it was all the  sweeter because \nDucati was struggling. \nYet  another V-twin started the  year in the  unlikely \nshape of the  Bimota SB8. The Rimini company that was \nso  strong in  the  early years of Superbike came back \nwith a  Suzuki TL1000 V-twin engine in  one  of their \nown typically beautiful frames. The personnel involved \ncould boast more arguments with Ducati than even Troy \nCorser. The rider, Anthony Gobert, was in dispute with \nhis  old  Vance & Hines Ducati team back in the  States, \nteam-manager Virginio Ferrari was consulting his  lawyers \nabout his  removal from managership of the  Ducati Corse \nteam, and  tuner Franco Farne, probably the  world’s most \nexperienced Ducati race mechanic, had been sacked by \nthe  company after years of service. \nGobert ran  race number 501 in  the  hope of some big \nsponsorship from Levi but  it never transpired. Amazingly, \na  winning tyre  gamble in  mixed weather conditions \nlanded Bimota and Gobert a  win in  Round 2 at  Phillip \nIsland, making the  wayward Aussie only the  second man \nto win  World Superbike races on  three different makes \n134 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nof motorcycle: Kawasaki, Ducati and  Bimota (the  first \nwas Stephane Mertens, on  Bimota, Honda and Ducati). \nMore predictably, the  Bimota blew up  big time in  Japan, \nflinging Gobert down the  track and  following him  into \nthe  barrier. It was a very fast, very scary crash that left \nAnthony severely beaten up,  with a collection of minor \nfractures and burns. The  team folded shortly afterwards, \nciting lack  of cash. \nDown the  four-cylinder end  of  the  pit lane Frankie \nChili and Katsuaki Fujiwara kept the  Suzuki flag flying \nwith the  aid  of good work from Dunlop. Kawasaki \ndidn’t fare so  well; Akira Yanagawa was again consistent \nwithout ever scoring a win, while Gregorio Lavilla’s \nseason was blighted from the  start by a  wrist injury \npicked up  in  pre-season testing and then ruined by a \nbroken pelvis at  Monza. Everyone's favourite sub, Simon \nCrafar, returned to  the  Green colours for one round \nat  Hockenheim, after which Peter Goddard did  the \nnecessary for  three more races. \nt soon became apparent that Carl Fogarty’s injuries \nwere going to  take a  lot  longer to  heal than first \npredicted. The brave noises about being back in  a  few \nweeks soon turned into disconsolate non-committal \nannouncements. If British fans were looking for a  new \nhero, they had  to  look no  further than Neil Hodgson, \nwho had disappeared from the  World Championship \nradar two seasons earlier. His  wild-card win in  Race \n2 of Round 4 at  Donington Park was his  first  World \nSuperbike victory and  —  amazingly —  Ducati’s first of the \nseason. \nHome fans were treated to  another round of the \nHodgson versus Chris Walker battle that raged all year \nin  the  British Championship. The pair even managed \n{£ \n\nto  scare Noriyuki Haga as  they traded places with him \nin  pursuit of leader Frankie Chili. Over 60,000 fans got \nwhat they wanted on  the  last  lap when Chili's tyres and \nmotor were both on  the  verge of throwing in  the  towel \nand the  home-town heroes went past the  Italian for a \none-two finish. It was an  indication not  just  of how well \nthe  pair  rode but  of the  strength of the  British Superbike \nChampionship as  a whole. Not  surprisingly, both men \nwould find themselves in  World Championship paddocks \nthe  following season. \nThe fans went home talking about the  racing, but \nthere was only one subject of conversation in  the \npaddock. Just before the  meeting, the  FIM  issued one \nof their regular press releases giving the  results of \ndrug tests from earlier rounds. Usually, this  would just \ngive a list  of riders tested and  affirm that no  banned \nsubstances were detected. This  time it was no  routine \nlist.  The release announced that Noriyuki Haga had \ntested positive for ephedrine after the  second race of \nthe  first round in South Africa, a  race he  had  won. \nWhen urine is taken after a  race, it is split into A and \nB samples. The  first is sent to  an  approved laboratory \nfor testing and  the  second is held by the  rider as \ninsurance. Haga and  Yamaha immediately asked for the \nB sample to  be tested, which was done by the  next race \nin Monza, and  it confirmed illegal levels of ephedrine. \nNow ephedrine is a  drug much favoured in sports like \nweightlifting, where its  combination of fat-dissolving \nand stimulating properties is very useful. You only had \nto  look at  him  to  see  that Nori-chan had  lost  an  awful \nlot of weight over the  close season —  15kg was the \ncommonly accepted figure —  that’s 33lb in  old  money. It \nturned out  that as  part of his winter programme Haga \nhad  been taking a  herbal formulation back home in \nJapan and  that was the  source of the  drug. \nStandard procedure when a  drug test  is positive is \nto exclude the  rider from the  meeting —  that means \nremoving points scored in  both races in the  case of \nWorld Superbike. So  Haga found himself 45  points \nworse off  than he’d thought (he’d also been second in \nRace 1). There was also  the  small matter of returning \nany  prize money and trophies, and the  much more \nSerious concern of a  ban  from racing. In  previous years \nperhaps this  wouldn’t have mattered too  much, but \nnow Nori was shaping up  as  a  genuine championship \ncontender. The Yamaha R7  had improved over the \nwinter and, vitally, the  team had  switched back to \nHaga’s favoured Dunlop tyres. The  Samurai of Slide \nwas back, then he wasn’t, and  then he was again after \nYamaha appealed. Standard legal procedure when this \nhappens is  to  presume innocence and give the  rider all \nhis  points back until! the  appeal is  heard. \nThe  FIM  Disciplinary Committee couldn't convene \nuntil Round 6 at  Hockenheim at  the  start of June, two \nmonths after the  sample had been taken. For  reasons \nno-one had been able to  explain satisfactorily the \nhearing was held just as  the  Superbikes, including Haga, \nwere going out  for  free practice, so  neither the  man \nhimself nor  anyone from Yamaha was present. Not \nsurprisingly the  committee upheld the  original decision, \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 135 \n\nBelow: Ben Bostrom was \nmoved sideways by Ducati, \nbut  donned the  Evel Knievel \nleathers and  was  fast  again. \na  of  all  the  points he‘d scored at  Kyalami! \ned  him for a  month, which would mean \ntwo rounds \nJow  the  legal stuff really hit  the  fan. Yamaha had \njambled on  the  appeal and lost, and the  only chance \nleft  was double or  quits —  taking the  matter outside the \nsport’s governing body's jurisdiction to  the  independent \nCourt of Arbitration in  Sport (CAS). First, they had  to \nget  leave from the  FIM  for  this  unprecedented move, \nwhich they managed just  in  time for  Round 7 at  Misano \nYet  again Haga raced with his  full  tally of South African \npoints appearing on  the  championship table. \nAnd when did  the  CAS bring down the  curtain \non  what had inevitably become known as  the  Haga \nSaga? Four days before the  final round of the  year at \nBrands Hatch, that’s when —  but  as  Colin Edwards had \nhammered out  a  significant 52-point advantage with a \ndouble win at  Oschersleben nearly a month previously, \nit really didn’t matter whether Haga got  his 45  points \nback or  not. In the  end, he  got 20  of them back for the \nfirst Kyalami race because he  wasn’t tested afterwards. \nHe'd been tested after Race 2 and  therefore lost  the \n25  points he’d scored. The CAS also banned him for \ntwo weeks with immediate effect so  he  missed the  last \nround of the  year. \nThat’s how long it took to  resolve a  situation that \nhad  its origins at the  first  round of the  year —  right up \nuntil the  week of the  final round. Could it have been \nmanaged any  better by any  of the  parties involved? In \nview of established practices and precedents the  answer \nis probably yes. In the  end  Yamaha got exactly the  same \nverdict as  Honda did  in  1994 when Aaron Slight’s fuel \nsample from Race 2 of Round 1 was  found to  be  illegal, \na \nLl ~ \nRS \n~ \ni™ \n~ \n<] \noa | \nae \n>» \n0 \nas  described earlier. The difference is  that Honda's \nlegal eagles got  their verdict from the  FIM Disciplinary \nCourt whereas Yamaha said \nHockenheim and went outs \ncursory examination of dop \nhave shown one unbendabl \ncare how the  stuff got  in  th \nthere. Evidence? Remember \nwho lost  her  medal from th \nnothing to  the  court at \nde  the  FIM’s orbit. The most \nng  cases in  other sports will \ne  rule: the  authorities don’t \ne  athlete, only that it was \nthat Rumanian girl gymnast \ne  Sydney Olympics thanks \nto  a cold cure given to  her  by the  team doctor; or  the \nScottish skier at  the  Salt Lake City Winter Olympics who \n+ \nlos \nhis  medal because the  medicine he  bought in  the \nUSA was different in  content from the stuff sold under \nthe  same label in  Europe? \nsuggest that Haga was som \nof the  title. Remember that \nt would be  grossly unfair to  Colin Edwards to \nehow robbed of a  chance \nthe  Texan had the  title \nsewn up  after the  penultimate round, before the  Haga \nSaga was resolved. Remember, too, how Colin had  to \ncope with an  intensive testing programme for the  mid- \nseason Suzuka 8 Hour race, \nwhich Honda regarded \nas  equally important to  both the  GP  and Superbike \nChampionships. Like his  ridi \nColin found the  endurance race a  distraction from the \nmain event. Both riders cras \nwon in  the  hands of Ukawa \nfor  impressive debuts, the  n \nfc \nLe  Mans, its first 8 Hour, an \nhat  is some achievement. \nirst  Superbike race and the \nirst  Superbike race in  Kyalami, its  first 24-hour race at \nng  partner, Valentino Rossi, \nhed but  an  SP-1 Honda still \nand Kato. If you're looking \new  Honda V-twin won its \nd, of course, its  first World \nSuperbike Championship. For  a  brand-new machine, \nIt had  taken Edwards a  lot longer to  win  both his \nWorld Championship, \n\nbut  that  shouldn't be allowed to  disguise the  grit \nand determination that took him  from a stellar \napprenticeship with Yamaha in  the  States to  a  fallow \nthree years with the  Belgarda Yamaha team in  World \nSuperbike. First  there was  the  Dunlop hiatus following \nthe  Kobe earthquake, and  then the  ageing YZF750 \nsimply didn’t have the  legs any  more, a situation \nillustrated at  Phillip Island in  1997 when he came out  of \nthe  last  turn in the  lead, rear  tyre spinning, front wheel \naviating, only to  be out-dragged to the  line  by Aaron \nSlight'’s Honda. He  may not  have won but  people still \nknew he was a contender. \nThere was even a war  of words with Carl Fogarty \n—  and King Carl never stooped to  acknowledge those \nlesser beings whom he considered to  be  no  threat. A \ntruce was declared after Foggy had  won on  the  RC45 \nHonda. Colin went to the  Fogarty family motorhome \nto  retract a  statement about Carl not  being a true \nchampion until he won on  a four-cylinder machine. \nFogarty was duly impressed that someone would have \nthe  guts to  make such a  statement to  his face and  went \nso  far as  to  echo Raymond Roche's prophetic statement \nabout himself: ‘He'll be World Champion, but  not  this \nyear.’ Then, lest  anyone should think he was going soft, \nCarl hurriedly added: ‘Doesn’t mean | like  him, mind.’ \nStrangely, it was  the  removal of Foggy from the \npicture that seemed to  derail Colin’s season and he \nseemed in danger of going back to  his old  habit of \nhaving weekends where he was scarcely visible. Misano \nand  Valencia were consecutive low  points, but  in the \nlast  three rounds he won four out  of six races as  he \nrediscovered the  self-belief that had  powered him  to \nwhat turned out  to  be a  double win  in the  first round \nof the  season. Nine men won races during the  2000 \nseason but  none deserved the  title  more than Texan \nColin Edwards. \nDucati’s early season musical chairs following the \nshock of Fogarty’s departure did  at  least prove that Troy \nBayliss was  made of the  right stuff. The  Aussie’s battle \nwith Haga at Assen, a track he’d never seen before, was \na  minor epic (although he crashed out  in both races), \nand his win  at the  first Brands Hatch meeting was a \nreward for  his  heroics as  well as  a steadying influence \non  Ducati. British fans got to  cheer Neil  Hodgson \nwinning not  once but  twice (first at  Donington, then \nat  Brands), as  well as  the  wily veteran John Reynolds \ngetting his first-ever win  at world level in the  second \nBrands meeting. Second Brands? Yes, the  UK  got three \nmeetings in 2000, the  last  being a second dose of the \nKent track that ended the  season in chilly mid-October \nnine weeks after the  first. The  event was originally due \nto  go to  Imola, but  local elections and  a  massive beer \nfestival (honest) would have stretched the  authorities \ntoo  far and  they cancelled. \nIncredibly, 75,000 fans turned out  and  fittingly saw \nColin Edwards win  the  last  race of the  year. They also \nsaw Slight run  his  last  race for  Honda. Embarrassingly, \nhe was presented with all sorts of gifts on  Saturday \nnight before he was officially told his  services would \nnot  be  required for 2001. Aaron had  spent years \nwaiting for  a V-twin and \nthought his  time had  at \nlast  come. He  made his \nfeelings plain at  Brands, \nthrowing anything he was \nwearing with a  Castrol \nHonda logo, including his \neathers, into  the  crowd \nafter the  second race. \nIt was a  shabby way \nfor  Slight to  leave Honda. \nHe  had  ridden hurt more \nthan any  other rider in \nthe  series, to  develop the \nRC45, been lumbered \nwith a  nightmare \nselection of team-mates \nand never broken ranks. \nIt later emerged that \nhis  brain operation had \nbeen performed in  the \nnick of time: his sight \nand reactions had  been \ndeteriorating rapidly, \nand  when things started \ngoing seriously wrong \nhe was lucky to  be  in \nSydney, where one  of the \nfew  surgeons capable of \ndoing the job was based. \nThere would obviously have to  be a  lot of changes \noff the  track as  well as  on  for the  2001 season, and \nmany of them would be informed by the  FIM’s release \nof outline plans for the  return of four-strokes to the  top \nclass of Grand Prix  racing first made public on  9 April at \nthe  third GP  of the  year in Japan, after much wrangling \nbetween the  manufacturers and  the  FIM  itself. From \n2002, the  500 class would be opened up to  990cc four- \nstrokes, provided they were prototypes. \nWhat would this  mean for the  future of World \nSuperbike? The  Japanese factories were already known \nto  be  unhappy with the  expense of the  series and \nwanted to turn the  clock back to what Superbike \nwas meant to  be  in the  late  1980s, when the  class \noriginated. Maybe allowing fewer modifications, as  in \nthe  Supersport class, would be an  option. Then there \nwas the  ever-increasing problem of the  now palpable \nadvantage the  1000cc twins had  over the  750cc fours. \nThe only non-V-twin win of the  year was by an  inspired \nFrankie Chili on  the  Suzuki at  home in  Monza, where \nhe  beat Edwards's Honda by a  fraction of a  second. \nYamaha announced their decision to  pull out  of the \nWorld Superbike Championship before the  end of the \nyear after just  two seasons with the  R7,  and  there was \nno  new 750 Kawasaki in  sight. And the  first whispers \nof the  four-stroke GPs had  put  paid to a  plan for  kitted \nengines which were to  be  made in  sufficient numbers to \ngive privateers a chance to  be competitive. \nSomething would have to  be done. The  question \nwas, what? \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nAbove: There has  never \nbeen a  more surprising \nwinning combination \nthan Anthony Gobert and \nthe  Bimota. \n137 \n\nBelow: Actor \nand biker Ewan \nMcGregor joins \nCarl and Michaela \nFogarty at  Brands \nHatch. \n2000 \nSEASON RESULTS \nRound 1 -  South Africa \nKyalami, 2 April \nRace 1 \nColin Edwards, USA, Honda \n1 \n2 Noriyuki Haga, Jap, Yamaha \n3.

There were, \nhowever, more questions than answers. How come Troy \nCorser could win the  first two races of the  year, in  Spain, \nand  never stand on  the  top  box  of the  podium again? \nHow could Honda’s new man, Tady Okada, winner of \nthe  Suzuka 8 Hour on  a  Superbike, be  so  uncompetitive? \nWould a  750cc four ever win a  race again? And how \ncome defending champ Colin Edwards never scored a \npole position all  year?

The Benelli Tornado could \ne€  a  rumour factory \nrks  over the new \nclaim to  be  unique in \nSuperbike terms because the racer came before the \nstreet bike.

In two years \nGermany had  managed to  lose the  glorious Hockenheim \n—  probably the  best race track in the  world —  and gain \nOschersleben and  the  Lausitzring. Nobody thought it \nwas a  good deal. \nTroy Bayliss emerged from the  wreckage of Ducati’s \n2000 season as  the  Bologna factory's undisputed \nnumber one  and lined up with new-to-Superbike Ruben \nXaus, the  young, lanky and  wild-riding Catalan with \na win-it-or-bin-it reputation. They formed the  official \nworks team —  Ducati Infostrada —  while Ben  Bostrom \nand his  Dunlops were semi-detached and running as \nDucati L&M. The really significant change in the  red \ncorner was a  new bike. Officially it was called the  996R \nFO1  but  was soon known to  all as  the  Testastretta, or \n‘narrow-head’. Sounds better in Italian, doesn’t it? This \nwasn’t just Ducati’s usual close-season modifications; \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nthis  was a  genuine second generation of the  design that \nstarted with the  original 851  Superbike built for the  start \nof World Superbike in  1988. \nDucati followed the  example of the  other V-twin \nmanufacturers, Honda and  Aprilia, by shortening the \nstroke to 63.5mm, which with a 100mm bore actually \ngives a  998cc motor. This more rev-happy bottom \nend got a  brand-new cylinder head design with a \nsignificantly narrower valve angle —  25  as  opposed to 40 \ndegrees —  allowing a  much more efficient combustion \nchamber shape. The problem with the  old  cylinder \nhead was that all four rockers for the  desmodromic \nvalve-operating system that is Ducati’s hallmark were \npositioned between the  camshafts, despite Massimo \nBordi’s original design thesis placing them outside the \ncamshafts and  valves. The  Testastretta design had  the \nrockers that opened the  valves mounted outside the \ncamshafts, which allowed the  cams to  be  moved closer \ntogether and  therefore the  valve angle to  be narrowed. \nCamshaft mounting bearings were also done away \nwith and  the  cams ran  directly in the  head, saving more \nspace. Overall the  result was a  great leap  forward, with \nas  much as  an  extra 10hp available to  the  three factory \nriders. \nHonda had  also found extra power, but  unfortunately \nlost  some reliability. At the  opening round at Valencia \nthe  new SP-2 failed once with Edwards and  three times \nwith Slight’s replacement, Tadayuki Okada. Edwards \npromptly won the  third race of the  year in South Africa, \nthen had  his  bike break again while shaping up  for the \ndouble; Okada DNFd twice. That glorious old  catch-all \nphrase ‘electrical problems’ was dusted off  and used \nstraight-faced by Honda people, although one  comment \nabout bearing failure did  escape the  net  of secrecy. \nAprilia didn't look like  they had  any  problems.

His  new team-mate, Regis Laconi, also shone, \nbriefly leading the  first race and netting a  creditable \nfourth despite injuries from a  qualifying accident, but \nit was a  false dawn. Corser spent most of the  rest  of \nthe  season complaining about strange vibrations from \nvarious parts of the  bike, which the  team couldn't \ndiagnose. He  scored a  hatful of podium places but  did \nnot  win  again. It was very apparent that team and rider \nwere not happy with each other, the  end result being \nthat RSV Aprilia, which had  truly threatened to  be the \ntop  V-twin in  2000, was reduced to  fourth overall in \n2001. Since Aprilia was about to  launch itself into the \nUS  road-bike market, where credibility from Superbike \nAbove: Newly-crowned \nchampion Bayliss in the \nAssen pits after his team \nhad  removed the \nfigure 2 from his  bike's \nracing number. \n144 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nracing on  the  domestic and  world scene is vital, the \nfactory was not  happy. \nCorser did  play a  lead role  again after Valencia, \nfittingly at  his  home race, but  it was as  a  shop steward, \nnot  a  racer. Phillip Island is in  the  Bass Strait, the \nstormy waters that once reduced the  Sydney to  Hobart \nocean yacht race to  tragic chaos. This time the  ocean \nmanaged to  reduce the  racing to  chaos, fortunately \nwithout tragedy. Race 1 went ahead in  conditions that \nwere simply appalling: it was like  racing inside a  storm \ncloud. (Back in  ‘92,  when Carl Fogarty and  Terry Rymer \nclinched their World Endurance title  here in  a six-hour \nrace, the  conditions had  been just  as  bad  and several \nmarshals ended up  in  hospital with hypothermia.) \nCastrol Honda made the  best of the  dire  conditions and \nwent some way to  making up  for their dreadful start to \nthe  year, with Edwards taking the  win. \nThe Supersport race then went ahead in  even \nworse conditions, and it was apparent that the  track \nwas unraceable thanks to  standing water everywhere. \nNevertheless, the  pit lane was opened on  time for \nRace 2 and a  few riders went out. Corser now took \nmatters into his  own hands, stationing himself at  the \npit-lane exit  and  urging his  fellow riders not  to  go  out. \nPublic rows with the  organisers followed, with Davide \nTardozzi also weighing in against Corser because \nhe wanted his  riders to  make up  their own minds. \nWorldwide TV  audiences were treated to  a  bizarre public \ndebate before Colin Edwards, as  World Champion, \nwas sent out  for  an  exploratory lap. He  returned to \nState the  obvious: Race 2 was cancelled. Good job, or \nspectators as  well as  marshals would have been at  risk \nof hypothermia, never mind the  riders. \nThe only notable consequence of the  singleton \n\nAustralian race was that Troy Bayliss went to  the  lead \nin  the  points standings for the  first  time, and  then \npromptly lost  it at  Sugo where anyone not  on  Dunlops \nwas in  deep trouble. Edwards could only manage 12th \nand 13th places behind Dunlop-shod regulars like  Corser \nand the  usual crop of local aces, who all —  even the \nHonda men —  use  Dunlops in  their local championship. \nBayliss fared even worse and  the  lead was handed back \nto  Corser. \nThe  bizarre happenings of the  opening four rounds \nof the  season had  not  revealed any  clues about the \ndestination of the  title. We  had  to wait for the  fifth \nround for the  picture to  come more clearly into  focus, \non  the  awe-inspiring tarmac of Monza, and  when the \nhaze cleared it revealed Troy Bayliss. The  popular Aussie \ntook Superpole and then his first-ever double win at \nworld level. \nThere were several other twists to  the  plot before \nTroy was able to  clinch the  crown, however. The  first \ncame from Britain’s Neil  Hodgson on  his  return to  World \nSuperbike with the  GSE Ducati team which had  taken \nhim  to the  2000 British Championship. Equipped with \nRS-spec Ducatis —  basically last  year’s works racer —  and \nDunlop tyres, and with the  highly promising youngster \nJames Toseland as  his team-mate, Neil  took a  few races \nto  readjust to  top-level racing, but  when he  did  he  was \nvery quick. Quick enough to  depose Troy Corser as \nking of the  Superpole, thanks to  a  stunning run  of four \nof them in  five  races in  the  middle of the  season, and \nto  win  the  first race at  Donington where the  Dunlop \nrunners all  had  a  good day. It was his  first rostrum of \nthe  season but  six  more followed in  nine races before he \nfaded slightly towards the  end of the  year. \nRace 2 at  Donington gave the  crowd another \nfavourite to  cheer: Frankie Chili. With no  Yamaha \nteam in  the  championship and the  Kawasaki ZX-7R \napproaching pensionable age, the  only hope for  a \n750cc four-cylinder victory was Chili and  the  newly \nfuel-injected Suzuki. The  factory's road-going 750  had \ngot  Injection in 2000 but  the  Alstare Corona team had \nstuck with the  carburetted version for that season. Now \nit became apparent why. Chili simply could not  get  on \nwith the  power delivery of the  new bike and  said so \nloudly, resulting in  an  end-of-season bust-up with team \nbosses. His  team-mate, Frenchman Stephane Chambon, \ngetting his  reward for the  Supersport crown, wasn't able \nto  give meaningful support, and Frankie's two rostrums \nat  Donington plus Yanagawa’s pair at  Monza and \nLavilla’s thirds at Valencia and Misano were the  only top- \nthree spots the  four-cylinder brigade managed all year. \nBelow: GSE Ducati left \nthe  safe waters of British \nSuperbike for the  rigours \nof the  World Championship, \nwith Neil Hodgson as  the \nlead rider. \nbi \noe \nae \nee:   \noe \nA \n8h \nthirds \niP \nea \nig \nLn \nSa \naR \nES \nSed \nSPO \ny bbre \nget \n\né \nne \\puNLoP \nnye alts \nAbove: Neil  Hodgson leads \nthe field down the  hill  into \nthe first turn at Laguna Seca. \nWithin the  Motor Sports Manufacturers Association \n(MSMA), the  constructors’ trade union, there was  a \nmove to  alter the  regulations to allow the  750  fours a \n10 per cent overbore to  825cc for 2002, which many \nthought would make them competitive again, but  it \ndid  not  gain the  necessary unanimous backing, despite \nvigorous lobbying by Kawasaki and  Suzuki. Note the \ndate: 27  May 2001, the  last  time a 750cc four won a \nWorld Superbike race. \nEdwards's title  challenge might have been torpedoed \nat the  outset by mechanical woes, but  even his \nseemingly certain second place overall came under \nthreat from a  most unexpected source. Ben  Bostrom’s \nintroduction to World Superbike had  been traumatic, \nto say the  least, thanks to  Fogarty’s exit  and  the  chaos \nthat engulfed Ducati’s efforts in 2000, and  for the  first \nhalf  of the  2001 season it looked as  if things weren't \ngoing to get any  better. Going into  Round 8 at  Misano \nhe'd had just one  win, at  Kyalami, and  only one  other \nrostrum, from the  opening race in Valencia —  plus a \ndislocated shoulder thanks to the  new mickey-mouse \nchicane that had  defaced Monza at the  insistence of \nthe  F1  cars. Comparisons were being made with the \nill-starred career of Mike Hale, the  last  great hope to \nemerge from AMA Superbike racing in the  States. \nThen came Misano and, nagging shoulder injury \nnotwithstanding, Bostrum shared the  wins with Bayliss \n146 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nat a track where Ducati have always done well. That set \nhim  up  nicely for a  return to the  only other track he had \never won on,  Laguna Seca. Dunlop runners monopolised \nthe  rostrum as  Ben  did the  double for the  first time in \nhis career to  make it three wins in a  row in front of an \necstatic crowd of fellow-Californians. \nThe big question hanging over Brands Hatch, \nthe  next venue, before proceedings got  under way, \nconcerned the  crowd and  how the  retirement of Car! \nFogarty would affect attendances. On  race day it simply \nlooked as  if the  old  red  Foggy T-shirts had  faded in \nthe  wash as  the  Kent track turned orange, with over \n120,000 fans flying the  colours of Neil  Hodgson’s GSE \nDucati team. The home favourite couldn't convert yet \nanother Superpole into  a  race win, though, as  Ben  Boz \non  only his second visit  to the  complex and intimidating \nBrands long circuit blitzed to  both wins and  made it five \nin a  row, something only Doug Polen and Carl Fogarty \nhad  achieved in the  entire history of the  championship. \nBostrom’s second half  of the  season more than made up \nfor his very patchy opening half. Although he didn’t win \nanother race he still  ended the year with six wins, the \nsame number as  eventual champion Bayliss. \nDucati’s other works rider, Ruben Xaus, also took \nsome time to  get going. True to  his win-or-crash \nreputation he spent a  lot of time reducing carbon-fibre \nbodywork to expensive shrapnel, but  at Oschersleben \n\nMichelin gave him  a front tyre  that cured all  his \nproblems —  or  that he  believed cured all  his  problems. \nHe  promptly gave Edwards a  hard time in Race 1 as  his \nteam-mate Bayliss hit  mechanical problems, then won \nRace 2 from the  American in a fair  fight. It was another \nhistoric moment —  the  first-ever win  in World Superbike \nby a  Spanish rider. \nIt could —  should? —  have been more at the  next \nround, the  penultimate of the  year, at  Assen, but  Xaus \ndid  the  decent thing and  shadowed his team-mate \nhome in both races, having plainly been the  fastest \nman out  there. No-one complained too  much about \nteam orders, though, as  the  two Ducatis were well clear \nof the  field both times and the  championship was at \nstake. Edwards and the  Castrol Honda team conspired \nwith Michelin to  make a  disastrous tyre choice for the \nsecond race, which saw the  World Champ come home \ntenth and  lose his crown. Bayliss didn’t know that as  he \ncame back to the  pit lane —  like  the  rest  of the  paddock \nhe thought the  fight would go down to the  last  round. \nOnly when he saw his team wearing the  obligatory \ncelebratory T-shirts did  he  realise he was  World \nChampion. \nAll  of which left the  way clear for a  last-round \nshowdown at Imola three weeks later. Superbike’s \nfirst visit  to the  historic Italian circuit produced two \namazing races, with Ruben Xaus winning the  first  one \nto  prove a  point. Bayliss, his  bike resplendent in silver \nto  celebrate Paul Smart's legendary 1972 victory in the \nImola 200 (the first race win  for  a desmo Duke) fell \nchasing his team-mate, and his  bike scooped up  Regis \nLaconi’s Aprilia. It looked horrible. The Frenchman’s bike \nappeared to  land on  him  at one point but  the  human \ndamage was limited to  a  broken collarbone for  Bayliss. \nAs  soon as  Laconi stopped rolling he  leapt to  his feet \nregulations didn't look too  different, but  there in  black \nand white were the  words ‘treaded tyres’. No-one \nseemed sure how that had  happened, and  with both \nMichelin and Dunlop denying any  prior knowledge and \npointing out  that they didn’t have suitable designs to  go \nracing to  those regulations, confusion reigned. \nClearly the  changes were being driven by the \nMSMA, whose members had  seen costs for what was \nsupposed to  be a  production-based formula spiral out \nof control to  the  point where HRC were spending as \nmuch keeping an  SP-2 on  track as  they were on  an \nNSR500. That was more than enough motivation to  try \nand peg back Superbike to where it was meant to  be  in \n1988, when the  class was born. Supersport regs, which \nforbid almost any  modifications to the  bottom end  of \nthe  motor and  stipulate that standard forks, brakes and \nwheels must be  used, are  an  obvious method of cost \ncutting. Hell, if you  look inside the  fairing of a factory \nHonda CBR600 Supersport bike you'll see  a  hole in  the \n(stock) top yoke where the  ignition switch should be; \nthey're that standard. There was also  the  small matter \nof the  market for  750cc street bikes collapsing world \nwide. Motorcyclists were buying 600 or  1000cc fours, \nassuming they were not  on  big V-twins, of course. \nThe  need to  do something was driven by several \ncauses. Money, specifically the  severe downturn in \nthe Japanese economy, was, as  usual, a  major factor; \nthe  rapidly decreasing competitiveness of the  750cc \nfours was another. All  the  puzzling over the  future \nwas brought into  sharp relief by one  cold fact. In April \n2002 the  sound of four-strokes would be  heard in the \nGrand Prix  paddock for the  first  time in over 20 years. \nHonda and  Yamaha showcased their new MotoGP \nmachines before the  end  of the  season; Aprilia declared \ntheir intention to  compete in the  new formula; and \nBelow: Troy Bayliss’s \nDucati wears silver at \nImola in honour of Paul \nSmart's landmark win \nthere 30  years earlier. \nand  rushed to  aid  the  obviously injured Aussie. It was a \ngenerous act  of spontaneous sportsmanship and  earned \nRegis a special award from Italian magazine Moto Sprint \nat their end-of-season Casque d’Oro awards. Laconi and \nAprilia got their just desserts a few hours later when \nthe  Frenchman —  almost literally —  beat off  Xaus to win \nRace 2. This  wasn’t just  his first  win, it was his first \nrostrum in Superbike and  earned him  a  place alongside \nthe  Doohans, Kocinskis and  Chilis of this  world as  one \nof the  very few men to  have won a  500 GP  and  a World \nSuperbike race. \nIn  many ways Laconi’s season was symptomatic of \nmuch that went on  in  2001: initial promise followed by \na  lengthy period in the  wilderness and  a  moment in the \nlimelight. Some riders, like  Bostrom, had  longer periods \nof grace; others, like  Okada, hardly troubled the  scorers \nat all.  Overall, the  departure of Fogarty still  seemed to \nleave a vacuum that was waiting to  be filled. \nOne other feature of the  season’s last  round was the \nfirst  sight of proposed new technical regulations for the \nclass. The British Superbike Championship had  already \nmade a  unilateral decision to  go  to  an  overall 1000cc \nlimit, but  with Supersport-style regulations on  engine \nmodifications to four-cylinder motors that effectively \nbanned any  tuning. The  proposed World Superbike \nDucati, Suzuki and  Kawasaki also  announced that they \nwould be  in  MotoGP in 2003. It looked like  the  time \nfor Superbike to  reinvent itself.

The restricters would \nbe 26.3mm in diameter for a single intake and 18.7mm \nif the  bike had  two. The  idea of this  sort  of regulation \nwas  to  level the  playing field for  privateers by effectively \npower-capping motors. If you  can  only flow so  much air \nyou  can  only make so  much power no  matter what you \ndo.  Theoretically, this  was much easier to  police than \nthe  Supersport regulations, and severely limited engine \ntuning. Most people were agreed that this  was a  pretty \ngood compromise, although some asked what the \npoint was of building £20,000 motors and  then \nstrangling them. \nMeanwhile the  show went on  with the  old  rules and \none Honda up  against the  same Ducati teams as  last \nyear —  Bayliss and  Xaus in the  Corse team, Hodgson and \nToseland in the  HM  Plant squad and Ben Bostrom in the \nL&M team. Noriyuki Haga returned after a  disgruntled \nyear In  GPs  to  pilot the  lone Aprilia, Kawasaki brought \nin  2000 Sugo double winner Hitoyasu |zutsu and, to \nthe  delight of British fans, Chris Walker —  who'd had  an \neven worse 2001 in GPs  than Haga. Gregorio Lavilla left \nKawasaki to  replace Chili on  the  Suzuki while the  Italian \n\nfound himself on  a  private NCR Ducati. \nTyres might not  have played a  part in  the  new \nregulations but  they did  in  the  racing. Michelin had \nspent a lot of time and effort developing a  fresh \ngeneration of S4 slicks to  cope with the  new MotoGP \nfour-strokes. Happily they also worked on  Superbikes, \nto  the  tune of around a  second a  lap improvement \nUnhappily, Dunlop hadn't made a similarly great leap \nforward and  Messrs Hodgson, Bostrom and  Haga found \nthemselves at an  acute disadvantage at  most tracks —  as \ndid  the  Michelin runners who didn’t have access to  the \nnew rubber. \nFor  this  and  other reasons the  championship \nquickly became a two-man race between riders with \nS4  Michelins: reigning champ Troy Bayliss and his \npredecessor Colin Edwards. Dunlop's qualifiers were, as \nusual, on  the  pace for the  one-lap dash of Superpole \nwhich let  Hodgson, Bostrom and Haga fight for front- \nrow  starts but  rarely for the  win. The  first  three rounds \nof the  year were a  Bayliss benefit. He  won every race, \nsomething no-one had  done before at the  start of \nthe  year —  but,  just as  he was eyeing up  Doug Polen’s \nrecord of seven races on  the  trot, the  circus came to \nSugo, the  track where Bayliss had  crashed twice in \n2000 and  scored a  grand total of four points in 2001. \nNot  surprisingly, the  benefit came to  an  end. Very \nsurprisingly, a Michelin rider won a  race in Japan for the \nfirst  time since Takuma Aoki in  ‘96.  That man was Colin \nEdwards, the  Texan sharing the  wins with local Honda \nman and  All-Japan Champion Makoto Tamada. It was \nalso the  first Sugo win by a  non-Japanese rider since \n'95. Bayliss wasn’t fazed by missing out  on  the  record \nfor consecutive wins, and instead seemed happy to \nescape from his  bogey track with fifth and  fourth places. \nSugo also gave the  World Superbike paddock its first \nsight of Ben Bostrom’s brother Eric  away from his  home \nround. Eric, Kawasaki's AMA Superbike star, was  taking \new \n©  \nW  \nie \nIi \nIORSE \nIERGY \nDRINK \n3 Tae vise em \nIT ERED mortar, \npart in  a  series of wild-card rides designed to  ease him \ninto world-level competition. Kawasaki needed him, \nthe  top  four-cylinder man in the  championship, Izutsu, \nhaving crashed in qualifying and  badly broken his  left \nwrist. \nEdwards did  hit  back occasionally, noticeably at \nSilverstone where storms of biblical proportions put \nBayliss on  the  floor, not  once but  twice in the  same \nrace. Both times his  bike kept going, seemingly in \ncontravention of the  regulation that requires a  mercury \nswitch to  cut  the  motor if a  certain lean angle is \nexceeded. Both times he got  back on  and  charged \ntowards the  front of the  field at  lap speeds well quicker \nthan anyone else’s. In  Race 2 Edwards contrived to  fall \non  the  warm-up lap,  so  bad  were the  conditions, but \ngot  back on  his  spare bike to  finish second.

When the  two re-enacted their British \n\\pionship battle in  Race 2 and Walker got  a \ndid  fourth place, both crowd and rider acted like \nhe'd won the  title \nThere were more departures from the  form book at \nLaguna Seca: Bayliss and Edwards scored their maiden \nwins there but, more significantly, the  first race rostrum \nwas 100  per  cent Michelin. Local wild cards Bostrom the \nYounger and Nicky Hayden mixed it up with the  regulars \nwith Eric  actually leading the  race for  a  while and \nscoring a  sixth and  a fourth. Hayden had  been expected \nto  compete for a win but  instead took a fighting fourth \nin  Race 1, then crashed and  took Haga out  in Race 2 \nbefore getting back on  to  finish 13th. Both Americans \nwere obviously well worth tempting away from the \ndomestic scene —  but  could anyone afford to  match the \nwages they got  in AMA racing? \nBayliss now led  the  championship by 53  points, \ndespite the  fact that Colin Edwards was riding as  well as, \nif not  better than, he  had  ever done and  only been off \nthe  rostrum once —  yes,  once —  all season. The  reigning \nchamp was riding at the  top  of his form. He  looked just \nas  fast  and loose as  ever and the  number-one plate had \ncertainly done nothing to  reduce his  will  to  win  —  and \nthat, combined with the  latest Ducati, gave him the \nslightest of advantages over Edwards. Troy ruthlessly \nexploited that edge, but  the  Honda rider never gave up \n50  much as a single point without a fight. Edwards was \nmentally tough enough to  keep the  pressure up,  and \nevery time Troy stood on  top  of the  rostrum there was \nColin beside him. \nOf the  Dunlop runners it was Neil Hodgson who \nwas emerging as  the  toughest, comfortably outgunning \nthe  disappointing Haga and the  patchy Bostrom. His \nmotivation was helped by Ducati announcing he would \nbe  in the  full  works Ducati Corse team for  2003 to \nreplace Bayliss who, it was assumed, would go  off \nto  Ducati’s new MotoGP project. The form of Ruben \nXaus was a  mystery, but  it emerged late  in  the  season \nthat he had  not  had  access to  the  latest Michelins \nuntil half-way through the  year. Chris Walker was \npleasing his  hard-core fans by usually, although by no \nmeans always, winning the  four-cylinder 750cc battle \nwith Lavilla. Young British hopeful James Toseland \ncontinued on  his  learning curve and  added steel to  his \nskill, as  a spectacular last-corner mugging of Haga at \nOschersleben showed. His  emotional rostrum finish in \n\nRace 2 at  Assen was well deserved. Young Aussie Broc \nParkes on a Pirelli-shod Ducati also showed promise, as \nyou would expect from a  protégé of Wayne Gardner \nAs  the  mid-season break approached the  question \non  everyone's lips was, could anyone beat Bayliss and \nwould he  trump Doug Polen’s record of  17  wins in  a \nseason? Ironically, the  person who nearly cost Bayliss \nhis  championship lead was his  team-mate, Ruben \nXaus. It happened at  Brands Hatch on  the  out-lap of \na  qualifying session. Both Ducati Corse riders were \non  the  way up  the  hill  to  Druids hairpin early in  the \nlap,  Xaus weaving to  get  some heat into his  tyres as \nBayliss came up  considerably faster on  the  outside \nRuben didn’t know his  team-mate was coming and \nmoved to  the  left  as  Troy was overtaking, with the \nresult that Bayliss was sent onto the  grass where he \nfell  and scraped along the  Armco barrier. It was a \nmessy crash and the  Aussie was obviously hurt. He \nwas still  suffering from a  sore back thanks to  a  crash \nin  qualifying at  Laguna and this  incident aggravated it \nand added a  broken rib  for  good measure \nUnder the  circumstances his  third and second places \nat  Brands were heroic, but  Edwards did  the  double for \nthe  first time in the  season and took a big bite  out  of \nthe  gap at  the  top  of the  championship. From Bayliss’s \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 155 \n\n\n\npoint of view, the  silver lining was the  four-week break \nin  the  calendar before Oschersleben that enabled him  to \nget  back to  full  fitness. \nThe other seismic event at  Brands was the  first public \nouting of the  Foggy Petronas bike in  the  hands of team \nriders Troy Corser and James Haydon, as  well as  a  couple \nof laps from King Carl himself. The  bikes had  actually \nbeen unveiled in  June amid assurances that the  target \nof racing at  Laguna Seca was attainable. That date was \nthen amended to  Brands before the  team had  to  admit \ndefeat and postpone the  FP1's race debut until 2003. \nProducing enough road bikes for  homologation was \nthe  main stumbling block and  the  MSMA was in no \nmood to  show the  leniency they'd exhibited to  Benelli. \nTypically, Carl brushed aside his earlier statements about \nhow he’d make people eat  their words when his team \nmet  the  deadline by reflecting that perhaps this  pressure \nwas necessary to  drive the  project forward. He  probably \nhad  a  point. The  bike certainly showed some very nice \ndetailing, and  with Petronas bankrolling things there was \nno  shortage of money —  but  the  team now had  to  revise \ntheir 900cc triple to  compete not  just with the  V-twins \nbut with 1000cc four-cylinder bikes. \nThe  Oschersleben round saw Edwards close the  gap \neven more, with another double, making it five  wins on \nthe  trot. He  also passed a few  significant milestones. \nRace 1 gave the  Castrol Honda team their 50th World \nSuperbike win  and Race 2 took Colin to joint second in \nthe  all-time winners’ table alongside Doug Polen. It was \nalso the  100th win  by an  American rider and  equalled \nPolen’s record of 21  podiums in a year, though Colin had \nscored them consecutively. Even Foggy in his  pomp had \nonly managed a  dozen consecutive top-three finishes, in \n1995. All that work and  Edwards was still  second in  the \ntitle race! \nBayliss’s Brands crash had  obscured the  fact  that \nHonda had  supplied Edwards with a  new motor after \nthe  Suzuka 8 Hour race, where Colin was teamed with \nDaijiro Kato and  won. The  Texan was on a roll,  and \nall of  a sudden Bayliss was looking vulnerable with his \nchampionship lead after Germany reduced to  29  points. \nAs  so  often, Assen was the  turning point. Race 1 \nfeatured the  two main men again, with Bayliss following \nEdwards home. That reduced the  lead to  24  points, \nand with only three more races on  the  calendar Troy \ncould afford that rate  of attrition. But  the  Aussie was \nfeeling the  strain and, according to  other riders, making \nunforced errors. In  Race 2 he  made several. The  first  was \nto  run  off track, but  he stayed on  his wheels and  set \nabout reeling in the  third-place dice between Hodgson \nand Haga. When Nori punted Neil into the  sand Bayliss \ninherited a safe third place. Inexplicably, he then crashed \na couple of laps from the  flag and Colin won again to \nequal Polen’s record run  of seven consecutive victories. \nWhen Edwards got the  pit signal telling him  that his  rival \nwas out  he couldn't quite believe it and ‘used up  a year’s \nworth of concentration’ getting to  the  flag. Much more \nimportantly, he also went to  the  top  of the  table, the \nfirst  time Troy Bayliss had  been deposed all  season. The \nlead? One solitary point, with only the  Imola round left \nLeft: Honda sent Colin \nEdwards out  with this \nspecial Stars & Stripes paint \njob at  Laguna Seca. \nLAPUNTA # >  puUNLOoF / \nAbove: One for the  ladies: \nFrankie Chili gets his  kit off. \nBelow: Carl Fogarty and \nthe  FP1  which started \nracing in  2003. \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 157 \n\n158 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nIt was a  fitting finale. The two contenders, the  men \nwho had  so  far won all  but  one  of the  races in  the  year, \nwent at  it like  a  six-lap club race. The lap record was \nshredded time after time, and  to  add to  the  drama Race \n1 was interrupted by a  red  flag half-way through when \nEdwards was leading. Conspiracy theorists pointed to \nthe  fact that the  flag  came out  very quickly, just  as \nthe  Italian Ducati appeared to  be  losing touch with \nthe  Honda. In  truth, it worked to  Edwards's advantage \nas  he  knew he  had  a 0.7s lead and  thus was able to \nfollow Bayliss across the  line  after the  restart yet win  on \ncorrected time to  give him a  six-point lead with only one \nrace left. \nThe  last  race of the  season was a real  classic. Bayliss, \nas  usual, gave it everything while Edwards refused to \nyield up  the  victory. Despite the  fact the  title  was at \nstake the  last  lap involved fairing-bashing and several \nchanges of lead. Fittingly, the  American took the  win \nand the  title while Bayliss appeared on  the  surface to \nbe a  lot  less  upset than he’d been after Assen, maybe \nbecause it had  been a fair  fight and he'd simply been \nbeaten on  the  day. \nIn 2002 both men had  ridden better than they ever \nhad  before. Bayliss lost  none of his aggression and \nfrightening will  to win  despite carrying the  number-one \nplate, while Edwards refused to  be discouraged by the \nAussie’s runaway start to the  year and  maintained his \nmotivation. He  also  showed, notably at  Imola, that he \ncould mix  it with the  best of them. There was  huge \npressure on  Troy Bayliss, not  least because the  showdown \nwas at  Ducati’s home track. Well, the  last  race wasn't a \nfight, it was a war  —  and  Colin Edwards won. \nThe  other man who didn’t lose his  motivation was \nNeil Hodgson who emerged as  clearly the  fastest of the \nDunlop runners and, as  his third place overall showed, \nhe firmly put a  few Michelin men in their place too. \nKnowing that he would be  a  Ducati factory rider in \n2003 must have contributed to  his  motivation in  the \nfinal race. \nThe  statistics tell  the  story of the  season. The  year \nwas dominated by just two men —  the  only other winner \nall year was Tamada at  Sugo. In the  first half  of the \nyear Troy Bayliss was supreme, but  the  only time Colin \nEdwards was  off the  rostrum was in the  first  race of \nthe  year. Once Bayliss had  suffered that unfortunate \ninjury at  Brands, Edwards and  his  new motor took over \nand  shattered the  all-time records for consecutive wins, \nconsecutive rostrums and number of rostrums in a \nseason. Anyone who wants to  beat those last  two marks \nis  going to  have to finish in  the  top three in every race of \na  season! In the  final analysis, Edwards had  as  near an \nerror-free season as  it's  possible to  imagine. Bayliss made \none mistake. That was the  difference between them. \nTop left:  Neil  Hodgson was  __ Right: Troy  Bayliss lost \nthe  season’s unsung hero. none of his  aggression \ntrying to  defend his title \nLeft: Edwards lifts  the but  conceded it to  his  good \ntrophy with the  help friend Colin Edwards in the \nof team-manager Neil final race at the  last  round \nTuxworth. at  Imola. \n\n\n\n2002 \nSEASON RESULTS \nRound 1 -  Spain \nValencia, 10  March \nRace 1 \nTroy Bayliss, Aus, Ducati \nNoriyuki Haga, Jap, Aprilia \nBen Bostrom, USA, Ducati \nColin Edwards, USA, Honda \nRuben Xaus, Spa, Ducati \nNeil  Hodgson, GB,  Ducati \nHitoyasu Izutsu, Jap, Kawasaki \nGregorio Lavilla, Spa, Suzuki \nPierfrancesco Chili, Ita,  Ducati \n10 Chris Walker, GB, Kawasaki \n11.

Although the  Michelin-shod full  factory \nbikes of Neil Hodgson and Ruben Xaus dominated from \nthe  outset, Dunlop did  manage to  get  in  on  the  act  with \nJames Toseland, Pierfrancesco Chili and  wild card Shane \nByrne, but  the  war was very much won by their French \ncompetitors. Ducati’s domination was such that they \ntook 64  of the  available 72  podium places, leaving many \nmedia observers (and fans) to  regard the  season as  more \nof a  Ducati Cup than a World Championship. \nA change of rules after 2002 and  the  continuing spat \nbetween the  MSMA and FGSport were the  reason for \nthe  Ducati domination. For  2003, the  four-cylinder bikes \ncould be  up  to  1000cc in  capacity but  had  to  be fitted \nwith restricters. It had been pretty clear the  750cc fours \nhad been struggling to  match the  998cc Ducatis for \nsome time, and half-way through 2002 an  agreement \nwas reached between the  FIM, MSMA and FGSport to \nallow 1000cc bikes to  compete next season. But  the \nadoption of restricters was not  greeted with universal \nenthusiasm, the  question ‘Why design, develop and \nspend a lot  of money building a  new race bike and  then \nStrangle it?’  being asked many times. In  the  end, the \n2003 season started with only one really competitive \nfour-cylinder 1000cc bike (a  factory-supported Suzuki) \nbut  its  comparative lack of success meant it would not \ncontinue into 2004 \nMany viewed 2003 as  an  ‘interim year’, but \nthat should not  detract from the  single-minded \ndetermination of its  champion, Briton Neil Hodgson \nIn  2002 Neil, on  his  GSE Racing Ducati, had im z \neverybody as  the  best non-factory rider outside the \nColin Edwards—Troy Bayliss battler and, over the winte \nof 2002-3 he  was signed to  ride  for  the  full  factory \nDucati squad \nTrue, 2002 champion Edwards, Bayliss, \nand Ben Bostrom had all  gone to  pastures new ( \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 163 \n\n\n\nPrevious spread: Neil \nHodgson started the  year \nwith nine consecutive wins. \nRight: Hodgson with the \ntitle  trophy at Assen. \nBelow right: Paolo and \nMaurizio Flammini face the \npress after announcing the \nadoption of a  one-make \ntyre  rule  for  2004. \nLeft: Hodgson tries to  keep \nthe  front end down in \nValencia. \nthree to  MotoGP, the  American back home to the  AMA \nChampionship), and certainly Hodgson or  Xaus were \nexpected to  take the  title, but  that didn’t mean it was \ngoing to  be a  stroll in the  park. Hodgson had  to fight \nfront-end and  tyre-selection problems on  the  999 Dukes \n—  which got the  better of his team-mate in the  first  part \nof the  season —  but  Neil proved any  doubters wrong by \nwinning 13  races and taking a total of 20  podiums. He \nbegan the  year with a  blistering run  of nine wins on  the \ntrot  and  such was his consistency he only had  two DNFs \nall season. No  matter the  problems in practice, Hodgson \nwas always fast  and consistent when it mattered —  on \nrace day. Xaus took longer to  master the  new 999 F03 \nDucati, but  ended the  season very strongly with four \nwins out  of the  last  six  races. If he’d started better, \nmaybe Hodgson's task would have been harder, but  in \nthe  end  the  Spanish rider finished in second place, some \n103  points behind Neil’s winning tally of 489. \nThe  Suzuki GSX-R1000 prepared by the  Belgian \nAlstare team and piloted by Spaniard Gregorio Lavilla \nwas an  occasional threat to  the  booming twins but, \nalthough he took seven podiums, a win  eluded him. \nHonda, Kawasaki and  Yamaha chose not  to  lend their \nsupport to  any  team, preferring to  observe proceedings, \nbut  there was one completely new manufacturer present \n—  Petronas. The  Malaysian company bankrolled their \nown 900cc triple —  a  project that should have been \non  the  track in 2002 —  and  were fronted by four-times \nchamp Carl Fogarty. Petronas were without doubt the \nlargest presence in the  paddock and looked to  be well \nprepared, marshalled by former Team Roberts crewman: \nNigel Bosworth. But, having designed and built from \nscratch a  900cc bike before the  rule  change, how much \nof a disadvantage would they face because of their \nlesser cubic capacity? Certainly, on  paper, they had \none of the  strongest line-ups: former World Superbike \nChampion Troy Corser and  the  experienced 29-year-old \nBriton, James Haydon. Time would tell  if the  package \nwould be good enough. \nTeam GSE Racing, sponsored by HM  Plant, were on \nthe  2002 ex-Bayliss spec bikes and  were the  only team, \napart from the  Fila  Ducatis, on  Michelins. Toseland \nand  Chris Walker flew the  flag for the  small but  well- \norganised British team and between them took one \nwin  and 14  podiums. Veteran Chili was riding for Team \nPSG-1, sporting a  distinctly non-Ducati bright yellow \ncolour scheme, but  the  bikes were two years old  and \nalthough he scored a  remarkable victory in  the  USA, \nthe  rest  of his season was littered with non-finishes \nTwo other Ducati-based teams made headlines in  2003 \nTeam Caracchi NCR Nortel Networks, who had  signed \nFrenchman Regis Laconi to  spearhead their attack, \nas) \nWeneslran \nOTT \nTS \n| \nrona \n= \nCorona \nCo \n=> \nExtra \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 165 \n\nAbove: Fireworks from \nTroy Corser on  the \ndistinctive FP1. \nAbove right: Shane Byrne \n—  the  last  ever ‘wild card’ to \nwin  a  World Superbike race. \nBelow right: Mr  & Mrs \nTroy Corser and FP1 \nPetronas boss Carl Fogarty \non  the  grid. \nbacked up  by Spaniard David Garcia, had Ducati legend \nFranco Farne as  their mechanical guru, but  even with his \nskill  and experience their season was erratic, with just \nfive  podium places. The three-rider DFX Racing team of \nSteve Martin, Juan Borja and Marco Borciani was \nfunded by Pirelli, with the  Italian company using them as \na test-bed for their latest rubber. Martin was consistently \ntheir best performer and  definitely the  best privateer \n—  not  counting Chili, of course. \nAt the  start of the  season three different tyre \ncompanies were involved in the  championship, but \nmaybe only one had  an  inkling of how that would \nchange before the  year’s end! \nRound 1 saw  the  race debut of the  Ducati 999  —  an \nimportant bike for the  Italian manufacturer. After the \nbeauty and  originality of its 916  Ducati knew a  change \nhad  to  come, but  the  999  wasn't initially viewed with \nthe  same excitement —  and certainly not  in  road livery. \nThe  race bike, though, was built to  take the  title and \nfor  Ducati that’s what mattered. It hadn't been long in \ndevelopment and most of its  track time had  been spent \nat Valencia, which was just as  well: Hodgson swept to \ntwo comfortable wins at the  Ricardo Tormo circuit, with \nFila  team-mate Xaus taking an  even more comfortable \npair  of seconds. Hodgson’s effort was ballsy to  say \nthe  least —  unknown to  most, the  Briton was taking \npainkilling injections to  relieve the  discomfort of crash- \ndamaged ribs  the  week before. The new 999s were \nalso giving both riders front-end problems, particularly \nentering turns and  on  the  brakes. Despite this, the \n166 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nfactory Dukes were in a  class of their own, with HM \nPlant's duo, Walker and Toseland, taking a third apiece \nahead of the  remaining Ducatis, already starting to  look \nwell past their sell-by date, and  Lavilla’s restricted Suzuki, \nwhich managed a forlorn seventh in  Race 1 and  sixth in \nRace 2, both times the  first non-Ducati finisher. If there \nwas any  consolation for  Gregorio’s team it was that \nthe  all-new Petronas had  fared worse. All  they could \nmuster was one  finish in each race, 12th by Haydon in \nRace 1 and  seventh by Corser in  Race 2 —  particularly \ndisappointing as  Troy had  been in  the  top  four in  both \nregular and Superpole qualifying. \nBefore the  season started, Valencia had  been seen \nby some as  the  dawning of a  new era  for  1000cc four- \ncylinder race bikes, but  Lavilla’s Suzuki was the  sole \nstrong entry and his team left  Spain knowing that it was \ngoing to  be a  long, hard season ahead. \nThe  second round, in Australia, gave the  Belgian- \nbased outfit some hope, because Lavilla took a \ntremendous third place on  his  Dunlop-shod GSX-R \nin the  opening race. The team had done masses of \nwork on  the  engine, trying to  regain some of the \npower lost  because of the  restricters, and they got \ntheir reward at  one  of the  fastest and  best-loved \ntracks of the  year. Phillip Island is  a  real ‘riders’ track’, \nfull  of fast  sweepers and long straights requiring a \ncompletely full-on approach —  and  fans love it too, for \nno  matter the  conditions the  racing is  always good, \nthough unpredictable. Although Lavilla was the  ‘man \nof the  meeting’ for  giving a  1000cc four-cylinder bike \n\nits  maiden podium, it was Hodgson who controlled \nproceedings with another double. His  victory margin \nin  Race 1 was over seven seconds, but  ne  really had \nto  work for  win number two, beating Xaus again, but \nthis  time by just 0.070s thanks to  clever tactics and the \nability to  squeeze behind the  999’s fairing better than \nhis  lankier rival. If Xaus had not  suffered three practice \ncrashes (including one on  his  Superpole lap) and had to \nStart on  the  second row of the  grid, perhaps it would \nhave been a  different story. The home star  was Corser, \nwho once again started from the  front row, taking \na superb fifth in  the  first race followed by eighth in \nRace 2, perhaps a fairer indication of his  FP1’s ability. \nFellow-countryman Martin gave his  Pirelli-shod 998 \nRS  its  best finish of the  year, a  fourth in  Race 1, while \nChili just  failed to  take Superpole (that honour, and the \naccompanying Breil watch, went to  Hodgson) and then \nDNFd. That fired the  Italian up,  at  one of his  favourite \ntracks, and he stormed through to  third place in  the \nsecond 22-lapper, the  sixth different rider on  the  podium \nin just four races. Maybe the  season wouldn't be  so \npredictable after all, although who would realistically \nbe able to  stop Hodgson’s relentless pursuit of the  title? \nWith just four races gone he  had a perfect tally of  100 \npoints. Second-placed Xaus, however, was only 20 \npoints adrift and  there was a  long way to  go. \nSugo has  never been a  happy hunting ground for \n‘foreign’ riders, at  least until Edwards equalled Tamada \nfor  maximum points in  2002. The  local wild-card riders \nwere on  Dunlops, developed in Japan, while Michelin \nhad little or  no  presence on  the  Japanese race scene, \nso  it was a  bit of a surprise that Hodgson took his third \ndouble of the  season to  maintain his  perfect score. He'd \nstruggled in  qualifying and  only managed the  fifth- \nquickest time behind four Dunlop-shod riders —  Laconi, \nChili, Lavilla and  local hotshot Atsushi Watanabe. Laconi \nposed the  biggest threat to  Hodgson in  Race 1, but  Neil \nwas able to  clear off  in the  last  few laps and  took the \nchequered flag with an  easy-looking margin of seven \nseconds. The race had  begun dramatically, with Toseland \nand Corser unwilling participants in  a  chain of events \nthat led  to  four riders being put  out  before they had \nmade the  first turn. The mechanical and human debris \ncaused havoc, though fortunately there were no  serious \nnjuries, but  the  pattern of the  race (minus fallers Chili, \nWalker, Corser and Clementi) was immediately affected \nToseland managed to  avoid going down and  then \nought his  way up  to  a  gritty third place by the  end of \nthe  25-lap race to  make it three different generations of \nDucatis in  the  top  three. Xaus battled to  fourth, despite \nset-up problems, incorrect tyre choice and having to \nStart from the  end of  row three in  12th place. Race 2 \nwas a  much closer affair, with Hodgson just  squeezing \nout  Lavilla’s Suzuki after 25  frenetic laps. The Spaniard \nwas close to  taking the  win, but  although his  bike’s top \nspeed was a  match for  the  Ducati, it could not  punch its \nway out  of turns as  well. Chili made up  for  his  fall  in  the \nfirst race by taking third, with Xaus again posting fourth \nplace —  but  now the  gap between him and his  team- §   Z a \nmate was  44  points me” \n.. = \nis ea a \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 167 \n\n168 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nNo  Superbike rider had  ever won eight races in a \nrow before Monza, but  Hodgson squeaked a victory in \nthe  first race to  give the  Bologna marque its 200th win \n—a   fitting touch in their home country and  at one  of \nthe  most revered tracks in the  world —  and  then went \non  to win Race 2, and  all after setting new records \nin qualifying and  Superpole. Neil may have ridden his \nluck in the  18-lap opener, after seeing a three-second \nlead shrink to just 0.352s at the  flag. The pursuer who \nnearly spoilt his  party was Laconi; if the  flag had been \nfurther down the  track Ducati would still  have notched \nup win number 200, but  the  Briton would've lost  his \nperfect sequence. Third place went to  Lavilla and the \nincreasingly competitive Suzuki, leading many to  think \nthat a win  was surely ‘when’ rather than ‘if’.  The  second \nrace was a Classic Monza multi-rider slipstreaming \nbattle, with Hodgson, Chili, Lavilla and  Laconi all  in \nwith a  chance of victory, to  entertain the  72,000-strong \ncrowd. Leaving the  Ascari for the  final time, however, \nthe  factory grunt of Hodgson’s Ducati was enough to \nclinch top  spot, though the  margin of 0.044s over the \nSuzuki was the  closest so  far.  Chili took third, much to \nthe  delight of his  home fans, with Laconi fourth. It was \nnot  a good day for the  other title  contender, with Ascari \nthe  scene of Xaus’s problems on  both occasions. In \nRace 1 he tangled with Walker and  went off the  track, \nrestarted in last  place, then charged back up  to  seventh. \n\nIn  Race 2 he  made a  mistake and  crashed, but  this  time \nwas unable to  restart. Ruben left  Monza bruised and \nbattered, still  second in the  championship but  now just \nfour points ahead of Lavilla. \nOschersleben was a real  Brit-fest, with five  out  of six \npodium places taken by British riders. Only Chili, on  his \naged customer Ducati, spoiled the  symmetry of the  first \nrostrum. He  almost halted Hodgson’s run  of victories \ntoo, but  Neils last-corner move was astute enough \nto  secure his  ninth win  of the  year. Toseland was \npushed off track by the  crashing Lavilla at the  first  turn, \nthundered across the  run-off area and  was lucky not  to \ncause a  multiple pile-up with the  leaders as  he  rejoined. \nBy the  time he sorted himself out  he was dead last. \nJames then fought his way through the  field to finish \nan  aggressive third, but  better was to  come in Race 2. \nHodgson and  Toseland led  the  pack and clattered into \neach other with sufficient force to temporarily dislodge \nNeil's clutch lever and redesign some of the  Fila  Ducati’s \npaintwork. Both riders called the  incident ‘an  accident’; \nthe  fans loved it. Toseland’s maiden World Superbike \nwin  saw not  only the  first-ever all-British podium but \nwas also significant for  Dunlop, recording their first \nvictory since Sugo in 2002. \nSilverstone in June was as  June should be —  warm \nand  sunny. A crowd of 83,000 was rewarded by two \nsuperbly entertaining races, with British riders prominent \nboth, but  everyone agreed the  final chicane was a \nsaster. Chicanes are  a  necessary nuisance but  the \nlverstone effort, comprising a  stupid mid-apex bump \nnd  obtuse left-right design attracted criticism from all \nuarters. However, it did  serve some purpose, causing \nclose ten-rider pack to  bunch up  on  almost every lap \nthe  first race. It was a  particularly important round \nfor  Lavilla. Machine improvements after the  start of \nthe  season had  given him  the  scent of victory, and \nSilverstone was  just  the  kind of track where the  Suzuki \ncould get the  better of Hodgson’s Ducati. Gregorio, \nthough, hadn't reckoned on  Neil’s self-belief and \ndetermination not  to  be  beaten by a  four-cylinder bike. \nThere were also two other strong GSX-R1000s in  the \nshape of British Superbike contenders John Reynolds and \nYukio Kagayama. \nRace 1 featured a five-rider freight train, all  in  with \nchance, but  Hodgson kept his  nerve and showed his \naggression, a  testament to  his  improvement since 2002: \nwhen it mattered he delivered the  goods and  took the \nwin, his tenth of the  season, with Toseland second, Xaus \nthird and  Japanese rider and British crowd favourite \nKagayama providing further entertainment. Race 2 was \nno  less  of a  battle: Lavilla had  been in  contention in  the \nfirst race until a fall  at the  final chicane, now he was a \ngenuine challenger.

The  effervescent Kagayama took a  pair of fifths \n—  good for his CV  in the  future. Afterwards Hodgson \nsald, ‘The Suzuki has  been improving all season and \n| knew that Lavilla could do well at Silverstone, so  | \nwas more than determined not  to  let  him  beat me.  | \nwould've done anything not  to  let him  win  because he’d \nhave grown in confidence so  much and  | didn’t want \nthat to  happen.’ \nOnce again Misano’s high temperatures and humidity \nmade life difficult for everyone, but  maybe it was  the \nheat of the  moment that caused Hodgson to  crash \nuncharacteristically on  lap one  of the  first race and  leave \nthe  battle to Xaus and  Toseland. Ruben had  started \nfrom row  three, but  made a  mockery of his grid place \nby storming up the  inside of most of his competitors \n—  usually at the  series of long left-handers leading onto \nthe  back straight. Toseland held off  Laconi for second \nplace, with Lavilla’s Suzuki some way back in fourth \ndespite suffering the  effects of a  hard fall  in qualifying. \nXaus won Race 2 as  well, beating Hodgson in a  hard- \nfought battle, neither rider giving way throughout the \n25-lapper. The  ever-popular Chili took third, ahead of \nLacon! and  Lavilla, who was almost embarrassed by \nformer Superstock Champion Vittorio lannuzzo on  an \nAlstare Suzuki GSX-R1000 that was of  a much lower \nspec than the  Spaniards bike. \nLaguna Seca is one of the  most breathtaking circuits \non  the  calendar, with the  infamous Corkscrew at  its \nheart providing a  riding experience like  no  other. It \ndoesn’t help that wild-card riders always want to  put \none  over the  Superbike regulars and  can  use  their \nsuperior local knowledge to  good advantage. Led  by \nYoshimura USA's Mat Mladin, the  locals were good \nin  qualifying but  couldn't produce the  goods in either \nrace; Mladin didn't even take part in Race 2, citing \n‘fatigue’. Xaus led  the  first race, and looked on  course \n170 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nfor win  number three, but then crashed out  leaving Chili \nto  inherit the  victory. Hodgson consolidated his series \nlead with second, ahead of Toseland and Mladin. Race \n2 saw Ruben more than make up for  his earlier fall, \ntaking his third win  in four races by an  easy 11  seconds. \nSecond again was Hodgson, with Walker third and \nLaconi fourth, ahead of a  bruised and  battered Lavilla. \nBoth races had  been all-action affairs, which was  just \nas  well as  there were two major announcements that \nsent shock waves through the  paddock. First, SBK CEO \nPaolo Flammini announced that Pirelli would be the \none-make tyre supplier in 2004. Second, and no  less \nsignificant, was the  MSMA statement that none of the \nmajor factories, or  Aprilia, would be  running their new \nsuperbikes in the  series. \nThe  two-week gap  between Laguna Seca and  Brands \nHatch gave everybody time to  digest this  news but, if \nthere was doom and  gloom around, it certainly didn’t \naffect the  racing at one of the  sport’s most popular \nvenues. The  weather had  been poor on  both practice \ndays but  stayed dry for  race day —  good for the  fans, \nbut  not  for the  SBK  regulars who'd had  hardly any  dry \ntrack time. Shane Byrne joined a  long list of locals who \nhave ‘done good’ when they've competed at their \nhome round, winning both races at the  undulating Kent \ncircuit. He  used his  long-time track knowledge to  blitz \nthe  opposition, though Race 2 was a  much tougher \ncall. Britons filled all the  remaining rostrum places, \ntoo  (Hodgson and  Walker in the  first race, Reynolds \nand  Toseland in the  second), bettering the  result at \nOschersleben earlier in the  year. Xaus was now 140 \npoints behind Hodgson, with only a  possible 150  points \nremaining, having DNFd in Race 1 and  then taken \nfourth. But  at  least he was better off than Petronas. \nThree DNFs and a finish outside the  points were hardly \nwhat they’d have hoped for,  or  might have expected, at \na  ‘home’ event. \n\nHodgson had  become a father just before Assen and \nhe celebrated that, and winning the  title, with a second \nplace in Race 1. On  his slow-down lap the  crowd, \nfull  of the  usual legion of British fans, was treated \nto  Hodgson’s T-shirt bearing the  slogan ‘Who's your \nDaddy?’ It was almost like  the  glory days of another \nLancastrian, Carl Fogarty, though perhaps lacking the \nsame intensity. The first race had been a  nervy, close- \nquarter, four-way affair, with Xaus and  Hodgson both \nlittering the  6.027-km circuit with mistakes; they finished \nin that order, with Chill third and  Toseland losing out \non  the  run  to the  flag. Chili had  taken Superpole with a \ntime only a second slower than the  best of the  MotoGP \nboys earlier in the  year —  and on  a  Ducati two levels \nbelow Hodgson’s. In Race 2 the  new champion, freed of \npressure, got  his own back on  his team-mate, winning \nhis  12th race of the year by almost half  a second. Lavilla \nwas a distant third, to  make up for  his  DNF in Race \n1, and  even Petronas had a positive day, with Corser \ncoming sixth and  ninth. \nThe  title  might have been decided before Imola, with \nXaus virtually assured the  runner-up spot, but  it didn’t \nstop the  Fila  team-mates slugging it out, lap after lap, \nfor top spot at  Ducati’s home circuit. In the  first  part \nof the  season Xaus had  struggled with the  new \n999 FO3, but  Imola was a  perfect example of how far \nhe’d progressed and, although Hodgson had  lost  none \nof his determination and  tried everything he knew (and \nmore!), the  Spaniard was too  strong. Third went to \nLaconi, with Lavilla fourth and  Chili a tremendous fifth \nafter starting from pit lane. Hodgson outbraked himself \nin Race 2 and  lost  places as  he thundered through the \ngravel. To  his credit, he fought back and  even managed \nto  pass Walker in the  final stages. Xaus was again the \ncomfortable winner, taking the flag some 12  seconds \nahead of Laconi, with Lavilla third. Toseland failed to \nscore, but  Corser and  Petronas had  more cause for \noptimism with a  pair of sevenths. The  biggest story of \nthe weekend, though, was Michelin lining up their top  - \nduo of Hodgson and  Xaus on  what seemed to  be  rear \ncut  slicks. There had  been no  change in track conditions, \nso  what were the  French company playing at?  According \nto their spokesman, it was the  first  use  of the  type of \n(production?) tyre they'd intended to  run  in Supersport \nin 2004 —  had  they not  been denied the  chance by the \nFGSport/Pirelli tie-up. It was obvious that Pirelli didn’t \nbelieve this, preferring to think of the  rubber on  show \nas  merely hand-cut clicks made to  look like  Michelin’s \nDOT offerings. Whatever the  point, it was a  more than \neffective message to those concerned. \nMagny-Cours in mid-October is not  renowned \nfor  its warm, balmy conditions and  although rain \nwasn’t on  the  menu, bitterly cold conditions were. \nThe  track temperature never rose above 21°C, even \nin the  afternoon, and  the  freezing cold caused many \nfallers, with just  15 finishers in Race 1 and 17  in Race \n2.  Hodgson led  the  charge in the  first race, despite his \nboot almost coming loose, taking his  13th win  of the \nseason. Once again it was team-mate Xaus who pushed \nhim  all the  way, even though he’d only qualified eighth. \nRuben rode with determined but  controlled aggression \nto finish a very close second, leaving many wondering \nwhy he'd not  done that from the  start, and  then took a \nvery comfortable win  in the  second race, a total of seven \nvictories from his  last twelve outings. Toseland posted \nfifth and  second places to  secure third spot overall in the \nchampionship on  271, just four points clear of Laconi. \nJames then performed a  burn-out with friend and \nteam-mate Walker, happy in the  knowledge that 2004 \nwould see  him  in an  all-changed factory Ducati team \nalongside his French rival. Walker's prospects were not \nso  clear, though he'd ended the  season strongly with \ntwo thirds, finishing sixth overall. Lavilla’s two fourths \nalso saw him  fourth in the  championship, ahead of \nChili, who had suffered a  pair of DNFs. The new boys, \nPetronas, fizzled out  with just an  eighth place from \nCorser in the  penultimate race. As  starts go,  it had  been \nan  inauspicious one, but  there was always 2004 to  look \nforward to. \nAbove: Support for the  Brits \nat  Brands Hatch, with just a \ntouch of Japanese. \nBelow: Team-mates Chris \nWalker and  James Toseland \nburn rubber at  Magny-Cours \nbefore going their separate \nways. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 171 \n\nry a) ig 3 James Toseland, GB,  Ducati 3.

In  taking the  title at  the  very last \nrace of the  year Briton James Toseland had to  overcome \nodds that would have got  the  better of most riders, \nbut  to  go  to  the  cauldron of Magny-Cours, behind in \npoints to  team-mate Regis Laconi, and come out  the \nwinner in  front of the  Frenchman's home crowd was \none of the  great moments in  World Superbike history \nAnd Toseland also went into  the  record books as  the \nyoungest-ever title-holder, eclipsing Aussie Troy Corser’s \nachievement eight years earlier \nAlthough James was only 23  he’d already been \nracing for  nine years on  tarmac, starting with the  UK \nJunior Road Racing Series in  1995 and  winning the \nHonda CB500 Cup in  the  UK  at just 16.  His  rise  to  World \nSuperbike glory hadn't been either steady or  meteoric; \ninstead, he  came up  through the  school of hard knocks, \nsuffering breaks to  both ankles, a fractured femur \nand spells with uncompetitive machinery, but  always \ndisplaying a  gritty approach to  racing. He  fought all  his \ndemons and, once he  started his  World Superbike career \nwith Team GSE, there would be  no  doubt as  to  his \ndesire and determination to  be  a  winner \nThe 2004 season did  not start promisingly, however \nDucati were still  the  only factory team involved, despite \nthe  dropping of the  controversial ‘restricters’ rule from \nthe  previous year. The factory boycott (real or  perceived \nby the  Japanese manufacturers did  not  bode well for \nthe  11-race series, and the  single-make tyre regulations \ndidn’t help either. World Superbike was being regarded \nby some as  at  its  lowest ebb for  years, while for \nothers, such as  series bosses the  Flammini Group, the \nlack of factory involvement meant the  championship \nwas returning to  Its  roots and the  one-make tyre | \nwould help, not hinder, that return. Paolo Flammi \nthe  Group's CEO, had noted MotoGP’s ever-spiralling \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 175 \n\n\n\ncosts and knew there was no  way the  World Superbike \nChampionship could go  the  same way. What he and \nthe  Flammini Group put  in  place was a  gamble, no \ndoubt, but  by the  end  of the  year it wasn’t looking such \na  bad idea —  and  the  proof was consistently close and \nexciting racing. Furthermore, the  Big Four were gearing \nthemselves up  to  return, albeit with importer, dealer or \nprivateer teams. \nWith 2004 champ Hodgson and runner-up Ruben \nXaus off  to  MotoGP, the  factory Fila  Ducati team called \nup  the  riders who'd placed third and  fourth in  the \n2003 standings —  Toseland and Laconi. Both had  been \nwith satellite Ducati teams, so  it was almost a  smooth \ntransition. What was not  so  smooth, though, was the \nmove to  the  new one-make Pirelli tyres and  all  the \nproblems that entailed. Fila  Ducati found themselves, \nuncharacteristically, in the  same boat as  everybody else, \nsomething they'd probably not  experienced since the \nchampionship’s early years. Their 999 FO4s were not \nappreciably different from the  2003 bikes —  they didn’t \nreally have to  be, after all —  but  strangely it was the \nchassis that proved tricky at  times. Indeed, Toseland \nwould spend a large part of the  season not  being \ncomfortable with the  bike and it took a  private Mugello \ntest  in the  summer before he felt  at  home with the \nmachine. Once he did, he took two wins and  was on  the \npodium six times in the  last  six  races. He  might only have \nwon three races compared to  his  team-mate’s seven, but \nhe  DNFd three times to  Laconi’s five  and  that difference \n—  and his  unbelievable performance in the  last  round \n—  was enough to take the  title. \nTheir biggest challenge came from the  ‘Samurai \nof Slide’, Noriyuki Haga, on  the  Ducati 999 RSO4, the \nPrevious spread: James \nToseland, the  youngest-ever \nWorld Superbike Champio1 \nFar left: Toseland celebrates \nin Assen. \nLeft: The  emotions get to \nToseland after crossing the \nline  in  Magny-Cours. \nBelow: Chris Vermeulen \nand the  Ten Kate Honda \ngot  better and better as  the \nseason wore on. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 177 \n\ni \nfeted \n1=4174 \n= \nLD \nCHAMPION,;HIP \n| \nworldsbk.com \nfia \n»    \nPC \n¢ \n\" \nJ \npat \n7 \nAbove: Frenchman Regis \nLaconi did  the  double \nat  Imola. \ncustomer version of the  F04. Haga’s bike looked almost \nidentical and  was close in performance, but  it was an \nexpensive and  finicky beast and  would test  the \nresources (technical and  financial) of team owner Mark \nGriffiths and his crew. Nori was partnered by 21-year-old \nLeon Haslam, son  of racing legend ‘Rocket’ Ron, but \nalthough the  bikes were patently very competitive, both \nwould suffer from a seemingly never-ending demand for \nnew parts. \nThe  other challenge to Toseland and Laconi came \nfrom a  most unlikely source: rookie team Ten  Kate \nHonda. The Dutch outfit had  won the World Supersport \ntitle  the  year before and decided to  play with the  big \nboys in 2004, using the  new 1000cc Fireblade piloted \nby their Supersport Champion, Aussie Chris Vermeulen. \nAt the  beginning of the  year, and  in the  early races, \nthe  bike was more of a  road bike with some race \nparts instead of a fully fledged member of the  World \nSuperbike fast  club, but  the  CBR1OOORR just got better \nand better as  the  season progressed. Ten  Kate were \nquick to  point out  that theirs was not  a  ‘factory HRC’ \nbike by any  means, rather it was all their own work \n—  with a little help from their friends in Japan. \nFoggy Petronas returned for their second season \nwith a  new engine partner: Ricardo Engineering took \nover from Suter Racing Technologies. Troy Corser was \njoined by Chris Walker but, although the  team took a \ncouple of podium finishes and  two Superpoles, it was \nanother tough year for the  British-based outfit. The \nevergreen Chili showed up  again, on  one  of the  new \n999RS Ducatis, and  took to  it like  a duck to  a frozen \nlake. Frankie just didn’t get on  with the  new bike \nand  it wasn’t long before the  paddock was treated \nto  one  he and  the  team had  made earlier —  a 998.5 \nas  he affectionately called it.  It was part 999RS and \npart 998FO2 and  gave the  Italian the  feel  he wanted \n—and it was legal. Not  that the  (Italian) organisers of \nthe  series would have thrown out  one  of the  crowd's \nfavourites, even if the  bike was a bit of a sore point \n178 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nfor  Ducati. Alstare Suzuki were noticeable absentees, \nhaving decided to  sit the  year out, so  the  Hamamatsu \nflag was carried mainly by Chinese company Zongshen. \nWith Superbike veteran Piergiorgio Bontempi and former \nWorld Endurance Champion Warwick Nowland on \nboard, the  riders had  pedigree, but  with zero factory \ninvolvement their highest finish was ninth. \nThe  first race took place in  Valencia, in late  February, \nand  it was clearly too  early in the  year for  most of the \nplayers, with only the  factory Ducati team really ready. It \nwas also the  first time with the  new Pirelli control tyres \nand  the  initial effect was slower lap times than previous \nseasons. Conditions on  race-day morning were tricky, to \nsay  the  least, with rain  giving way to  a  drying track and \ncausing a variety of tyre choices. There were numerous \nfallers, including Laconi, who only got as  far as  Turn 2 \non  the  opening lap. Team-mate Toseland took the win, \ndespite pressure from Chili and Steve Martin throughout \nthe  23-lapper. The unlucky Aussie should have had  third, \nbut  his  privateer Ducati blew up just two laps from the \nend, letting Walker into  third place —  and  the  first-ever \npodium for  Foggy Petronas. Haga took a comfortable \nwin  in Race 2, with Toseland second and Martin getting \nhis just rewards with a third place. The hapless Laconi \nonce again failed to score, though this  time it was his \nchain coming off  rather than any  mistake of his own. \nAt  Round 2, in Phillip Island, Laconi made up for  his \nweekend to forget in Spain by completely dominating \nthe  first race, running out  the  winner by a whopping \nseven seconds. Behind, though, was a thrilling four-rider \nbattle between Vermeulen, Toseland, Martin and McCoy \nfor the  remaining podium places. In a frantic dash to the \nline  Vermeulen took runner-up spot, with Toseland third, \nbut the  gap  between Chris and  fifth-placed McCoy \nwas  just seven-tenths of a second at the  flag. Former \nMotoGP race winner McCoy then gave his  home fans a \ntreat by taking victory in Race 2, despite luridly sliding \nhis 999 Ducati the whole way round the 4.445-km \ncircuit. Fellow-countryman Vermeulen was second, Chili \nthird, with Borciani’s privateer Ducati fourth, ahead of \nyet another Aussie, Corser, in fifth. Martin had  been \nfighting McCoy for the  lead in the  race, but  another \nblow-up saw his challenge evaporate three laps from \nthe  end. Although lap times were down compared to \nprevious years, the  fans enjoyed a spectacle of rear-end \nslides, smoking tyres and  closer racing, with the  four \nraces to  date producing four different winners. \nMisano was the  scene for  Round 3, in April rather \nthan its usual summertime slot  —  and  it seemed the \nmove was not  a good one, for the  weekend was \nblighted by rain. At  least the  home fans left the  Adriatic \ncircuit happy because Chili's third in Race 1 and \nemotional victory in the  second race were enough to \nmove the  Italian into  the  title  lead. The  first race was \nshortened by a  lap after Bontempi’s Suzuki failed to fire \nup  on  the  start line  and  then stopped after 17  laps due \nto the  adverse conditions. Corser had  put the  Petronas \nin front for the  best part of the  first 14  laps, but  Laconi \novertook him  just before the  heavens opened again. \nTroy had  been tantalisingly close to  giving the  Malaysian \n\ncompany its  first-ever win, but  runner-up spot was \nthe  best result of their short World Superbike history \nChili was ahead of Haga and Vermeulen, with Walker's \nsixth making it two Petronas bikes in  the  top  six.  Series \nleader Toseland had only qualified 20th, but  a  gritty \ntenth kept his  points tally ticking over. Race 2 was wet \nand rain-master Chili took the  win after slipping and \nsliding around in  the  early stages behind Laconi. The \nFrenchman held second comfortably, with Martin taking \na thoroughly well-deserved third. Toseland charged to \nsixth place and  20  points behind Chili going into Round \n4, knowing it was going to  be yet another ‘home’ race \nfor the  Italian. \nThere had  now been five  different winners in six \nraces, but  Monza saw something of a  return to  normal \nbusiness. The  factory Ducati team of Laconi and \nToseland took a  1-2  in both races and, to  keep the \npodium symmetrical, McCoy took two thirds. If Ducati \nhad  been unhappy about Chili's adoption of old  chassis \nand new engine in  his  998.5 they must have had  a wry \nsmile as  the  Italian suffered two DNFs. In  Race 1 his \nbike failed at the  first  chicane and  he  had  to  ‘borrow’ \na  scooter to  get  back to  pit lane and  jump onto his \nunfavoured 999. \nHe  started dead last, but  got  up  to  14th after five \nlaps before his  engine went bang. Worse was to  come in \nRace 2, when he crashed at  the  Parabolica after pushing \nthe  front too  hard. The  ever-popular Italian's pair of \nno-scores dropped him  from first to third behind new \nchampionship leader Laconi and team-mate Toseland \nOschersleben is  not  a  fast circuit and overtaking \nis  difficult, but  Haga showed that he was completely \nat  home in  the  twisty bits  by taking the  chequered \nflag in  Race 1, some five  seconds in  front of Toseland. \nChill made up  for some of his  Monza disappointment \nby taking third place, and Corser and Petronas had  a \ngood race, finishing fourth. The  German track suited \nthe  sweet-handling Petronas, where power is  not  at \na  premium, but  Troy couldn't repeat the  feat in  Race \n2, retiring like  so  many others. There were only 14 \nfinishers, Laconi won the  race by a  massive 21  seconds \nfrom Toseland and fellow-Briton Haslam took third. \nHaga had led  the  race and looked set  for  a superb \ndouble, but  his  unreliable bike let  him  down again, \nsix  laps from the  end. Toseland’s pair of seconds took \nhim  back to  the  top  of the  standings, but  the  margin \nbetween him  and Laconi was just  two points. \nToseland was hoping for  a home success at \nSilverstone, but  although the  crowd could enjoy the \nsunshine they didn’t get the  result they wanted. James \nfailed to  finish in  the  first  race and  only managed fifth \nin the  second. Fortunately for  him, Laconi also had \na  first-race crash, so  the  points damage was limited. \nHaga took his third win  of the  year, narrowly beating \nVermeulen after 20  action-packed laps, with Chili third. \nRace 2 saw history made, with Vermeulen giving a \n1000cc four-cylinder bike its first-ever World Superbike \nwin. It was also the  championship’s 400th race and \nUirtiviviiel \n[56 ©   Ose oes =  yf  | \nBelow: Troy Corser’s \nsecond place in  Misano was \nPetronas FP1’s best-ever \nresult. \n177s \n\nalg ee \nIEPs \nDUNLOF \nDBD UN TOE \nwe, \n‘of a second and once again his main foe was Haga.  — \nThe two of them had  slugged it out for a second time, \nbut this time it was  the young Aussie and  Honda who \nprevailed. Laconi was  third and  back at the top of the \ntable, with Haslam fourth. It had  been an  eventful \nday for  Chili, forced to start from the  fourth row  after \nclutch problems in Superpole, so  his third place in Race \n1 had  been nothing short of amazing. In Race 2, he \nwas  trying to  pass Toseland but  hit the  rumble strip and \ncrashed, taking James off the  track. Frankie was out, but \nToseland recovered to  take fifth. Afterwards the  veteran \ngave the  young Briton a  piece of his  mind, but  that \ncouldn't make up for the  fact  that he’d now dropped to \nfifth in  the  standings. \nLaguna Seca was a Vermeulen-fest, with Chris \nachieving a  double in the  California sun  on  his  bright \nyellow Ten  Kate Honda, despite never having seen the \ntrack before, to  make it an  astonishing three wins in a \nrow. The  usual bunch of wild cards was absent —  unable \nto  take part because of the  Pirelli one-make rule  —  but \nthe  racing was still  entertaining. Tyre grip (or  lack of it) \nin the: \n“second, suffering a problem with front-end grip, and \nMartin third. Toseland and  Laconi’s grip problems were \nat the  other end  of the  bike and  they finished fourth \nand  fifth respectively. Toseland had  led  Race 1 and \nhis fiery determination carried over into  a fight with \nVermeulen in the  second: he tried everything he knew \n(plus a few  other things for good measure) to stay \nahead but the  Aussie did  enough to win  by four-tenths \nof a  second. Third, some way back, was Laconi, with \nHaga fourth and  Chili fifth. Laguna was not  a  happy \nhunting ground for Team Foggy Petronas. They had  a \nnewly upgraded engine spec, but  Corser’s tenth place \nin the  first  race  was  all the  team had  to show for their \nefforts as  they left  for the  long flight back to  Europe. \nBrands Hatch had new owners —  Motor Sport \nVentures —  and  they were delighted with the  huge \ncrowd and superb weather. Over the  years, the  Brands \nHatch round has  gone from being just a  race on  the \ncalendar to  a  ‘must-go-to’ event. The  fact  that a  Brit  was \nleading the  championship obviously helped although, \n\ninishing st \nout  of Race 2 after just three laps. Race 1 began with \n~  an  eight-rider battle and  ended with Haga and  Laconi \nfighting for top  honours after Chili crashed out  of \ncontention with seven laps remaining. When Haga’s bike \nwas on  song, the  Japanese rider was almost unbeatable. \nThat, together with his gutsyness, saw off  Laconi’s \nchallenge, though once again the  margin of victory was \nsmall —  0.134s. Superpole winner Martin took third, \nahead of fellow-Aussies Vermeulen and  Corser. The \nsecond race was a two-parter, after Italian De  Matteis \ncrashed and broke his collarbone. His  team-mate Chili's \nDucati had  only just  been rebuilt in time to  make the \nStart line  and  the  Italian was all  fired up  in  front of a \ncrowd who had  learned to  love him  as  their own. Haga \nwas in  front when the  race was stopped and  then he \nand Laconi had a terrific scrap in  the  second part, until \nthe  Frenchman crashed out. Chili crossed the  line  first \nand  thought he was the  outright winner, but  when the \ntimes were aggregated he’d finished second to  Haga. \nHis  celebrations on  the  slow-down lap were those of a \nourite Walker \n: uble  had  seen him close up to third in \nthe championship, with Vermeuelen now lying second \nto leader-Laconi and  Toseland in fourth, the top four \ncovered by just eight points. \nThe  summer break gave Toseland the  chance for \na  private test  at Mugello to  unlock some of his 999’s \nsecrets. Suddenly, from having to  fight his  bike, he was \nnow in control. Assen is one  of the  best-loved circuits \non  the  calendar and  has  always been eventful for  Chili: \nthis  time he took Superpole. He  and  the  top  four riders \nin the  title  race all figured throughout the  pair  of  16- \nlappers on  another race day blessed by sun. Fresh from \nhis  recent test, Toseland dominated Race 1, despite the \nattentions of Chili, Laconi, Haga and  Vermeulen. Any \none  of the  five  could've won, but  James led  every lap, \nincluding the  all-important last  one. Chili took second, \nwith Laconi third and Haga fourth, only four-tenths of a \nsecond separating the  trio  at  the  flag. Race 2 witnessed \nyet another multi-rider battle with three riders separated \nby a  minuscule one-tenth at  the  end. Four different \nriders led  the  race, with the  lead changing eight \nAbove: California gold \nrush —  Chili on  pole, with \nVermeulen, Toseland and \nMartin on  the  front row. \n\nRight: Haga gives his  Ducati \nsome air  at  Phillip Island. \nBelow: In World Superbikes \nthe  Paddock Show gives all \nfans a  chance to  get close \nto  their heroes. \nross the  finish line  and more out  on  the  long, \n}  6.027-km circuit. On  the  final lap Vermeulen \n2|and traded places several times, with Haga \n}  to  pick up  the  pieces in  third, but  the  Honda \nler  just  did  enough to  take victory, by a  mere 0.037s. \noseland’s victory and runner-up spot had handed him \nback the  series lead, but  Laconi, Vermeulen and Haga \nwere all  very much still  in  contention. \nImola is very close to  the  Ducati factory, and the \nItalian company certainly expected to  take victory in \nboth races. Laconi was equally determined that he \nwould leave Imola a  clear championship leader and, \nright from the  start, he  looked fluent and in  control of \nboth himself and  his  bike. He  had  to work hard for the \nwin  in  Race 1, chasing Vermeulen down before surging \npast the  Australian in  the  closing stages. Toseland hung \nin  as  best he could to  take third after fighting off  Haga \nfor  most of the  race. Laconi and  Toseland then went at \nit like  hammer and  tongs in  the  second race, hurtling \naround the  undulating track, leaving the  pack trailing \nway behind, in  their own personal duel. Team-mates \nthey might have been, but  no  quarter was given. The \nFrenchman won the  battle, by just  0.041s, but the  war \nwas  far from over. Martin took third, a  long way back, \nwith the  Ducatis of Nannelli and McCoy fourth and  fifth. \nVermeulen had  been highsided on  the  sighting lap and \ninjured his foot, hand and  hip.  He  was given a lift back \nto the  grid by Bussei and had  to  scramble through a \nsignalling gap to  get to  his  pit, where he jumped onto \nhis spare bike. He  then had  to  start the  race from pit \nlane, but  although he  lapped as  fast  as  the  leaders he \nwas too  far  back to  catch them. He  finished sixth, his \ntitle hopes in tatters, but  he  had  signalled that he was \nundoubtedly a  rider to watch. Haga also put  himself \nout  of contention with another DNF, leaving the  title a \nstraight fight between team-mates Laconi and  Toseland. \nWith one  round remaining Regis had  a four-point lead — \nand he was heading for  his  home race and  the  support \nof all the  French fans. \nJames Toseland might have been behind in \nthe  points, but  it was Laconi who appeared to  be \nsuffering more from the  pressure. Despite his  points \nand home advantage, and the  fact that the  Ducati \nhierarchy seemed to  favour him  over the  more reserved \nEnglishman, he could only manage fifth quickest in \nSuperpole. In  Race 1 Toseland and Haga disputed the \nlead throughout the  23  laps, but  it was Toseland who \ndeterminedly took the  win  and  put  Laconi under even \nmore pressure. The Frenchman took third place after \nVermeulen’s Honda ran  into problems. He  was now \nfive  points behind his team-mate and rival. Superpole \nwinner Corser got the  holeshot in Race 2, but Toseland, \nVermeulen and Haga led  the  cavalry charge, with the \nJapanese running out  the  eventual winner, by some \nthree seconds. Toseland was second and  claimed the \ntitle, the  distraught Laconi down in third. The  see-saw \nnature of the  title  chase had  seen the  leadership change \nhands nine times during the  season, but  Toseland’s extra \ndetermination and  desire to win  was the  crucial factor in \ncarrying him  to victory. \n‘During the  first part of the  season, it was hard going \nand | wondered if | was ever going to  get on  with the \nbike,’ said the  new champion, ‘but | kept on  working. | \nwas determined to  understand the  bike and  ride  it to  Its, \nand my,  potential —  probably to  the  despair of the  team! \nThe  Mugello test  was  a  real  turning point and, after that, \n| knew | had  a very good chance. | went into  the  last \nround knowing that | could win  the  title.

Troy Corser became the \nfirst rider in  the  history of the  series to  win the  World \nChampionship for  two different manufacturers; it was \nthe  first-ever title for  Suzuki and for  a  1000cc four- \ncylinder bike; and it was a first for  Team Alstare. Troy's \nprevious title had been nine years earlier, in  1996, when \nhe was in  the semi-privateer Promotor Ducati team, \nand he’d also been leading in  1998 until a  bad crash in \nthe  last round, at  Sugo, when he  broke three ribs and \nruptured his  spleen. He  spent two seasons with Aprilia \nand was with Foggy Petronas for  2003-4, but  when the \nchance came to  ride  for  Francis Batta’s Alstare outfit, on \nthe  new Suzuki GSX-R1000, he jumped at  it \nAlstare carried out  an  extensive programme of \nwinter tests and when the  season began Corser and \nthe  team came out  of the  starting blocks firing on  all \nfour cylinders. If anybody thought the  Aussie’s desire to \nwin had been blunted by his  semi-wilderness years, his \nvictory in  the  first race of the  year, starting a  run  of six \nwins in  the  first  seven races, dispelled any  misgivings \nThe  groundwork for  the  title  was done before the  rest \nhad a  chance to  catch their breath and it was eight \nrounds and 16 races before Troy failed to  get  on  the \npodium. He  didn’t manage a  win after Brands Hatch, \nbut he kept his  points tally ticking over, and even though \nVermeulen outscored him in  the latter stages he  had \ndone more than enough to  become champion \nThe 2005 series was the  second year of  the  Pirelli \none-make tyre rule and it  received a  couple of  fillips \nbefore the  very early start; first, all  the  Japanese \nmanufacturers returned in  some form or  another \n(though it’s  difficult to   know exactly how ‘factory \nthey were) and second, the  series got  a  title sponsor \n—-  Corona, which brought glamour in  the  shape of  the \nCorona girls and very welcome supplies of  their beer! \nThe number of  teams taking part increased substantially \nfrom the year before, with 30  riders regularly lined up \nf \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 187 \n\nExt \ncary \n—— \nOAAALYA \nSER \nrtp \npeppy \npe \ncr \n\nthe  grid and  feeling that, because of the  one-make tyre, \nthey genuinely had  a  chance of success. \nThe  factory Ducati team changed sponsors (Xerox \ninstead of Fila)  but  kept the  same riders —  2004 champ \nJames Toseland and  Frenchman Regis Laconi —  though it \nwould prove to  be a  hard year for them and  the  Bologna \nmarque. Their new 999FO5 bikes had  been completely \nrevamped, with huge work done to the  electronics \nand injection systems. Improvements in the  engine \ndepartment liberated another five  horsepower and \nthat, together with the  rest  of the  factory mods, meant \nthere was now quite a  difference between them and \nthe  customer bikes. A relative lack  of winter tests meant \nthey had  to  play catch-up but, once they got there, they \nproved equal to  the  best of the  Japanese bikes. \nThe  Ten  Kate CBR1000RR Hondas received a  boost \nin the  form of sponsorship from tobacco company \nWinston, which meant a change from yellow to  blue \nand  white. Chris Vermeulen was  joined by fellow- \ncountryman and 2004 World Supersport Champion, Karl \nMuggeridge and, despite getting their material late, the \nDutch outfit were fast  from the  start. \nItalian-based PSG-1 ran  the  top  Kawasaki team in \n2005, with Chris Walker on  board, partnered by Mauro \nSanchini. The  bike was clearly fast, thanks to  its  French \nengine tuners Akira, but  the  chassis caused quite a \nfew  problems and  gave the  team a lot of work to  do \nthroughout the  season. \nAfter taking a year out, Alstare Suzuki came back \nwith a  bang. Having secured the  services of long- \nAbove: Dream start for \nAlstare Suzuki in the  desert \n—  Troy Corser and  Yukio \nKagayama take a  1-2. \nFar  left: ‘Mr  Smooth’, Troy \nCorser, doing what he  does \nbest. \nBelow: Chris Vermeulen \nwas Corser’s strongest rival \nthroughout the  season. \nHere he  leads Corser in the \nonly race at  Imola. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 189 \n\nAbove: Yukio Kagayama \nand  Noriyuki Haga —  fierce \ncompetitors, but  good \nfriends off-track. \ntime favourite Corser, Batta’s well-prepped squad \nenjoyed support from Japan, but  insisted that GSX- \nR1000 bikes were tuned and  fettled in Belgium. The \nnew bikes were well balanced, had  a  strong torque \nrange and  benefited from factory Showa suspension, \ncomplete with a dedicated technician. There was further \nJapanese content with the  welcome arrival of Yukio \nKagayama, a  long-time favourite in the  British Superbike \nChampionship and  self-confessed ‘crazy rider’. He  wasn't \nin the  team just to  make up  the  numbers, though \n—he won the  second race and  left  the  first  round as \nchampionship leader. \nPetronas FP-1 had  a  new team-manager, Jack \nValentine, and new top-name riders in  Steve Martin and \nGarry McCoy, but  their 900cc triple was always destined \nto  struggle against the  massed hordes of  1000cc fours. \nThe original concept of a triple, with a  reversed cylinder \nhead, was clearly up  against it and no  amount of rider \nskill  or  commitment could make up  for the  machine's \nfailings. \nlf Corser and Suzuki had been a  marriage made in \nheaven (or  at  least Hamamatsu), then Noriyuki Haga \nand Yamaha were an  equivalent pairing. The R1  had \nbeen a  potent tool in  the  Superstock class and  the  newly \nformed Yamaha Motor Italia squad had  the  look of a \n‘factory team’, based as  they were in  the  same building \nas  Yamaha's MotoGP squad. Former World Supersport \nChampion Andrew Pitt  joined Haga on a bike that \nstarted the  season more Superstock than Superbike and \nit was the  seventh round before rider and bike worked \n190 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nin perfect harmony and recorded their first win. \nThe increased grid saw the  return of Ben Bostrom, \nwho replaced Haga in the  Renegade team (now on \nCBR1000RR Hondas) from the  year before. It was a \nfrustratingly mixed season of crashes and  few highlights \nfor the  American, due  to the  unreliability of the  bikes \nand behind-the-scenes squabbles. Also Honda-mounted \nwas the  oldest racer in the  field, Pierfrancesco Chili, and \nthe  youngest, Max Neukirchner, both riding for Team \nKlaffi Honda. Like  Team Renegade (and many others) \nthey'd spend most of the  year trying to  improve their \nbikes. Yamaha Motor France entered the  fray with \nformer GP  winner Norick Abe and  Sébastien Gimbert, \nand two other ex-GP riders —  Fonsi Nieto (partnered \nby rising Italian Lorenzo Lanzi) in Team Ducati SC \nCaracchi and fellow-Spaniard José Luis  Cardoso (Yamaha \nDFXtreme) —  also  joined the  Superbike club. \nSo  a  new era  for World Superbikes and a  new track \nfor the  first race of the  year: Losail, Qatar. The  facility \nwas brand new and had  everything a  modern race track \ncould offer; the  only thing missing was the  fans. Not \nthat Corser and team-mate Kagayama noticed, for  each \ntook a win and a  podium to  give Alstare Suzuki a  dream \nstart and leave the  rest of the  pack worried. It was the \nfirst time in  the  history of the  series that Suzuki had \nscored a  double and, ominously, looked like  it wouldn't \nbe the  last. Troy’s win in  Race 1 came after an  unusual \noccurrence in  the  desert: rain! The race started dry, \nbut  when rain  began to  fall  after ten  laps, and Laconi \ncrashed as  the  conditions worsened, it was red-flagged. \n\nKagayama won the  second part ‘on  the  road’, but \nCorser had  stuck close by in  second and  took the  overall \nwin, with Laconi third. New boy Pitt  took fourth, with \nteam-mate Haga fifth and  2004 champion Toseland \nsixth. In the  second race, a  too-hard rear  tyre cost \nCorser the  double and  he  had  to settle for third, but  at \nleast team-mate Kagayama won, with Laconi second. \nEight riders began the  battle for fourth, with Vermeulen \ntaking the  honours ahead of Chili and  Toseland —  not  an \nauspicious start for the  former GP  stars, with Abe's pair \nof top tens the  best of the  bunch. It was, however, a  lot \nbetter than Petronas, who managed just a  single point \nbetween them. \nIf ever a  rider was made for  Phillip Island, that rider \nwas Troy Corser —  especially when he  had  the  right \ntool for the job. He  and  the  GSX-R1000 had  topped \nthe  tests there and  should have led  the  charge in \nqualifying, but  he found himself way down the  pecking \norder after Superpole —  even behind the  Petronas. Chili \nwas a  non-starter, thanks to  a  broken collarbone, and \nthe  new 1000cc four-cylinder bikes were surprisingly \noutgunned (in top  speed anyway) by Laconi’s Ducati, \nwhich burst through the  speed trap at a  staggering \n318km/h (197.6mph). Only 16  riders finished Race 1, \ndue  to crashes and  other DNFs, with Corser taking \nthe win, eight seconds ahead of team-mate (and \nSuperpole winner), Kagayama. Vermeulen used his  local \nknowledge to take third, but  only after a  battle with \nrookie Neukirchner, which saw both paint and rubber \ntraded. The  good news for the  start of Race 2 was that \nthe  wind had  died down; the  bad  news was rain  after \n12  laps, which caused the  red  flag to come out. And \nso,  for the  second time in two rounds, another two- \nparter. Conditions were tricky to  say  the  least, and  there \nwere numerous fallers, notably at the  Hayshed, where \nWalker, Pitt  and Haga all succumbed. Laconi managed a \nspectacular ‘save’ there, only to fall  further up  the  hill  at \nLukey Heights. He  restarted and  took seventh place in a \nrace that saw only 14 finishers. Corser kept his  head to  . \ntake his second win  of the  day, with Kagayama second \nand Neukirchner a  superb third. \nThe  Corser roadshow continued its  momentum at \nValencia, with yet another double for the  Alstare rider, \nbut  the  big surprise of the  weekend was that none of \nthe  Ducatis really featured on  a track that’s normally \ntheir kind of territory. The  best they could manage was \nToseland’s ninth in the  first  race and  no  Ducati (factory \nOr  private) even got  a  point in the  second —  a  big change \nfrom the  year before when they practically filled the \ntop  ten. Honda was Suzuki's main challenger, with \nVermeulen taking a  pair of runner-up spots. Kagayama \nwas third in  Race 1 and  Walker third on  the  Kawasaki \nin  Race 2, leaving only Yamaha without a  podium \nplace so  far.  Laconi didn’t even get to  the  start line: a \nheavy fall  in  qualifying left  him  with concussion and  the \ndoctors wisely ruled him  out. Neukirchner was back in \nthe  news again, this  time for different reasons, when \nhe suffered the  biggest highside of the  year in  the  first \nrace, his sliding Honda taking out  Lanzi before pushing \nMuggeridge off  track. The  Italian broke his  collarbone, \n= Su \naoe \n—— \nAbove: Up close and \npersonal —  Troy Corser leans \non  Troy Bayliss. \nLeft: Former GP  star  Norick \nAbe joined the  World \nSuperbike scene at the  start \nof the  year. \nBelow: Noriyuki Haga in a \nhurry to  leave the  pits. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 191 \n\n192 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nNeukirchner injured his  hand but  Muggeridge escaped \nwithout falling. \nMonza’s fast  track makes for fast  racing, and  should \nreally have favoured the  1000cc fours, bur  Bologna’s \nfinest showed a  huge improvement after their sluggish \nstart and were competitive again. It wasn’t quite \nenough to  stop Corser racking up win number six  out \nof seven starts, but  they did  take two podiums. As \nusual, the  Italian circuit served a feast of high-speed \naction, with the  opening race ending with just 1.75s \ncovering the  top  four. Kagayama played wingman to \nCorser, with Toseland third and Laconi fourth. The Ten \nKate Hondas should have been challengers but, for \nsome unaccountable reason, the  team decided not  to \nuse  the  special ‘Monza’ motors in  Race 1. The plan \nfailed for Vermeulen when his  CBR1000RR ground to  an \nundignified halt  after only a  lap.  In  Race 2, the  ‘Monza’ \nmotor went in and  Vermeulen stole the  win, a  mere \nhalf-second ahead of Laconi. Corser took third, after \ncomplaining about brake problems, ahead of Toseland \nand  Pitt.  There had  been eight riders contesting the \nlead at one  stage of the  race, conclusive proof that you \ndon't need the  fastest bike to  have a  good result at a \nfast  track. \nThe  season took an  unpredictable turn at  Silverstone \nwhen Laconi and  Toseland gave Ducati a win  apiece. \nNormally the  Northants track is suited to the  high-speed \nfours, despite the  mickey-mouse chicane just before the \nstart-finish straight, but the  use  of the  so-called shorter \n‘International’ circuit negated much of the  1000cc bikes’ \nadvantage. There was universal disapproval, from riders \nand  teams alike, especially as  the  information about \nwhich circuit was to  be  used was only discovered a \nweek or  so  before the  event. Nevertheless, the  racing \nwas exciting, the  result unexpected and  the  crowd \nenjoyed Toseland taking a win  on  home soil. James was \nalso in contention in the  first race, but  that was won by \nteam-mate Laconi, with Corser second. However, a win \nand a third for  Ducati was a  huge turnaround, and  a \ngreat relief to  Ducatisti everywhere. Corser led  most of \nthe  second race until overtaken by Toseland, then settled \nfor  runner-up spot after Laconi crashed out  and Haga \nwasn’t close enough to  cause any  problems, knowing \nhe’d increased his championship lead over his  nearest \nrival —  team-mate Kagayama. \nMisano returned to  its traditional summer slot, \nmuch to  everybody’s relief, except perhaps Pirelli: track \ntemperatures were in the  fifties on  race day. Ducati’s \nrecent testing programme (riders and tyres) reaped \ndividends, with Laconi winning both races. Vermeulen \ntook a  pair  of seconds, Corser a  pair of thirds and  the \nsymmetry even extended to Toseland’ s pair  of fourths. \nAlthough the  top  four may have been the  same in  both \n24-lap races, they were very different kettles of fish. \nLaconi ran  away with Race 1, four seconds in  front of \nVermeulen, with Corser a further four seconds adrift; \nRace 2 was a  much closer affair. And Kagayama lost  his \nsecond place in  the  championship. He’d been fined for a \nfist  fight with Spaniard Cardoso in  qualifying and maybe \nthe  red  mist hadn't cleared in  time for  race day. A crash \n\nx \nv \nafter 15  laps of the first race put him  out  and  injured \nhis hand. He then had  to  use  his number two bike and \ncould only manage 12th place in the  second. His  behind- \nthe-scenes work testing for the  Suzuka 8 Hour was cited \nas  a factor in his  loss  of form and, true or  not, it would \nbe the  last  race of the  year before he saw the  podium \nagain. \nIt had  been nine years since the  Superbike circus \nhad  been to  Brno, a  long-time favourite with fans, and \nthis  year’s race saw ‘Nitro-Nori’ Haga break his and \nYamaha's winning duck. His  previous best result so  far \nhad  been a third at Silverstone, but  his  performance \nin Race 2 was nothing short of sensational and  even \noutclassed series leader Corser. Troy had  been without \na win  since Monza and  many observers were beginning . \nto  think that, once again, the  wheels were beginning \nto  come off the  Aussie’s wagon. Not  this  time. He \ndominated practice, and Superpole, and stormed his \nway to victory In Race 1, finishing over six seconds ahead \nof Toseland, with Laconi third and  Walker fourth. He \nwas on  course for another double, but  he’d reckoned \nwithout Haga. The  Japanese rider hadn't even qualified \nfor  Superpole and his  18th position on  the  grid meant \nhe had  to  do  something really special. Nobody had  ever \nwon a  Superbike race from outside the  top  16  before, \nbut  Haga didn’t care about statistics. Lap after lap he \ncharged though the  field, at  record pace, forcing his way \nthrough gaps that didn’t exist until nobody was in front. \nThose fortunate enough to witness it will  never forget \nit—  and  that probably includes runner-up Corser, third- \nplaced Vermeulen and the  rest  of the  riders who saw a \nflash of blue and  white go  past. \nAs  usual the  biggest race on  the  World Superbike \ncalendar was Brands Hatch and, as  ever, the  on-track \naction didn’t disappoint the  massed crowds. Haga, \nfresh from his victory in Brno, was the  only rider to  give \nOVA AUK MV AH \n} 5 Wat ql \n1A Y anil \nCorser a  hard time in the  opening race. The  duo  stuck \nto each other like  glue throughout the  25-lapper, with \nthe  lead changing hands no  less  than seven times, but \nin the  end  Troy just sneaked it, by less  than two-tenths \nof a second. Laconi took third, with Vermeulen fourth \nand  crowd favourite Walker fifth. Toseland DNFd with \nan  ‘electrical problem’, much to the  dismay of his  legions \nof fans looking for  a home win  for the  number-one \nplate-holder. If Race 1 was a  Corser/Haga thriller, Race \n2 was even more of the  same —  if that were possible! \nWith nearest title  rival  Vermeulen finishing only fourth in \nthe  first  Troy didn’t need to win, but  that didn’t prevent \nhim  pulling out  all the  stops and  giving Nori a  helluva \nfight. For  virtually every lap there was hardly daylight \nbetween them. They tangled on  the  back part of the \n4.197-km circuit —  far from the  eyes of the  crowd, but \nvisible on  the  big-screen monitors —  with Corser running \noff-track. He  got  back on  course but  that excursion into \nthe  dirt  gave Haga just the  gap he  needed to  take the \nchequered flag. Vermeulen was third, a  long way down, \nwith Walker netting his second fourth place of the \nday. Two fantastic races with the  top four in each race \ndifferent manufacturers —  what more could the  series \nask  for? \nIf Vermeulen needed to  reassert himself, Assen was \na  good place to  do  it.  His  Ten  Kate team’s headquarters \nwere just down the  road and  hordes of home fans were \nready and willing to  provide vocal support. Like Brands, \nAssen is  another great Superbike venue and  although \nthe  circuit had  been remodelled there was still  enough \nof the  ‘old’ Assen to  please riders and  fans. The  racing \nwas top  notch, too, with the  track still  favouring the \nbest and  fastest riders. Vermeulen started his campaign \nwell, by taking Superpole, and  then fastest lap in  Race 1, \na  record that will  last  forever as  it would be the  last  year \nof the  North Loop. Four riders disputed the  lead until \nAbove: Pole-setter Yukio \nKagayama gets the  holeshot \nat  Phillip Island. \nLeft: Chris Vermuelen \nsmokes the rear at  Assen. \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 193 \n\nA \nAAD \nwea \nya   \nos \neae, \nWt \n< \neal  \nhea \nCER \nMLA \nme \ni \nwai \nI \nbl \nmh \n\nChris decided it was going to  be  his  race, leaving behind \na frenetic battle between Haga, Corser and  Toseland, \nwith James taking second and  Nori third. Corser was \nfourth —  the first  time he’d not  been on  the  podium all \nyear. Race 2 was a straight three-way fight: Vermeulen, \nHaga, Toseland. All three led  several times, but the \nyoung Aussie just held off  Haga out  of the  final chicane \nto take the flag by 0.85s. Toseland was  third, Corser \noff the  podium again in fourth. A crisis? Maybe. But  at \nleast he was  better off than Laconi. The  Frenchman had \ncrashed in qualifying, injuring the tendons in his elbow, \nremoving skin  from his arm  as  he made contact with \nfirst  the tarmac and  then his bike. It was  the  second \ntime this year he’d been forced to  miss races after a \npractice crash. \nThroughout the  season young Italian Lorenzo Lanzi \nhad been doing well on  the  SC  Caracchi Ducati, and \nwhen the  factory Xerox Ducati team looked for a \nreplacement for Laconi at Lausitz the  choice was simple \nbut obvious. Lanzi took his chance right from the  start \nof practice and  surprised even the  Ducati top  brass by \nwinning Superpole. Could he go on  to take victory as \nwell? Championship leader Corser’s non-podium finishes \nin Assen had  given his nearest challenger, Vermeulen, \na glimmer of hope and  the  deficit was now down to \n86  points —  still  a good lead, but  not  an  impossible \ntarget. Lanzi got overexcited at the  start of Race 1 and \ncompletely lost  his Superpole advantage by going into \nthe first  turn too  hot. He  had  to take to the  slip road \nand, by the  time he  recovered, he was in the  middle of \nthe  pack. Vermeulen kept up  his winning streak, making \nit three in a  row, with Haga second and  Corser third, in \na  race halted by rain  on  lap 20  out  of 24. Maybe seeing \nhis young countryman on  the  up was  what prompted \nCorser to  push so  hard in Race 2. Too  hard as  it turned \nout, as  he lost the front going into  Turn 1 and  crashed. \nTroy picked up the  bike and  got going again, dead last, \nbut  rode the wheels off his Suzuki to take 13th place. \nAt the  sharp end  Lanzi showed that his qualifying and \nSuperpole form had  been no  fluke, controlling the  race \nand  running out  the winner 0.84s ahead of Vermeulen, \nwith Haga third. Kagayama’s fifth and  fourth confirmed \nhe'd now completely recovered from his trips to and \nfrom Japan on  Suzuka 8 Hour duties. \nLaconi was deemed fit for  Imola, so  Lausitz hero \nLanzi moved back to the  SC  Caracchi squad, though this \ntime he had  factory engines to  play with. A large part \nof the  crowd had  come to see  the  young Italian and \neven the wet  conditions didn’t put them off,  but they \nwere destined to  leave the  old  circuit feeling robbed. \nA rainstorm of biblical proportions flooded the track \nafter Race 1, causing deep puddles round the 4.933-km \ncircuit. The drains did  their best, but  lakes of standing \nwater and  small rivers running across the  track caused \nthe  top  riders to stop the  second race’s proceedings \nbefore they started. The  start was delayed, then delayed \nfurther, and  finally Corser, Vermeulen and  Laconi went \nout  in pace cars  to take a closer look. They confirmed \nwhat everybody feared, but  it was Race Control who \nmade the  decision to cancel Race 2.  The  decision \nalso meant that Corser was World Champion, for the \nsecond time, depriving Vermeulen of the  chance to \ntake the  fight to the  last  round in Magny-Cours. All  this \novershadowed events in Race 1, where Vermeulen had \ntaken victory in difficult conditions. The  race started \nwet, then the  track began to dry out  as  he and  Corser \nsought to  master both each other and  the  conditions. \nAt  the end  there was only 0.297s between them, with \nHaga a  distant third, Toseland fourth, Martin fifth and \nWalker sixth. Six different manufacturers in the  top six \nwas a vindication of FGSport’s decision to  go with the \none-make tyre rule; it was  just a shame that the  rain \ncame down and  decided everything. \nThere was still  plenty to fight for at  Magny-Cours \n—  apart from first and  second places in the  standings \n—  and  even new champ Corser and  Vermeulen wanted \nto end  the  season on a high. Troy was  taken out  of the \nequation early on  with a  disastrous Superpole, through \nno  fault of his own. Unknown to  him, at least until \nthe  first turn or  so,  a team member had  over-inflated \nhis  rear  tyre by a substantial margin and he spent the \nwhole lap slipping and  sliding around the  track with \nclouds of smoke coming from his  rear  tyre. Entertaining \nto watch, but  an  unsatisfactory 16th-quickest lap time \nand  a fourth-row start as  a  result, so  it’s to  his credit \nhe still  found the  hunger to fight his way up to fifth in \nthe first race and  an  even better fourth in the  second. \nVermeulen continued his run  of good form by leading \nfrom the  start of Race 1 and  was  never headed on  his \nway to  a comfortable eight-second victory. Kagayama \ntook second with Toseland third and  Muggeridge \nfourth, not  far ahead of the  charging Corser. The  start \nof Race 2 witnessed one  of the  most dramatic first-lap \npile-ups in Superbike history. Pitt  and Muggeridge got \ntangled up as  they left the  start line, causing widespread \ncarnage. Wild card Julien Da  Costa hit Bussei, who was \nalready on  the  deck, with Martin another unwilling \nfaller. Bussei suffered concussion and  hurt his  neck and \nshoulder, Martin damaged his  kidney, with Muggeridge \nneeding stitches in his head after his footpeg gouged its \nway into  and under his  helmet. Pitt  skinned his  hands \nbut, like  Da  Costa, made it back for the  restart. No such \ndrama at the  second time of asking as  Vermeulen and \nLanzi battled for the  win, but then Chris's rear  sprocket \nbroke, leaving the  young Italian to take an  unchallenged \nvictory. Good friends off the  track, but  fierce opponents \non  it, Kagayama and  Haga fought tooth and  nail  for \nsecond, with the  Suzuki rider taking the  honours \nater the  Yamaha's tyres faded. It had  been a  long, \nhard season, but  one  of the  elder statesmen of World \nSuperbike had  proved that, with the  right bike and  the \nright team, anything Is possible. \n‘During my years with Petronas, | never doubted my \nability to win  another title,’ said Corser, ‘| knew that all | \nneeded was the  right bike and  the  right team. For years \nI've  seen the  Alstare set-up in the  paddock and  always \nwanted to  ride  for  Francis Batta, so  when | got the  call, \n| didn't hesitate for a second. We  put in a lot of hard \nwork before the  season began, did a lot of testing and  it \npaid off  big time.’ \nCHAPTER \n18 \nLeft: Troy Corser leads the \ncharge of the  heavy brigade \nat the  Eurospeedway \nLausitz. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 195 \n\nFar  right: Frankie \nChili —  always \nhappy to  help with \na  photo-shoot. \n2005 \n=/ASON RESULTS \nRound 1 -  Qatar \nLosail, 26 February \nRace 1 \nTroy Corser, Aus, Suzuki \nYukio Kagayama, Jap, Suzuki \nRegis Laconi, Fra, Ducati \nAndrew Pitt, Aus, Yamaha \nNoriyuki Haga, Jap, Yamaha \nJames Toseland, GB,  Ducati \nIvan Silva, Spa, Yamaha \nChris Vermeulen, Aus, Honda \nKarl Muggeridge, Aus, Honda \n10  Norick Abe, Jap, Yamaha \n11.

The veteran Aussie proved that his  time \naway from World Superbike had  honed rather than \ndiminished his skills, and his  hunger to win  was as  strong \nas  ever. He  led  the  championship from the  first round \nand, despite a few  crashes along the  way, failed to  finish \njust twice all season. Only runner-up James Toseland on \nthe  Ten  Kate Honda was more consistent but  his  three \nvictories throughout the  year were dwarfed by Bayliss’s \ntwelve wins, and Troy suitably wrapped up  the  title with \none round to  go  at  Ducati’s home track, Imola. He  then \ncrowned a  superb season by winning the  last  MotoGP \nrace of the  year at Valencia to  show that Superbikers \ncan  win  in MotoGPs. It had  been five  years since his first \nWorld Superbike title, but  once the  season got  into its \nStride his  rivals knew that Bayliss would be  hard, if not \nimpossible, to  stop. \nAfter the  fire  sale  that saw both Toseland and Regis \nLaconi thrown out  of the  official Ducati team at  the \nend of 2005, Bayliss was seen as  the  man to  reinstate \nthe  Italian manufacturer's position at  the  top  of the \nSuperbike pile and he  didn’t disappoint. Not  even a \nhorrible wrist injury while doing a  spot of winter off- \nroading prevented the  Australian from starting the  new \nyear in  aggressive mode right from the  first tests \nIf the  injury caused any  discomfort or  pain it was \nnever acknowledged, and at  the  end of a  gruelling day’s \ntesting he would just  say, ‘| guess it gets a  bit  sore when \nI'm  done riding, but  it’s  no  problem really.’ \nBayliss’s team-mate in  the  Xerox Ducati squad \nwas the  young Italian hope Lorenzo Lanzi, having his \nfirst full  year as  a  factory rider, but  a  family tragedy \ngot  his season off  to  a  slow start and  although he \nmustered two podiums at  Valencia, he  never looked like \nthreatening the  rostrum again \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 199 \n\n200 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nPrevious spread: Ever the Right: The  shirt said it all, \npatriot Troy Bayliss returned ___ Troy Bayliss took the  title at \nto  his  spiritual home, as  if Imola. \nhe'd never been away. \nLeft: The first chicane at \nMonza always catches out \nthe  unwary.

The  main differences between the \n2006 FO6  Ducatis and  the  previous year’s models were \nthe  electronics and  suspension. Bayliss and Lanzi had  the \nbenefit of the  superbly working Magneti Marelli traction \ncontrol system with Ohlins TTX20 upside-down forks \nand  TTX36 rear  shocks. Their traction control was  far \nbetter than any  rival  offerings and  allowed Bayliss and \nLanzi to  get away with things the  rest  could only dream \nabout. \nDucati’s B teams consisted of Team Berik Sterilgarda, \nwith the  experienced Ruben Xaus partnered by Marco \nBorciani, and  Ducati SC  Caracchi with affable ex-GP \nrider Robby Rolfo on  board. It’s  hard to  know in which \ncategory to  put Pedercini’s Ducatis, as  they were running \n999RS machines which many considered well past their \nsell-by date. They started the  season with a three-rider \nline-up of Lucio Pedercini, lvan Clementi and  young \nGerman hopeful Max Neukirchner, but  after yet another \ncrash due  to technical problems on  the  outdated bikes \nMax decided that he’d had  enough, limping away before \ndoing any  serious damage to  himself. \nWhen Ducati got rid  of Toseland, their 2004 World \nChampion, James found himself in an  awkward position. \nHe was entertaining all and  sundry at the  piano in a  hotel \nbar  in Imola after the  last  race  of 2005 but  had  no  ride \nlined up for 2006, so  when Ten Kate Honda threw him \na  lifeline he grabbed it eagerly. The  previous incumbent, \nChris Vermeulen, had  departed to the  perceived holy \ngrail of MotoGP and  the  Dutch outfit were looking for \na title  contender to  partner Aussie Karl  Muggeridge. \nToseland, and  all the  Honda riders, struggled with a \ntraction control system far inferior to those of Ducati, \nSuzuki and  Yamaha (as witnessed by James's regular \ntyre-smoking antics) and it is greatly to  his credit that he \nwas able to finish the  season in second spot. \nPierfrancesco Chili was riding for  DFX Treme Honda \nin what would be his swan-song season, together \nwith his young pupil, Michel Fabrizio. There was also \nanother Honda team of note —  Klaffi Honda —  and  the \nGerman outfit had  signed MotoGP star  Alex Barros. \nThe  Brazilian was obviously a class act,  but  his generally \npoor performances in qualifying usually left  him  with too \nmuch work to  do come race day. \nAlstare Suzuki retained 2005 champ Troy Corser \nand  Yukio Kagayama. They had  come out  of the \nStarting blocks the  previous year firing on  all cylinders, \nbut  the  2006 season would turn out  to  be one of \ndisappointment, especially for  Corser, who only \n\nm 9007 \n5 \n\\ G \n4d \n& \n, \na \n1049 Diy qiodng PH: \n<4 \n‘ \nrei awn , he \n- \n“ \nYnbE ® \"? \nf + \nAg hm wt \neo “ \na ~~ e \nPg a \nfad \né \ns \n\nAbove: Corser leads Pitt, \nToseland and  Haga at \nMisano. \nAbove right: Silverstone — \nToseland’s Honda bears the \nmarks of an  earlier crash. \nBelow right: Alex Barros \ntook his  only World \nSuperbike win  at  Imola, \nseen here leading outgoing \nchamp Troy Corser. \nmanaged \ntwo \nvictories \nto  \nhis \nteam-mate’s \nthree. \nAlstare \nalso  \nentered \na  \nhome-brewed \nbike  \nwith \nFrenchman \nFabien \nForet, \nbut \nhe \nwas \nreplaced \nmid-season \nby \nMax \nNeukirchner. \nBoth \nwere \nblighted \nby \nDNFs \non  \nthe \ndistinctly \nnon-factory-supported \nmachine \nand  \nthe \nhighlight \nof \nthe  \nyear \nwas \na  \nsixth \nplace \nby \nthe  \nGerman \nat \nAssen. \nYamaha Motor Italia, now wearing the  startling \nred \nlivery \nof \nSantander \nConsumer \nBank, \nfielded \ncrowd \nfavourite Noriyuki Haga and  Aussie Andrew Pitt.

Kagayama was ahead, and looking \nto  repeat his 2005 success, when his good friend \nHaga took him  out. Nori had  tried to  make a virtually \nimpossible \npass \nand \nlost \nthe \nfront \nend, \nhis \nYamaha \nthen \nsmashing into Kagayama’s Suzuki. Both were down and \nout, leaving the  pursuing foursome to  chase podium \nglory. \nKagayama \nwas \ndisappointed \nand \nangry, \nHaga \njust \nplain embarrassed, but  fortunately neither was injured, \nalthough it did  cost Nori an  expensive dinner as  a way of \nsaying sorry. Fifth was new boy Fabrizio, with sixth and \nseventh places filled by ex-GP riders Barros and  Rolfo. \nThe second race took place in hotter conditions \nand  was a straight fight between Aussies Corser and \nBayliss. The  Suzuki man took the  win  by just over a \nsecond after Bayliss ran  wide on  the  last  lap, trying to \novertake his countryman. Third place went right down \n\nto  the  last  digit on  the  timekeeper’s watch, with Haga \ntaking it by only one thousandth of a  second ahead of \nToseland at  the  line. James thought he  had  snatched it, \nand was even making his way to  the  podium ceremony \nwhen officials broke the  bad news. Pitt  was fifth and \nLanzi sixth, but  the  winner for the  time being was the \nchampionship, with the  top  four in  both races filled by \nfour different manufacturers. \nAs expected, Aussie riders ruled the  roost at  Phillip \nIsland, with the  two Troys taking a win apiece. Bayliss \nhad  been in scorching form from the  start of practice \nand led  the  opening race by a country mile, but  then his \ntoo  soft  tyre  started going off at  half-distance, allowing \nthe  rest  to catch up.  Corser took the  lead, with six  laps \nto  go,  and  then the  win, less  than half  a  second off \nBarros, with Toseland third. Haga was fourth, with Rolfo \nfifth and a slipping and  sliding Bayliss sixth. In  Race 2 \nBayliss fitted a  harder tyre and patiently waited until \nthe  pace up  front slowed. He  chose his  moment well, \ncharged into  the  lead and  stormed to  a comfortable \nvictory ahead of Toseland and  Barros. Alex had  been \npart of a  drama early in  the  race when he  had  hit the \nfallen Corser on  the  exit  of MG  corner. The  big screens \nshowed Corser on  the  floor and  then Barros’s Honda \nrunning over the  Australian's neck and  head. It looked \nhorrible in the  slow-motion replays, but  somehow Troy \nscrambled to  the  safety of the  trackside before realising \nthe  force of the  impact. The  footage was  so  dramatic \nit even made national TV  news and  featured in all the \npress coverage of the  event. \nAfter the  two-week flyaway the  teams regrouped \nin Valencia, with 2005 champion Corser in  tremendous \nform in qualifying and  Superpole. Pre-season testing \nat  the  tight and  twisty track had  been dominated by \nBayliss, so  Corser’s form was something of a  surprise, \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 203 \n\nAbove: Noriyuki Haga \nattacks the  Parabolica at \nMonza. \n» @ \nSe. \n<5 \ny) \na \nwe \nes \n=i \nnt \n~s: \nez \nYE \nbut  \nit \nwouldn't \nlast. \nBayliss \nwas \ncontent \nto  \nshadow \nCorser \nuntil \nthe \nclosing \nstages \nof \nboth \n23-lappers, \ntaking \nthe  \nlead \nin \nRace \n1 \non  \nlap \n20,  \nand  \nwaiting \nuntil \njust \ntwo \nlaps \nfrom \nthe \nend \nin \nthe \nsecond \nrace. \nOnce \nBayliss \nwas \nin \nthe \nlead \nCorser \ndidn’t \nstand \na \nchance, \nwith \nthe \nDucati \nseemingly \nable \nto \nchurn \nout \nconsistently \nfast  \nlaps \nas  \nrequired. \nTime \nafter \ntime, \nBayliss \nand  \nCorser \nexited \nthe \nleft-hander \non \nto \nthe \nback \nstraight \nin \nline, \nbut \nthe  \ndifference \nwas \nthat \nthe  \nDucati \nrider \nwas \nable \nto \ncrack \nthe \nthrottle \nwide \nopen, \nsafe \nin \nthe \nknowledge \nthat \nhis \ntraction \ncontrol \nsystem \nwould \ndo \nits \njob, \nwhereas \nTroy \nand \nthe \nSuzuki \nhad \nto \nwait. \nAfterwards \nCorser \nremarked, \n‘If \n| \ntried \nto \nget \non \nthe \ngas \nexiting \nthe \nturns \nlike \nhim, \nI’d \neither \nbe \nin \nthe \ngravel \ntrap \nor \nhospital!’ \nThird \nplace \nin \nboth \nraces \nwent \nto \nBayliss’s \nteam-mate \nLanzi, \nwith \nYamaha \nriders \nAbe \nand \nHaga \ntwice \ntaking \nfourth \nand \nfifth. \nlf there is any  track suited to the  high-revving \nfours \n— \nand \nwhere \nCorser \nand \nthe \nrest \nmight \nhave \nput \none  over the  Ducatis —  it is Monza, where speed and \nslipstreaming are  the  name of the  game.

That something was \ndone, though it was Bayliss who did  it, winning both \nraces comfortably much to the  delight of the  red-flag \nwaving Ducatisti in the  grandstands, who also  witnessed \na first-lap incident in Race 1 that saw seven fallers at \nthe  infamous first  chicane. The  highlight of that first \nrace (for  non-Ducati fans) was a stirring fight for second \nbetween Barros, Corser and Haga and  won by the \n204 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nBrazilian, \nwith \nTroy \nthird \nand  \nNori \nfourth: \nthere \nwas \nless \nthan \n0.4s \nbetween \nthem \nat \nthe \nfinish \nline. \nRace \n2 \nwas \nmore \nstrung \nout, \nwith \nBayliss \nominously \ntaking \nhis \nsecond \ndouble \nof \nthe  \nseason \nahead \nof \nCorser \nand \nHaga. \nIt \nwas \nthe \nJapanese \nrider's \nfirst \npodium \nsince \nthe  \nopening \nround \nin \nQatar \nand  \nproof \nthat \nthe  \nfast, \nsweeping \ncircuits \ncould \nstill  \nbe  \nrelatively \ngood \ntracks \nfor \nthose, \nlike \nHaga, \nwithout \ntraction \ncontrol. \nWhen \nthe  \nteams \narrived \nat \nSilverstone \nBarros \nwas \nless \nthan \namused \nto \ndiscover \nthey \nwere \nto \nrace \non \nthe \nshort \ncircuit \ninstead \nof \nthe \nfull \ninternational \nlayout. \nHe \nhad \nbeen \nparticularly \nlooking \nforward \nto \nthe \nBritish \ntrack, \nas \nhe \nhad \nridden \nthere \nbefore, \nbut \nnow \nit \nwould \nbe \njust \nanother \nnew \ncircuit \nto  \nlearn. \nThe  \nslow \nfinal \nchicane \ndid \nbunch \nup \nthe  \nriders \nlap \nafter \nlap,  \nhowever, \nand \ngave \nthe \ncrowd \na \npair \nof \nentertaining \nraces. \nThere \nwas \na \nsurprise \nbefore \nrace \nday, \ntoo, \nwhen \nwild \ncard \nTommy \nHill \ntook \na \nwet \nSuperpole. \nHill \nwas \nracing \nin \nthe \ndomestic \nchampionship \nfor \nVirgin \nMobile \nYamaha \non \nPirellis \nand \nit \nwas \ngood \nto  \nsee  \na \nstrong \nwild-card \nrider, \nsomething \nthe \nchampionship \nhad  \nlost  \nwhen \nthe  \nmonomarque \ntyre \nrule \ncame \ninto  \nbeing. \nAfter \nthe  \nwet  \nconditions \non  \nSaturday, \nthough, \nit \nwas \nalmost \ninevitable \nthat \nthe  \ntwo \nraces \nwould \ntake \nplace \nin \nthe \ndry \non \nSunday, \npaving \nthe \nway \nfor \nBayliss \nonce \nagain \nto \nassert \nhis \nauthority \nand \ntake \nhis \nthird \ndouble \nin \na \nrow. \nBoth \npodiums \nwere \nsymmetrical, \nwith \nHaga \nsecond \nand \nToseland \nthird, \nthough \nTroy \ndid \nhave \nto \nwork \nmuch \nharder \nfor \nthe \nchampagne \nin \nRace \n1. \nAt \nthe \npost-race \npress \nconference \nBayliss \nwas \nasked \nif \nhis \ntraction \ncontrol \nsystem \nwas \ngiving \nhim \nan \nadvantage. \nHis \nreply \nwas \nsuccinct: \n‘Somebody \nstill \nhas \nto \nride \nand \n\ncontrol the  thing!’ His  nearest title challenger, Corser, \nhad  a  day to  forget, crashing out  of the  first race and \nfinishing a  lowly sixth in  the  second. \nToseland was on  pole at  Misano, his  first since 2003, \nand he and  the  other main contenders desperately \nneeded to  peg  back Bayliss’s run  of success. Troy, \nhowever, defied his seventh place on  the  grid to  notch \nup  his eighth win  on  the  trot, a  massive seven seconds \nahead of the  rest  of the  field. Toseland was second, with \nKagayama third, his  best result to  date. Another rider \nto  score well was Pitt  in Race 2, the  Aussie taking his \nmaiden World Superbike victory with Barros second and \nteam-mate Haga third. Bayliss had  crashed on  lap  17  but \nshowed his  ‘never say  die’  spirit by remounting to  finish \n12th. He wasn’t to  know that it wouldn’t matter by the \nback end  of the  season; it was just typical Bayliss. It was \nanother day of disappointment for  Corser, with a fall  in \nRace 1 (when his  bike jumped out  of gear) and  another \ncrash while leading Race 2 after trying to  avoid cement \ndust. Nil  points meant a  drop to fourth in the  standings \nand  the  disappearance of any  hope of retaining his title. \nHaga’s Superpole at  Brno was only his third in  170 \nStarts and  should have put  him  in good stead for  a \nvictory or  two at the  Czech circuit, but  instead it was \nanother Japanese rider who stole the  glory with a  pair \nof faultless wins. Kagayama’s podium at the  previous \nround had  been just the  confidence boost he needed \nand  that, together with a  productive test  at  Brno one \nmonth earlier, allowed him to  take two comfortable \nvictories. Toseland had  to  settle for second in Race 1, \nafter leading the  charge early on,  with Fabrizio third. \nKagayama’s screaming start in the  second race left  the \nrest  trailing and  the  main battle for the  minor podium \nplaces was between Haga, Corser and  Fabrizio. Michel \nhad  only qualified 12th, but  there was something about \nBrno that suited the  young Roman and  an  even better \nresult was in store. He  went into  the  final chicane in \nfourth place, then pulled out  an  audacious move, block \npassed Corser, pushed Haga wide and  emerged ahead \nof his two vastly more experienced rivals. At the  flag \nthe  trio  were separated by less  than 0.083s, with Haga \ntaking third. The  Japanese rider and  the  Aussie were \nunited, though, in  their comments about the  Italian’s \nantics: ‘What he did  was plain crazy. He  could've taken \nall three of us  out  there!’ Troy Corser had  missed the \nBrno test  after his son  had  kindly given him  chicken pox, \nbut  his fifth and  fourth showed that he was getting \nback to form. \nAnother favourite circuit for fans, if not  always for \nriders, loomed large next. Brands Hatch’s natural setting, \nwith the  crowds close to  the  action, witnessed Bayliss \nand Lanzi wearing Superman-style leathers on  race day. \nThe rest of the  field could have used some Kryptonite \nin the  first race as  the  Aussie got  back to winning ways, \ngiving Ducati its  250th victory in  World Superbike. \nSecond went to  local favourite Toseland, with Haga third \nand Pitt  fourth. Race 2 saw Haga’s well-overdue first \nwin  of the  year and his  entry into  the  record books as \nBrands Hatch’s most successful racer in  the  21st century, \nwith four wins from six  starts.

\nlift \nthe \nchampionship \ntrophy \nhere \nin \nGermany, \nbut \nhis \nfirst-race \ncrash \nmeant \n\nthe  celebrations would have to  stay on  hold for at  least \nanother round. \nIf a  Ducati rider is going to win  a  championship then \nthere is  no  better place than at  their home track, Imola. \nBayliss didn’t need to win  or  do anything spectacular \nto  take the  title, and  his cruise round the  4.959-km \ncircuit to  fifth place in  Race 1 was all that was required \nto  send the  Ducati fans into  a frenzy of flag-waving \nand  celebration. Barros was in  eighth at  the  end  of \nthe  first lap of Race 1 and  then had  to  keep clear of \ncrashes before starting his charge. This was to  be the \nBrazillan’s day. He  rode with all the  poise and experience \nof his GP  days to  take his  first-ever World Superbike \nvictory and become the  eighth different winner of the \nseason. Second was Toseland, with Pitt  and  Haga third \nand  fourth. By the  time Bayliss returned to  the  pit lane \nafter his cool-down lap he was already wearing a  2007 \nWorld Champion T-shirt, but  if anybody thought he'd \nbe  resting on  his  laurels in  the  second race they were to \nbe  disappointed. With all the  pressure off,  he stormed \nto  his eleventh win of the  season, with Barros a  superb \nsecond and Kagayama third. Pitt  took fourth ahead of \nToseland, with Haga an  indifferent sixth. And what of \nthe  outgoing champion? Another depressing afternoon \nfor  Corser saw him retire in  Race 1 —  he  said his  gearbox \nwas finding false neutrals —  and struggle to  seventh in \nthe  second race as  a  result of a  spinning rear  tyre. He \nAbove left: A life-size cut- \nout  of Toseland brought \nby one of his  many loyal \nfollowers. \nwas now a lowly sixth in  the  championship standings \n—  hard to  believe after his success the  year before. \nAlthough the  title  was decided, the  Magny-Cours \ncrowd were treated to two of the  finest races of the \nyear after qualifying sessions blighted by bad  weather, \ndelays, crashes and  oil spills. Corser responded to \nthe  unwelcome news that he was to  be  replaced in \nthe  Alstare team for  2007 by GP  refugee Max Biaggi \nby taking the  38th Superpole of his  career and then \nfighting hard for a  third in  the  first race and  second in \nRace 2, showing his  new employers Yamaha that he  still \nhad  the  desire and  belief to  compete at  the  highest level. \nToseland had been fast  throughout practice and \nqualifying and  determinedly kept Haga at  bay  in  Race \n1, although his  margin of victory was just  0.115s, with \nCorser only 0.4s behind. Bayliss had been a contender \nthroughout the  23-lapper, but  faded at  the  end. In  the \nsecond race he showed just  why he was the  champion \nDespite being battered by Corser, Toseland and Haga \nhe  fought his  way to  victory, setting a  new lap record \nin  the  process. He  took the  final flag of the  season \n1.282 seconds ahead of Corser, with Toseland third \n—  enough for  the  Briton to  secure runner-up spot in \nthe  championship —  and Haga fourth. The  top  four \nhad  traded paint several times throughout the  race, a \nfitting end  to  a  championship which saw a different Troy \n(Bayliss this  time) take the  title, and deservedly so \nAbove right: Supermen \nfor  the  weekend —  Lorenzo \nLanzi and  Troy Bayliss at \nBrands Hatch. \nLeft: Toseland and Corser \nget down to  business. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 207 \n\n\"O06 \nASON RESULTS \nRound 1 -  Qatar \nLosail, 25  February \nRace 1 \n1 ames Toseland, GB, Honda \neZ Troy Bayliss, Aus, Ducati \n3 Andrew Pitt, Aus, Yamaha \n4 Troy Corser, Aus, Suzuki \n5 ichel Fabrizio, Ita,  Honda \n6 Alex Barros, Bra, Honda \niv Roberto Rolfo, Ita,  Ducati \n8  Pierfrancesco Chili, Ita,  Honda \n9 arco Borciani, Ita,  Ducati \n10 ax  Neukirchner, Ger, Ducati \n11 orick Abe, Jap, Yamaha \n12 Karl Muggeridge, Aus, Honda \n13.

The  racing was consistently of the  highest \norder and the  result in  doubt until the  very last  race, \nwith any  one of three riders in  contention for  the  title \nBut, in  the  end, Briton James Toseland once again \novercame all obstacles to  take the  title  in  a  nail-biting \nfinale at  Magny-Cours —  the  scene of his  previous title \nvictory in  2004 \nDuring 2007 some questioned what they saw as \nan  ‘over-aggressive’ riding style, but  James ignored all \nhis  critics and had  the  strength to  recover from a blip \nin  fortunes, after a  stunning double at  Brands Hatch, \nand return focused on  the  job in  hand. In  so  doing he \nbecame only the  second rider in  World Superbike history \nto win the  title with two different manufacturers, the \nother being Troy Corser in  1996 and 2005 \nEven before the  season began the  series had  received \na  massive boost in  profile with the  arrival of four-times \n250cc GP  champion and former MotoGP star Max \nBiaggi. For  FGSport, the  Rome-based organisers of the \nchampionship, Biaggi’s arrival was regarded as  a  huge \ncoup as  not  only had the  series acquired one of road \nracing's biggest stars, but  it also meant they could stage \na  race at  Vallelunga circuit, close to  their headquarters \nRome Is  also Biaggi’s home town. Max's presence \nwould mean a  considerable increase in  media coverage \n—  especially in  Italy —  and maybe, just maybe, the  first- \never Italian World Superbike Champion \nThe ‘Roman Emperor’, as  he  is  known to  his \nlegions of  fans, arrived on  the  scene with his  own \nentourage —  something not  hitherto seen in  World \nSuperbikes —  and a  perhaps over-fastidious MotoGP \napproach. It was something Alstare Suzuki tried to \naccommodate from the very first test session, but \nit would be  Biaggi’s demeanour that would prove a \nsterner test of  his  team’s warm and friendly atmosphere \nthroughout the  year. Biaggi had replaced 2005 \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 211 \n\n\n\nchampion Troy Corser, a  change that didn’t go down \nwell \nin \nmany \nquarters, \nand \nwas \npartnered \nby \nJapanese \nrider Yukio Kagayama who was destined to  have a \nseason of more downs than ups. \nThe  GSX-R1000 K7s  were updated versions of \nlast year’s bikes, but  were in the  process of changing \ntheir electronics package from Mitsubishi to the  more \ndevelopable Magneti Marelli. Max Neukirchner also \nrode a  Suzuki GSX-R1000, but  his  bike was way down \nthe \nfood \nchain \ncompared \nto \nAlstare’s \nfactory-supported \nmissiles. The  young German's persistence was rewarded, \nhowever, \nby \na \nride \non \nthe \nAlstare \nbike \nin \nthe \nlast \nround \nwhere he  replaced the  injured Kagayama. He  took to  it \nlike \na \nduck \nto \nwater \nand \nwould \nhave \nhad \na \npodium \nin \n- \nRace 1 were it not  for getting punted off the  track by \noutgoing champion Bayliss. \nDucati Xerox team kept the  same riders —  Troy Bayliss \nand Lorenzo Lanzi —  with updated 2007 bikes in what \nwould be their last  year of competition before changing \nto  1200cc twins in 2008. Spaniard Ruben Xaus stayed \nwith Sterilgarda Ducati, with Giovanni Bussei and Marco \nBorciani as  occasional team-mates. \nTen Kate Honda retained 2006 runner-up James \nToseland on  a CBR 1000RR that had  an  electronics \npackage (and traction control system) that was now \nvery comparable to  that of Ducati. Joining him  from the \nDucati SC  Caracchi team was Roby Rolfo. The  likeable \nItalian was fairly consistent throughout the  season and \nwas even on  course for a  podium at  Monza, but  a  ‘fuel \nsupply problem’ prevented him  from what would've \nbeen his  best result of the  year. Roby replaced Kar! \nMuggeridge, who went to Alto Evolution Honda to \npartner fellow-countryman Josh Brookes. But  the  team \nran  into  technical problems during the  season, missed \nthe  Misano round and  then reappeared at  Brno with \na  new paint scheme, though minus Brookes who had \ngone off to  World Supersport. The other Honda team \nof note was DFX Corse, managed by Frankie Chili, \nwho started the  season with Michel Fabrizio and  Steve \nMartin. Martin left  the  team after the  sixth round in \nMonza, had  a one-off ride  with Yamaha France at \nBrands Hatch and ended the  season with Celani Suzuki: \nno  other rider in the  series has  competed on  three \ndifferent bikes in  the  same season before! \nYamaha Motor Italia kept Haga and  brought in 2005 \nchamp Corser to  help develop the  new R1’s  potential, \nseen as  a smart move by many as  Nori has  never been \nnoted for  his  bike development skills. Yamaha France \nentered a  one-rider team, with Shinichi Nakatomi \nkeeping his  ride  from the  year before. \nKawasaki PSG-1 Corse ditched 2006 race winner \nPrevious spread: James \nToseland gave the  home \nfans something to  cheer \nabout at  Donington. \nAbove: Troy Bayliss won \nRace 1 at  Phillip Island, fans \nand penguins were happy. \nLeft: James Toseland left \nMagny-Cours and  World \nSuperbikes as  champion. \nBelow: Biaggi won his \ndebut race in  Qatar, finished \nsecond in the  other and left \nas  joint series leader with \nToseland. \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 213 \n\nChris \nWalker \nand \nwent \nto  \na \ntwo-rider \nline-up \nwith \nFonsi \nNieto \nand \nRegis \nLaconi, \nbut \nthe \nbike \nsuffered \nfrom \na \nlack \nof \nfactory \nsupport \nand \nthe \nteam’s \nbest \nresult \nwas \na \nstorming \nthird \nplace \nby \nNieto \nin \nthe \nlast \nrace \nof \nthe \nyear. \nAs  usual the  series kicked off  in  Qatar and  the \nspacious press room was unusually full, thanks to \nscores of Italian media who had  come to  see  if Biaggi \ncould adapt to  World Superbikes —  and  they must have \nthought their plane tickets were good value when he \nwon the  opening race. It’s  true that Max had  raced \nthere in MotoGP, but  his  rookie win  was greeted with \nhuge delight by them, and  the  Italian series organisers. \nToseland took second, with Lanzi a somewhat suprising \nthird, but  James got the  better of Biaggi in  Race 2, \nwith Corser third, ahead of team-mate Haga. Reigning \nchampion Troy Bayliss struggled with tyre problems \nand  finished fifth and  eighth. At the  press conference \nafterwards Biaggi said, ‘| wish | had  discovered this \nchampionship years ago. These guys are  way more \nexperienced in this  class than me  and  they are  tough \nold  dogs, who want to  bite! | think Superbike is \nmore challenging because you  don’t have the  best of \neverything —  bikes, tyres etc.  You  just have to  adapt to \nwhat you've got.’ He  left  as  joint championship leader \nwith Toseland and  headed to  another circuit he  knew \nwell —  Phillip Island. \nIt’s  not  hard to see  why riders and  fans love Phillip \nIsland. Its  high-speed corners give an  adrenaline rush \nvirtually unmatched at any  other track and  once again the \nracing lived up to  its reputation. Both 22-lappers featured \nsuperb battles between local hero and  champion Bayliss \nand  title  contender Toseland. Such was  the  intensity of \ntheir fight they sometimes traded paint, but  neither had \nany  complaints afterwards. Bayliss delighted the  home \nfans by taking victory in the  first  race, with Toseland \nREE h \ncf) te2KE WD \n.  ooh ee ee \n214 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \n\ntwo seconds down at the  flag. Biaggi was third after \na tremendous late  charge saw him  overtake Yamaha \nteamsters Haga and Corser. Toseland got  his  revenge \nover Bayliss in the  second race by  the tiny  margin of \n0.274s, with Haga muscling past Biaggi on  the  last  lap \nto  claim the  final podium place. After a heavy tumble in \npractice Kagayama was a  non-starter —  something that \nwould happen on  several occasions in  2007 \nDonington was the  scene of Round 3, the  first time \nsince 2001 that the  Midlands circuit was hosting a  World \nSuperbike event. It had been the  venue for  the  first-ever \nWorld Superbike race, back in  1988, and to  celebrate \nthe  20th year of the  championship some former stars \nwere invited along, including first  champion Fred Merkel, \nRob Phillis, Aaron Slight, Fabrizio Pirovano, Terry Rymer, \nNeil Hodgson, Frankie Chili, Peter Goddard, Piergiorgio \nBontempi, Jamie Whitham and John Reynolds. All  were \nproud they could still  get  into their original leathers to \ntake part in  a  parade lap  round the  4.023-km circuit, \nbut  one (no  names, but  take a  bow, Aaron) came back \ncovered in  embarrassment because he  had fallen off  the \nbike loaned to  him for  the  lap! \nThe  weather was bright and sunny but  the \ntemperatures hardly climbed above zero and the  day \nproved to  be  a  painful one for  Bayliss. He  had recently \ncelebrated his  38th birthday, had  dominated qualifying \nand Superpole, and was favourite to  take two podiums \nand get  his  season back on  track, but  he  crashed while \nleading Race 1.  He  was rushed to  hospital for  surgery \non  a  severely damaged finger and suffered horrendous \nbruising to  his  groin area. Being the  gritty Aussie tha \nhe  Is,  Troy wanted to  come back for  the  second race, \nbut  the  doctors advised against it because of a risk \nof  infection —  to  his  finger, that is.  Toseland took an \nemphatic win in  Race 1, with Corser runner-up anc \nBiaggi third, just ahead of  Haga who'd charged through \nthe  field after a  poor start. James was all  set  for  a \ndouble until an  electrical problem stopped his  progress \nafter just  three laps, leaving the  Yamaha duo  of  Haga \nand Corser to  fight it out  with Suzuki's Biaggi. Max was \nleading on  the last  lap  but  then made an  error exiting \nthe  final corner, which was all  Haga needed to  slip \nthough and take the  chequered flag \nValencia saw an  unexpected but highly welcome \nresult in  Race 1 when Spaniard Ruben Xaus took the \nvictory on  his  Ducati 999 FO6. After overtaking Bayliss \nand Haga he  took control of  the  race to  make it  a \n+ \ncomfortable win in  front of  his  home fans.

But \nhe got carried away with the  noise of the fireworks \nand  allowed the  bike to stall, and  four or  five  other \ncornerworkers were also unable to  restart it. Faced \nwith being late  for  his own podium ceremony Ruben \ncommandeered a  nearby photographer on  a scooter to \ngive him  and  his  Ducati a tow back to the  pits. The  scene \nwas shown on  live TV,  much to the  amusement of all \nand  sundry, but very much in keeping with the  relaxed \natmosphere of World Superbike. There were no  such \n‘oddities’ in Race 2. Xaus was again in contention for \nthe  first 11  laps or  so,  but  was then passed by Toseland, \nHaga and Biaggi and  gradually lost  touch with the trio \nas  the  race wore on.  James took the victory from Max, \nwho'd squeezed past the  Japanese rider just three \ncorners from the  end; Bayliss finished sixth, the  2006 \nchamp now 61  points adrift of series leader Toseland. \nThe  Assen round normally takes place in September, \nbut  this  year the  event was switched to April. Well- \nprepared Assen fans always turn up for  races with \nwaterproofs —  they certainly came in handy in 2006 \n—  but  the  weather gods were in a good mood for \nRound 5 and  the  rainwear stayed packed away on  race \nday. Toseland won the  first race by a  hair  from Haga, \nwith Xaus third. The  second race then witnessed one \nof the  greatest battles in World Superbike history, with \nToseland and  Bayliss wheel to wheel for almost the \nentire distance. It came down to the  final turn, Bayliss \ngetting through an  impossible gap  and  taking the  win \nby just 0.009s. Biaggi was a  long way back in third but \nstill  second in the  championship, as  he  had  been since \nthe  second round. \nA huge number of fans came to  Monza, the  first of \nthe  three scheduled Italian rounds, and many of them \npacked the  paddock to  try and get an  autograph or \nphoto with their hero, Max Biaggi. His  team had  to  hire \nthree beefy security guards to  ensure his safe passage \nfrom pits to  hospitality or  motorhome. The  crowd \n216 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nX y 2 \nfigures quoted by the  organisers suggested over 75,000 \nwere there on  race day alone, and  it sometimes seemed \nas  if most of them were in the  paddock. Those that did \nfill the  grandstands, though, didn’t get the  result they \nwanted, a win  from either Biaggi or  Ducati. Instead the \nday belonged to  Haga, who took both wins in comfort \nand in style. The  first was like  a stroll in the  Monza \nwoods, as  he took victory by well over eight seconds \nfrom Bayliss, with Biaggi third and  Toseland fourth. The \nsecond was more of a  brisk hike, though the  margin \nof victory was still  quite substantial —  2.691 seconds. \nToseland, Bayliss, Rolfo and  Biaggi were all  in contention \nfor the  runner-up spot until the  final lap when Troy and \nMax clashed with each other at the  exit  of Ascari. Biaggi \nhad  run  wide and  collided with Bayliss when he  rejoined \nthe  track, the  impact bending the  Suzuki's clutch lever \nout  of position so  the  clutch didn’t work when he tried \nto  slow down for the  Parabolica. Biaggi was forced to \nstamp on  the  rear brake to  try and reduce his speed \nand in doing that ran  onto the  kerbstones and nearly \ncrashed. By then Toseland, Rolfo and  Bayliss were gone. \nRolfo was ready to  take his first podium of the  year, but \nwith the  line  almost in sight his  Honda ran  out  of fuel, \nleaving Bayliss to  inherit third. \nEarly on  race day Silverstone was hit  by heavy rain, \nthen by an  absolute deluge and  Race 1 took place in \nsoaking wet conditions that had  most of the  21  two- \nwheeled gladiators slipping, sliding and  crashing. In the \nend  only 13  got to the  finish line, and  one  of those, \nToseland had  crashed, remounted and  was rewarded for \nhis efforts by an  eighth place and  eight valuable points. \nHe  certainly wasn’t to  know at the  time quite how \nvaluable they would prove to  be!  Reigning champion \nBayliss kept his  head and  somehow brought his  FO7 \nDucati home in  one piece to take the  chequered flag, \ntwo seconds ahead of Haga, with Corser filling the  final \npodium spot. There was then a  massive gap  of over \n45  seconds before Rolfo in  fourth ahead of Laconi and \nBiaggi. Before the  scheduled start of the  second race a \ntrack inspection was made by officials and  a few  of the \n\ntop  riders, but  when the  cars started aquaplaning on  the \nrain-sodden surface it was decided to  delay proceedings \nin  the  hope that conditions would improve. They never \ndid,  and  the  race was cancelled, much to  the  disgust of \nthe  considerable crowd who had  endured the  elements \nthroughout the  day. \nAfter the  miserable conditions at  Silverstone it was \na  relief and pleasure to  be  beside the  Adriatic seaside \nfor  Misano, but  since World Superbikes raced there last \nseason the  race track had been drastically altered and. \nWas now running in completely the  opposite direction. \nOstensibly this  was done on  safety grounds, instigated \nbecause of the  circuit’s wish to  have a MotoGP race \nthere, but  most of the  riders complained the  track was \nnow more dangerous than before and certainly more \nbumpy. After practice Troy Corser said, ‘It’s  so  bumpy in \nsome places that my  vision gets blurred and | just have \nto  point the  bike in  what | think is  in  the  right direction \nand hope for the  best!’ \nMisano is just up  the  road from Ducati’s Bologna \nheadquarters so  it seemed almost inevitable that Bayliss \nwould triumph —  and  Troy duly gave the  Ducatisti what \nthey wanted, a  double victory. His  fellow-countryman \nCorser was runner-up in  Race 1, ahead of an  almost-fit- \nagain Kagayama, with Toseland maintaining consistency \nwith a  fourth place. MotoGP star Valentino Rossi was \nan  interested spectator and was in  exactly the  right \nplace to  see  an  incident that probably cost Haga the \nchampionship in  that first race. Haga was in  front of \nBiaggi when the  Italian tried to  go  for  a  gap that simply \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 217 \n\nwasn't there, at  Curva del  Carro. Biaggi torpedoed Haga \nand  they both went down and into  the  gravel trap. In \nfrustration and  anger Nori kicked the  gravel, but  it was \nin Max's direction and  he thought it was a deliberate \naction, saying afterwards, ‘He  threw stones at  me!’ \nHaga laughed at the  allegation and  just said, ‘He  tried \nan  impossible pass, made a  mistake and  took me  out. \nHe's a  stupid rider.’ The  comment did  not  find favour, \nobviously rankling for the  rest  of the  season with Max, \nwho would moan about it to  anybody who'd listen. \nlf anybody had  expected any  form of retaliation from \neither Max or  Nori in Race 2 they were disappointed. \nBayliss made it a  runaway victory, ahead of Haga and \nBiaggi; the  Aussie was now second in the  championship, \nonly 21  points behind Toseland and ready to  attack, \nwhile Biaggi had  slipped back to fourth. \nBrno is loved by riders and  fans alike and  it’s  not  hard \nto  see  why —  its fast  and  flowing nature make it a  real \nriders’ circuit. In his GP  days it had  been a  happy hunting \nground for  Biaggi and  he was expected to  do well, \nespecially as  he,  and the  other top teams, had  tested \nthere three weeks previously. It didn’t go  quite according \n218 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nto  \nplan, \nalthough \nhe \ndid  \ntake \nthe  \nwin  \nin \nthe  \nsecond \nrace \nafter \nfinishing \nin \nrunner-up \nspot \nin \nthe \nfirst. \nThe \nvictory \nmeant \nthat \nBiaggi \nhad  \nwon \na \nrace \nin \nevery \ncategory \nat \nBrno, \nand \nit \nalso \npropelled \nhim  \nback \ninto  \nsecond \nplace \nin \nthe \nchampionship. \nToseland \ntook \nhis \nsixth \nwin \nof \nthe \nyear \nin \nRace \n1, \nand \nagain \nbattled \nhard \nwith \nMax \nin \nthe \nsecond \nrace, \nwhich \nhad \nbeen \ndelayed \nbecause \nof \nlight \nrain \nand \nthen \nshortened \nby \none \nlap. \nBiaggi \nwas \nseventh \nat \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \nopening \nlap \nbut \nmade \na \ndetermined \ncharge \nup \nthe  \nfield \nto  \npass \nJames \nfor \nthe  \nlead \non  \nlap  \n14, \nwinning \nby \n1.5s \nat the \nflag. \nBayliss's \nDNF \nin the \nfirst \nrace \nand  \nsixth \nin \nthe  \nsecond \ndropped \nhim  \nback \nto \nfourth \nin \nthe \nchampionship. \nHe \nwas \nnow \nlosing \ntouch \nwith \nthe \ntrio \nahead. \nAnd so  to  Brands Hatch, good weather and  a \nhuge crowd all wanting a  home win. They were not \ndisappointed, for Toseland took a  remarkable double, \nwith Corser second and  Biaggi third in the  first race. \nJames's title aspirations were helped by two of his \nnearest rivals, Haga and  Bayliss, crashing out  and  he \nwas full  of confidence for  Race 2, which saw a real \ndogfight between him  and  Haga for over three-quarters \nof the  race distance. In the  end, Haga had  to  concede \nvictory to James, with the  margin of victory just over \n1.5  seconds. Corser took third, with Fabrizio fourth \nand Kagayama fifth despite being in pain from a  heavy \ncrash in the  first  race. Toseland’s double was his first \nin World Superbike and  he was so  happy that, on  the \ncooling-down lap,  he stopped on  the front straight, \nstripped off  his  leathers and  then hurled them into  the \ncrowd. He  left  Brands Hatch with a  66-point lead in \nthe  series over his  nearest rival, Haga, with Biaggi close \nby in third. Bayliss was now nearly a  hundred points \nadrift of Toseland, something nobody would have \nthought possible at the  start of the  year. With three \nrounds remaining the  Briton had  one strong hand on \nthe  trophy, but  Haga and  Biaggi were not  giving up the \nchase yet. \nIt’s  hard to find beauty in the  monolith that is the \nEurospeedway Lausitz, and not  easy to  believe it’s  a \nplace for good racing. The  crowd, trapped as  they are \nin the  only place they can  go,  have a  reasonable view \nof the  track action, but  the  complex is so  vast that it \nonly really comes to  life  if there over 100,000 spectators \nthere. No  such luck for World Superbikes, whose \nweekend crowd figure of 49,000 looked respectable \nrather than remarkable. Haga won Race 1 by 11  seconds \nafter Bayliss's tyre faded. Biaggi took advantage to  take \nsecond place, with Corser third. Series leader Toseland \nsuffered a swinging-arm problem, but  instead of pulling \nout  he  kept going and  finished in ninth. Bayliss and \nHaga once again led  the  charge in the  second race, but \nthis  time Troy got  his  revenge, beating Nori by 1.353s at \nthe  flag. Biaggi was third, some 13  seconds or  so  back, \nwith Toseland a  gritty fourth despite a tyre problem. \nVallelunga was the  event that FGSport had been \nwanting to  stage ever since they took over the  series, \nbut  until this  year there was no  reason to  hold a  race \nat what is, at  best, a club circuit. With a certain Max \nBiaggi taking part, though, they finally had  enough \n\nammunition. How the track was homologated is \nanybody's guess, because there were at least three \nareas which gave cause for concern. When Troy Corser \nasked for some airfencing at the  dangerous exit  of the \nlast  turn he was told that it was not  possible because \nthe  airfence might intrude onto the  ripple strips. The \npaddock was nowhere big enough for all the  teams, \nso  the  support classes were out  in fields with minimal \nfacilities a  long way from the  pits. The Saturday \nafternoon press conference had  to  be cancelled because \npolice and  security officials, despite being there in \nhuge numbers, could not  or  would not  guarantee the \nsafety of the  riders going to  and  from the  pits. It was \na  logistical nightmare, to  say the  least, but  happily the \nracing, especially on  TV,  was good and  there were no \naccidents or  serious injuries. As  more than one rider said \nafterwards, though, ‘We were lucky today. \nOf course the  fairytale would not  have been \ncomplete without a  Biaggi win  and  fortunately, for \nthe  massive crowd present, he duly obliged in Race \n1, overtaking Bayliss after three laps and  then never \nheaded on  his way to  an  historic victory. Toseland was \nthird, ahead of Haga. Throughout the  season Biaggi \nhad  shown, more than any  other rider, that he was \nthe  smoothest racer out  there, best able to conserve \nhis tyres and  still  run  fast  at the  end  of a  race. He \nobviously wanted to  do the  double, but  Bayliss spoiled \nthe  Roman’s party. Troy led  most of the  race, apart from \na six-lap stint by Haga, but  was back in control, with \nBiaggi second, with five  laps to  go.  Then Max made a \nmistake and  ran  wide, allowing Bayliss just the  breathing \nspace he  needed to  ease away and  take the  chequered \nflag. Biaggi was 1.431s behind at the  finish line, with \nHaga third and  Corser fourth. Toseland crashed at the \nvery slow hairpin but  once again remounted to  take 11th \nplace, but  his  lead over second-placed Biaggi was down \nto  29  points, with Haga just four points further back. \nNow both Toseland’s pursuers were scenting blood. \nThe  odds were still  stacked heavily in James \nToseland’s favour when the  teams arrived for the  final \nshowdown at  Magny-Cours, and normally a  29-point \nadvantage would seem pretty good, but  an  incident \non  the  opening lap of the first race nearly changed \neverything. Lanzi’s fall  at Turn 1 almost caused James \nto  crash. He  managed to stay onboard his  Honda, but \navoiding the  crash dropped him  way down the  order \nand  suddenly, for  Haga and Biaggi, there was light and \npossible glory at the  end  of the  tunnel. Toseland finished \nseventh, with Haga the  biggest benefactor thanks to \nhis win. Biaggi was sixth —  not  out  of contention, but \nknowing now that only a win  and poor results from \nthe  other two would give him  the  title. The  final race \nwas a tense and  nervy affair, which Haga duly won, but \nToseland’s sixth place was enough to give him  the  title \nby just two points. It was a fitting send-off to  a  rider \nwho has  graced the  World Superbike Championship \nsince 2001 and will  ply his trade in MotoGP in 2008. \nAfterwards he said, ‘It’s  hard to  believe that I've \nbeen in this  championship for seven years. | have really \nenjoyed racing against the  likes of Bayliss, Haga, Biaggi, \nCorser and  the  rest  of the  guys and  am  proud to  have \nbeaten them and  taken the  title. The  trophy | won in \n2004 has  been sitting on  the  shelf and getting a  bit \nlonely, so  | thought I'd  better get  it some company. | \nknew that I'd  be going to  MotoGPs three races before \nthe  end  of the  season, but  | was determined to  leave as \na  champion —  for  myself, my family, the Ten  Kate team \nand  everybody who has  helped and  supported me.’ \nToseland has  been dealt more than his fair  share of \nhard knocks in life,  but  every time he  has  bounced back \nmore strongly. His  title win in 2004 was a testament to \nhis determination to overcome all odds, and  if anything \n2007 was a  much harder task, but  one  that he once \nagain accomplished though his strength, resilience \nand  consistency —  a truly worthy champion for World \nSuperbike’s 20th year. \nAbove: Bayliss and  Haga \nled  Race 1 at  Brands Hatch, \nbut  both crashed out. \nUpper left: Toseland leads \nCorser through the  Ascari at \nMonza. \nLower left: Corser and \nhis Yamaha part  company, \nBayliss looks on. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 219 \n\nAfter his  Race 1 \nwin at Valencia, \nSpaniard Ruben \nXaus needed a \ntow back to  the \npits, and Kel  Edge \nobliged. \n220 World Superbikes: The  First 20 Years \nwe \n2007 \nsatis hp \nRound 1 -  Qatar \nLosail, 24  February \nRace 1 \n1 Max Biaggi, Ita,  Suzuki \n2 ames Toseland, GB, Honda \n3 Lorenzo Lanzi, Ita,  Ducati \n4 Yukio Kagayama, Jap, Suzuki \n5 Troy Bayliss, Aus, Ducati \n6 Max Neukirchner, Ger, Suzuki \n7 Roberto Rolfo, Ita,  Honda \n8 Noriyuki Haga, Jap, Yamaha \n9 Troy Corser, Aus, Yamaha \n10 Ruben Xaus, Spa, Ducati \n11 Steve Martin, Aus, Honda \n12 Shinichi Nakatomi, Jap, Yamaha \n13.

That's \nthe  attraction of the  Superbike class: the  bikes that \nanyone can  buy in the  showroom are  raced by some of \nthe  best riders in the  world. \nNo  factory has  benefited more than Ducati. When \nthe World Championship was born, Ducati was a tiny \nItalian factory in protective receivership.

In no  time at all, the  Ducati brand was  a \nworldwide style icon. \nThe  World Superbike Championship has  come a  long \nway in two decades, but  it hasn't always been an  easy \nride. Earlier attempts to  promote World Championships \nbased on  production bikes —  TT  F1  and  Formula 750 \n—  were short lived. There were times when it looked as \nif World Superbike might go the  same way, for  reasons \nranging from simple lack  of cash to  a  major fall-out \nbetween the  organisers and  the Japanese factories. \nThe  World Superbike Championship has weathered all \nthe  storms and, in its first 20 years, has  become solidly \nestablished as  the  most successful series of its type. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 9"

      "text": "There were a  couple of hiccups, though. First there \nwas a  skirmish on  the  grid when the  Clerk of the  Course \nwould not  let  mechanics help riders push-start the  bikes \nfor the  warm-up lap.  Lucchinelli shrugged and leaned \nthe  Ducati —  ‘You need at  least six  Italians to  start that \nthing’ —  against the  pit wall. Other riders made more \nvociferous protests until McLaughlin negotiated a truce \nby pointing out  to  officials the  cost of the  TV  cameras \naimed at them. More significantly, the  $100,000 \nguarantee that Sports Marketing was supposed to  have \npaid to the  FIM  before the  first race had  not  arrived. \nIt was, says McLaughlin, the  first inkling he  had  that \nsomething was wrong. \nBut  his efforts had  brought together an  interesting \ncast  of characters and  an  intriguing mix  of machinery. \nThe  Japanese factories stuck to their promise not  to \nfield works teams, and  the  smaller Italian manufacturers \nsaw a  chance to  grab the  limelight. Bimota didn’t even \nconsider defending their TT  F1  title, sacked their rider \nVirginio Ferrari and  sent out  a two-man team of ex-GP \ncrasher Stephane Mertens of Belgium and  Italian Davide \nTardozzi, whom many saw as  the  pre-season favourite. \nBimota’s YB4EI was within the  letter, if not  the  spirit, \nof the  technical laws; its beautifully crafted aluminium \nchassis made at  Bimota’s Rimini factory housed a  heavily \ntuned and  fuel-injected Yamaha FZ750 motor. Because \nof the  size  of the  company, the  homologation limit was \n200 units. Bimota said  that they’d made them, with the \nmajority going to  ‘Japanese collectors’, but  McLaughlin’s \nopinion was that Giuseppe Morri, Bimota’s boss, played \na very clever game and  never made anywhere near the \nrequired number of bikes. \nMost people thought that the  factory flouting the \nrules most flagrantly was Ducati. They fielded the  1981 \n500cc GP World Champion Marco Lucchinelli. It is an \nopen secret that the  first Ducati 851  that raced at the \nBol  d’Or in ‘87  was illegal under the  prevailing TT  F1 \nregulations in that it was well over the  750cc limit, \ndespite being billed as  a  750. The  Superbike paddock . \nsuspected that there were not  many more than the  two \nnew 851s at  Donington in existence, let alone the  200 \nrequired. McLaughlin was adamant that on a visit  to \nBologna he  personally counted 207  851s in production. \nTrue, it was after the  first homologation date, but  it was \nbefore the  second cut-off date, so  again there was no \ndoubt that Ducati were operating within the  spirit if not \nthe  absolute letter of the  law. \nThe  Japanese factories were represented by \ncomparatively low-profile operations. Embarrassingly, \nthe  aluminium-framed homologation special Yamaha, \nthe  FZ750R, was almost absent and the  quick Yamahas \nwere standard steel-framed FZs. The quickest of them \nwas piloted by a tiny  Italian, Fabrizio Pirovano, an  ex- \nmotocrosser with just a couple of seasons of road racing \nunder his  belt. Kawasaki and Suzuki were not  really in \nthe  frame; their GPX and GSX-R 750 sportsters were \nnot  readily adaptable to the  race track. The  American \nYoshimura Suzuki team of Doug Polen and Scott Gray, \nin  the  UK  for the  Eurolantic (née Transatlantic) Challenge \nthat was wrapped around the  first World Superbike \nmeeting, \ndid  \nnot  \nenter \nat  \nDonington. \nEven \nF1  \nace  \nand \nPrevious \nspread: \nFred \ntechnical wizard Anders Andersson of Sweden had Merkel and  the  Honda \nRC30, the combination \nproblems making the  1988 Slingshot CV  carbs work ihatwould-dominate Warld \non  his GSX-R.

In  Italy he would send the  crowds \nwild with dare-devil riding, then, having won, march \nout  on  to the  track brandishing an  enormous Stars \n& Stripes at them, ignoring the  hail  of boos, whistles \nand more solid protests aimed at  him. To  describe him \nmerely as  Californian would be  guilty of the  wildest \nunderstatement. He  looked every inch the  surfer with \nhis long blond curls and  bandannas. His  riding style \nwas  wild and  he affected enormous knee-sliders that \ncovered most of his shins, which spent most of the  time \non  or  just above the  tarmac as  Fred slid  the  Honda in  a \nmanner that Europeans had  yet to come to terms with. \nFred was fast, Fred was glamorous, Fred was a Star, and \nlike  all Californians seemed to  know instinctively what \nto  say  when a  microphone was pointed at  hirn. And he \nwas keen to  remind any  commentator he could corner \nthat it was he,  Flyin’ Fred Merkel, who had  started \nthe  fashion for the  standing-on-the-pegs flag-waving \nair-punching slow-down-lap celebration, not  Kevin \nSchwantz. He  was just what Superbike needed. \nThe  struggle for the  title  was a  season-long war \nbetween the  speed of the  Bimotas and  the  consistency \nof Merkel and  the  Honda, with the  occasional significant \ninterruption. The  honour of winning the  first-ever World \nSuperbike race went to  Davide Tardozzi, but  for the  only \ntime in the  championship’s history the  results of the  two \nraces held each day were combined to  give an  overall \nwinner. Lucchinelli won the  second leg and, when \nTardozzi crashed while lying second, took the  overall \nvictory as  well. He  wasn’t that sympathetic to  his fellow- \ncountryman: ‘Tardozzi eez  a  square ‘ed,’ he announced \nto a  puzzled group of journalists, before adding, ‘First he \nfall  on  that side’, while theatrically striking the  left  side \nof his face, followed by a whack on  the  right side  and \n‘then he fall  on  that side!’ \nThe  two-race formula turned out  to  be a stroke of  . \ngenius. If a  rider crashed or  had  a  mechanical problem \nin the  first race, he  had  a chance to  redeem his day in \nthe  second. And the  Superbike guys didn’t have to  share \nthe  prize money, which was the  responsibility of the \norganising circuit, with too  many support-class racers. \nThe  paying public got value for  money, too  —  although \nin some places the  undercard was a little short on \nquality. Steve McLaughlin felt  that, with TV  in mind, \nthere was also  the  possibility of showing a  race on  either \nside  of an  F1  car  GP. \nThe first unexpected win came in  the  second race at \nHungary when, in front of a  massive crowd, Frenchman \nAdrien Morillas gave Kawasaki their first  World \nSuperbike win  on a steel-framed GPX750 prepared by \nendurance legends Godier-Genoud; he then survived an \namazingly petty protest from Bimota about the  shape \nof his bike’s seat. The  first  double came next time out \nat the  superfast Hockenheimring, where Tardozzi took \nboth wins as  Merkel’s Honda blew up  trying to  keep \npace. \nUnexpectedly, Suzuki took a win  in Japan, although it \nwas more down to  the  tactical nous of Gary Goodfellow \nthan the  bike. On  a  drying track the  expatriate New \nZealander riding under a  Canadian licence did  what \nbike racers very rarely do;  he  pitted to  change wheels \nThe  slick tyre he  put on  the  back of the  GSX-R enabled \nhim  to  hold off  Merkel and win. The second race saw a \nlittle bit of history, although no-one knew it at the  time. \n“he  race was stopped and restarted after an  oil  spill \nbought down a  bunch of riders, including the  leader, \nMarco Lucchinelli. At the  second time of asking the \nwinner was a  young Australian by the  name of Michael \nDoohan on  a  Yamaha. He’d been a  promising hotshot \nin domestic 250cc production racing and, in the  usual \nAussie racer production-line method, had  been picked \nup  by the  Yamaha importer’s Superbike team. It was \nthe  exact route travelled by Wayne Gardner and Kevin \nMagee, who'd also had  to  prove themselves in  Japan \nand  on  four-strokes before graduating to  500 GPs. The \nAustralian press was already predicting a stellar future \nfor  Doohan, although not  even the  most enthusiastic \nOcker could have realised just how good he'd be.  To \nslightly less  acclaim, a  quiet young Kiwi called Aaron \nSlight scored points in both races on  a  Bimota. \nLeft: Davide Tardozzi and \nthe  factory Bimota —  fast  but \nfallible. \nBelow: Marco Luccinelli and \nthe  new Ducati 851 brought \na  certain Latin something to \nSuperbike."

      "text": "The  speed of Tardozzi’s Bimota kept him  at the  head \nof the  championship table from Hockenheim onwards, \nwith one interruption from Pirovano, so  when the \nSuperbike paddock decamped to the  Antipodes for \nthe  last  two rounds in  Australia and New Zealand the \nItalian was odds-on for the  title, especially when Ducati \ndecided not  to  make the  trip. Ostensibly the  reason was \nlack of budget, but  as  they’d been able to  go to Japan \nthis  didn't ring quite true, especially as  Lucchinelli was \nstill  in with a chance of the  title. The  conspiracy theorists \nhad  an  explanation. They reckoned that the  Australian \nscrutineers, used to  policing the  ultra-strict regulations \nfor the  Castrol 6 Hours, the  world’s most important box- \nstock production race, would throw Ducati out. It was \ncommon knowledge that since the  Austrian round the \nfactory 851  was in fact an  888 thanks to  a 94mm bore. \nThis  was confirmed by the  capacity of the  Lucky Replica \nlaunched later in the  year at the  Cologne Show —  888cc. \nBut  in Japan the  Duke's motor was allegedly measured \nat 998cc; as  the  rules forbid altering the  motor’s stroke, \nthis  meant a  bore of 99.5mm, and the scrutineers would \nobviously have measured the  stroke to  calculate the \ncapacity. But, said the  men who'd worked on  eight- \nvalve Ducatis, you  can't bore the  standard barrels out \nto  99.5mm —  you'd be through the  metal and into  the \nwater jacket. \nAnd there was more. Ducati claimed that Lucky's \nbike weighed 152kg, but  Stefano Carrachi’s semi-works \nNCR 851, with its carbon-fibre bodywork and  titanium \nfasteners, tipped the  scales at  166kg. This, said the \nspecialists, meant weight must have been lost  from \nthe  motor, and  that meant magnesium castings, so  the \noriginal material had  been changed, again contrary to \nthe  regulations. This surreptitious development work \nwould probably have got  past the  scrutineers in most \ncountries, but  the  ultra-sharp Aussie scrutineers would \nhave spotted it a  mile off. \nDucati must have regretted their decision when \nTardozzi crashed in qualifying at Oran Park and  could . \nonly manage 10th and 11th in the  races. Merkel took a \nthird and  fourth to  close to within 2.5  points of Tardozzi \nand level with Pirovano. The  final round at  Manfeild \nPark was wet, stretching already taut nerves to  breaking \npoint. The coolest man was Fred Merkel, who won the \nfirst race from Pirovano, until then reckoned the  rain- \nmaster, with Tardozzi fifth. \nThe  track was drying for the  second race, the  worst \nof all circumstances. Merkel and Pirovano both went \nout  on  wets, while Tardozzi contrived to crash on  the \nwarm-up lap.  Much arm-waving followed as  the  Bimota \npeople tried to  get  Mertens off  his  bike to  give it to \nTardozzi. Mertens, who already knew that Bimota didn’t \nwant him  next year, was having none of it. The  track \ndried rapidly, and  to  add insult to  Bimota’s injury the \nBelgian, who'd gambled on  slicks, cleared off for the \nwin  as  Merkel wobbled round in  fifth. Pirovano lost \ntouch and in a  last  desperate throw of the  dice tried to \ndo a  Goodfellow and pitted for slicks. It was too  late. \nFred Merkel was the  first World Superbike Champion. \nThe question was, would there be another one? \nTop left: Kawasaki's first \nwinner: Adrien Morillas. \nBottom left: Suzuki's first \nwinner: Gary Goodfellow. \nBelow: Terry Rymer showed \nhis  promise with a  rostrum \nfinish in  Portugal on  a  very \nwell-used RC30. \nRight and above: Fabrizio \nPirovano and the  steel- \nframed Yamaha were \nsurprisingly competitive. \nWorld Superbikes: \nPema \nThe First 20  Years \n17"

Superbike had \ntaken over from TT  F1  as  the  premier four-stroke \nchampionship thanks to  getting the  right mix  of men \nand machines on  to the  right circuits. TV  coverage had \nbeen good compared to  anything that had gone before, \nand  the  big Japanese factories were now starting to  take \nan  interest in supporting the  series. \nUnfortunately, the  single big series sponsor hadn't \nmaterialised, but talks with Japan’s largest advertising \nagency, Dentsu, had  looked promising —  not  least \nbecause all four major manufacturers were clients. \nBut  McLaughlin and  Jones didn't get the  chance to \ntry for the  big prize. The bosses at  Madison had  seen \nthe  best part of a  million pounds sterling spent on \nSuperbikes with no  sign yet of a  return. They decided \nthat enough was enough and  pulled the  plug, leaving \nthe  World Superbike Championship without an  organiser \nand  without TV  coverage. Just  six days before the  first \nround of the  year, Sports Marketing ceased trading. \nThe FIM’s Management Council was informed at  a \nmeeting on  Good Friday, three days before the  first race. \nThere seemed a very strong possibility that the  World \nSuperbike Championship would not  happen. \nOf immediate concern to  the  riders was the  promised \ntravel fund for the  top 25  riders of the  previous year. \nAny rider who'd planned his  season around the \nSuperbike Championship had  just  lost a major chunk \nof his guaranteed income and  was faced with the \nprospect of telling his sponsors that all the  TV  coverage \nthey'd been promised wouldn't be  happening. The \nFIM  guaranteed payments for  the  first round only, \nand  Joe  Zegwaard, President of the  FIM  Road Racing \nCommission, was deputed to  try and sort out  the  mess \nNot  that you’d have known that the  championship \nwas in  crisis from the  quantity and quality lined up  for \nthe  first round.

His  RC30 \ncame from HRC, the  Honda Racing Corporation, and \nwas  fielded by the  Italian Rumi team with some useful \nsponsorship from an  underwear manufacturer. The  only \nhelp Fred had  received the  previous year had  been an \nengine for the  Austrian round supplied not  by HRC but \nby Honda R&D (these distinctions are  important when \ndealing with something as  big as  the  Honda Motor \nCompany). That motor had  been slower than the  ones \nhis team built, as  was the  motor from the  same source \nsupplied to Virginio Ferrari, but  this  time Flyin’ Fred could \nexpect the  best kit available. \nThere was one big imponderable in  his  campaign, \nhowever —  his tyres. The  Rumi team of Merkel and \na  young Italian called Piergiorgio Bontempi had  an \nexclusive deal to  use  Pirellis. The  Italian tyre  company \nhad  always been a  big player in  the  supersport classes \nthat use  treaded road tyres, but  had never provided \nslicks for  a front runner at  World Championship level. \nOver in the  500 GPs, Pierfrancesco Chili was also using \nPirellis, but  both he and  Fred were on  their own trying \nto  develop their equipment while the  Michelin and \nDunlop factories had  years of experience and  feedback \nfrom all their teams. Looked at  optimistically, Fred \nhad  Pirelli’s undivided attention and  must therefore \nhave a  magic tyre. The  alternative view was that he \nwould be struggling with lack of experience and  an \nunderdeveloped product. The  analogy with Kenny \nRoberts's arrival on  the  GP  scene ten  years previously \nas  Goodyear’s only runner seemed a  good one. When \nKenny won his titles everyone assumed that his  tyres \nwere very special. Only later did  the  truth emerge"

      "text": "—  they were usually awful. Fred, said the  paddock \nsages, would have similar problems. Peter Ingley, the \nvastly experienced tyre engineer brought in  by Pirelli \nto  run  their operation, maintained the  truth was, as \nusual, somewhere in  the  middle. ‘There was one track \n—  Canada —  where we  were at  a  definite disadvantage \nand  one  where we  were at  a  definite advantage.’ \nCrucially, neither Dunlop nor  Michelin were yet taking \nWorld Superbike seriously and, said Ingley, ‘By the  time \nMichelin hit the  panic button we  were on a roll.’ \nIngley also claimed to  have introduced the  true \nqualifying tyre to  bike racing in  1989. Some racers need \nto  set  pole position as  part of their psychological war \nwith the  opposition —  Merkel was one  of them —  while \nsome racers simply want to  be  on  the  front row. ‘! built \nMerkel a true one-lap qualifier and used the  tactic |’d \nobserved Senna using in  F1,  setting pole at  the  last \nmoment, leaving no  time for  anyone to  beat it.’  Merkel \ntook pole four times in  the  season, as  did  Ducati’s \nRaymond Roche, but  Fred also started from second \n—  usually behind local heroes in Australia or  the  States \n—  four times compared to  Raymond's twice. \nThere was more than one HRGsupplied RC30 on \nthe  grid. Stephane Mertens left  Bimota to  run  his own \nteam with ace  tuner Jean d’Hollander, another Belgian, \nfettling his  motors. But  the  lanky Belgian missed the  first \nrace of the  season after a  dreadful crash at  Brands Hatch \non  Good Friday during the  Eurolantic Challenge when \nhe tangled with Joey Dunlop at  Paddock Hill  Bend. \nCourageously, he  returned for  Round 2 in  Hungary, but \n7 \ni \ncouldn't race with the  front men and dropped more \nvital points. Dunlop came off  worse and, much to \nthe  displeasure of Irish fans who raked over Mertens’s \nreputation as  a  crasher, missed the  Isle  of  Man TT \nAt  Ducati, Marco Lucchinelli gave up  full-time \nriding and  instead managed the  team of ex-500 GP \nStar  and 1981 World Endurance Champion Raymond \nRoche with virtually unknown Baldassarre Monti as \nback-up. The Frenchman, now 32  years old, was a \nnotorious hard case —  even by the  standards of his  tough \nhome town of Toulon —  and also a  rider of proven \nworld class. His  major problem would be  the  lack of \nreliability that had  also plagued Lucchinelli the  previous \nyear. Not  only was the  851 a  new bike, but  the  use  of \nelectronic fuel injection was also new to  motorcycle \nracing applications and gave rise  to  many of the \nmechanical failures \nBimota suffered as  well, leading to  all  sorts of \nunlikely rumours, such as  the  Air  Traffic Control radar \nat  East Midlands Airport two miles up  the  road from \nDonington interfering with the  electronics. Which didn’t \nexplain why the  motors also stuttered on  tracks miles \nfrom airports. However, when the  Ducati kept going \nit was very, very fast. Fast enough for  Roche to  post \ndouble wins at the  two fastest tracks in  the  calendar, \nHockenheim and Brainerd —  it was the  shape of things \nto  come. \nBimota moved Tardozzi to  a  privateer team and \nsigned ex-GP privateer Fabio Biliotti, plus a  total \nunknown, an  ex-motocrosser with the  looks of an \nPrevious spread: Flyin’ \nFred Merkel at  the \nHungaroring. \nAbove left: The  riding style \nand celebrations were as \nvivid as  the  colour scheme: \nMerkel in  action. \nBelow left: Merkel’s crew \nsignal to  him that Mertens \nis out  and he  is World \nChampion again. \nBelow: Giancarlo Falappa \ngets a  good talking to  from \nhis  team."

Fabrizio \nPirovano got  an  OWO01 and sponsorship from the  Italian \nimporter, Anders Andersson deserted Suzuki for the \nfirst time in his career and  turned up  with a  beautifully \nprepared Yamaha with very trick Ohlins suspension, and \nyoung English hope Terry Rymer would do  most of the \nchampionship on  the  UK  importer’s Loctite-sponsored \nbike. Terry's season would be  interrupted by domestic \ncommitments and hampered by Dunlops that didn’t \nseem able to  last a World Championship-length race, \nbut  here at  last  was a  genuine championship hope for \nBritish fans to  get  behind. \n24 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nKawasaki didn’t have any  full-time challengers, \nbut  the  French endurance squad of Patrick Igoa and \nChristophe Bouheben put  in some useful rides at the \nbeginning of the  season, as  did  the  Kawasaki Australia \nduo of Rob Phillis and  Aaron Slight at the  end. Their \nmain problem was that the  ZXR homologation bike \nwas much more of a  roadster than a racer, certainly \ncompared to  the  Yamaha and  especially the  Honda, and \nneeded considerable development and a lot of weight \nto  be shed before it would be a competitive Superbike \nracer. Suzuki's French endurance team dabbled but  soon \nrealised that their GSXRs were still  less  than competitive. \nThey didn’t even contest their home round at  Circuit \nPaul Ricard. Suzuki got  a win, though, and again It was \nin Japan and in the  wet  where Doug Polen coped best \nwith monsoon conditions. \nBut  once again the  championship would be fought \nout  between a  hard core of regulars —  Merkel, Mertens, \nPirovano and Roche —  with the  local heroes confusing \nthings in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. \nDespite all the  political activity going on  behind the \nscenes, the  championship ran  smoothly. Joe  Zegwaard \nturned up  at  every race and  took a lot  of flak  for \na  situation that was not  of his  making. His  hostile \nreception was not  helped by the  fact that he’d been"

      "text": "Below: Robbie Phillis had \na very special Kawasaki for \nthe  last  two rounds: the \ntaped-up rear light shows it \nwas built for the  Suzuka \n8 Hour endurance race. \nBottom: Doug Polen’s first \nWorld Superbike win, in the \nrain in Japan. \none \nof \nthe  \nmain \nenemies \nof \nMcLaughlin, \nand  \ntherefore \nSuperbike, \nin the \nFIM’s \ninternal \npoliticking. \nThe big surprise of the  opening round at  Donington \nPark was Giancarlo Falappa on  the  Bimota. In  Race 1 \nhe  ran  with a  fraught bunch including Roger Burnett \n(on  a third HRC-supplied Honda RC30), eventual winner \nPirovano, Rymer and Merkel at the  front before tangling \nwith a  backmarker and dropping right down the  order, \nbut  not  before he thoroughly outraged most of the \nopposition. ‘Who's the  wanker on  the  Bimota?’ asked \nBurnett after the  race. ‘He  doesn’t know what he’s \ndoing —  he’s  got fuel  blowing on  his tyre  and  he doesn't \nknow why it’s  sliding!’ Falappa then won Race 2 and \nlooked almost composed, not  bad  for  his first meeting \noutside Italy. Photographs of him  in among other riders \nshow all the  bunch bar  one  leaning off the  bike to the \ninside of the  corner in the  usual fashion, but  Falappa is \nsitting almost upright pushing the  bike down into  the \ncorner motocross-style. Giancarlo smoothed his style out \n26 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \na  little without compromising his  aggression and  won \ntwo more races. He  also became a star. The  contrast \nbetween the  on-track psycho and  the  off-track teddy \nbear was wonderful. Asked if he was married to  his \ngirlfriend Paula, he searched his  English vocabulary and \nreplied, ‘We are  for  life  ...  she  is my  life.’ Only an  Italian \ncould have got away with a line  like  that. \nThe  other new star  was Terry Rymer, a gangling 22- \nyear-old South Londoner who'd performed wonders \nin  ‘88  on  a very standard RC30. As  one  of the  UK \nYamaha importer’s riders, his  priority was really the \ndomestic championship, so  as  well as  missing two World \nSuperbike rounds he  had  very little time for testing, and \nit showed. That and Dunlop's season-long problems \nconspired to  hold him  back, but  at  least he won a  race \nright at the  end  of the  season and  redeemed his year. \nDucati’s new boy Baldassarre Monti also shone, but  the \nfactory didn’t have a  bike for  him  at the  start of the  year \nand  didn’t send him  to Australia or  New Zealand. \nSuperbike’s first excursion to  its spiritual homeland, \nNorth America, was a success —  at  least with the  fans. \nRounds 3 and  4 were at  Mosport in Canada and \nBrainerd in the  USA, and  attracted 30,000 and  20,000 \nspectators respectively. But  the  barrier-lined Mosport \ntrack was obviously dangerous by the  standards to \nwhich the  European riders were accustomed. It is in \na  beautiful part of the  world, but  the  Armco barriers \nand  concrete walls that line  it caused the  regular \nriders to warn that they would expect some heavy \nmodifications if they were to  return the  following year. \nThe North American races also saw the  return to top- \nlevel competition of the  American ex-500 GP  star  Mike \nBaldwin on a private Bimota. With Biliotti yet to  score \na  point, the  paddock wondered if he was being lined \nup  as  a  replacement, and  when the  Italian quit before \nthe  Austrian round the  wondering was over. Baldwin \ncouldn't get to  Europe for Austria, but  made it for \nFrance and  the  rest  of Bimota’s season. With no  travel \nmoney available and  the  championship gone, Bimota did \nnot  go to the  final two rounds. \nUnbelievably, the  championship went down to  the \nwire again. Roche had  won most races but  had  also had \nhis  Ducati break down far too  often. This  time Merkel \nhad led  since the  second round with only one break \nwhen Mertens got  his  nose in front after Hockenheim, \nbut when they went to the  final two rounds in Australia \nand  New Zealand Flyin’ Fred led  by just two points. It \nwould be another test  of nerve, but  the  regulars would \nbe outshone in the  final two rounds by the  locals. The \nYamaha Australia team fielded Mike Dowson, already \na winner in Japan, and  their new hope Peter Goddard, \nwho had  won his first international race in Japan the \nprevious week, on  full  factory machines. Kawasaki flew \nin a full  factory bike from Japan for  Rob  Phillis who, \nwith team-mate Aaron Slight, was preparing for a full- \ntime assault on  the  championship in  1990. A promising \nyoung man called Daryl Beattie, the  Australian 250 \nchamp, was given an  RC30. Dowson and Goddard split \nthe  wins and legend has  it that the  latter’s win in  the \nfirst race on  a track that started wet  and  dried came"

Zegwaard says that he \nwas strung along for  nearly the  whole season without \ngetting a  firm answer from Japan. What he  didn’t \nknow was that Dentsu was embroiled in  negotiating \nthe  biggest TV  deal ever for the  rights to  the  Barcelona \nOlympics, so  a  little old  Superbike championship was \nway down their list  of  priorities. Of  course Zegwaard \ncouldn't let the  teams know about these negotiations, \nwhich meant that he  was still  the  target for  frustration \nwithin the  paddock. His  mood wasn’t helped when \nMcLaughlin made the  occasional appearance and was \ntreated like  a  visiting deity \nIn the  face of continued procrastination from Japan \n—  or  Zegwaard’s inability to  close the  deal, depending \non  who you talked to  —  the  FIM had to  make a  decision \nRight from the  first meeting after the  crash of Sports \nMarketing there had  been an  offer on  the  table fron \nthe  Flammini Group to  take over the  championship \nThere was also an  offer from McLaughlin in  partnership \nwith an  un-named Japanese backer, but  Zegwaard made \nit quite clear within the  FIM that this  offer would be \naccepted over his  dead body. After one last  plea to  his \nDentsu contact failed to  elicit a  decision, Zegwaard felt \nthat he  had to  recommend acceptance of the  Flammini \nGroup’s offer \nThis Italian concern, fronted by ex-Formula 3000 \ncar  racer Maurizio Flammini, already ran  Italian national \nraces plus several Grands Prix. They quickly put in  place \na  deal with Dentsu for  the  TV  rights and secured a  high \nprofile series sponsor, Diesel Jeans, thanks to  Francis \nBatta, later to  become Alstare team owner \nMcLaughlin, meanwhile, fetched up  in  Germany \nwhere he  started another Superbike series, the  Pro- \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 31"

Ironically, he  had a lot of \nhelp from a TV  producer he  had  once thrown out  of \nthe  Hockenheim paddock for filming a  news item with \ntoo  many cameras. ‘That's not  a  news item, that’s a \nprogramme —  get the  **** out  of here; you're dealing \nwith CBS! They've got  more damn lawyers than there \nare  people in  Munich!’ Pro-Superbike was a  great \nsuccess thanks in no  small part to TV  coverage financed \nby the  large subscription that teams had  to  pay  to join \nthe  series. \nMcLaughlin took the  separation from his creation \nphilosophically —  outwardly at  least. There was one  time \nwhen he got  upset, though. An  American magazine \nprinted a feature on  the  most important men in the \ndevelopment of Superbike; they named Jim  France, \nDaytona track owner, as  the  most important, with \nMcLaughlin only fourth behind Kawasaki team boss Rob \nMuzzy. That one obviously rankled. \nFlammini built well on  the  foundations laid  over \nthe  first two years of World Superbike, and  the \nchampionship got  its first fully fledged Japanese \nworks team in the  shape of Rob Phillis and the  Shin- \nEtsu Kawasaki. Basically, the  Team Kawasaki Australia \noperation, which had  helped Rob to  sixth overall in \n1988 from just four rounds and  seen him  finish no  lower \nthan sixth in three events in ‘89, moved to  Germany \nfor the  season. Although in reality a  dedicated family \nman, outwardly Phillis was a very abrasive character, \nand  very much a  party animal —  with the  emphasis on \nanimal. He  was already 33  years old  with six Australian \nSuperbike Championships under his  belt, and here at  last \nwas the  chance of a crack at a world title  that he  had \nlonged for.  He  had  the  tools for the job:  a works ZXR \nwith fully kitted motor plus an  array of trick suspension, \nsix-piston brakes and lightweight parts that put  it bang \non  the  minimum weight limit for four-cylinder bikes. \nAt  last  Kawasaki had  a  competitive runner with a \nrealistic shot at the  championship, but  Phillis had  a  bad \ncrash at  Hockenheim, ironically bringing down fellow- \ncountryman Mal  Campbell in the  process, and didn’t \nmanage to win a race until the  penultimate round in \nAustralia, but  then promptly backed it up with a win in \nNew Zealand. \nThere were few  changes elsewhere to either men \nor  machines with the  significant exception of Bimota’s \nwithdrawal from the  championship, which gave \nDucati the  chance to  sign up  Giancarlo Falappa as \nRoche's team-mate. Monti moved to  Rumi as  Merkel’s \nunderstudy. Apart from Phillis, the  only other full-time \nnewcomer of note was experienced 500 GP  man Rob \nMcElnea alongside Terry Rymer in  the  Loctite Yamaha \nsquad, but  once again the  team would not  do  a \nfull  season as  they struggled to  cope with domestic"

Michelin were obviously taking the \nSuperbikes seriously now, and  their A-grade men ended \nup  as  the  top  four in  the  championship \nRaymond Roche's Ducati didn’t look very different \nfrom the  previous year’s model, but  one  significant new \ncharacteristic had  been built in  over the  winter: reliability \nHe  had  won more races than anyone else the  previous \nseason but  had  ended up  third in  the  championship, so \nRaymond made his wishes very clear before the  start of \nthe  1990 season, and  when Raymond made something \nclear there was very little option but  to  listen.

Davide Tardozzi had  been \nfirst on  the  scene and may have saved Falappa from \nstrangulation by his  helmet strap. Like all  other witnesses \nto  the  accident, Tardozzi was very shaken; he was still \nmuttering ‘Stupido, stupido!’ to  himself in  the  paddo \nas  Falappa was helicoptered to  hospital and  out  of th \n1990 World Superbike Championship. \nHis  team-mate Roche's view was that It was simply a \nmatter of experience. ‘The problem with a young rider \nlike  Falappa is he crashes because he says “I want to  be \nin front”, but  thinks “I want to  be  in  front immediately”.’ \nReminded of his own wild youth, Raymond would say, \n‘Lam an  old  man now, | don’t want to  crash.’ His  views \non  the  rest  of the  opposition were also enlightening. \nMerkel and Phillis were ‘good riders’, as  was Mertens \nwho was also ‘very aggressive’. McEInea was ‘very fast’ \nand  so  was Pirovano, but  only for ten  laps. The  rest  of \nthe  grid wasn’t very fond of Fabrizio either; the  little \nItalian was the  usual culprit when the  racing became a \ncontact sport. Stephane Mertens’s team felt  aggrieved \nenough after a  coming together in  Australia, which \ncaused their rider to  crash, to  put in  an  official protest \nBut  Roche reserved the  description ‘completely crazy’ for \nBaldassarre Monti. \nRoche embodied some of the  schizophrenia of \nthe  Superbike World Championship itself. He  was in \nthe  veteran class with a  distinguished 500 Grand Prix \ncareer behind him. He  was good enough to  be third in \nthe  World Championship in  1984 but  he  never won a \nGP,  and  that always rankled. He  approached racing In \nSuperbike as  a job, and his  heart was obviously still  with \nthe  500s, but  he was realistic: ‘It’s  better to  have a  good \nbike in  Superbike than a  slow one in  GPs.’ Neither was \nhe very impressed with the  disjointed calendar or  the \nlack  of adjustability on  his  bike: ‘With Superbikes, after \ntyres, suspension, that’s it.’ \nNevertheless, Roche was obviously more motivated \nthan he’d been in  1989. His  win at  the  Hungaroring \nand getting pole at  Sugo, both circuits to  which the \nDucati was unsuited, were, for  him, the highlights of  the"

But  what \nhappened in  1991 threw into stark relief the  inherent \nproblems of the  Superbike class. \nWhat happened was Doug Polen and the  Fast by \nFerraccl 888 Ducati. \nThe  Texan's domination was utter and  total —  he \nwrapped the  title up  with five races to  spare, and up \nto  then had only been beaten once in  a  straight fight \nwhen he  had no  machinery problems. Polen had  a \nworks Ducati 888 but  he  didn’t ride for the  factory \nteam. Instead, the  veteran Italian-American tuner Eraldo \nFerracci prepared his  bikes to  great effect, Dunlop \nproduced a steady flow of new tyres that Polen seemed \nto  be  able to  assess and use  instantly, and —  last  but  not \nleast —  he  rode brilliantly. From the  12  rounds and 24 \nraces (excluding the  Canadian round that was boycotted \nby all  the  regular riders on  safety grounds), Polen was \non  pole an  astounding ten  times, and wasn’t lower than \npole position on  the  grid until the 11th round when Rob \nPhillis went faster at  Magny-Cours. Doug set  the  fastest \nlap of the  day  14  times and  won 17  races, including no \nfewer than six  double wins. No-one has  yet  managed to \nbetter those marks for  a  season's racing \nIt was also the  first example of  a phenomenon \nthat would crop up  regularly in  the  future, that of  a \nnominally private Ducati often being quicker than the \nfactory bikes. Ferracci’s rider Jamie James had  gone we \nin  the  USA the  previous year and showed well in  the \nNorth American rounds of  the  World Championship, \nPolen’s style could sometimes \nlook awkward, but  in  1991 it was \noverwhelmingly effective. \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 41"

      "text": "Right: Doug and  Dianne \nPolen —  note her  name on \nthe  sleeve of his  leathers. \nAbove: Giancarlo Falappa \nmade a welcome return \nafter injury, but  he was \nnot  yet back to  his fighting \nweight. \nBelow: Hockenheim: \nPirovano hits  the  deck, \nFalappa takes to the \ngrass, Mertens carries on \nregardless. Shortly after this, \nFabrizio hit a  marshal. \nand  for  his  1991 campaign he  linked up with two Italian \nex-works mechanics, Giorgio Nepoti and Rino Carrachi, \nwhose tuning firm Scuderia NCR (literally Team Nepoti \nCarrachi Racing) had  built the  factory's racers since the \nmid-1970s in their Bologna workshop a stone’s throw \nfrom Ducati’s factory. Their endurance racers, based on \nthe  original 900SS, were works of art,  but  the  bike of \ntheirs that everyone remembers is the  one on  which \nMike Hailwood made his  legendary comeback to the \nIsle  of Man TT  in  1978, which was prepared by Steve \nWynne of the  British company Sports Motorcycles. \nThis event was as  significant for the  fortunes of the \nfactory as  Paul Smart's Imola 200 win  in  1972 on  the \nfirst-ever racing Ducati V-twin, for  more than any  other \ncompany Ducati’s commercial fortunes were always \ninextricably linked with their racing success. Incidentally, \nthere was another British rider on  an  NCR-built, Sports \nMotorcycles-prepared Ducati: one George Fogarty, who \nhappened to  have a young son  named Carl. The  firm's \nWorld Superbike Championship successes would push \nsales of their road bikes to  undreamed-of levels. \nPolen’s domination was underlined by the \nperformances of the  other factory Ducatis, which, now \ndown on  or  very near the  class's 140kg minimum weight \nlimit for twins, won every race that Polen didn’t until ex- \nGP  star Kevin Magee popped up on  a factory Yamaha in \nAustralia. They also set  the  fastest laps that Polen missed \nout  on  (although Aaron Slight shared that honour at \nthe  Australian round on  a  Kawasaki). Raymond Roche \ngot the  only other double win  that anyone managed \nin  1991, in Malaysia, but the  man who beat Polen in a \nstraight fight was Stephane Mertens, who'd abandoned \nhis  Honda RC30 for a factory Ducati and  Pirelli tyres. \nThis was the  year when Superbike racing became like \nmost other forms of road racing, in that any  rider, no \nmatter how gifted, had  to  have a factory bike to win. \nAnd not just any  factory bike, but  the  right factory bike. \nThe  statistics show that you  needed a  Ducati, despite \nRobbie Phillis’s heroic efforts to  keep on  terms with \nthe  very promising ZXR75OR. The  Aussie, now 35 years \nold, managed to  beat the  other Ducatis fairly regularly, \nespecially towards the  end  of the year as  the  bike got \nmore trick bits, but  he  rarely bothered Polen. \nIt could have been worse —  he could have been on  a \nworks Honda or  Yamaha. Even Fred Merkel struggled; \nhe only got on  the  rostrum once all year, as  it became \nclear that the  RC30 was now very long in the  tooth. \nAgainst all expectations, Carl Fogarty ended up  as  top \nHonda rider after a season of consistent top-ten finishes \nand  no  crashes; his one  DNF was  the  result of a  broken \ngear linkage. This did  not  fit with Foggy’s (undeserved) \nreputation as  a crasher and  machine-breaker, and  the \nfact  that he was riding for the  Honda Britain team on \nrelatively standard machinery and  had  real  problems \nwith front suspension set-up made his season all the \nmore praiseworthy. The  career of his team-mate and \nfriend James Whitham was nearly ended by the front- \nend  problems he suffered. \nThe  highlight of Fabrizio Pirovano’s Yamaha year was \npunching a  German marshal about twice his size  when \nhe attempted to  dissuade the  diminutive Italian from \nrestarting after a crash. On  the  race track he  managed"

The  front row \nis Polen (53), Roche (1), \nMonti (8),  Rymer (7) and \nMerkel (27); the  second \nrow is Phillis (4), Pirovano \n(2),  McElnea (19). \nRight: Stephane Mertens \nenjoyed his first  year on  a \nDucati. \nBelow: Fabrizio Pirovano \nseen through the  armco. \nonly one second place and  three thirds. \nThere was one  new machine on  the  grid, Bimota’s \nhub-centre-steered Tesi  with Ducati V-twin power, but \nit didn’t make much of an  impression. The  Zimbabwean \nRussell Wood was its regular pilot, although the  British \nprivateer Steve Manley was in the  saddle at  Round 1 \nand  scored a World Championship point for  15th in the \nbike’s first  World Championship race. \nPolen’s flying start to  the  season was aided and \nabetted by Dunlop, who took the  Superbikes very \nseriously right from the  start of the  year. Michelin, who \nshod the  works Ducatis of Roche and Falappa, again \ntook too  long to fully commit the  resources needed \nee \n44 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nto  fight for the  title. Pirelli's new tie-up with Stephane \nMertens bore fruit with a win  in the  second race of \nthe  first  round, but  it was  significant that the  Belgian \ncrashed in the  first race trying to  keep up with Polen. \nEqually significantly, Roche hurt himself in a qualifying \ncrash trying to  match the  Texan's time, and  would do \nSO  again at  Round 3. The  pattern was set  that early. \nThe  other factory Ducati rider, Giancarlo Falappa, was \nstill  recovering from his Austrian crash the  previous \nseason, and  was not a realistic candidate for victory. \nMost teams wouldn't have given a  man in his condition \na factory bike, but  the  Ducati team likes to  think of itself \nas  a family and  this  was a way of helping a  much-loved \nfamily member get  better. \nWith hindsight it is now possible to  say  that Kevin \nMagee’s races in Japan and  Australia were significant \nevents in the  Superbike World Championship. Here was \na  man who had  won a  500 Grand Prix  appearing in the \nnew championship, the  first  GP  winner to  do so  after \nLucchinelli. He  was obviously fully recovered from the \nserious head injuries that had  curtailed his  GP  career, \nand he was anxious to  prove a  point or  two. In Japan he \ngot on  the  rostrum just once, with third in  the  second \nrace, so  those Superbike regulars couldn't be that \nshabby, could they? In Australia he won one race, as  we \nnow expected the  locals to  do,  but  lost  the  second to \nPolen. Another landmark: the  first win  for  a  foreigner in \nan  Australian round of World Superbike, and more proof \nof just  how quick Doug Polen was. \nPolen’s domination brought the  issue of the \nSuperbike formula to  a  head.

      "text": "Top: Robbie Phillis and  the \nKawasaki threatened Ducati \ndomination late in the \nseason. \nAbove and right: The \nreasons why the  regular \nchampionship contenders \ndidn’t enter for  Mosport \nwere terribly obvious —  and \nvery close to  the  track. \n& i Nl \nsiaahelal \nPa \nclass, the  regulations had  been skewed to encourage \nsmaller manufacturers —  and  back then Ducati was a \nvery small manufacturer —  to  go  racing. How can  you \ncomplain, said  the  Italians, when we  try harder and \nbuild a good bike; if V-twins have such an  advantage \nyou  should build one  too. The  Japanese camp didn't \nquite see  it like  that. To them the  double whammy of \nthe  capacity advantage and  the  25kg minimum weight \ndifference was simply unfair, and it wasn’t just a  matter \nof top  speed. Well, they would say  that, wouldn't they, \nbut  it was most definitely a fact  that you  needed a \nworks Ducati to win. Even a  good private 888 couldn't \nget  near the  carbon-fibre-bedecked Fast by Ferracci or \nLucchinelli bikes. The  Ducati’s lighter weight allowed its \nriders to  brake later for corners and  give their tyres an \neasier time than the  four-cylinder guys, while the  extra \ncapacity and  the  nature of the  big twin motor launched \nthe  bike out  of low  and medium speed corners on  a \nwave of mid-range power and  torque as  if it had  been \n46 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nfired from a  gun. This was the  route to works bike \ndomination that had  led  to  a  crisis of sorts in  the  500 \nGP  class, and  while there was no  doubt that Ducati \nwere doing nothing against the  letter of the  law, there \nwere grounds for  worrying about the  future viability of \nthe  class. \nSome years later Steve McLaughlin had  an  interesting \ninsight into  the  minimum weight differential. He  said \nunequivocally that it was a sop  to  Ducati to  get them \nto  commit to  Superbike. However, the  way he wrote \nthe  first set  of rules the  differential was 25  pounds, and \nsomewhere along the  way to the  FIM’s headquarters in \nSwitzerland pounds got turned into kilograms without \nbeing divided by any  conversion factor. What was \nmeant to  be a token gesture was turned into  a  major \nadvantage for the  V-twins. \nThere were also the  perennial worries about some \nof the  venues and  the  gappy, disjointed calendar. The \nfirst of these problems came to  a  head at  Mosport \nPark in Canada where improvements for which the \nregular riders and  teams had  asked had not  been done. \nThe  track had  always been dangerous and  over the \nprevious two years improvements had  been requested \nand  carried out. But  this  time, in a  display of unanimity \nunusual for  motorcycle racers, the  event was boycotted, \nwhich is why the  names Pascal Picotte and  Tom Kipp \nappear on  the  roll  of World Superbike race winners. \nAlong with the  cancellation for the  third time running \nof the  Brazilian round, this  avoidable situation appeared \nto  be totally ignored by Joe  Zegwaard and  the  FIM, \nwhich was now doing its best to  pretend that Superbike \ndidn’t exist. But  the  vast majority of the  paddock was \npreoccupied with what to  do about Polen and Ducati if \nthe  combination returned for  1992. \nDoug Polen and his wife Dianne appeared to  lead a \nblameless life:  they donated money to  their local police \nforce to  help them buy mountain bikes for chasing \ndrug dealers (honest), and  they were both always more \nthan happy to talk  to the  media. In fact, the  problem \nwasn't getting Doug to talk, but  to  stop him. Behind \nthis  squeaky-clean facade there was a very astute \nbusinessman as  well as  a calculating racer. He’d always \nraced in classes that paid the  best, and had  banked a \nlarge amount of Suzuki contingency money for winning \none-make series races on  that company’s GSX-R/50 \nand 1100s. He’d then gone to Japan to  race Yoshimura \nSuzukis, effectively works bikes, and  won both the  TT \nF1  and  F3  (400cc) titles, the  first  time anyone had  won \nboth —  and a foreigner as  well! There was also the  small \nmatter of  a World Superbike Championship race win. \nAnd all this  after he’d missed almost a whole season \nin the  late  ‘80s when a gory accident at  an  American \nchampionship race tangled his  foot with the  rear chain \nand sprocket and he  lost  all the  toes from it. \nNot  only couldn’t they cope with him  on  the  track, \nbut  he also wasn’t the  usual Superbike rider off  it. After \nthe  buccaneering Merkel and  the  tough-as-nails Roche, \nwhat do you  make of a  guy  who races with his  name \non  one  sleeve of his  leathers and  his wife Dianne’s name \non  the  other?"

And the  result was the  same, too, \nalthough Doug Polen had  to  work a  lot  harder to  retain \nhis title  than he  did  to  win  it. \nThe  most noticeable absentee wasn’t a  rider, but  a \nteam-manager. Marco Lucchinelli had been caught in \npossession of a  substantial quantity of cocaine in  1991 \nand  was now behind bars, so  the  Ducati teamsters \nhad  to  be  reshuffled. Doug Polen was now part of the \nofficial factory team alongside the  almost completely \nrecovered Giancarlo Falappa, with another ex-500 GP \nWorld Champion, Franco Uncini, as  team-manager. \nRaymond Roche ran  his own bike on  Michelins and  a \nshoestring budget, while Mertens and  the  Spanish rider \nDaniel Amatriain got full  factory bikes. Davide Tardozzi \nalso got factory equipment, but  he was usually acting as \ntest pilot for  development parts. \nAs  usual, Ducati built a small number of 888 Corsa \nreplicas of the  previous year’s works bike for  sale  to \nprivateers, but  unusually they were only 7kg  heavier \nthan the  new works bikes and  very competitive. Both \nthe  factory bikes and  the  Corsas retained the  1991 \nframe and bodywork —  it was obvious that the  888 \nwas approaching the  end of its  development life. \nThe question was, could the  Japanese factories take \nadvantage? \nHonda certainly couldn't. The RC30 was now well \npast It, but  Team Rumi soldiered on  with Baldassarre \nMonti on  what was essentially Fred Merkel’s bike from \nthe  previous season.

The French rider Hervé Moineau, \nfour times World Endurance Champion, put  in  some \nsolid rides on  it, but  never looked like  getting on  the \nrostrum. \nOnce again the  Japanese challenge was left to \nKawasaki, and  again the  only man who regularly got \nin among the  ruling Ducatis was the  indomitable Rob \nPhillis, although Pirovano underlined his  rain-master \nreputation with a  double at a very wet Monza. But \nit was Phillis’s team-mate Aaron Slight who won the \nopening race in Spain on  the  newly and  appropriately \nnamed Moving Kawasaki. \nFive  rounds into  the  year, Phillis was leading the \nchampionship thanks to wins at  Spa and  Jarama \nand  solid points-scoring finishes everywhere else. \nUnfortunately, this  splendid form rather undermined \nhis argument that the  Ducatis had  an  unfair advantage. \nLater in the  season, when he was again holding forth in \nhis caravan on  the  injustices of the  regulations, his wife \nCarol casually remarked, ‘You didn't say  that when you \nwere leading the  championship...’ Ouch. \nPhillis’s motivation wasn’t helped when news leaked \nout  at the  last  European race of the  season that his \nservices would not  be  required on  the  works team next \nyear, but  he still  finished third in the  championship and \nprevented a  Ducati clean sweep of the  top  three places. \nAs  usual, Rob  fought to the  end  —  the  adjective ‘gritty’ \ncould have been coined just for  him  —  but this  was the \nend  of his full-time World Superbike career. His  role  in \nestablishing the  credibility of the  series should not  be \nunderestimated, but  if the  World Championship had \ncome about when he was in  his  twenties instead of \nhis  mid-thirties, history —  and the  record books outside \nAustralia, where he will  always be  a  hero —  might have \nbeen a little different. \nOne works Ducati rider didn’t do  himself justice \n—  Stephane Mertens. For  the  first  time in  the  history of \nthe  championship he  didn’t score a  race win and ended \na  lowly seventh. The lanky Belgian had  been second, \nthird and  fourth in  the  championship in  the  previous \nthree years, but  now it appeared that his  challenge \nwas over. He  was always a fearsome competitor on  the \nfast  tracks, but  his  introverted nature meant that this \nvery likeable racer never stamped his  personality on  the \nchampionship. \nDoug Polen didn’t score a victory until the  first race \nof Round 3, at  Hockenheim, but  he  made up for  lost \ntime with a  double and  went joint top  of the  points \ntable with Roche. This wasn’t going to  be easy. Other \nriders, notably his team-mate Falappa, used Dunlop- \nshod Ducatis to their full  potential. Roche stayed injury \nfree, benefited from Michelin's increased interest in the \nchampionship, and his  bike was the  quickest thing out \nthere. This was another case of the  non-factory-tuned \nDucati being quickest thanks to the  attentions of tuner \nRolando Simoneti, whereas the  factory squad wasn't \nallowed to  interfere with their motors. \nPolen didn’t just have trouble in the  World \nPrevious spread: Polen’s \nstyle was still  strange, but \nhe was still  quick as  well. \nLeft: Number one  again. \nBelow: Polen leads the \nplunge down to  Eau  Rouge \nat  Spa, followed by Pirovano \nand Russell."

But  he didn't —  he \nwon the  first race with Roche back in  third and \nequalled Fred Merkel’s achievement of retaining the \nchampionship.

Most worrying of all,  TV  coverage \nhad been patchy, but  Dentsu’s three-year contract was \nnow over and the  Flammini Group took the  brave step \nof guaranteeing coverage of every round. Up to  now, \na  race only got  on  air  if a  local TV  station decided to \ncover it and provide a  so-called world feed for  stations \nin  other countries. This meant that there were gaps in \nthe  coverage, a  major disadvantage when trying to  sell \ncoverage of the  whole title race. Imagine not  being able \nto  watch a  couple of rounds of the  car  F1  championship \nbecause, say,  Hungarian TV  didn't have the  budget to \ncover the  race. Flammini now took the  decision to  put  in \ntheir own crews if they couldn't contract a  local station \nto  be  host broadcaster. The championship could now \nguarantee consistent coverage and the improvement \nwas instant and impressive \nOf  course these things don’t happen overnight; they \nwere the  result of a  lot  of work over the  preceding \nmonths and  years, which helped to  explain the  seeming \nStagnation over the  previous two seasons. British fans \nbenefited from a  last-minute deal with Sky TV  to  show \nthe  Superbikes after the  UK-only satellite channel had \nlost the  GPs to  the  pan-European station Eurosport. At \nthe  time it seemed like  a  piece of useful opportunism for \nall  concerned, but  by the  end of  the  season Carl Fogarty \nwas being hailed as  Britain’s first nationally Known \nmotorcycle racer since Barry Sheene \nFogarty —  ‘Foggy’ to  every British biker —  replaced \nRaymond Roche in  the  factory Ducati squad while Roche \nhimself moved up  to  become a very laid-back team- \nmanager.

Scott \nRussell replaced Rob Phillis as  the  team’s number-one \nrider, with Slight again playing the  role  of loyal number \ntwo, a  part with which he would have more and more \ndifficulty as  the  year wore on. \nHonda still  didn’t have their RC30 replacement ready, \nbut  the  Rumi team soldiered on  with the  American Tripp \nNobles as  rider. More significantly, Ducati decided not  to \nlaunch their new bike until Honda did,  so  the  only new \nbike on  the  grid was the  YZF750 Yamaha, which would \nagain be  ridden by Pirovano and Merkel. Terry Rymer \nalso rode a  Yamaha in a  private team with a  Portuguese \nrider and  the  backing of that country’s Pepsi importer. \nAll  the  behind-the-scenes progress was fine, but  the \nchampionship had  lost  its top three riders from last  year: \nPolen went back to the  States to  ride  for  Fast by Ferracci, \na 25    A  See \niF \ncad \na \nRy? \nate \n64 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nRoche was now Ducati’s team-manager, and Phillis was \nalso back on  domestic duty. The infrastructure was \ngetting better, but  what would the  show be  like? There \nwas no  need to worry. Fans at the  trackside and  at \nhome in  front of their TVs  were treated to  the  first  year \nof an  epic confrontation that would dominate Superbike \nfor  two seasons —  Carl Fogarty and Ducati versus Scott \nRussell and Kawasaki —  a  script with plenty of sub-plots: \nthe  little Italian factory versus the  might of Japanese \nindustry, the  taciturn Brit  versus the  flashy American, \nLancashire versus Georgia, you name it. \nNot  that it looked that way at the  start of the  season. \nFoggy fell  on  the  very first  lap of the  first  race at  Brands \nHatch (the Irish round!), putting himself out  of the \nsecond race as  well, and  destroying his wet-weather \nconfidence for years. His  team-mate Falappa belied his \nwild-man reputation with two beautifully controlled \nwins in appalling conditions and promptly backed them \nup with a win  in the  dry at  Hockenheim. The  German \nround also saw Juan Garriga’s only visit  to the  Superbike \nrostrum with a second behind Russell in Race 2, but \nhe only lasted two more meetings before his obvious \ndisenchantment with racing led  to  his  replacement in \nthe  Grottini team by Mauro Lucchiari, a young Italian \nrider held in high regard by the  factory. \nFogarty didn’t post a win until the  third round in \nSpain, where he then made up  for  lost  time with a \ndouble victory and  went on  to  dominate the  middle \nof the  season with doubles in Sweden, Malaysia \nand  Holland. But  to the  increasingly exasperated \nFoggy it seemed as  if every time he won, Russell was \nsecond. Scott was also exasperated by what he saw \nas  the  Ducati rider’s machinery advantage, and  even \nthough he was racking up  the  points he was unhappy \nthat he wasn’t winning. As  it became clear that the \nchampionship was between the  two of them, a  small \namount of personal needle crept into  the  proceedings."

He  won the  first  race in front \nof two local Kawasaki riders with Russell back in \neighth on  a  motorcycle that was plainly well down \non  power compared to  the  Japanese Kawasaki riders’ \nbikes: a strange way to  go about winning a World \nChampionship. Harsh words were exchanged behind \nlocked garage doors, and new motors were fitted to \nAti RE See? \nthe  Muzzy bikes. In the  second race Fogarty and Russell \nduelled at the  front until Carl crashed heavily while \nlapping a tail-ender; Scott then led  home a  Kawasaki \nclean sweep of the first four places and retook the \nchampionship lead. Even Fogarty’s Assen double next \ntime out  didn’t dislodge the  American, who finished \nsecond both times. \nSo,  with a slim seven-point lead, Russell went to \nMonza where the  first race was wet. The  two Muzzy \nKawasaki riders led,  and  when Aaron Slight slid  past \nhis  team-mate on  the  front straight everyone expected \nthat he’d be signalled to  let Russell through for those \nvital extra points. But  it didn’t happen, and  when Foggy \nthen fought back to  beat Russell for fourth place in  the \nsecond race, they went to  Donington just nine points \napart instead of twelve. \nSeveral significant events took place at the  British \nround, where a  large crowd expected Fogarty to \nput the  pressure on  the  American, who was rapidly \nassuming the  status of folk  devil for Carl’s fans. When \nRussell committed the  classic Donington Park mistake of \ntrying too  hard on  cold tyres going down the  fast  and \ntreacherous Craner Curves in  qualifying, it looked as \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 65 \npat TT ai sal \nsence tiene te incl ‘ -"

      "text": "if the  fans were going to  get their wish. Such was the \nferocity of the  crash that Russell had  to  be carried up  the \nsteps of his  motorhome when he got out  of the  medical \ncentre. A journalist asked if he could get anything for \nhim, and received the  laconic reply: ‘Yeah, the  race put \nback to  Monday.’ \nOn  race day Russell put  in one  of the  gutsiest \nperformances the  championship has  ever seen, beating \nFogarty in the  first race, then drawing Carl into a crash — \nironically on  Craner Curves —  early in Race 2. All this  on  a \nmotorcycle that the  Muzzy crew had  to alter significantly \neven to  let Scott sit on  It, so  badly beaten up was he. \nAaron Slight and  Russell then fought for the  lead until \nthe  Muzzy crew signalled Slight, who was leading, to \nlet his team-mate through. The New Zealander was not \namused and  gesticulated angrily next time round. \nlt would have been an  easier decision to accept if \nhe’d had  to drop back at Monza, but  now that both \nriders knew that Fogarty was on  the  floor it was almost \nimpossible. With those extra three points Russell went \ninto  the  last  two rounds with a  lead of 32  points. Was \nit worth depriving Slight of what would have been only \nhis third World Superbike win  for three points? The \nKawasaki people said that it was very easy to  see  a \nscenario in which Fogarty might win  the  title  by three \npoints, so  of course it was. Which didn’t explain the  lack \nof a signal at Monza. \nSo  Donington turned into Scott Russell's first double \nwin; it was now the  American’s championship to  lose \nrather than Fogarty’s to win. \nWhat had  been a triumphant season for the  series \ndegenerated into  near farce over the  last two races \n—  scheduled for the  Estoril circuit in Portugal, and \nMexico —  and  undid a  lot of the  good work that had \ngone before. The Portuguese track had  been brought \nup to the  required length by adding two new bends \nat the  far side of the  circuit. Unfortunately, these \nnew-section bends were so  tight that  they made the \nwalking-pace Governor's Bridge hairpin on  the  Isle  of \nMan TT look like  Hockenheim’s super-fast Ostkurve. \nThe result was inevitable —  dominoes on  the  first lap. \nAnd then there was  the  small matter of the  lack  of \nrun-off on  some corners, notably Turn 2. Theoretically \nthe  championship was still  up for grabs, and  when the \nstarter held them on  the  line  for an  age  before the  first \nrace, Scott Russell’s clutch cooked itself and he pitted \nafter a  handful of laps. Unfortunately for  Fogarty, he \ncrashed before his pit crew could signal him  the  news. \nThe removal of the two top  men let  Fabrizio Pirovano in \nfor his only win  of the  season and  what would be the \nYamaha YZF750's only win  until the  end  of 1997. \nFogarty duly won the  second race from Russell, and \nmade his feelings known with a series of explicit hand \ngestures aimed at  his  rival. Foggy’s total of  11  wins \nmade him  by far the  most successful rider of the  year. \nRussell, by contrast, had  only won five  races, and  that \nwas  the  source of Foggy’s frustration: he  had  trouble \ngetting his  head round the  fact  that although he  had \nwon more than twice as  many races as  his  rival, he \nwasn't champion. ‘I just can’t believe Russell’s luck,’ was \nthe  mantra repeated to  any journalist who enquired. \nMaybe the  truth of the  matter lies  in  another statistic: \nFogarty crashed four times and  Scott Russell just  once, \nand that was when he was torpedoed by Giancarlo \nFalappa in Spain. \nRussell, meanwhile, who had  backed up  his wins with \nmany more lower rostrum finishes than Fogarty, further \ninfuriated the  Englishman by being so  laid-back that he \nwas almost horizontal, and implying that you  had  to  use \nyour brains to  be a champion. \nThe championship should have gone down to  the \nwire in Mexico, but  a  bizarre set  of circumstances saw \nthe  race cancelled. The  Circuito Hermano Rodrigues was \npart of a giant complex that hosted a  diverse range of \nevents as  well as  motorsports. The Superbike race was \ntangled up with preparations for a  Michael Jackson \nconcert, and  there were typically convoluted Latin \nAmerican political rivalries involved. The  riders knew that \nthey had  a  problem when stray dogs and  footballs were \nseen on  the  track during qualifying, but  the  last  straw \nwas  when Scott Russell, flat  out  on  the  long straight, \nSaw a pick-up truck cross the  track in front of him. \nIt would be easy to  blame the  Flammini Group for \nscheduling a  race at a track that wasn’t ready for World \nChampionship racing, but there had  twice been post- \nseason internationals held there as  shake-down events. \nIndeed one of these races, at the  end of 1990, had \nbeen the first  time that Doug Polen had  sat  on  a  Ducati. \nHe  had  won both the  non-championship races and  set \nhimself up for  his first  World Championship campaign. \nNo,  scheduling a  race in Mexico was a perfectly valid \nand  well-planned attempt to  broaden the  horizons \nof the  series. Unfortunately it backfired and  left the \nchampionship and  its organisers looking less  than \nprofessional at the  end  of what had  otherwise been \nSuperbike’s most competitive and  highest-profile year yet. \nFar  left: The  last  Yamaha \nvictory in World Superbike \nfor  four years: Fabrizio \nPirovano in  Portugal. \nLeft: Falappa’s T-shirt says \nit all  —  he was really a  big \npussycat. \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 67"

Now when Honda enters —  as  their \nadvertising slogan used to  say  —  Honda wins, so  the \nnew set-up was the  most lavish in  the  paddock. The \nfactory's official team ran  out  of  the  Louth, Lincolnshire, \nworkshops of  Honda UK  alongside the  GP  motocross \nteam, with Neil Tuxworth as  manager, although it’s \na  mistake to  think that he  had  a  massive amount of \nnfluence on  the  choice of  riders. Japan recruited Doug \nPolen to  lead their comeback —  and why not? He  was \nhe  most successful rider in  the  championship’s history, \nand the  men at  Honda head office had  seen his  All- \nJapan TT  F1  and F3  championship wins on  unfancied \nSuzukis at  close quarters, and had noted the fact that he \nhad defeated Honda's supposedly superior machinery on \nthe way. Polen, meanwhile, had filled his  year off  trom \nWorld Superbike productively, winning the  American \nSuperbike Championship on  a  Ferracci Ducat \nThe RC45 didn’t look too different from the old  RC3 \n—  an  aluminium-framed V4  with single-side swinging \narm —  but as  is  usual with Honda, every component was \nnew and improved. The only obviously new feature \nfuel injection, a  major escalation of  the technologi \nwar between the Japanese factories. As  the Ducat \n851/888 was the only other World Superbike \nto  have electronic fuel injection, the natura \nwas that the RC45 would be  not only competitive \nprobably also the bike to  beat \nAaron Slight, happ \nKawasaki but destined, so   everyone thougnt \nanotner season as nis  teams second rider \nDucati had he 8  & \nyear in  order to meet Hondas T \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 71"

      "text": "Previous spread: There \nwas a  British fan  with a flag \nfor  Carl at  every track. \nAbove: Fogarty and  the \nnew Ducati 916  were in \ncommand right from the \nstart. \nRight: Honda’s new works \nteam featured Superbike’s \nmost successful rider, Doug \nPolen... \n...  and  Aaron Slight \n(below), poached from \nMuzzy Kawasaki. \nmoruil \nMm   SPOly \nei dbedil \nWiLTON \nsrolly \natiany \nwas the  916, a  bike so  beautiful that it instantly became \nan  object of desire featured not  only in the  motorcycle \npress but  also in car  and  style magazines all over the \nworld. It looked very different from its predecessors, but \nwasn’t that different. The modifications were all aimed \nat  making the  bike more of a  racer; any  concessions \nto the  comfort of customers who bought a  Ducati \n916  for  road riding were forgotten. The  engine had its \nstroke lengthened by 2mm, a vital step as  Superbike \nregulations prohibited any  alteration to  a homologated \nengine's stroke, and  it was canted forward in the  frame \nto  get  more weight on  the  front wheel. This allowed the \nall-new chassis to feature a  shorter wheelbase, variable \ngeometry was built into  the  steering head, and a single- \n72 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nsided swinging arm was used. But  it was the  shark- \nnosed looks of the  thing that set  the  pulse racing as \nonly a  machine conceived and produced by Italians can. \nThe  factory’s only problem would be  building enough of \nthem to  meet demand. \nThe  minimum weight differential between the  fours \nand  twins had  been shrunk by 5kg  in  1993 by raising \nthe  twins’ minimum limit  to  145kg, still  leaving a  gap \nof 20kg. For  1994 the  gap  was reduced by a further \n5kg, this  time by reducing the  fours’ minimum weight \nto  160kg. Ducati’s response was to  overbore the  916 \nfactory race bikes by 2mm for a capacity of 955cc, \nechoing the  way they'd increased the  capacity of the \nfirst  851  to  888cc, then to  919  and  finally 926cc. As \nalready mentioned, this  was all within the  letter of the \nlaw,  which imposed a  limit of  1000cc on  twins, but \narguably not  within the  spirit of the  rules. \nThe  only comfort for the  opposition was that Ducati’s \nhard-pressed race shop could only make and maintain \na very limited number of 955cc racers. The  factory's \npriority was the  works team of Fogarty and Falappa, \nnow under the  management of Virginio Ferrari, who \nbrought with him  a  much more professional-looking \nset-up than Roche’s down-home team, complete with \ngiant transporters, hospitality unit, and  all the  other \nrequirements of the  modern paddock. Only Honda’s \nencampment was bigger. Davide Tardozzi replaced \nStephane Mertens with Fabrizio Pirovano, who'd finally \ngiven up  on  Yamaha. There was one  other works \n916  run  by Moto Cinelli, Ducati’s UK  importer for \ncompetition bikes, for  fans’ favourite James Whitham. \nKawasaki stuck with Scott Russell as  their number \none and replaced Slight with Terry Rymer, happy to"

Belgarda Yamaha fielded an  all-Italian line- \nup  of young chargers Massimo Meregalli and Mauro \nLucchiari, the  latter poached from Ducati, although the \nrelationship would only last  three races before Lucchiari \nreturned to  Ducati and the  experienced Paolo Casoli \nreplaced him. \nOne extra factory 955 Ducati would make an \noccasional appearance in the  hands of Troy Corser. The \n22-year-old Australian was already champion of his \nown country and  would concentrate on  winning the \nAmerican Superbike title for the  Fast by Ferracci team, \nbut  he still  found time for three European races plus \nthe  Australian round. Corser was the  first of  a new \nphenomenon in Superbike, an  up-and-coming racer \nusing the  series rather than GPs to  hone his  skills and \nraise \nhis \nprofile, \neven \nthough \nthe \n500s \nmight \nhave \nbeen \nhis  ultimate objective. He  qualified on  the  front row in \nhis first race at  Donington and got on  the  rostrum in \nRace 2.  Clearly he would be a  force to  be  reckoned with \nwhen he joined World Superbikes full  time in  1995. \n74 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nDown among the  privateers, it was immediately clear \nthat the  Ducati was still  the  bike to  have, even in  Corsa \ntrim. Two rising stars, Jose Kuhn of France and Michael \nPaquay of Belgium, tried to  make their mark with RC45s \nand  had  dreadful seasons. Only Simon Crafar, one  of \nthose New Zealanders who raced anything anywhere, \ncould do anything with one. He  took the  Team Rumi \nRC45 to  top  privateer slot  and  fifth in  the  championship \nwithout the  benefit of significant factory help, just \nbeating Andreas Meklau’s Ducati despite the  fact that \nthe  Austrian made the  rostrum twice and  Crafar could \nfinish no  higher than fifth all year. \nMuch of the  season was confused by events that \nfollowed fuel  tests from the  first  round at  Donington \nPark. Fogarty, Russell and Slight left  the  UK  neck and \nneck with 35,  34  and 33  points respectively, and  went \nto  Hockenheim where Russell took control after Foggy \nbroke his wrist in  qualifying and Slight crashed in  the \nsecond \nrace. \nThat \nincident \nwas \nexplained \naway \nas \npilot \nerror, but  was in  fact  that rarest of things, a factory \nHonda engine blowing up.

Russell also crashed heavily twice in \ntesting between the  Spanish and Austrian rounds, once \nin Europe and once in Japan, while team-mate Rymer \nwas growing disenchanted with the  penny-pinching \nattitude of the  Muzzy team. Would you  believe they \nbought wheels second hand —  from the  works Kawasaki \nendurance team? \nHonda had  the  lawyers wound up  by now and \nsuccessfully appealed to  the  FIM’s International \nDisciplinary Court on  a variety of technicalities, not  least \nthat Slight was being punished for  using illegal fuel in \ntwo races despite having only been tested after one. \nSlight had  all  his  34  points returned and went back on \ntop  of the  championship, where he stayed up  to  Round \n9 at  Mugello. However, between Rounds 8 and 9 a \ncounter-appeal by Virginio Ferrari on  behalf of Ducati \nand, bizarrely, Oriol Bulto on  behalf of the  FIM’s own \nTechnical Commission, finally ended the  affair and  saw \nwhat most people thought was justice done. Slight had \nhis  17  points for  second place in  the  Donington race \n76 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nafter which he  had  been tested taken away again, but \nwas allowed to  keep his  points from the  other race. The \nresult was that Fogarty left  Round 8 at Assen second in \nthe  championship, and  arrived for  Round 9 at  Mugello \nleading! \nThe  legal wrangling all  but  overshadowed a  near- \ntragedy at Albacete. In  untimed practice Giancarlo \nFalappa highsided the  factory Ducati out  of a  slow \ncorner and was rushed to  hospital with severe head \ninjuries. The prognosis was not  good; local doctors \nwarned us  to  expect the  worst, but  he was flown back \nto  Italy where he teetered on  the  brink before making a \nmiraculous recovery. Giancarlo never raced a  motorcycle \nagain, but  he was alive, although some people who \nSaw him a year or  so  after the  accident were upset \nby his  appearance —  he was limping and had  lost  a \nlot of weight. Part  of the  problem was that non-life- \nthreatening injuries had been ignored in  the  battle to \nsave his  life,  and he  needed a series of operations to  get \nback unrestricted movement. \nWe lost a  great racer, the first true star to  emerge \nsolely in  Superbike, but  we  still  have that charming \nteddy bear of a  man, and  for that we  should be grateful. \nHis  factory ride  was taken over by Mauro Lucchiari."

Very much a  Yamaha man throughout \nhis career and  now 29  years old,  Nagai had  been \nsufficiently highly thought of to  partner Eddie Lawson \nin  the  Suzuka 8 Hour race and to  be sent to  Europe for \nthe  first time at  the  end of  1994 to  help Yamaha win \ntheir first Bol  d‘Or with the  Sarron brothers. His  reward \nfor that high-profile win and his work developing the \nYZF750 was the  chance to  go for  a world title. All  that \nthe  Superbike paddock knew of him  was that he fitted \nthe  old  stereotype of the  win-or-crash kamikaze when \nthey'd seen him  at  Sugo the  year before. He  set  pole \nand got on  the  rostrum in the  first race, then went from \nsecond to fifth on  the  last  corner of Race 2 attempting \nthe  impossible for a win. His  win in the  Bol,  a  24-hour \n% \\ race, contradicted that image, and  so  would his  riding \nHORSE im” 4 /   when he got to  Europe full  time. \nENT AGY+/ORINK \nPrevious spread: Fogarty \nsalutes the  Brands Hatch \nfaithful. \nAbove: Troy Corser’s \nchallenge was blunted \nby frequent machinery \nproblems. \nRight: Aussie parentage \nbut totally Texan: Yamaha's \nColin Edwards. \nFar  right: The  Foggy/ \nDucati/Michelin \ncombination was \ndevastating in  1995. \n82 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nThe  Yamaha team still  ran  out  of Belgarda’s Italian \nworkshops, but  with Christian Sarron as  team co- \nordinator and  ex-GP mechanics Davide Brivio and \nFiorenzo Fanalli looking after the  bikes. It was an \nimpressive set-up, and the  CVs of the  men in charge \nmade excellent reading. Fanalli had  worked with Lawson \nat Yamaha and  had  then been chief mechanic for \nCagiva’s GP team, while Brivio was similarly experienced \nwith top  Yamaha teams. \nVirginio Ferrari kept Lucchiari as  Foggy’s team-mate \nand recruited ex-racer turned suspension guru Anders \nAndersson from Ohlins to work full  time for the  Ducati \nteam. As well as  the  Promotor squad, there was another \nSignificant Ducati outfit in the  shape of the  Gattolone \nteam and  their rider Pierfrancesco Chili, a 250  and  500 \nGP winner as  well as  an  ex-European 125  champion. \nOstensibly this  was not  a works team, but  by the  middle \nof the  season he was admitting to  getting some help \nfrom Bologna —  again the  phenomenon surfaced of a \nprivate 916  (or rather 955 Corsa) being quicker than the \nworks bike. Ferrari’s and Inzinger’s teams received sealed \nengines from the  factory, whereas the  Gattolone team’s \ntuner could work on  their motors. Chili quickly became \na favourite with the  fans  thanks to  his habit of making \na  bad  start then charging through the  pack. When he \ngot to the  front he  usually either crashed or  won. He \ndid  both at  Monza, where the  victory of an  Italian rider \non  an  Italian bike at an  Italian race produced one  of the \nmore emotional celebrations seen at a  Superbike round. \nThe other new privateer outfit was the  British Revé \nKawasaki team. This was set  up  by businessman Ben \nAtkins for  his friend John Reynolds, with David Jefferies \nas  second rider and  machinery equal to that of long- \ntime Superbike contender Piergiorgio Bontempi, who \nrode for the  Italian importer. World Championship \nmotorcycle racing also returned to  the  USA with the  first \nAmerican World Superbike round for four years; in the \nabsence of an  American GP  it was the  most significant \nroad-racing event of the  year in North America. \nOn  the  technical front, carbon-fibre disc  brakes were \nbanned as  a  gesture to  reducing costs (replacing Ducati \n916  crankcases at  regular intervals cost a  damn sight \nmore) and  the  minimum weight limit for  both twins \nand  fours was raised by 2kg to  compensate.

A massive earthquake devastated \nthe  industrial city of Kobe where Dunlop made their \nrace tyres; the  damage was comprehensive and  would \nmean that the  Yamaha and Kawasaki factory teams \nwould suffer severe problems for the  first half  of the \nseason. On  the  political front, the  increasingly fractious \nrelationship between the  Flammini Group and  the \nGP  establishment resulted in  a  slanging match at  the \nstart of the  season when it was announced that a \n600cc four-stroke championship called Thunderbikes \nwould run  as  a support class at  GPs with a view to \nbecoming a  full  World Championship. As  Flammini was \nrunning the  Open Supersport Championship alongside \nSuperbikes, the  Italians regarded this  as  an  intrusion \non  their territory. The  fact that Flammini had run  the \n250cc European Championship at  Superbike meetings, \nand the  movers and shakers in  GPs had previously \n84 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nregarded anything with a four-stroke motor as  an  oil- \nspewing device of the  devil, was conveniently forgotten. \nThe inevitable compromise was that Thunderbikes \nexcluded the  new 748cc Ducati while Open Supersport \nallowed them. In the  event, Thunderbikes would only \nlast  one  year, while Flammini would go  on  to  develop \nthe  Supersport class as  a  natural accompaniment to \nSuperbikes. \nThere was  yet another shock before the  start of the \nseason: Honda and Doug Polen had  parted company. \nThe  announcement was made only a week before the \nfirst race, leaving the  Castrol Honda team no  time to \nrecruit a second rider. Polen had  been half-way through \na two-year contract and the  strange timing of the  split \nwas thought to  be down to  some high-level arguments \nas  to who signed the  cheque that paid Doug off.  He \nwas always a  very astute businessman and  would not \nhave taken kindly to  the  brush-off, but  this  being Honda \nthe  press release said that the  parting was amicable and \nany  investigation was met  with a  discreet silence. \nThe  result was  the  mighty Honda works team \nfielding just one bike and giving Polen’s to  Simon \nCrafar, who ran  it in his  Rumi team’s colours. Aaron \nSlight had  to  carry the  whole burden of development \nand try to  make the  still  recalcitrant RC45 competitive \non  his own. Given the  situation in which he found \nhimself, his achievements this  season were remarkable. \nThey included the  RC45’s first pole position at  Monza \nfor  Round 4, then its  first win at  the  next round in"

      "text": "Above: Meklau hits  the \ndeck, Polen and Edwards \ntake to the  grass. \ncountryman Gobert had  to wait longer, until Laguna \nSeca, for his first  win  of the  year, but  he again won the \nfinal race of the  year at  home in Phillip Island. \nLaguna Seca also saw  the  return to World \nChampionship competition of Freddie Spencer, who got \na seventh place in the  first race, but the  revelation of the \nmeeting was Mike Hale, who scored a third and  fourth \non  a  Honda America RC45, as  did  his  better-known \nteam-mate Miguel DuHamel. Hale’s performance was \nimpressive enough to  get  him  a  Promotor Ducati for \nthe  last  two meetings as  a try-out for a full-time ride \nin  1996. The  American round was also the  only really \nbad meeting Fogarty had  all year. He  could not  get to \ngrips with the  circuit and  only finished fifth and  seventh, \nbut  even that wasn’t enough to  deprive him  of the \nchampionship lead that he’d held since the  opening day \nof the  season. \nThe next venue was Brands Hatch for the  European \nround, giving the  UK  two championship rounds, a \nprivilege normally reserved for  Italy and ‘San Marino’. \nDespite all Fogarty’s successes, he  had  never won a  race \nat the  Kent circuit at any  level of competition, and  this \nextra home round put  pressure on  him, coming as  it did \nright after the  setback of Laguna Seca. Foggy fever now \nhad  the  UK  firmly in its grip, and  45,000 fans turned up \nat  Brands, the  largest-ever crowd for a World Superbike \nrace. They were rewarded with a weekend of total \ndomination —  pole and  two wins in an  atmosphere that \nany  British fan  too  young to  remember the  heyday of \nBarry Sheene had  never experienced. \nHome fans were further cheered by what they \nthought was a  brace of fourth places from John \nReynolds, but  a  protest converted his second race result \nto  third when Yasutomo Nagai was deemed to  have \n86 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nmade a  pass under a yellow flag and  was penalised \nby one  second. Reynolds thus achieved the  dubious \ndistinction of finishing in the  top three at  his  home race \nbut  not  getting to stand on  the  rostrum. Yamaha were \nnot  amused —  they thought that it was a home-town \ndecision and said Nagai would get  his  revenge at Sugo. \nHe  nearly did,  for Fogarty, who could have won the  title \nat the  Japanese round, crashed out  of the  first race in \nwhat was almost a  carbon copy of his  1994 highside. \nNagai tried an  impossible move at the  last  corner of \nthe  first race and  ended up third. In the  second race he \nblocked Fogarty more than once on  the  first lap before \nthe  Englishman forced his way past and, visibly annoyed, \npulled away for a  remarkable win  given the  cracked \nbones in his wrist and  ankle. \nFogarty had  two weeks to  recover before he went \nto Assen, where he was now a racing certainty to take \nthe  title thanks to  an  astonishing lead of  128  points over \nCorser and 154  over Slight. It was like  a third British \nround, there were so  many Foggy fans in the  crowd \nand  so  many Union Jacks on  display. Carl duly retained \nhis title by winning the  first race from surprise package \nSimon Crafar. The  extent of his  lingering Sugo injuries \nwere demonstrated on  the  slow-down lap when he \nasked a fan  to tie a flag around his  neck as  his wrist \nwasn't strong enough to  support a  makeshift flagpole. \nEntertainingly, the  fan  misheard and leapt on  the  back \nof the  Ducati for the  pillion ride  of a  lifetime. Fogarty \nduly extended his  unbeaten Assen run  in Race 2, with \nJohn Reynolds actually getting to  stand on  the  rostrum \nin  third place. \nTragically, the  celebrations were overshadowed by \na second-race crash that would lead to  the  death of \nYasutomo Nagai. Superbike’s first  fatality was the  result"

      "text": "uperbike’s increasing significance was underlined by \nthe  arrival of  a works Suzuki team for  1996, making \na  full  set  of the  big four Japanese manufacturers plus \nDucati. Even more significantly, one  of the  most talented \nriders of recent years —  an  ex-GP World Champion, no \nless  —  arrived on  the  scene. John Kocinski had  taken a \nyear off  racing in  1995 when it became obvious that no \n500 GP  team, or  more likely their sponsors, was willing \nto  risk  taking on  the  troubled genius. How could a  man \nwho had  won the  250  title  and  four 500cc GPs  on \ntwo different makes of bike not  be  a  hot  property? His \nreputation was that he caused teams to  implode and \nwas difficult if not  impossible to  deal with. There were \nalso rumours of strange behaviour, a  cleanliness fetish \nand  other personal problems. None of which altered the \nfact that he was a  genius of a  racer. Kocinski had  very \nmportant fans in  the  shape of Maurizio Flammini and \nthe  Castiglioni brothers, bosses of the  Cagiva Group \nwhich owned Ducati, so  his  path to  the  works Ducati \nteam as  Fogarty’s replacement was a  smooth one. His \nteam-mate was Fogarty’s friend and fellow-Lancastrian \nNeil  Hodgson who was signed first on  the  strength of \nhis  impressive performances as  a  500 GP  privateer. He \nirst  realised who his  team-mate would be when he  saw \nJohn in  the  restaurant across the  road from Ducati’s \nneadquarters one lunchtime \nStill, the  22-year-old managed to  give every \nmpression of enjoying his  new status as  a  works rider, \nand  would engagingly confide how he  couldn't believe \nhe was being chauffeured to  circuits in  the  Cagiva \ncompany helicopter: ‘Me, just  a  lad  from Burnley. And \nthey‘re \npaying \nme \nwell!’ \nHe \nwas \nalso \nloyal \nto \nhis \nteam- \nmate in  public, although in  private he  would wonder \nwhy the  American would ‘let  himself down with some \nof \nthe \nthings \nhe \nsays’. \nKocinski \nsaid \nall \nthe \nright \nthings \nIn \npublic, \nprofessing \nhimself \nhappy \nto \nbe \nin \nSuperbikes \nand \nready to  enjoy his  racing again. It wouldn't last \nSuzuki's first factory team in  Superbike was run  by \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 91"

      "text": "Previous spread: Troy \nCorser was smooth, stylish \nand  the  class act  of ‘96. \nAbove: By mid-season \nKocinksi wasn’t talking to \nteam-manager Virginio \nFerrari. Engine man lvo \nBertoni and mechanic Mike \nWatt consult in Sugo. \nBelow: Team-manager \nDavide Tardozzi was a vital \nelement of Troy Corser’s \ncampaign. \nRight: The  champ had \na  spectacular line  in \ncelebrations. \nthe  English Harris Performance operation, with Lester \nHarris as  manager and  John Reynolds and  Australian \nSuperbike Champion Kirk  McCarthy as  riders. The \nnew GSX-R750 turned out  to  have power and  good \ntop-end speed but  was  afflicted by a strange high- \nspeed instability that took most of the  season to  iron \nout. Along the  way both riders, the  even-tempered \nEnglishman and  the  tough little  Aussie, became very \ndisenchanted. The  other bikes stayed much the  same, \nalthough the  minimum weights for fours and  twins \nwere now equalised at  162kg which meant the  Ducatis \nhad  to add  7kg. The  Thunderbike series run  at GPs \ndidn’t manage a second season, so  Flammini reacted by \nrunning a  Supersport round outside Europe for the  first \ntime as  part of the  gradual move towards the  objective \nof a  second World Championship series. \nThe  Promotor team again fielded Troy Corser, most \npundits’ pre-season tip for the  title, alongside American \nMike Hale who'd impressed at  Laguna last year, then \nbacked that up with impressive guest rides in the  last \ntwo rounds. Frankie Chili again had  what was alleged \n92 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nto  be  a  private bike, but  he obviously had  the  key to  the \nfactory's back door. \nOver at  Honda Fogarty had  to  come to  terms with \nthe  RC45, a  bike that was still  all  but  impossible to  set \nup  for  bumpy tracks, a  task complicated by wet  winter \ntesting and  the  fact  that the  first  round was at  Misano, \nwhere the  Castrol Honda team had  had  a  nightmare in \n1995. Foggy promptly made it even more difficult by \ncrashing heavily in  qualifying, although he scored useful \npoints in both races. Much attention was focused on \nhow the  relationship with his team-mate Aaron Slight \nwould develop. Fogarty had  not  been charitable about \nSlight in the  past —  he always seemed to  need one \ncompetitor to  focus his efforts on  —  but  they did  a  good \njob of hiding whatever mutual dislike was left. \nFogarty’s early season was dire. He  had  the  worst \nweekend of his career at  Donington, where he simply \ncouldn't get the  bike to work and  felt  he’d let  his  home \nfans down badly. Then his friend and  mechanic Anthony \n‘Slick’ Bass was sacked from the  Honda team on  the \nMonday after racing. Surely things couldn't get worse? \nThey did. \nHis  team-mate Aaron Slight won the  first  race at \nHockenheim with Carl  a distant fifth. New mechanic \nNick Goodison and  Carl decided on a radical move, \njacking the  back end  of the  bike up to throw more \nweight onto the  front wheel. It worked and  Fogarty won \nhis first  race on  an  RC45. It was  also  the  first  time the \nbike had  won both races at a  round. Carl’s spectacular \ndouble at Assen was the  first  time one  rider won both \nraces on  an  RC45. It was also the  point at which Foggy \nannounced he was going back to  Ducati in  1997. He \nreckoned he  had  proved his  point, that he could win  on \na  four-cylinder bike, but  he obviously hadn't found the \nBritish-based Honda team as  homely as  he thought he \nwould. \nAaron Slight made a conscious attempt to  change \nhis  image as  the  nice guy  —  and  we  all  know that nice \nguys come second —  by dyeing his  hair  different colours \nfor every round, and  when he  ran  out  of colour options \nhe went in for  outrageous Mohicans and  a variety of \nsculptured goatee beards. He  was still  a nice guy, and \nhe still  racked up the  points with a  hatful of podium \nplacings, but  he still  only won once. \nThe  Honda was obviously an  improved bike \ncompared to  the  previous year but  it still  had  major \nproblems on  bumpy tracks. You  wouldn't have known it \nat  Sugo, though. The  local Honda men gave the  regulars \nthe  same sort of lesson they used to  get  in Australia in \nthe  early days of the  championship. Yet  another talented \nyoungster, Yuichi Takeda, won the  first race and  Takuma \nAoki romped away with the  second race and into  the \nRepsol Honda Grand Prix  team. It was obviously possible \nto  get the  RC45 to  both go fast  and handle on  tight \ntracks. \nYamaha and Kawasaki were again reduced to  the \nrole  of bit-part players. Muzzy Kawasaki backed up the \nprecocious Anthony Gobert with Simon Crafar, the  New \nZealander at  last  getting the  works bike his talent and \ndedication deserved, but  the  bike was still  obviously"

The  season started \nwith Gobert giving an  astonishing display of machine \ncontrol as  he slid  his way around Misano to  beat John \nKocinksi in  Race 2, only to  have the  victory taken away \nfor a technical infringement. A carburettor part had \nbeen modified, which is illegal. The  team said it was \npart of the  inlet tract not  the  carb and the  modification \nwas therefore legitimate, but  the  FIM  didn’t agree. \nGobert didn’t win  again until Laguna Seca, when an \nelectrical fault made Kocinski’s Ducati run  rich  and  run \nout  of fuel  on  the  last  lap. After he  broke his collarbone \nin qualifying for  Indonesia in August he didn’t appear \nagain until the  final round in Australia at the  end  of \nOctober, prompting dissatisfied mutterings from his \nteam and  fuelling rumours of a  move to  500 GPs  which \nwould be  proved correct. \nYamaha draughted in  Wataru Yoshikawa alongside | \nColin Edwards to  replace the  late, lamented Nagai and \nslimmed the  team’s structure down. Christian Sarron \nwas no  longer in charge, leaving Davide Brivio to front \nthe  team. Along with Dunlop tyres being back to  normal \noperating level, this  helped the  team to  threaten the  top \nmen everywhere and score a lot  of points —  Yoshikawa \neven set  a  new lap record at  Laguna Seca —  but  never \nquite manage to win. Edwards was as  personable as \never and smiled for the  cameras but  in  private he was \ngetting very frustrated with seconds and  thirds. \nOver at  Ducati Virginio Ferrari was getting more than \nfrustrated with his  star rider's behaviour, and by Sugo \nhe and Kocinksi weren’t communicating at  all  but  were \ncomplaining about each other to  anyone who'd listen. \nThankfully for  Ducati, the  Promotor team were In \nbetter shape and  Troy Corser was riding superbly. Not \nthat you  could always tell  from his  smooth, unhurried, \nalmost classical style. When he was a  youngster his  dad \nhad  worried about it, saying he  looked like  he was out \nfor  a  Sunday ride not  a  race. His  mum pointed out  that \nTop: Fogarty stalks Corser \nand  Chili at  Monza. \nLeft: Enigmatic? Difficult? \nContradictory? Probably. A \nbrilliant rider? Definitely. \nBelow: Kocinksi tries in vain \nto  bump start his  Ducati \nafter it ran  out  of petrol on \nthe  last  lap of Race 2 at \nLaguna. \nInset: Fogarty took the \nHonda’s first double win at \nAssen.

So  Troy's style \nnged — you needed a  stopwatch to  see  if \neally trying \nonington Park he  really was trying. His  pole- \nime  was under the  absolute lap record set \nby   Kevin Schwantz on  a  500 Suzuki —  a  landmark \nachievement for  a  bike based on  the  916  you  can  buy in \nhe shops. It was one  of Troy's good weekends, when \neverything worked for  him  and  he set  pole, won both \nraces and  set  the  fastest laps. He  did  it at  Donington \nt might have been more but  for  a worrying recurrence \nof the  engine problems that had  dogged him  the \nprevious season at  three consecutive races: Brands, \nSentul and Sugo. As  Kocinski’s bike was conspicuously \nreliable, Alfred Inzinger, Corser’s team owner, started to \nbelieve in conspiracy theories. \nTroy did  have two bits  of luck, though. He  crashed \ntwice at  Hockenheim, both times at the  fast  and \nand he  also doubled at  the  Czech Republic and in  Spain. \nfearsome Ostkurve, and both times he walked away. \nAll  of which meant that Corser never pulled away \nat  the  top  of the  championship until the  last  couple of \nrounds. In Albacete everyone except Troy suffered from \ntyre problems while the  Australian stormed away to  a \nconvincing double and  took a  26-point lead to  the  last \nround at  home in  Australia. \nFour men went to  Phillip Island with a mathematical \nchance of the  title  —  Corser, Slight, Fogarty and Kocinski \n—  although it would have taken an  act  of God for \nanyone except Troy to  win. The  title was settled in  the \nfirst race, the  act  of God happened in  the  second, too \nlate  for the  others. Aaron Slight didn’t care about the \nsums and  lived up to  his  haircut by charging after Corser \nand  the  returning Gobert, who'd dyed his own unruly \nmop of hair red  for the  occasion. Aaron's hope was \nalive until lap 13  when he  lost  the  front end  and  slid \nout  at the  splendidly named Siberia corner. To  the joy \nof the  home crowd Corser cruised round to third place \nand  the  title. At the  start of Race 2 the  flock of seagulls \nthat inhabit Phillip Island failed to  get out  of the  way on \nthe  first  corner and  Corser, who'd made the  holeshot, \nhad  his fairing smashed and his clutch lever broken. \nThe remains splattered all over Colin Edwards, who \ncontinued to  a  blood and  feather smeared third."

Gobert celebrated his  first \ndouble win  by taking his  clothes off  on  the  rostrum. \nAt  24  years old  Troy was Superbike’s youngest World \nChampion and the  first Australian to  take the  crown. \nAs  befits one  of the  young lions, he  looked on  the \nSuperbike title as  another step on  the  career ladder \ntowards his  objective of a  500 GP  title. The plan was \nthat the  whole Promotor team would move into the  GPs \nwith works Yamahas and Luca Cadalora as  lead rider \nalongside Troy.

It Is \na  mystery quite why the  Lucky Strike Suzuki GP  team \nwanted to  get  rid  of the  rider who had kept their team \ncredible in the  absence of their chosen number one \nand had  got an  increasingly uncompetitive bike on  the \nrostrum twice in  his  first full  year. It resulted in  a man \nreckoned to  be a  potential GP  winner being welcomed \nback to  Superbike not  just  by his  new Yamaha team, \nbut  by the  fans. Russell had  always had  their respect, \nnow they actually liked him  too. The  American is  a \ncomplex man who has  coped with a  great deal of pain | \nin his  personal life,  but  he  now came across as  a  more \nsympathetic person whose brave and undervalued \nperformances in  500 GPs proved to  anyone who ever \ndoubted it that a good Superbike rider could also be a \ngood 500 rider. \nlf Russell was the  good American, John Kocinsk\\ \nswiftly became the  baddie in  the  black hat. He  couldn't \nget away from Ducati quickly enough and finally got  his \nwish, a  Honda ride. Fogarty happily returned to  the  laid- \nback family atmosphere of the  Ducati team: no  more \ntwo-hour debriefing meetings after qualifying to  decide \non  suspension settings. \nThere were big changes at  Suzuki and Kawasaki. \nBoth John Reynolds and Kirk McCarthy went back to \ntheir own domestic championships with sighs of relief to \nbe  replaced at  Suzuki by James Whitham and Mike Hale \nSince Whitham had left  World Superbike he’d been \ndiagnosed with, and cured of, cancer of the  lymphatic \nsystem and made a  successful comeback in  the  British \nChampionship. As  cheerful as  ever, he  was now even \nmore philosophical about racing. ‘I’m looking forward to \ngoing back to  hospital with something nice and simple \n—  like  a  broken leg.’ \nKawasaki parted company with Rob Muzzy’s \norganisation and replaced it with the  German set-up \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 101"

The approach \ncame from Kawasaki Germany, but  Eckl took his time to \nmake his  mind up.  He  had  no  experience of four-strokes, \nhaving been a  250 GP  rider, but  he  saw the  opportunity \nas  a  good one  for  himself and  his staff. Simon Crafar \nkept his  ride and Japan sent over the  relatively unknown \nAkira Yanagawa. He'd been the  fastest Kawasaki \nqualifier at Sugo in  1996 but  had never been a  Japanese \nChampionship contender so  his  CV  didn’t prepare \nanyone for the  impact he would make. The  pace of \nthe  green bikes was just as  surprising. The team had \nvery few new parts at  pre-season testing but, when it \ncame to  the  first race, the  factory had magicked up  an \nastonishing amount of new power. \nAll  the  other factory-supported riders kept their seats: \nChili with his semi-detached Gattolone Ducati team, \nSlight at  Honda, Edwards at Yamaha and Hodgson at \nDucati. On  the  technical front, the  most significant move \nwas Honda quietly homologating a  new fuel-injection \nsystem with two injectors per  cylinder which added \nmid-range flexibility to  the  outright top  speed the  RC45 \nalready had. \nThe new season opened where the  old  one had \nfinished, on  the  glorious curves of Australia’s Phillip \nIsland circuit, and  revealed several new truths that would \nset  the  pattern for the  season. The  most striking new \naspect of the  grid was  that the  Kawasakis had  found \nnot  just extra speed but  a  new star  in Akira Yanagawa. \nThe  Japanese rider started the weekend as  a  nervous \nnewcomer but  by the  end  of qualifying his  grin was so \nwide that, to  quote the  editor of Australian MotorCycle \nNews, ‘| thought the  bottom of his face was  going \nto fall  off.’ He  qualified second, scored a  solid fourth \nin the  first very wet race and  then ran  with the  front \ngroup until getting nudged off  line  by a  backmarker and \nrunning out  of road in Race 2. \nIf Kawasaki had  leapt forward over the  winter, the \nreverse was true of Suzuki. Not  only were their bikes \nslower than the  previous year, the  works team was \nsoundly beaten by the  local importer’s team as  well. ‘| \ncould have kicked my  hat  round faster,’ said Whitham. \nTeam-manager Lester Harris was realistic: ‘It was a \ndisaster.’ Honda had  a good day. Kocinksi won the  first \nrace in the  wet  and  Slight the  second in the  dry,  out- \ndragging Edwards to the  line. The  American came out  of \nthe  last  corner in the  lead with his front wheel in  the  air \nand  the  rear  tyre  spinning —  he couldn't have done any \nmore —  but  he still  got  beaten. Two things about Honda \nwere now evident: Kocinksi was going to win if it rained, \nand the  team was rapidly curing the  old  problem of how \nto  get all that power to the  ground. \nWhen it rained at  Misano, Kocinski won one race and \ncame second in the  other. Fogarty led  out  of the  last \ncorner at  Monza in  Race 1 but  found himself beaten to \nthe  line  by both Hondas. The  days when the  Ducati 916 \nwas the  power king appeared to  be over. \nFogarty and Slight seemed to  have swapped \ncharacters over the  winter.

Aaron’s tactics now \nmatched the  ever more ferocious haircuts as  he tried to \nshake off  the  tag  as  Superbike’s Randy Mamola —  the \nbest guy never to  win the  title. But  the  king of the \nrostrum-or-straw-bales school of racing was still  Ducati \nveteran Pierfrancesco Chili, now firmly established as \neveryone's favourite. He  ruined his  chances of the  title \nby crashing hard enough in  the  very first race to  put  him \nout  of the  second. He  then won the  first  race of the \nsecond round and  broke down in  Race 2.  In the  UK,  at \nDonington, where the  only more popular Italian was  the \njockey Frankie Dettori, Chili fell  in Race 1, then overtook \nSlight on  the  final bend of Race 2 to finish second. You \ncould hear the  cheer in Bologna. \nThere was the  odd scrap of comfort for  Suzuki and \nYamaha. Jamie Whitham used the  Suzuki's undoubted \npower at  Hockenheim and Monza, the  two fastest \ntracks on  the  calendar, to  get two third places, although \nthe  GSX-R was still  conspicuously unhappy over the \nslower, bumpy circuits like  Laguna Seca and Brands \nHatch. Scott Russell followed up  Edwards's Aussie \nrostrum finish with a fighting third at  Hockenheim and \na second at  Brands Hatch. The  German race was a little \ngem: Scott got away with the  leaders, vital on  the  long \nStraights of Hockenheim, then gleefully outbraked, \nblocked and  otherwise harried the faster bikes, finally \nputting himself in the  right place on  the  right-hander \ninto the  stadium section on  the  last  lap.  In the  second \nrace, Whitham did  much the  same but  it was a  race that \nshould have been won by Neil  Hodgson. He  had  a two- \nsecond lead at  one point but was mugged by Fogarty, \nhis team-mate, on  that same right-hander, with enough \nforce to  rattle him  into  running wide on  the  next \nleft  and losing any  chance of a  rostrum. Fogarty was \ncelebrating on  the  slow-down lap when James came \nalongside him  and  a wonderful pantomime of jabbing \nfingers followed until Foggy realised his friend would be \non  the  rostrum with him. \nHaving ridden the  best race of his Superbike career, \nHodgson then broke a  kneecap in a training accident. It \nwas symptomatic of the  way his  luck had  run  over the \npast couple of years and ruined what was a vital season \nfor the  youngster just as  it looked as  if everything was \ncoming together. \nMonza also saw the  end  of Colin Edwards's Superbike \nseason. He was hit  by fellow Yamaha man Jean-Philippe \nRuggia in  untimed practice with enough force to  break \nthe  American's wrist. After trying to  come back at \nLaguna Seca, Edwards decided to  have everything fixed \nat  once. As well as  the  wrist he would have a collarbone \nreplated and  both sets  of cruciate knee ligaments \nRight: Superbike welcomed _ Inset: Fogarty on  his way \nScott Russell back with open to winning the  first  race in \narms —  he appeared to  be Austria in front of Yanagawa, \nenjoying himself too.

      "text": "repaired so,  not  surprisingly, he  didn’t reappear and \nwas replaced by British young gun  Chris Walker for the \nnext four meetings and  Noriyuki Haga for the  last  two \nrounds. Edwards left  Superbike with some prophetic \nwords: ‘The championship is Fogarty’s to  lose.’ \nKocinksi, meanwhile, was making a stealthy start \nto the season. The  atrocious weather at the  first  two \nrounds undoubtedly helped him  and  he scored two \nwins and  a second in the wet, but  in the  dry he only \nmanaged seventh in the  second race at Australia and \nthen tenth and  fifth at Donington. Things changed at \nthe fast  tracks, though: he was  second in Hockenheim’s \nfirst race but  claims he was bumped by Fogarty on  the \nfirst lap of the  second race and  could only manage 14th. \nKocinski was also living up to  his  reputation for \nbeing difficult. Aaron Slight and  he didn't exchange any \ninformation and  Aaron said publicly that he wouldn't \naccept team orders. The  American also decided that \nhe wouldn't talk  to certain journalists and  avoided \nthe  cameras of some photographers. He  even got the \nHonda team’s PR man to fire off a three-page letter of \ncomplaint to one  American magazine. No  matter what \nquestion he was  asked he would answer by telling you \nhow happy he was  to  be on  a  Honda —  so  often that \nit became a  paddock and  press-room joke. Journalists \nwould go  up to each other and  ask  in mock seriousness: \n‘Did you  know Kocinski was happy to  be on  a  Honda?’ \nIt was also noticeable how close he was to Japanese \nmembers of the  Castrol Honda team. The  rumour mill \nsaid  that Kocinski’s objective was  to get a  ride  in 500 \nGPs  with Honda and  that he had  to win  the  Superbike \ntitle  first, although it seemed more likely that Honda \nwould want to see  the  number-one plate on  the track in \nSuperbike in 1998, the  50th anniversary of the founding \nof the  Honda Motor Company. \nOne thing was certain. The  two men who looked \nlikely to contest the title  now heartily disliked each \nother. Carl Fogarty likes to  have a  hate figure with \nwhich to whet his will  to win. First it was Scott Russell,. \nwho Foggy enjoyed sniping at, then Aaron Slight, but \nthat was all kindergarten stuff compared to the  intense \ndislike he and Kocinski developed for each other. Before \nthe  Brands Hatch round, Kocinski used one  of the \ntabloids to  refer to the  Ducati team as  ‘the  Mafia’, a \nphrase he'd also used about his old  employers in Kenny \nRoberts's Yamaha GP team. Foggy retaliated in another \ntabloid by calling Kocinski ‘a freak of nature’. This was \nnot  the  slapstick of Foggy and  Russell playing to the \ngallery: it was  genuine hostility. \nCarl Fogarty’s very untypical start to the  season —  in \nwhich he seemed to  be happy with points rather than \nwins —  gave way to a crisis of confidence after Kocinski’s \ndouble win  at home in the  USA. At  both Brands Hatch \nand  the  A1-Ring Carl  crashed soon after Kocinski had \ncome past him. In the  UK  he took Simon Crafar down \nwith him, in Austria he punted Kocinski into  a sand trap, \nalthough the American was  able to  rejoin and  finish \nthird. That incident, plus Chili crashing and  taking down \nthe  luckless Crafar (‘if he  had  a duck it’d  sink’ —  Steve \nParrish), gave Yanagawa a clear run  to the  flag and \nhis debut win. The  Japanese rider broke new ground \nby taking his  pet  miniature terrier Mew to the  rostrum \nand  announcing that the  hound liked the  taste of \nchampagne so  he must win  more races. \nThe next round was at Assen, where Fogarty hadn't \nbeen beaten since 1992, surely a vital test  for  his  mental \ntoughness. In the  first  race Kocinski was nothing short \nof awesome. He  made an  appalling start, then swept \nthrough the  field overtaking every other works bike \nas  If it wasn't there and  ghosting past Fogarty on  the \npenultimate lap.  Fogarty fans were relieved to  see  that \nat least he coped with the  sight of Kocinski in front of \nhim. In the  second race Kocinksi made another dreadful \nstart and  could only carve through to third this  time, as \nChili shepherded Foggy home. Assen was a  one-all draw \nbut  Kocinski got another boost when it was announced \nthat Niall Mackenzie was likely to  lose his third place \nfrom Brands Hatch following a fuel  test. As  Kocinksi had \nfinished one place behind the  Scot, that meant an  extra \nthree points if the  FIM  confirmed the  finding. \nAll  of which made the  Spanish round crucial. Fogarty \nhad  done the  double there twice for  Ducati and  said \nthat, with only the  Far  Eastern rounds left, he had  to win \nboth races to stand a chance of the title. Kocinski took \npole as  he had  done at Assen, his first of the  season, \nwith Foggy second, but  ominously for the  British rider \nthe  next Ducati rider was Frankie Chili back in seventh \nand over a second slower. The  writing was on  the  wall. \nAlbacete is a difficult place to  pass except, according \nto  Kocinski, if you’re on  a  Honda. He  delivered this  gem \nto a TV  reporter, but for once there was a ghost of a \nsmile and  a  hint  of irony. He  had  been notably nicer with \nthe  press since Brands Hatch when, according to  one \nAmerican insider, John had  been told by the  men from \nhead office to  lighten up;  but this  was different, the  guy \nwas positively relaxed and  enjoying himself. He  enjoyed \nthe  first race even more when Fogarty crashed out  of \na safe second place. That, said Carl, was  what you  got \nfor  riding a  bike  over its limits, before adding that  the \ntitle  was now gone. While the  Honda team hadn't just \nkept Kocinski happy but  developed the  RC45 into  the \nbest bike out  there, the  Ducati team appeared to  have \nstood still. Chili was the  first Ducati home in fifth. In the \nsecond race a wayward Gregorio Lavilla punted Foggy \ninto  the  sandpit on  the  second corner; Carl  got  back on \nthe track dead last  and  was  up to  ninth when he again \nlost the  front end. The  first  Ducati? Chili again, this time \nin seventh. \nKocinski, now with a  55-point lead, lost  no  time \nrubbing salt  into  his old  team's wounds. ‘The next race \nis in Japan, | think Ducati'’ll feel  far from home.’ He  was \nright. No  Ducati rider made the  rostrum, and Foggy \nfell  again. Kocinski’s third place in the  second race was \nenough. He  became the  first rider to win  both a  Grand \nPrix  and  a Superbike World Championship. He was \nobviously very happy to  be on  a  Honda. However, two \nvery risky manoeuvres in Indonesia lost  him a lot of the \nBrownie points he  had  gained with Honda over the \nseason. It looked like  the  leopard had  not  changed his \nspots after all. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 107 \nLeft: Noriyuki Haga \nwon at  Sugo and  saved \nYamaha's face. \nInset right: James \nWhitham gave it a \nhundred per  cent, as \nusual, on  the  recalcitrant \nSuzuki. \nInset left: At the  Al-Ring \nAkira Yanagawa became \nthe  first  Japanese rider \nto win  a  round of the \nchampionship outside \nJapan. \nA"

He  departed for  GPs without a  backward \nglance, leaving behind him  a  motorcycle that was now \nprobably the  best package out  there. Aaron Slight \ncontinued with Castrol Honda but  at  last  had  a  team- \nmate with whom he could get  on  —  Colin Edwards \nThe  young American had  abandoned the  allegedly \nuncompetitive Yamaha without a  win to  his  name, but \nno-one doubted that he was a  winner \nThere was also the  small matter of  1998 being the \n50th anniversary of the  Honda Motor Company.

As  Carl \nFogarty had  found on  his  return to  the  Bologna team in \n1997, the  996 Ducati was very different from the  955 \nhe’d left  behind in  ‘95,  and  the  bike still  wasn’t to  his \nliking when the  season got  under way. There was also \na  lot  of politics to  contend with. Ducati had contracte \nthree riders —  Foggy, Frankie Chili and Troy Corser, \nreturning to  Superbike after an  abortive year in  GPs \nThey solved this  embarrassment of  r \ntwo works teams.

By  mid-season Ducati’s \nAmerican owners had decided that there would be \nonly one works team in  1999, and that it  would have \nonly two riders, which cranked inter-team tens \nanother notch.

And they didn’t suffer the  sort  of \nhumiliation at  the  hands of importer teams that had  so \nembarrassed them at  Phillip Island in  1997 when Troy \nBayliss outperformed the  works team by a  distance. \nAussie Peter Goddard replaced Mike Hale in the \nWorld Superbike team, bringing with him  a wealth of \nexperience, not  least in bike development. The fact that \nhe’d won the  Australian Superbike Championship and \nthe  World Endurance Championship on  GSX-Rs didn’t \nhurt either. James Whitham, who'd scored Suzuki's \nonly rostrums the  previous year, retained his  place. For \nthe  first half  of the  season Goddard outperformed his \nteam-mate, but  Whitham came on  strong in the  second \nhalf. The highlight was his  race-long pursuit of Fogarty \nat  Brands Hatch in front of 82,000 people, which ended \nwith James setting a  new lap record on  his way to  third \nplace, Suzuki's only rostrum of the  year. \nThe  four-cylinder bike everyone thought would do \nthe  business was the  Kawasaki. Akira Yanagawa was \nmany people’s tip for a  hatful of race wins and  a shot \nat the  title, and  surely Neil Hodgson would at  last  live \nup to  his  potential on  a bike he  immediately seemed at \nhome on.  But  the  Green challenge never materialised. \nThe  team's 1998-spec motors blew up  in their final pre- \nseason tests, Yanagawa struggled in  Round 1 at  Phillip \nIsland, where he'd been a contender in ‘97,  and  it took \nthem half  a season to  regain their momentum. Akira \nwas competitive in  Round 7 at  Kyalami, however, setting \nthe  fastest lap of the  second race. \nThen came Laguna Seca. Yanagawa and Doug \nChandler —  still  fast, still  wearing green —  trailed a \nrunaway Troy Corser, with the  American closing fast \non  the  Japanese. Going into  the  Corkscrew something \nhappened on  Doug's bike —  probably a  clip-on broke \n—  and he fell  under braking. The bike slid  straight on \nand scooped up  Akira as  he arrived at the  apex. It was \na  horrible-looking crash, a  cartwheeling blur of dust, \nmen and machines, with Yanagawa doing a sickening \nimpersonation of a  rag  doll  before ending up crumpled \nand  motionless on  the  far side  of the  track. His  team- \nmate Neil  Hodgson was one  of the  first  to stop and \nstood waving on  the  track, trying to  get the  authorities \nto  put the  red  flag out. The race was restarted, but \nan  equally horrible start-line pile-up that badly injured \nBontempi and  —  crucially —  Slight meant another red \nflag, and  the  result was  taken from the  lap before the \nChandler/Yanagawa crash. With cruel irony, that gave \nthe  lower two rostrum places to the  Kawasaki riders (the \nfirst  Green rostrums of the  year) while they were both \non  their way to  hospital. \nThe  four-cylinder team that wasn’t supposed to  do \nwell was Yamaha, yet they confounded all expectations \nthanks to  the  arrival of a  new star  —  no,  make that \nsuperstar —  Noriyuki Haga. Nori-chan (he prefers the \ninformal mode of address usually used for children \nrather than the  customary Haga-san) had  saved much"

It wasn’t just  Yamaha's \nonly win  in  Superbike, it was the  factory's only win  in \nany  World Championship road-racing class that year, \nincluding all  three GP  formulae and  World Endurance. \nFrankly, no-one expected anything more this  season, but \nNoriyuki astonished the  world by leaving the  first round \nlevel on  points with Fogarty at  the  top  of the  table, with \na third place and a win. \nBetween the  first  two Superbike rounds he took \ntime out  to  debut on  a  500 as  a wild-card entry in  the \nJapanese GP.  With apparent ease he  ran  with the  top \nmen and ended up  third —  and it should have been \nsecond, but  for the  vastly experienced Tady Okada \nmugging him  at the  chicane last  time round. Jaws \ndropped in  both Superbike and GP  paddocks. When \nHaga went to  Donington (for the  first  time, don’t \nforget), won both races and  stormed to  the  top  of the \ntable, chins hit the  floor Tom and  Jerry style. \nThe  flip side to the  instant deification of Haga was \nthe  descent into personal hell  for  Scott Russell. He’d put \na  price on  his  return to  the  team —  a  switch to  Michelin \ntyres. Uniquely, the  team let  him change to  the  French \nrubber, but  Haga stayed with Dunlop. The  sight of the \nnew boy comprehensively outperforming him  on  the \ntyres he'd rejected cannot have been comfortable for \nthe  ex-champ. There followed a succession of mystery \nretirements and  lacklustre races. The  nadir came at \nLaguna Seca, where Scott led  the  second race after the \nmost blatant of jump-starts only to  crash half-way round \nthe  first lap.  He  arrived back at the  Yamaha pit grinning \nsheepishly where he was pointedly ignored by his crew. \nThe  sight of a  great champion in decline wasn't made \nany  more palatable by the  fact that he’d started the  year \nwinning a  record fifth Daytona 200. \nThe major innovation for  1998 was Superpole, an \nidea lifted from the  Suzuka 8 Hours and  some American \nfour-wheeled racing in an  attempt to  spice up  qualifying \nfor the  TV  cameras. In Superpole, the  top  16 from \nregular qualifying go forward to  do  one  flying lap that \ndecides their grid position; one mistake, and  that fastest \ntime in regular qualifying mutates into  the  fourth row \nof the  grid. Not  surprisingly, the  riders were unanimous \nin disliking the  system intensely. Even Troy Corser, by \nfar the  best qualifier of the  year, said on  every possible \noccasion how much he disliked the  concept. \nThe trouble with Superpole is that it’s  fine until \nthe  weather refuses to  co-operate, as  at  Donington, \nAlbacete and Assen. British wild card James Haydon \nbecame the  first man to  crash in Superpole when he \nfell  on  his out-lap at  Donington. He’d been kept waiting \nfor over 30  seconds in  near-freezing conditions and his \ntyre had  cooled off so  much —  probably by 30°  —  that he \nknew he was in  trouble as  soon as  he  left  the  pit lane. \nThe riders’ insistence that Superpole might endanger \ntheir safety seemed to  have some basis in  truth, but  it \nwas the  farce at Albacete that was really embarrassing. \nRain half-way through Superpole saw the  top  16 split \ninto two groups, with the  result that the  top  eight \nwere slower than the  second eight.

And that’s the \nnub  of  the  matter. Superpole was designed for TV,  yet \nthere’s nothing visually exciting about one bike going \nround a  track on  its  own, no  matter how fast it’s  doing \nt.  Superpole can  seem exciting when the  hour-long \nprocess is  edited down to  a  five-minute highlights \npackage, but  live  it’s  right up  there with watching paint \ndry.  Thankfully the  wet-weather rules were changed \nafter Albacete to  a  system almost identical to that \nused by Formula 1 —  that is,  a 50-minute final session \nfor the  fastest 16 from regular qualifying, which, like \ndry Superpole, discounts all that has  gone before. \nt was used twice and both times provided brilliant \nentertainment in totally different ways. Let’s face it, \nf the  F1  cars use  this  system it must be TV-friendly; \nBernie’s boys don't arrive at their procedures by chance. \nOver the  20-year history of the  championship, the \ntwo perennial complaints have been the  disjointed \ncalendar and the  quality of the  supporting races. This \nseason started out  with two races a  month from March \nthrough to  October, with one race in  both April and \nSeptember. It was the  best-planned schedule yet, but \nthe  collapse of the  Tiger Economies of the  Pacific Basin \nsaw the  opening round in  Indonesia and  the  final round \nin  Malaysia cancelled. The  result was a  month of waiting \nbetween the  penultimate round at  Assen and  the  finale \nin  Sugo. Not  ideal, but  on  this  occasion unavoidable. To \nno-one’s surprise, the  Brazilian round was also cancelled, \nbut  this  cloud had a silver lining: Superbike became the \nfirst motorsport World Championship to  return to  South \nAfrica after the  fall  of apartheid and  the  election of \nNelson Mandela. \nThe Supersport World Series that supported \nthe  Superbikes was supposed to  receive full  World \nChampionship status, and even though it didn’t get that \npromotion the  class went a  long way towards answering \ncriticisms of the  support classes. Works teams from \nDucati, Suzuki, Honda and  Yamaha gave the  class real \nstrength in  depth, and  the  fans full  value for  money. \nTragically, the  class lost  its finest exponent when Michael \nPaquay died at  Monza after a  qualifying accident. The \nBelgian had  been European Supersport Champion in \n1993 on  a  Honda, and  again in  ‘95  on  a  Ducati, and \nwas leading the  Castrol Honda team as  they prepared \nfor the World Championship due in  1999. As  well as \nbeing a  superb rider —  the  best yet  produced by the  class \n—  he was also a thoroughly decent person. \nNoriyuki Haga’s impact on  Superbike was immediate \nand  impressive, but  two big crashes in qualifying for \nRound 3 at  Monza slowed him  down. He  had  to  be \ncarried to  his  bike, but  still  managed to  race and scored \nenough points to  keep the  championship lead. Monza, \nthough, was really noticeable for the  maiden victory of \nColin Edwards. It had been a while coming, and when \nhe  backed it up  in  Race 2 to  score a  double we  were"

In all  his years in  World Superbike Aaron Slight \nhad  never scored a  double win, something that really \nbugged him. The sight of his  new team-mate heading \nfor the  double caused Aaron to  over-rev the  RC45 \nfor  longer than the  prescribed ten  seconds riders are \nallowed to  use  in  emergencies. The  result was a very big \nbang indeed. \nHappily Aaron didn't have to  wait long to  score his \nown double, and  the  fact  that it came at  Misano made \nit doubly sweet. The  Italian track has  historically been \nDucati country —  the  only non-Ducati win had  been John \nKocinksi’s, in  his  championship year in  1997 —  but  most \nteam personnel remembered 1995 when the  Castrol \nHonda team suffered its  most humiliating weekend \nas  Aaron struggled to  16th and 13th places. Aaron's \ndouble was proof positive that the  RC45 was now the \nbest all-round package on  the  grid. Revenge, the  Italian \nsaying goes, is a  dish best eaten cold. \nFrankie Chili also got  his first-ever double at the  new \nKyalami venue in South Africa, and  to the  amazement \nof many it was in the  dry! This was also the  race where \nGregorio Lavilla backed up  his wet-weather third place \nat  home in Spain by taking third place in the  dry,  in \nRace 1, and proved he was a cut  above the  rest  of \nthe  privateers. The  fact  that he was also Spanish was \npolitically useful. \nWell into  the  season four men had  pulled away from \nthe  field. The usual suspects —  Slight, Fogarty and  Corser \n—  were there, but  surprisingly so  was Frankie Chill. Three \nof them had  had  bad  meetings —  Fogarty in the  wet  in \nGermany, Chili at  home in Misano, and  Slight at  Laguna \nSeca, where the  injury he  picked up  threatened to  put \nhim  out  of Brands Hatch as  well —  while Corser plugged \naway, and  although he didn’t win  a  lot  he always \nseemed to  be on  the  rostrum. Not  that his achievements \nshould be  underestimated; after all,  he’d hardly sat  on  a \nbike all through 1997. He  did  win  two races, but  more \noften faded in mid-race only to  push hard at  the  end, - \ngiving rise  to  serious doubts about his  level of fitness. \nFit or  not, Troy led  the  championship going into \nthe  penultimate round in  Holland, but  only by the  slim \nmargin of  1.5  points from Slight, with Foggy 17.5 points \nfurther back and  Franki Chili still  in  touch another \n13  points in arrears. The  scene was now set  for the \nBattle of Assen. \nThe  first  shock came in Race 1 after the  three Ducati \nmen broke away from Slight. First Troy drifted off the \npace of the  other two. Chili was faster on  the  back of \nthe  circuit but  Foggy seemed to  be able to  retake first at \nwill  at the  chicane. Clearly it was going to  come down \nto the  last  lap, or  even the  last  corner. Sure enough, Chill \nshadowed Carl into the  last  lap and took him  on  the \nsweeping turns behind the  paddock. Carl shaped to  pass \nat the  chicane but  made a slight mistake and  couldn't \nget through. Afterwards, Foggy did  a  passable imitation \nof Mick Doohan moaning about acting as  a  tow-truck \nfor  riders who couldn't get  round on  their own. It was \nmerely a  warm-up for what was to  come. \nRace 2 was a  replay of Race 1, and  again it looked as \n_ a \n— ee ee \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 115"

The Italian was hustled away \nand  everyone assumed that was the  end of events, but \nhalf  an  hour later Frankie, wearing a  blue towelling \ndressing-gown, invaded the  winner's press conference \nand  accused Foggy of dangerous riding in  the  fast \ncorners and said he fell  because he was so  angry.

With the  number-one plate on  his  Ducati, he \ntook a  double win in the  first round and  was never \nheaded in the  points table in either year. If anything, this \ntitle  was even more impressive than those that had  gone \nbefore, but  if you  think that  would make the  season, \nwell, boring, think again. Superbike got a full  quota of \nworks teams with the  arrival of Aprilia to join the  big \nfour Japanese factories and Ducati and, like  their fellow- \ncountrymen, the  Noale company opted for a V-twin. \nAdmittedly, this  was a development year for the  team, \nwith just one regular rider —  the  veteran Aussie Peter \nGoddard —  with the  occasional help of factory test  rider \nAntonello, but  no  other two-wheeled motorsport could \nboast the  official involvement of six factories. Crowds \nwere also up —  massively in the  case of both Italian \nraces and  the  USA. The  average increase was 30  per \ncent, with an  astonishing 41  per  cent being the  biggest \nimprovement. \nThe  old  problem of the  supporting races was well \nand truly solved with World Championship status for \nthe  Supersport class and European Championship for \nthe  new Superstock class for  under-24s only. British \nfans were also pleased to see  that the  sidecars soldiered \non,  with the  evergreen Steve Webster MBE at  the  front \nagain. There were lots  of new motorbikes, too. As  well \nas  the  new-from-the-ground-up Aprilia, there was \nYamaha's R7  in Superbike and  the  equally new R6  in \nSupersport. But  yet again it was the  Honda RC45 that \nstarted the  season as  favourite. Now Colin Edwards had \na  season on  the  V4  under his  belt he would surely give \nteam-mate Aaron Slight the  hurry-up to  the  benefit of \nthe  whole team.

      "text": "management struggle from 1998 was well and  truly \nwon by Davide Tardozzi, leaving a  disgruntled Virginio \nFerrari on  the  sidelines conferring with his  lawyers. \nTroy Corser stayed in the  team and  was reunited with \nTardozzi, who had  taken the  Aussie to  his title  as \nmanager of the  Power Horse Ducati team in  1996. \nFrankie Chili, the  man who made way for  Foggy at \nDucati Corse, signed for the  Suzuki team under its new \nmanagement by Francis Batta’s Alstare organisation and \nwith high-profile sponsorship from Corona, the  Mexican \nbeer company. Japan insisted that Katsuaki Fujiwara \nbe the  second rider. Things did  not  look good at the \nstart of the  year. A despondent Frankie was  33  seconds \nbehind the  winner in Round 1, but  hard work with his \nDunlop tyre  technicians reaped dividends, starting with \na  morale-boosting Superpole at  Round 3.  By Round 5 at \nMonza he was able to finish under a  second behind the \nwinner, then win in the  rain in Austria —  Suzuki's first- \never World Superbike victory outside Japan —  and  finally \nwin  a dry race in Germany. \nThat German win may have come after Foggy had \nwrapped up  his title, but the  battle with Carl and  Aaron \nSlight on  the  last  lap was as  fine  a piece of racecraft as \nyou  could hope to see. Unfortunately, Fujiwara was no \nhelp to Chili, despite being good enough to  get on  the \nrostrum at Sugo when he was a Japanese Championship \nrider and  was thought to  be a  prospect for the  Grand \nPrix  team. But  after the first-corner crash he instituted in \nthe  1998 Catalan GP,  Superbike was meant to  be akin \nto  rehabilitation. At least he stopped crashing, but  in ‘99 \nhe appeared to take more trouble over his haircut and \nclothes than his  racing and  looked like  he was  enjoying \nhimself too  much, given the  paucity of his  results. What \ncould Chili have done with more solid back-up from his \nteam-mate? Nevertheless, Frankie's heroics endeared \nhim  not just to the  team but  also  to the fans, not  least \nthe  Brits, who'd taken no  time at all in forgiving him  for \nhis attacks on  Foggy at Assen the  previous year. \nNeil  Hodgson’s place in the  Kawasaki team was taken \nby Gregorio Lavilla, who had  impressed everyone with \nhis form on  a  private Ducati in  1998. Unfortunately, the \nswitch to  Dunlops didn’t suit  him  and he  had a rash of \ncrashes in the  second and  third rounds that severely \ndented his confidence. Akira Yanagawa continued \nas  the  number one at Team Green, managing two \nsecond places in Spain before he started crashing. It \nwas  debatable whether he was  fit to  race in Austria \nand Holland but  race he did,  and  then got  back on \nthe  rostrum at  Hockenheim where his  bike was at a \ndefinite disadvantage. When he won the  last  race of \nthe  year everyone in the  paddock smiled. However, the \nKawasaki was now the  last  carburetted, as  opposed \nto fuel-injected, bike in  the  paddock and  looked to \nbe struggling against the  V-twins and  even the  newer \nSuzuki and  Yamaha fours. \nThe  other new boy on  a works bike, Vitto Guareschi, \nalso struggled early on  as  Haga’s team-mate on  the  new \nR7,  although he was rewarded with a  rostrum finish in \nthat wet  Austrian race behind Fogarty.

Typically he came out  with \nall guns blazing at  Kyalami and  put the  R7  on  the  front \nrow, rode the  wheels off  it to finish fourth in the  first \nrace, and  then crashed it at the  chicane in  Race 2. When \nhe  got  onto the  rostrum it was as  the  victor in Race 1 \nat Albacete —  this  time he blew it up  in  Race 2!  His  only \nother visit  to the  podium was at  Brands Hatch, his  least \nfavourite circuit. Nori-chan never ceased to  amaze all \nseason, although it was plain that he sometimes grew \nweary of fighting against the  odds and  sometimes didn’t \nshow among the  leaders all weekend. \nSo  it was left  to  the  usual suspects —  Slight, Corser \nand  Edwards —  to  battle Foggy for the  title, with the \n124 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nwo ws \nother factory riders getting the  occasional rostrum but \nnever truly being in  the  hunt for the  crown. Yet,  just  as \nin  1995, each of the  pretenders to  the  throne suffered \ninjury or  misfortune, real  or  imagined, that held them \nback. Edwards started the  season with torn shoulder \nmuscles from a testing accident at  Laguna Seca barely \ntwo weeks before the  first  round in  South Africa; he \nthen had  his  machine fail  in Spain when he  looked \na  good bet  for the  win in  Race 1.  His  tendency to \ndisappear from view at  some tracks was less  noticeable \nbut  still  afflicted him  at  a couple of places, noticeably \nLaguna Seca. \nTroy Corser suffered a  similar shoulder injury in \nSuperpole warm-up at Albacete, but  it was his  ever \nmore pronounced tendency to  fade in  the  middle of a \nrace that worried observers most. Give him  a sniff of \nthe  rostrum, though, or  specifically the  top  step of it, \nand  he was his  old  self. A scintillating double at  home \nin  Phillip Island reminded us  just why Troy had  won a \nWorld Championship, and  when Foggy fell  from the \nlead of Race 2 in  the  first German round a previously \ndisinterested Corser awoke to  put  a  stunning move on \nSlight and  take the  win. Ducati were not  happy and  told \nTroy so  —  this  despite the  fact that he was second overall \nafter every race of the  year bar  two. Unfortunately \nfor the  Aussie one of the  two was the  final round, \nsomething the  bosses in  Bologna didn’t appreciate. \nThe  falling out  between the  two Castrol Honda \nriders happened at  Donington Park when they came \ntogether on  the  exit  of the  Melbourne Loop, after Slight \noutbraked Edwards and Chili but  got  in  the  corner too \nhot. He  ran  wide on  the  exit  and Edwards cut  back \nunderneath him, they touched, and Slight went down. \nMost observers saw it as  a  racing incident but  the \nKiwi was on  his  feet and gesturing at  the  disappearing \nAmerican in  a manner that made it clear that he  saw \nit very differently.

Slight tucked in  behind his team-mate, but \nin  trying to  run  at  Colin's pace fell  at  Coppice and \ncompounded the  damage to  his  right little finger \nfrom the  first crash. When Edwards went to  Slight’s \nmotorhome afterwards to  check on  his  team-mate’s \nhealth he  quickly found he wasn’t welcome. ‘The only \nreason anyone's interested’, said a  puzzled Edwards, ‘is \nbecause we're on  the  same make of bike.’ \nAaron never really returned to  his  old  form, spending \nmuch of the  middle of the  season complaining of \nobscure problems with his  machinery. Little did  anyone \nknow that we  were seeing the  evidence of a  medical \ncondition that would threaten his  life. \nColin also got  to  play a  supporting role in  what was \ndefinitely the  race of the  year, and  a  strong candidate \nfor the  race of any  year. It happened at  Monza. Both \nraces came down to  three-man dices for the  rostrum \nbetween Edwards, Foggy and  Chili, although it was \nobvious that the  Italian's Suzuki could stay in  the \nSlipstream of the  twins but  couldn't pass.

Italian magazine Moto \nSprint’s race report called Foggy ‘a force of nature’ and \n‘the perfect racer’. After those two races, it didn’t seem \nlike  hyperbole. \nEdwards was also central to another major drama, \nthis  time at the  Nurburgring in Germany. The meeting \nstarted under the  pall of a  personal tragedy for  Car! \nFogarty after the  two-year-old daughter of close friends \nhad  a fatal accident at  Fogarty’s home nine days before \nthe  meeting. Little Hannah Walsh's parents told Carl to \nwin  for  her.  He  did, pointing to the  sky and  collapsing \nover the  tank after taking the  chequered flag  in Race \n1.  ‘| had  to win  that at  all costs,’ said a sombre Carl. \n‘There’s a little girl who isn’t with us  any  more. Her  dad \ntold me  to win it.’ There was no  champagne on  the \nrostrum. \nThe  race had  provided drama of a  different type, and \nit was only by luck that another tragedy was avoided. \nIt started with Igor Jerman’s Kawasaki blowing up  on \nthe  run  to  Turn 1.  It was a  comprehensive bit of self- \ndestruction; coolant and oil were literally flowing out \nof the  belly-pan as  the  Slovenian pulled off  the  track. \nAstoundingly the  marshals did  not  display the  oil  flag  or \neven the  yellow flag. \nLeader Fogarty went through okay but  Yanagawa \nwent down, still  without bringing out  the  flags. Next \ntime round Haga lost  it on  the  oil,  saved the  crash, but \nran  across the  gravel for  100  yards before toppling off \nthe  Yamaha. Still  no  flags, despite the  crowd shouting \nat  the  marshals. Team-managers were going berserk in \nthe  pit  lane, with Tardozzi leading the  charge to  Race \nControl. Then Chili fell,  still  without the  flags coming \n126 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nout, and  headed straight for  Race Control, where he \nthreatened to  sue  everyone in sight for  loss  of earnings. \nTardozzi was screaming for the  race to  be stopped, \ndespite his  riders leading. Then Colin Edwards fell. \nUnlike the  more stoical Japanese and the  litigious \nChili, Edwards leapt to  his feet in  a  rage, waved his \narms, flung gravel on  to  the  track and  yelled at  the \nmarshals. He’d assumed the  spill had been cleared \nup  and  was livid. The marshals did  reluctantly put the \nflags out  now, in response to the  crowd rather than \nanything happening in front of their eyes. Edwards's \nanger didn’t subside and  for a few  weeks he  lost  faith \nin the  championship and its organisers. It wasn’t just the \nloss  of a  rostrum finish: there were echoes of the  crash \nthat had  fatally injured his team-mate Nagai-san back in \n1995, and  although Colin never mentioned it in  public \nhis  racing lost  its  edge for some weeks. \nThe  second race also looked to  be going Foggy’s \nway until he fell  as  his concentration understandably \nwavered. But  how many World Champions would have \ndone what he did  next? He  kicked the  bike straight, \nrejoined the  race and  just  snatched the  final available \npoint for  15th place.

Even his  post-race interview was a \npolished performance. \nNo-one took enough notice of Gobert's Vance & \nHines team-mate who finished second —  reigning AMA \nSuperbike Champion Ben Bostrom. When Gobert \ncrashed under pressure from Chili in  Race 2, Bostrom \nupheld local honour by taking the  victory. Amazingly, it \nwas his  first win on  a  Superbike. Consistency had  given \nhim  the  American title, not  race wins. As  a  Californian, \nBen looked and talked the  part with his  Evel Knievel \ncrash-helmet design, designer facial hair  and large \ncollection of classic American motors. His  riding was \neye-catching too, featuring a  wildly snaking entry to  the \nfinal turn. This man was obviously cool enough to  be the \nnext Scott Russell. \nThe end of the  season was a carnival for  British \nbike fans. First, over 120,000 of them turned up for \nthe  European round at  Brands Hatch and Carl Fogarty \npromptly had his worst weekend of the  year with a  non- \nscoring ride in  Race 1, thanks to  a  chunking tyre, and \njust a fourth place in  Race 2.  Carl felt  he’d let everyone \ndown and  asked them to  come to  Assen, where he'd do \nthe  double for them. Instead of their hero dominating at \nBrands as  he  had in  ‘95, the  massed ranks saw Castrol \nHonda finish one-two in both races, the  first  time the \nteam had  achieved that feat, and  they got  to  cheer \nheroic third places from Chili and Haga —  who hates the \nKent track. \nA wet weekend in  Austria saw Chili notch up  Suzuki's \nfirst-ever win outside Japan, the  first for  Suzuki under \nAlstare management, and his  own first  on  a  four- \ncylinder bike. Then came Assen —  and it turned into \nBritish bike racing's best day out  since Foggy’s Brands \ndouble of  ‘95. At  the  most conservative estimate \nthere were over 30,000 British fans in  the stands, and \namazingly they saw not  just the  double that Foggy had \npromised them at  Brands —  which almost assured him \nof  his  fourth title —  but  British winners in  every support \nrace. lain  MacPherson won the Supersport race, Karl \nHarris was victorious in  Superstock and the  evergreen \nSteve Webster won the  sidecars \nFogarty's growing understanding with Davide \nTardozzi and the  team gave him faith in  his  own \njudgement on  machine set-up, never previously Carl’s \nstrong point.

He  described Tardozzi as  Carl's ‘gift \nfrom God’ \nFoggy himself was sure he  was riding better than \never —  including his  runaway 1995 World Championship \nseason.

      "text": "Previous spread: The  three \nmain players at the  start \nof the  millennial season: \nEdwards, Haga and Fogarty. \nAbove: Fogarty was already \ncarrying an  injury at the  first \nrace of the  year at  Kyalami. \nRight: Colin Edwards at \nhome in  Laguna Seca. \n132 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nBelow: Colin Edwards \nand  Aaron Slight got to \nride Honda’s all-new \nSP-1 V-twin. \nto  any  firm conclusions. Just  before the  season started \nhis  condition deteriorated suddenly and he went for \na  brain scan in  Australia. On  the  way there his wife \nMegan ventured to  suggest ‘| hope they don’t find \nanything’; Aaron's reply, minus the  expletives, was a \nvehement ‘I hope they do.’  They did. A congenitally \nweak blood vessel had bled and could have catastrophic \nconsequences. At  least it explained the  problems he’d \nbeen having, but  it was obviously serious. He  was \noperated on  immediately. No-one knew when he'd be \nback on  a  bike; in fact nobody knew if he’d ever be \nback. But  exactly twelve weeks later he was on  the  grid \nat  Donington Park and  scored two top-ten finishes. \nTough, these Kiwis. \nThe  enforced absences of Slight and Fogarty meant \nthe  field had  an  odd look for  much of the  year. The \nimmediate consequence of Fogarty’s crash was a  game \nof musical saddles involving Ducati teams everywhere. \nTroy Bayliss, the  Aussie who was reigning British \nChampion, was riding for Vance & Hines in the  AMA \nChampionship and was drafted in for  Round 3 at  Sugo, \nonly to  be  knocked off  his  bike on  the  first lap of both \nraces. Luca Cadalora, the  factory’s official test  rider, was \non  Foggy’s bike for  Donington but  could only manage \none paltry 17th place, an  embarrassment for a  man \nof his talent. Ducati went back to  Bayliss for  Round 5. \nHis  brace of fourth places confirmed him  as  Fogarty’s \nfull-time replacement in the  World Championship, but \nhis erstwhile new team-mate Ben  Bostrom, who had \nbeen struggling with the  Michelin-shod Infostrada \nbike, was shipped off to the  semi-works NCR team. \nThe  championship rookie was at  least reunited with \nfamiliar Dunlop rubber as  Spaniard Juan Borja went \nthe  other way to  the  full  works team. The  seemingly \nhumiliating exchange worked better for  Ben  Boz, who \npromptly beat Borja in  both races, then went on  to  his \nfirst  rostrum finish of the  year next time out  in  Misano. \nThis was also the  first appearance of Ben’s Evel Knievel \nleathers in Europe. The  young Californian had  just \navoided career meltdown and  was now Starting to  enjoy \nhimself. \nHonda also  went the  substitute route, with Simon \nCrafar deputising for  his countryman for the  first two \nrounds but  never overcoming his  dislike of Michelins. \nManabu Kamada took over at  Sugo before Slight \nreturned —  almost from the  dead —  at  Donington. \nIt wasn't just the  faces that were new on  the  grid. \nHonda had  a  new bike, the  VTR1000SP-W. As  it was a \nV-twin there were a  few  snide remarks about copying \nDucati. While it’s  true that the  Big  H  had never built a \nsporting V-twin before, the  SP was shorter of stroke \nan  the  Duke and  featured Honda’s usual twin-spar \naluminium frame, not  Ducati’s trademark steel lattice \nor  their desmodromic valve-operating system. Winning \nwith a  new bike first time out  had become very, very \ndifficult, as  Honda had  found out  with the  RC45, and \nthey weren't about to  make the  same mistake twice. \nMassive resources were poured into  pre-season testing \nand  the  bike arrived for  competition so  light it even \nretained the  roadster’s starter motor!

In the  black- \nand-red livery of the  factory's GP  bikes and  with Axo \nsponsorship, the  bike looked the  part —  and  so  did  the \nrider. Troy Corser had  found himself unemployed when \nDucati signed Ben Bostrom and wasn’t happy about tt. \nThe  Aprilia ride  came along just at  the  right time, with \nthe  team now being run  by the  factory using mechanics \nfrom their GP  efforts. Motivation wasn’t a  problem for \nTroy. He  duly gave Aprilia their first Superpole in the  first \nrace of the  year, their first  rostrum in Race 2, and  their \nfirst  win  in  Round 2. And it was all the  sweeter because \nDucati was struggling. \nYet  another V-twin started the  year in the  unlikely \nshape of the  Bimota SB8. The Rimini company that was \nso  strong in  the  early years of Superbike came back \nwith a  Suzuki TL1000 V-twin engine in  one  of their \nown typically beautiful frames. The personnel involved \ncould boast more arguments with Ducati than even Troy \nCorser. The rider, Anthony Gobert, was in dispute with \nhis  old  Vance & Hines Ducati team back in the  States, \nteam-manager Virginio Ferrari was consulting his  lawyers \nabout his  removal from managership of the  Ducati Corse \nteam, and  tuner Franco Farne, probably the  world’s most \nexperienced Ducati race mechanic, had been sacked by \nthe  company after years of service. \nGobert ran  race number 501 in  the  hope of some big \nsponsorship from Levi but  it never transpired. Amazingly, \na  winning tyre  gamble in  mixed weather conditions \nlanded Bimota and Gobert a  win in  Round 2 at  Phillip \nIsland, making the  wayward Aussie only the  second man \nto win  World Superbike races on  three different makes \n134 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nof motorcycle: Kawasaki, Ducati and  Bimota (the  first \nwas Stephane Mertens, on  Bimota, Honda and Ducati). \nMore predictably, the  Bimota blew up  big time in  Japan, \nflinging Gobert down the  track and  following him  into \nthe  barrier. It was a very fast, very scary crash that left \nAnthony severely beaten up,  with a collection of minor \nfractures and burns. The  team folded shortly afterwards, \nciting lack  of cash. \nDown the  four-cylinder end  of  the  pit lane Frankie \nChili and Katsuaki Fujiwara kept the  Suzuki flag flying \nwith the  aid  of good work from Dunlop. Kawasaki \ndidn’t fare so  well; Akira Yanagawa was again consistent \nwithout ever scoring a win, while Gregorio Lavilla’s \nseason was blighted from the  start by a  wrist injury \npicked up  in  pre-season testing and then ruined by a \nbroken pelvis at  Monza. Everyone's favourite sub, Simon \nCrafar, returned to  the  Green colours for one round \nat  Hockenheim, after which Peter Goddard did  the \nnecessary for  three more races. \nt soon became apparent that Carl Fogarty’s injuries \nwere going to  take a  lot  longer to  heal than first \npredicted. The brave noises about being back in  a  few \nweeks soon turned into disconsolate non-committal \nannouncements. If British fans were looking for a  new \nhero, they had  to  look no  further than Neil Hodgson, \nwho had disappeared from the  World Championship \nradar two seasons earlier. His  wild-card win in  Race \n2 of Round 4 at  Donington Park was his  first  World \nSuperbike victory and  —  amazingly —  Ducati’s first of the \nseason. \nHome fans were treated to  another round of the \nHodgson versus Chris Walker battle that raged all year \nin  the  British Championship. The pair even managed \n{£"

Over 60,000 fans got \nwhat they wanted on  the  last  lap when Chili's tyres and \nmotor were both on  the  verge of throwing in  the  towel \nand the  home-town heroes went past the  Italian for a \none-two finish. It was an  indication not  just  of how well \nthe  pair  rode but  of the  strength of the  British Superbike \nChampionship as  a whole. Not  surprisingly, both men \nwould find themselves in  World Championship paddocks \nthe  following season. \nThe fans went home talking about the  racing, but \nthere was only one subject of conversation in  the \npaddock. Just before the  meeting, the  FIM  issued one \nof their regular press releases giving the  results of \ndrug tests from earlier rounds. Usually, this  would just \ngive a list  of riders tested and  affirm that no  banned \nsubstances were detected. This  time it was no  routine \nlist.  The release announced that Noriyuki Haga had \ntested positive for ephedrine after the  second race of \nthe  first round in South Africa, a  race he  had  won. \nWhen urine is taken after a  race, it is split into A and \nB samples. The  first is sent to  an  approved laboratory \nfor testing and  the  second is held by the  rider as \ninsurance. Haga and  Yamaha immediately asked for the \nB sample to  be tested, which was done by the  next race \nin Monza, and  it confirmed illegal levels of ephedrine. \nNow ephedrine is a  drug much favoured in sports like \nweightlifting, where its  combination of fat-dissolving \nand stimulating properties is very useful. You only had \nto  look at  him  to  see  that Nori-chan had  lost  an  awful \nlot of weight over the  close season —  15kg was the \ncommonly accepted figure —  that’s 33lb in  old  money. It \nturned out  that as  part of his winter programme Haga \nhad  been taking a  herbal formulation back home in \nJapan and  that was the  source of the  drug. \nStandard procedure when a  drug test  is positive is \nto exclude the  rider from the  meeting —  that means \nremoving points scored in  both races in the  case of \nWorld Superbike. So  Haga found himself 45  points \nworse off  than he’d thought (he’d also been second in \nRace 1). There was also  the  small matter of returning \nany  prize money and trophies, and the  much more \nSerious concern of a  ban  from racing. In  previous years \nperhaps this  wouldn’t have mattered too  much, but \nnow Nori was shaping up  as  a  genuine championship \ncontender. The Yamaha R7  had improved over the \nwinter and, vitally, the  team had  switched back to \nHaga’s favoured Dunlop tyres. The  Samurai of Slide \nwas back, then he wasn’t, and  then he was again after \nYamaha appealed. Standard legal procedure when this \nhappens is  to  presume innocence and give the  rider all \nhis  points back until! the  appeal is  heard. \nThe  FIM  Disciplinary Committee couldn't convene \nuntil Round 6 at  Hockenheim at  the  start of June, two \nmonths after the  sample had been taken. For  reasons \nno-one had been able to  explain satisfactorily the \nhearing was held just as  the  Superbikes, including Haga, \nwere going out  for  free practice, so  neither the  man \nhimself nor  anyone from Yamaha was present. Not \nsurprisingly the  committee upheld the  original decision, \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 135"

Yamaha had \njambled on  the  appeal and lost, and the  only chance \nleft  was double or  quits —  taking the  matter outside the \nsport’s governing body's jurisdiction to  the  independent \nCourt of Arbitration in  Sport (CAS). First, they had  to \nget  leave from the  FIM  for  this  unprecedented move, \nwhich they managed just  in  time for  Round 7 at  Misano \nYet  again Haga raced with his  full  tally of South African \npoints appearing on  the  championship table. \nAnd when did  the  CAS bring down the  curtain \non  what had inevitably become known as  the  Haga \nSaga? Four days before the  final round of the  year at \nBrands Hatch, that’s when —  but  as  Colin Edwards had \nhammered out  a  significant 52-point advantage with a \ndouble win at  Oschersleben nearly a month previously, \nit really didn’t matter whether Haga got  his 45  points \nback or  not. In the  end, he  got 20  of them back for the \nfirst Kyalami race because he  wasn’t tested afterwards. \nHe'd been tested after Race 2 and  therefore lost  the \n25  points he’d scored. The CAS also banned him for \ntwo weeks with immediate effect so  he  missed the  last \nround of the  year. \nThat’s how long it took to  resolve a  situation that \nhad  its origins at the  first  round of the  year —  right up \nuntil the  week of the  final round. Could it have been \nmanaged any  better by any  of the  parties involved? In \nview of established practices and precedents the  answer \nis probably yes. In the  end  Yamaha got exactly the  same \nverdict as  Honda did  in  1994 when Aaron Slight’s fuel \nsample from Race 2 of Round 1 was  found to  be  illegal, \na \nLl ~ \nRS \n~ \ni™ \n~ \n<] \noa | \nae \n>» \n0 \nas  described earlier.

Remember that \nt would be  grossly unfair to  Colin Edwards to \nehow robbed of a  chance \nthe  Texan had the  title \nsewn up  after the  penultimate round, before the  Haga \nSaga was resolved. Remember, too, how Colin had  to \ncope with an  intensive testing programme for the  mid- \nseason Suzuka 8 Hour race, \nwhich Honda regarded \nas  equally important to  both the  GP  and Superbike \nChampionships.

      "text": "but  that  shouldn't be allowed to  disguise the  grit \nand determination that took him  from a stellar \napprenticeship with Yamaha in  the  States to  a  fallow \nthree years with the  Belgarda Yamaha team in  World \nSuperbike. First  there was  the  Dunlop hiatus following \nthe  Kobe earthquake, and  then the  ageing YZF750 \nsimply didn’t have the  legs any  more, a situation \nillustrated at  Phillip Island in  1997 when he came out  of \nthe  last  turn in the  lead, rear  tyre spinning, front wheel \naviating, only to  be out-dragged to the  line  by Aaron \nSlight'’s Honda. He  may not  have won but  people still \nknew he was a contender. \nThere was even a war  of words with Carl Fogarty \n—  and King Carl never stooped to  acknowledge those \nlesser beings whom he considered to  be  no  threat. A \ntruce was declared after Foggy had  won on  the  RC45 \nHonda. Colin went to the  Fogarty family motorhome \nto  retract a  statement about Carl not  being a true \nchampion until he won on  a four-cylinder machine. \nFogarty was duly impressed that someone would have \nthe  guts to  make such a  statement to  his face and  went \nso  far as  to  echo Raymond Roche's prophetic statement \nabout himself: ‘He'll be World Champion, but  not  this \nyear.’ Then, lest  anyone should think he was going soft, \nCarl hurriedly added: ‘Doesn’t mean | like  him, mind.’ \nStrangely, it was  the  removal of Foggy from the \npicture that seemed to  derail Colin’s season and he \nseemed in danger of going back to  his old  habit of \nhaving weekends where he was scarcely visible. Misano \nand  Valencia were consecutive low  points, but  in the \nlast  three rounds he won four out  of six races as  he \nrediscovered the  self-belief that had  powered him  to \nwhat turned out  to  be a  double win  in the  first round \nof the  season. Nine men won races during the  2000 \nseason but  none deserved the  title  more than Texan \nColin Edwards. \nDucati’s early season musical chairs following the \nshock of Fogarty’s departure did  at  least prove that Troy \nBayliss was  made of the  right stuff. The  Aussie’s battle \nwith Haga at Assen, a track he’d never seen before, was \na  minor epic (although he crashed out  in both races), \nand his win  at the  first Brands Hatch meeting was a \nreward for  his  heroics as  well as  a steadying influence \non  Ducati. British fans got to  cheer Neil  Hodgson \nwinning not  once but  twice (first at  Donington, then \nat  Brands), as  well as  the  wily veteran John Reynolds \ngetting his first-ever win  at world level in the  second \nBrands meeting. Second Brands? Yes, the  UK  got three \nmeetings in 2000, the  last  being a second dose of the \nKent track that ended the  season in chilly mid-October \nnine weeks after the  first. The  event was originally due \nto  go to  Imola, but  local elections and  a  massive beer \nfestival (honest) would have stretched the  authorities \ntoo  far and  they cancelled. \nIncredibly, 75,000 fans turned out  and  fittingly saw \nColin Edwards win  the  last  race of the  year. They also \nsaw Slight run  his  last  race for  Honda. Embarrassingly, \nhe was presented with all sorts of gifts on  Saturday \nnight before he was officially told his  services would \nnot  be  required for 2001. Aaron had  spent years \nwaiting for  a V-twin and \nthought his  time had  at \nlast  come. He  made his \nfeelings plain at  Brands, \nthrowing anything he was \nwearing with a  Castrol \nHonda logo, including his \neathers, into  the  crowd \nafter the  second race. \nIt was a  shabby way \nfor  Slight to  leave Honda. \nHe  had  ridden hurt more \nthan any  other rider in \nthe  series, to  develop the \nRC45, been lumbered \nwith a  nightmare \nselection of team-mates \nand never broken ranks. \nIt later emerged that \nhis  brain operation had \nbeen performed in  the \nnick of time: his sight \nand reactions had  been \ndeteriorating rapidly, \nand  when things started \ngoing seriously wrong \nhe was lucky to  be  in \nSydney, where one  of the \nfew  surgeons capable of \ndoing the job was based. \nThere would obviously have to  be a  lot of changes \noff the  track as  well as  on  for the  2001 season, and \nmany of them would be informed by the  FIM’s release \nof outline plans for the  return of four-strokes to the  top \nclass of Grand Prix  racing first made public on  9 April at \nthe  third GP  of the  year in Japan, after much wrangling \nbetween the  manufacturers and  the  FIM  itself. From \n2002, the  500 class would be opened up to  990cc four- \nstrokes, provided they were prototypes. \nWhat would this  mean for the  future of World \nSuperbike? The  Japanese factories were already known \nto  be  unhappy with the  expense of the  series and \nwanted to turn the  clock back to what Superbike \nwas meant to  be  in the  late  1980s, when the  class \noriginated. Maybe allowing fewer modifications, as  in \nthe  Supersport class, would be an  option. Then there \nwas the  ever-increasing problem of the  now palpable \nadvantage the  1000cc twins had  over the  750cc fours. \nThe only non-V-twin win of the  year was by an  inspired \nFrankie Chili on  the  Suzuki at  home in  Monza, where \nhe  beat Edwards's Honda by a  fraction of a  second. \nYamaha announced their decision to  pull out  of the \nWorld Superbike Championship before the  end of the \nyear after just  two seasons with the  R7,  and  there was \nno  new 750 Kawasaki in  sight. And the  first whispers \nof the  four-stroke GPs had  put  paid to a  plan for  kitted \nengines which were to  be  made in  sufficient numbers to \ngive privateers a chance to  be competitive. \nSomething would have to  be done. The  question \nwas, what? \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nAbove: There has  never \nbeen a  more surprising \nwinning combination \nthan Anthony Gobert and \nthe  Bimota. \n137"

In two years \nGermany had  managed to  lose the  glorious Hockenheim \n—  probably the  best race track in the  world —  and gain \nOschersleben and  the  Lausitzring. Nobody thought it \nwas a  good deal. \nTroy Bayliss emerged from the  wreckage of Ducati’s \n2000 season as  the  Bologna factory's undisputed \nnumber one  and lined up with new-to-Superbike Ruben \nXaus, the  young, lanky and  wild-riding Catalan with \na win-it-or-bin-it reputation. They formed the  official \nworks team —  Ducati Infostrada —  while Ben  Bostrom \nand his  Dunlops were semi-detached and running as \nDucati L&M. The really significant change in the  red \ncorner was a  new bike. Officially it was called the  996R \nFO1  but  was soon known to  all as  the  Testastretta, or \n‘narrow-head’. Sounds better in Italian, doesn’t it? This \nwasn’t just Ducati’s usual close-season modifications; \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nthis  was a  genuine second generation of the  design that \nstarted with the  original 851  Superbike built for the  start \nof World Superbike in  1988. \nDucati followed the  example of the  other V-twin \nmanufacturers, Honda and  Aprilia, by shortening the \nstroke to 63.5mm, which with a 100mm bore actually \ngives a  998cc motor. This more rev-happy bottom \nend got a  brand-new cylinder head design with a \nsignificantly narrower valve angle —  25  as  opposed to 40 \ndegrees —  allowing a  much more efficient combustion \nchamber shape. The problem with the  old  cylinder \nhead was that all four rockers for the  desmodromic \nvalve-operating system that is Ducati’s hallmark were \npositioned between the  camshafts, despite Massimo \nBordi’s original design thesis placing them outside the \ncamshafts and  valves. The  Testastretta design had  the \nrockers that opened the  valves mounted outside the \ncamshafts, which allowed the  cams to  be  moved closer \ntogether and  therefore the  valve angle to  be narrowed. \nCamshaft mounting bearings were also done away \nwith and  the  cams ran  directly in the  head, saving more \nspace. Overall the  result was a  great leap  forward, with \nas  much as  an  extra 10hp available to  the  three factory \nriders. \nHonda had  also found extra power, but  unfortunately \nlost  some reliability. At the  opening round at Valencia \nthe  new SP-2 failed once with Edwards and  three times \nwith Slight’s replacement, Tadayuki Okada. Edwards \npromptly won the  third race of the  year in South Africa, \nthen had  his  bike break again while shaping up  for the \ndouble; Okada DNFd twice. That glorious old  catch-all \nphrase ‘electrical problems’ was dusted off  and used \nstraight-faced by Honda people, although one  comment \nabout bearing failure did  escape the  net  of secrecy. \nAprilia didn't look like  they had  any  problems.

He  scored a  hatful of podium places but  did \nnot  win  again. It was very apparent that team and rider \nwere not happy with each other, the  end result being \nthat RSV Aprilia, which had  truly threatened to  be the \ntop  V-twin in  2000, was reduced to  fourth overall in \n2001.

Phillip Island is in  the  Bass Strait, the \nstormy waters that once reduced the  Sydney to  Hobart \nocean yacht race to  tragic chaos.

Race 1 went ahead in  conditions that \nwere simply appalling: it was like  racing inside a  storm \ncloud. (Back in  ‘92,  when Carl Fogarty and  Terry Rymer \nclinched their World Endurance title  here in  a six-hour \nrace, the  conditions had  been just  as  bad  and several \nmarshals ended up  in  hospital with hypothermia.) \nCastrol Honda made the  best of the  dire  conditions and \nwent some way to  making up  for their dreadful start to \nthe  year, with Edwards taking the  win. \nThe Supersport race then went ahead in  even \nworse conditions, and it was apparent that the  track \nwas unraceable thanks to  standing water everywhere. \nNevertheless, the  pit lane was opened on  time for \nRace 2 and a  few riders went out. Corser now took \nmatters into his  own hands, stationing himself at  the \npit-lane exit  and  urging his  fellow riders not  to  go  out. \nPublic rows with the  organisers followed, with Davide \nTardozzi also weighing in against Corser because \nhe wanted his  riders to  make up  their own minds. \nWorldwide TV  audiences were treated to  a  bizarre public \ndebate before Colin Edwards, as  World Champion, \nwas sent out  for  an  exploratory lap. He  returned to \nState the  obvious: Race 2 was cancelled.

Edwards could only manage 12th \nand 13th places behind Dunlop-shod regulars like  Corser \nand the  usual crop of local aces, who all —  even the \nHonda men —  use  Dunlops in  their local championship. \nBayliss fared even worse and  the  lead was handed back \nto  Corser. \nThe  bizarre happenings of the  opening four rounds \nof the  season had  not  revealed any  clues about the \ndestination of the  title. We  had  to wait for the  fifth \nround for the  picture to  come more clearly into  focus, \non  the  awe-inspiring tarmac of Monza, and  when the \nhaze cleared it revealed Troy Bayliss. The  popular Aussie \ntook Superpole and then his first-ever double win at \nworld level. \nThere were several other twists to  the  plot before \nTroy was able to  clinch the  crown, however. The  first \ncame from Britain’s Neil  Hodgson on  his  return to  World \nSuperbike with the  GSE Ducati team which had  taken \nhim  to the  2000 British Championship. Equipped with \nRS-spec Ducatis —  basically last  year’s works racer —  and \nDunlop tyres, and with the  highly promising youngster \nJames Toseland as  his team-mate, Neil  took a  few races \nto  readjust to  top-level racing, but  when he  did  he  was \nvery quick. Quick enough to  depose Troy Corser as \nking of the  Superpole, thanks to  a  stunning run  of four \nof them in  five  races in  the  middle of the  season, and \nto  win  the  first race at  Donington where the  Dunlop \nrunners all  had  a  good day. It was his  first rostrum of \nthe  season but  six  more followed in  nine races before he \nfaded slightly towards the  end of the  year. \nRace 2 at  Donington gave the  crowd another \nfavourite to  cheer: Frankie Chili. With no  Yamaha \nteam in  the  championship and the  Kawasaki ZX-7R \napproaching pensionable age, the  only hope for  a \n750cc four-cylinder victory was Chili and  the  newly \nfuel-injected Suzuki. The  factory's road-going 750  had \ngot  Injection in 2000 but  the  Alstare Corona team had \nstuck with the  carburetted version for that season. Now \nit became apparent why. Chili simply could not  get  on \nwith the  power delivery of the  new bike and  said so \nloudly, resulting in  an  end-of-season bust-up with team \nbosses. His  team-mate, Frenchman Stephane Chambon, \ngetting his  reward for the  Supersport crown, wasn't able \nto  give meaningful support, and Frankie's two rostrums \nat  Donington plus Yanagawa’s pair at  Monza and \nLavilla’s thirds at Valencia and Misano were the  only top- \nthree spots the  four-cylinder brigade managed all year. \nBelow: GSE Ducati left \nthe  safe waters of British \nSuperbike for the  rigours \nof the  World Championship, \nwith Neil Hodgson as  the \nlead rider. \nbi \noe \nae \nee:   \noe \nA \n8h \nthirds \niP \nea \nig \nLn \nSa \naR \nES \nSed \nSPO \ny bbre \nget"

Note the \ndate: 27  May 2001, the  last  time a 750cc four won a \nWorld Superbike race. \nEdwards's title  challenge might have been torpedoed \nat the  outset by mechanical woes, but  even his \nseemingly certain second place overall came under \nthreat from a  most unexpected source. Ben  Bostrom’s \nintroduction to World Superbike had  been traumatic, \nto say the  least, thanks to  Fogarty’s exit  and  the  chaos \nthat engulfed Ducati’s efforts in 2000, and  for the  first \nhalf  of the  2001 season it looked as  if things weren't \ngoing to get any  better. Going into  Round 8 at  Misano \nhe'd had just one  win, at  Kyalami, and  only one  other \nrostrum, from the  opening race in Valencia —  plus a \ndislocated shoulder thanks to the  new mickey-mouse \nchicane that had  defaced Monza at the  insistence of \nthe  F1  cars. Comparisons were being made with the \nill-starred career of Mike Hale, the  last  great hope to \nemerge from AMA Superbike racing in the  States. \nThen came Misano and, nagging shoulder injury \nnotwithstanding, Bostrum shared the  wins with Bayliss \n146 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nat a track where Ducati have always done well. That set \nhim  up  nicely for a  return to the  only other track he had \never won on,  Laguna Seca. Dunlop runners monopolised \nthe  rostrum as  Ben  did the  double for the  first time in \nhis career to  make it three wins in a  row in front of an \necstatic crowd of fellow-Californians. \nThe big question hanging over Brands Hatch, \nthe  next venue, before proceedings got  under way, \nconcerned the  crowd and  how the  retirement of Car! \nFogarty would affect attendances. On  race day it simply \nlooked as  if the  old  red  Foggy T-shirts had  faded in \nthe  wash as  the  Kent track turned orange, with over \n120,000 fans flying the  colours of Neil  Hodgson’s GSE \nDucati team. The home favourite couldn't convert yet \nanother Superpole into  a  race win, though, as  Ben  Boz \non  only his second visit  to the  complex and intimidating \nBrands long circuit blitzed to  both wins and  made it five \nin a  row, something only Doug Polen and Carl Fogarty \nhad  achieved in the  entire history of the  championship. \nBostrom’s second half  of the  season more than made up \nfor his very patchy opening half. Although he didn’t win \nanother race he still  ended the year with six wins, the \nsame number as  eventual champion Bayliss. \nDucati’s other works rider, Ruben Xaus, also took \nsome time to  get going. True to  his win-or-crash \nreputation he spent a  lot of time reducing carbon-fibre \nbodywork to expensive shrapnel, but  at Oschersleben"

      "text": "Michelin gave him  a front tyre  that cured all  his \nproblems —  or  that he  believed cured all  his  problems. \nHe  promptly gave Edwards a  hard time in Race 1 as  his \nteam-mate Bayliss hit  mechanical problems, then won \nRace 2 from the  American in a fair  fight. It was another \nhistoric moment —  the  first-ever win  in World Superbike \nby a  Spanish rider. \nIt could —  should? —  have been more at the  next \nround, the  penultimate of the  year, at  Assen, but  Xaus \ndid  the  decent thing and  shadowed his team-mate \nhome in both races, having plainly been the  fastest \nman out  there. No-one complained too  much about \nteam orders, though, as  the  two Ducatis were well clear \nof the  field both times and the  championship was at \nstake. Edwards and the  Castrol Honda team conspired \nwith Michelin to  make a  disastrous tyre choice for the \nsecond race, which saw the  World Champ come home \ntenth and  lose his crown. Bayliss didn’t know that as  he \ncame back to the  pit lane —  like  the  rest  of the  paddock \nhe thought the  fight would go down to the  last  round. \nOnly when he saw his team wearing the  obligatory \ncelebratory T-shirts did  he  realise he was  World \nChampion. \nAll  of which left the  way clear for a  last-round \nshowdown at Imola three weeks later. Superbike’s \nfirst visit  to the  historic Italian circuit produced two \namazing races, with Ruben Xaus winning the  first  one \nto  prove a  point. Bayliss, his  bike resplendent in silver \nto  celebrate Paul Smart's legendary 1972 victory in the \nImola 200 (the first race win  for  a desmo Duke) fell \nchasing his team-mate, and his  bike scooped up  Regis \nLaconi’s Aprilia. It looked horrible. The Frenchman’s bike \nappeared to  land on  him  at one point but  the  human \ndamage was limited to  a  broken collarbone for  Bayliss. \nAs  soon as  Laconi stopped rolling he  leapt to  his feet \nregulations didn't look too  different, but  there in  black \nand white were the  words ‘treaded tyres’. No-one \nseemed sure how that had  happened, and  with both \nMichelin and Dunlop denying any  prior knowledge and \npointing out  that they didn’t have suitable designs to  go \nracing to  those regulations, confusion reigned. \nClearly the  changes were being driven by the \nMSMA, whose members had  seen costs for what was \nsupposed to  be a  production-based formula spiral out \nof control to  the  point where HRC were spending as \nmuch keeping an  SP-2 on  track as  they were on  an \nNSR500. That was more than enough motivation to  try \nand peg back Superbike to where it was meant to  be  in \n1988, when the  class was born. Supersport regs, which \nforbid almost any  modifications to the  bottom end  of \nthe  motor and  stipulate that standard forks, brakes and \nwheels must be  used, are  an  obvious method of cost \ncutting. Hell, if you  look inside the  fairing of a factory \nHonda CBR600 Supersport bike you'll see  a  hole in  the \n(stock) top yoke where the  ignition switch should be; \nthey're that standard. There was also  the  small matter \nof the  market for  750cc street bikes collapsing world \nwide. Motorcyclists were buying 600 or  1000cc fours, \nassuming they were not  on  big V-twins, of course. \nThe  need to  do something was driven by several \ncauses. Money, specifically the  severe downturn in \nthe Japanese economy, was, as  usual, a  major factor; \nthe  rapidly decreasing competitiveness of the  750cc \nfours was another. All  the  puzzling over the  future \nwas brought into  sharp relief by one  cold fact. In April \n2002 the  sound of four-strokes would be  heard in the \nGrand Prix  paddock for the  first  time in over 20 years. \nHonda and  Yamaha showcased their new MotoGP \nmachines before the  end  of the  season; Aprilia declared \ntheir intention to  compete in the  new formula; and \nBelow: Troy Bayliss’s \nDucati wears silver at \nImola in honour of Paul \nSmart's landmark win \nthere 30  years earlier. \nand  rushed to  aid  the  obviously injured Aussie. It was a \ngenerous act  of spontaneous sportsmanship and  earned \nRegis a special award from Italian magazine Moto Sprint \nat their end-of-season Casque d’Oro awards. Laconi and \nAprilia got their just desserts a few hours later when \nthe  Frenchman —  almost literally —  beat off  Xaus to win \nRace 2. This  wasn’t just  his first  win, it was his first \nrostrum in Superbike and  earned him  a  place alongside \nthe  Doohans, Kocinskis and  Chilis of this  world as  one \nof the  very few men to  have won a  500 GP  and  a World \nSuperbike race. \nIn  many ways Laconi’s season was symptomatic of \nmuch that went on  in  2001: initial promise followed by \na  lengthy period in the  wilderness and  a  moment in the \nlimelight. Some riders, like  Bostrom, had  longer periods \nof grace; others, like  Okada, hardly troubled the  scorers \nat all.  Overall, the  departure of Fogarty still  seemed to \nleave a vacuum that was waiting to  be filled. \nOne other feature of the  season’s last  round was the \nfirst  sight of proposed new technical regulations for the \nclass. The British Superbike Championship had  already \nmade a  unilateral decision to  go  to  an  overall 1000cc \nlimit, but  with Supersport-style regulations on  engine \nmodifications to four-cylinder motors that effectively \nbanned any  tuning. The  proposed World Superbike \nDucati, Suzuki and  Kawasaki also  announced that they \nwould be  in  MotoGP in 2003. It looked like  the  time \nfor Superbike to  reinvent itself.

The restricters would \nbe 26.3mm in diameter for a single intake and 18.7mm \nif the  bike had  two.

Theoretically, this  was much easier to  police than \nthe  Supersport regulations, and severely limited engine \ntuning. Most people were agreed that this  was a  pretty \ngood compromise, although some asked what the \npoint was of building £20,000 motors and  then \nstrangling them. \nMeanwhile the  show went on  with the  old  rules and \none Honda up  against the  same Ducati teams as  last \nyear —  Bayliss and  Xaus in the  Corse team, Hodgson and \nToseland in the  HM  Plant squad and Ben Bostrom in the \nL&M team.

Michelin had \nspent a lot of time and effort developing a  fresh \ngeneration of S4 slicks to  cope with the  new MotoGP \nfour-strokes. Happily they also worked on  Superbikes, \nto  the  tune of around a  second a  lap improvement \nUnhappily, Dunlop hadn't made a similarly great leap \nforward and  Messrs Hodgson, Bostrom and  Haga found \nthemselves at an  acute disadvantage at  most tracks —  as \ndid  the  Michelin runners who didn’t have access to  the \nnew rubber. \nFor  this  and  other reasons the  championship \nquickly became a two-man race between riders with \nS4  Michelins: reigning champ Troy Bayliss and his \npredecessor Colin Edwards. Dunlop's qualifiers were, as \nusual, on  the  pace for the  one-lap dash of Superpole \nwhich let  Hodgson, Bostrom and Haga fight for front- \nrow  starts but  rarely for the  win. The  first  three rounds \nof the  year were a  Bayliss benefit. He  won every race, \nsomething no-one had  done before at the  start of \nthe  year —  but,  just as  he was eyeing up  Doug Polen’s \nrecord of seven races on  the  trot, the  circus came to \nSugo, the  track where Bayliss had  crashed twice in \n2000 and  scored a  grand total of four points in 2001. \nNot  surprisingly, the  benefit came to  an  end. Very \nsurprisingly, a Michelin rider won a  race in Japan for the \nfirst  time since Takuma Aoki in  ‘96.  That man was Colin \nEdwards, the  Texan sharing the  wins with local Honda \nman and  All-Japan Champion Makoto Tamada. It was \nalso the  first Sugo win by a  non-Japanese rider since \n'95. Bayliss wasn’t fazed by missing out  on  the  record \nfor consecutive wins, and instead seemed happy to \nescape from his  bogey track with fifth and  fourth places. \nSugo also gave the  World Superbike paddock its first \nsight of Ben Bostrom’s brother Eric  away from his  home \nround. Eric, Kawasaki's AMA Superbike star, was  taking \new \n©  \nW  \nie \nIi \nIORSE \nIERGY \nDRINK \n3 Tae vise em \nIT ERED mortar, \npart in  a  series of wild-card rides designed to  ease him \ninto world-level competition. Kawasaki needed him, \nthe  top  four-cylinder man in the  championship, Izutsu, \nhaving crashed in qualifying and  badly broken his  left \nwrist. \nEdwards did  hit  back occasionally, noticeably at \nSilverstone where storms of biblical proportions put \nBayliss on  the  floor, not  once but  twice in the  same \nrace. Both times his  bike kept going, seemingly in \ncontravention of the  regulation that requires a  mercury \nswitch to  cut  the  motor if a  certain lean angle is \nexceeded. Both times he got  back on  and  charged \ntowards the  front of the  field at  lap speeds well quicker \nthan anyone else’s. In  Race 2 Edwards contrived to  fall \non  the  warm-up lap,  so  bad  were the  conditions, but \ngot  back on  his  spare bike to  finish second.

When the  two re-enacted their British \n\\pionship battle in  Race 2 and Walker got  a \ndid  fourth place, both crowd and rider acted like \nhe'd won the  title \nThere were more departures from the  form book at \nLaguna Seca: Bayliss and Edwards scored their maiden \nwins there but, more significantly, the  first race rostrum \nwas 100  per  cent Michelin. Local wild cards Bostrom the \nYounger and Nicky Hayden mixed it up with the  regulars \nwith Eric  actually leading the  race for  a  while and \nscoring a  sixth and  a fourth. Hayden had  been expected \nto  compete for a win but  instead took a fighting fourth \nin  Race 1, then crashed and  took Haga out  in Race 2 \nbefore getting back on  to  finish 13th. Both Americans \nwere obviously well worth tempting away from the \ndomestic scene —  but  could anyone afford to  match the \nwages they got  in AMA racing? \nBayliss now led  the  championship by 53  points, \ndespite the  fact that Colin Edwards was riding as  well as, \nif not  better than, he  had  ever done and  only been off \nthe  rostrum once —  yes,  once —  all season. The  reigning \nchamp was riding at the  top  of his form. He  looked just \nas  fast  and loose as  ever and the  number-one plate had \ncertainly done nothing to  reduce his  will  to  win  —  and \nthat, combined with the  latest Ducati, gave him the \nslightest of advantages over Edwards. Troy ruthlessly \nexploited that edge, but  the  Honda rider never gave up \n50  much as a single point without a fight. Edwards was \nmentally tough enough to  keep the  pressure up,  and \nevery time Troy stood on  top  of the  rostrum there was \nColin beside him. \nOf the  Dunlop runners it was Neil Hodgson who \nwas emerging as  the  toughest, comfortably outgunning \nthe  disappointing Haga and the  patchy Bostrom. His \nmotivation was helped by Ducati announcing he would \nbe  in the  full  works Ducati Corse team for  2003 to \nreplace Bayliss who, it was assumed, would go  off \nto  Ducati’s new MotoGP project. The form of Ruben \nXaus was a  mystery, but  it emerged late  in  the  season \nthat he had  not  had  access to  the  latest Michelins \nuntil half-way through the  year. Chris Walker was \npleasing his  hard-core fans by usually, although by no \nmeans always, winning the  four-cylinder 750cc battle \nwith Lavilla. Young British hopeful James Toseland \ncontinued on  his  learning curve and  added steel to  his \nskill, as  a spectacular last-corner mugging of Haga at \nOschersleben showed.

      "text": "point of view, the  silver lining was the  four-week break \nin  the  calendar before Oschersleben that enabled him  to \nget  back to  full  fitness. \nThe other seismic event at  Brands was the  first public \nouting of the  Foggy Petronas bike in  the  hands of team \nriders Troy Corser and James Haydon, as  well as  a  couple \nof laps from King Carl himself. The  bikes had  actually \nbeen unveiled in  June amid assurances that the  target \nof racing at  Laguna Seca was attainable. That date was \nthen amended to  Brands before the  team had  to  admit \ndefeat and postpone the  FP1's race debut until 2003. \nProducing enough road bikes for  homologation was \nthe  main stumbling block and  the  MSMA was in no \nmood to  show the  leniency they'd exhibited to  Benelli. \nTypically, Carl brushed aside his earlier statements about \nhow he’d make people eat  their words when his team \nmet  the  deadline by reflecting that perhaps this  pressure \nwas necessary to  drive the  project forward. He  probably \nhad  a  point. The  bike certainly showed some very nice \ndetailing, and  with Petronas bankrolling things there was \nno  shortage of money —  but  the  team now had  to  revise \ntheir 900cc triple to  compete not  just with the  V-twins \nbut with 1000cc four-cylinder bikes. \nThe  Oschersleben round saw Edwards close the  gap \neven more, with another double, making it five  wins on \nthe  trot. He  also passed a few  significant milestones. \nRace 1 gave the  Castrol Honda team their 50th World \nSuperbike win  and Race 2 took Colin to joint second in \nthe  all-time winners’ table alongside Doug Polen. It was \nalso the  100th win  by an  American rider and  equalled \nPolen’s record of 21  podiums in a year, though Colin had \nscored them consecutively. Even Foggy in his  pomp had \nonly managed a  dozen consecutive top-three finishes, in \n1995. All that work and  Edwards was still  second in  the \ntitle race! \nBayliss’s Brands crash had  obscured the  fact  that \nHonda had  supplied Edwards with a  new motor after \nthe  Suzuka 8 Hour race, where Colin was teamed with \nDaijiro Kato and  won. The  Texan was on a roll,  and \nall of  a sudden Bayliss was looking vulnerable with his \nchampionship lead after Germany reduced to  29  points. \nAs  so  often, Assen was the  turning point. Race 1 \nfeatured the  two main men again, with Bayliss following \nEdwards home. That reduced the  lead to  24  points, \nand with only three more races on  the  calendar Troy \ncould afford that rate  of attrition. But  the  Aussie was \nfeeling the  strain and, according to  other riders, making \nunforced errors. In  Race 2 he  made several. The  first  was \nto  run  off track, but  he stayed on  his wheels and  set \nabout reeling in the  third-place dice between Hodgson \nand Haga. When Nori punted Neil into the  sand Bayliss \ninherited a safe third place. Inexplicably, he then crashed \na couple of laps from the  flag and Colin won again to \nequal Polen’s record run  of seven consecutive victories. \nWhen Edwards got the  pit signal telling him  that his  rival \nwas out  he couldn't quite believe it and ‘used up  a year’s \nworth of concentration’ getting to  the  flag. Much more \nimportantly, he also went to  the  top  of the  table, the \nfirst  time Troy Bayliss had  been deposed all  season. The \nlead?

      "text": "158 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nIt was a  fitting finale. The two contenders, the  men \nwho had  so  far won all  but  one  of the  races in  the  year, \nwent at  it like  a  six-lap club race. The lap record was \nshredded time after time, and  to  add to  the  drama Race \n1 was interrupted by a  red  flag half-way through when \nEdwards was leading. Conspiracy theorists pointed to \nthe  fact that the  flag  came out  very quickly, just  as \nthe  Italian Ducati appeared to  be  losing touch with \nthe  Honda. In  truth, it worked to  Edwards's advantage \nas  he  knew he  had  a 0.7s lead and  thus was able to \nfollow Bayliss across the  line  after the  restart yet win  on \ncorrected time to  give him a  six-point lead with only one \nrace left. \nThe  last  race of the  season was a real  classic. Bayliss, \nas  usual, gave it everything while Edwards refused to \nyield up  the  victory. Despite the  fact the  title  was at \nstake the  last  lap involved fairing-bashing and several \nchanges of lead. Fittingly, the  American took the  win \nand the  title while Bayliss appeared on  the  surface to \nbe a  lot  less  upset than he’d been after Assen, maybe \nbecause it had  been a fair  fight and he'd simply been \nbeaten on  the  day. \nIn 2002 both men had  ridden better than they ever \nhad  before. Bayliss lost  none of his aggression and \nfrightening will  to win  despite carrying the  number-one \nplate, while Edwards refused to  be discouraged by the \nAussie’s runaway start to the  year and  maintained his \nmotivation. He  also  showed, notably at  Imola, that he \ncould mix  it with the  best of them. There was  huge \npressure on  Troy Bayliss, not  least because the  showdown \nwas at  Ducati’s home track. Well, the  last  race wasn't a \nfight, it was a war  —  and  Colin Edwards won. \nThe  other man who didn’t lose his  motivation was \nNeil Hodgson who emerged as  clearly the  fastest of the \nDunlop runners and, as  his third place overall showed, \nhe firmly put a  few Michelin men in their place too. \nKnowing that he would be  a  Ducati factory rider in \n2003 must have contributed to  his  motivation in  the \nfinal race. \nThe  statistics tell  the  story of the  season. The  year \nwas dominated by just two men —  the  only other winner \nall year was Tamada at  Sugo. In the  first half  of the \nyear Troy Bayliss was supreme, but  the  only time Colin \nEdwards was  off the  rostrum was in the  first  race of \nthe  year. Once Bayliss had  suffered that unfortunate \ninjury at  Brands, Edwards and  his  new motor took over \nand  shattered the  all-time records for consecutive wins, \nconsecutive rostrums and number of rostrums in a \nseason. Anyone who wants to  beat those last  two marks \nis  going to  have to finish in  the  top three in every race of \na  season! In the  final analysis, Edwards had  as  near an \nerror-free season as  it's  possible to  imagine. Bayliss made \none mistake. That was the  difference between them. \nTop left:  Neil  Hodgson was  __ Right: Troy  Bayliss lost \nthe  season’s unsung hero. none of his  aggression \ntrying to  defend his title \nLeft: Edwards lifts  the but  conceded it to  his  good \ntrophy with the  help friend Colin Edwards in the \nof team-manager Neil final race at the  last  round \nTuxworth. at  Imola."

But  the \nadoption of restricters was not  greeted with universal \nenthusiasm, the  question ‘Why design, develop and \nspend a lot  of money building a  new race bike and  then \nStrangle it?’  being asked many times. In  the  end, the \n2003 season started with only one really competitive \nfour-cylinder 1000cc bike (a  factory-supported Suzuki) \nbut  its  comparative lack of success meant it would not \ncontinue into 2004 \nMany viewed 2003 as  an  ‘interim year’, but \nthat should not  detract from the  single-minded \ndetermination of its  champion, Briton Neil Hodgson \nIn  2002 Neil, on  his  GSE Racing Ducati, had im z \neverybody as  the  best non-factory rider outside the \nColin Edwards—Troy Bayliss battler and, over the winte \nof 2002-3 he  was signed to  ride  for  the  full  factory \nDucati squad \nTrue, 2002 champion Edwards, Bayliss, \nand Ben Bostrom had all  gone to  pastures new ( \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 163"

Hodgson had  to fight \nfront-end and  tyre-selection problems on  the  999 Dukes \n—  which got the  better of his team-mate in the  first  part \nof the  season —  but  Neil proved any  doubters wrong by \nwinning 13  races and taking a total of 20  podiums. He \nbegan the  year with a  blistering run  of nine wins on  the \ntrot  and  such was his consistency he only had  two DNFs \nall season. No  matter the  problems in practice, Hodgson \nwas always fast  and consistent when it mattered —  on \nrace day. Xaus took longer to  master the  new 999 F03 \nDucati, but  ended the  season very strongly with four \nwins out  of the  last  six  races.

The  Malaysian company bankrolled their \nown 900cc triple —  a  project that should have been \non  the  track in 2002 —  and  were fronted by four-times \nchamp Carl Fogarty. Petronas were without doubt the \nlargest presence in the  paddock and looked to  be well \nprepared, marshalled by former Team Roberts crewman: \nNigel Bosworth.

The three-rider DFX Racing team of \nSteve Martin, Juan Borja and Marco Borciani was \nfunded by Pirelli, with the  Italian company using them as \na test-bed for their latest rubber. Martin was consistently \ntheir best performer and  definitely the  best privateer \n—  not  counting Chili, of course. \nAt the  start of the  season three different tyre \ncompanies were involved in the  championship, but \nmaybe only one had  an  inkling of how that would \nchange before the  year’s end! \nRound 1 saw  the  race debut of the  Ducati 999  —  an \nimportant bike for the  Italian manufacturer. After the \nbeauty and  originality of its 916  Ducati knew a  change \nhad  to  come, but  the  999  wasn't initially viewed with \nthe  same excitement —  and certainly not  in  road livery. \nThe  race bike, though, was built to  take the  title and \nfor  Ducati that’s what mattered. It hadn't been long in \ndevelopment and most of its  track time had  been spent \nat Valencia, which was just as  well: Hodgson swept to \ntwo comfortable wins at the  Ricardo Tormo circuit, with \nFila  team-mate Xaus taking an  even more comfortable \npair  of seconds. Hodgson’s effort was ballsy to  say \nthe  least —  unknown to  most, the  Briton was taking \npainkilling injections to  relieve the  discomfort of crash- \ndamaged ribs  the  week before. The new 999s were \nalso giving both riders front-end problems, particularly \nentering turns and  on  the  brakes. Despite this, the \n166 World Superbikes: The First 20  Years \nfactory Dukes were in a  class of their own, with HM \nPlant's duo, Walker and Toseland, taking a third apiece \nahead of the  remaining Ducatis, already starting to  look \nwell past their sell-by date, and  Lavilla’s restricted Suzuki, \nwhich managed a forlorn seventh in  Race 1 and  sixth in \nRace 2, both times the  first non-Ducati finisher. If there \nwas any  consolation for  Gregorio’s team it was that \nthe  all-new Petronas had  fared worse. All  they could \nmuster was one  finish in each race, 12th by Haydon in \nRace 1 and  seventh by Corser in  Race 2 —  particularly \ndisappointing as  Troy had  been in  the  top  four in  both \nregular and Superpole qualifying. \nBefore the  season started, Valencia had  been seen \nby some as  the  dawning of a  new era  for  1000cc four- \ncylinder race bikes, but  Lavilla’s Suzuki was the  sole \nstrong entry and his team left  Spain knowing that it was \ngoing to  be a  long, hard season ahead. \nThe  second round, in Australia, gave the  Belgian- \nbased outfit some hope, because Lavilla took a \ntremendous third place on  his  Dunlop-shod GSX-R \nin the  opening race. The team had done masses of \nwork on  the  engine, trying to  regain some of the \npower lost  because of the  restricters, and they got \ntheir reward at  one  of the  fastest and  best-loved \ntracks of the  year. Phillip Island is  a  real ‘riders’ track’, \nfull  of fast  sweepers and long straights requiring a \ncompletely full-on approach —  and  fans love it too, for \nno  matter the  conditions the  racing is  always good, \nthough unpredictable.

His  victory margin \nin  Race 1 was over seven seconds, but  ne  really had \nto  work for  win number two, beating Xaus again, but \nthis  time by just 0.070s thanks to  clever tactics and the \nability to  squeeze behind the  999’s fairing better than \nhis  lankier rival. If Xaus had not  suffered three practice \ncrashes (including one on  his  Superpole lap) and had to \nStart on  the  second row of the  grid, perhaps it would \nhave been a  different story. The home star  was Corser, \nwho once again started from the  front row, taking \na superb fifth in  the  first race followed by eighth in \nRace 2, perhaps a fairer indication of his  FP1’s ability. \nFellow-countryman Martin gave his  Pirelli-shod 998 \nRS  its  best finish of the  year, a  fourth in  Race 1, while \nChili just  failed to  take Superpole (that honour, and the \naccompanying Breil watch, went to  Hodgson) and then \nDNFd. That fired the  Italian up,  at  one of his  favourite \ntracks, and he stormed through to  third place in  the \nsecond 22-lapper, the  sixth different rider on  the  podium \nin just four races. Maybe the  season wouldn't be  so \npredictable after all, although who would realistically \nbe able to  stop Hodgson’s relentless pursuit of the  title? \nWith just four races gone he  had a perfect tally of  100 \npoints. Second-placed Xaus, however, was only 20 \npoints adrift and  there was a  long way to  go. \nSugo has  never been a  happy hunting ground for \n‘foreign’ riders, at  least until Edwards equalled Tamada \nfor  maximum points in  2002. The  local wild-card riders \nwere on  Dunlops, developed in Japan, while Michelin \nhad little or  no  presence on  the  Japanese race scene, \nso  it was a  bit of a surprise that Hodgson took his third \ndouble of the  season to  maintain his  perfect score. He'd \nstruggled in  qualifying and  only managed the  fifth- \nquickest time behind four Dunlop-shod riders —  Laconi, \nChili, Lavilla and  local hotshot Atsushi Watanabe. Laconi \nposed the  biggest threat to  Hodgson in  Race 1, but  Neil \nwas able to  clear off  in the  last  few laps and  took the \nchequered flag with an  easy-looking margin of seven \nseconds. The race had  begun dramatically, with Toseland \nand Corser unwilling participants in  a  chain of events \nthat led  to  four riders being put  out  before they had \nmade the  first turn. The mechanical and human debris \ncaused havoc, though fortunately there were no  serious \nnjuries, but  the  pattern of the  race (minus fallers Chili, \nWalker, Corser and Clementi) was immediately affected \nToseland managed to  avoid going down and  then \nought his  way up  to  a  gritty third place by the  end of \nthe  25-lap race to  make it three different generations of \nDucatis in  the  top  three. Xaus battled to  fourth, despite \nset-up problems, incorrect tyre choice and having to \nStart from the  end of  row three in  12th place. Race 2 \nwas a  much closer affair, with Hodgson just  squeezing \nout  Lavilla’s Suzuki after 25  frenetic laps. The Spaniard \nwas close to  taking the  win, but  although his  bike’s top \nspeed was a  match for  the  Ducati, it could not  punch its \nway out  of turns as  well.

Neil may have ridden his \nluck in the  18-lap opener, after seeing a three-second \nlead shrink to just 0.352s at the  flag. The pursuer who \nnearly spoilt his  party was Laconi; if the  flag had been \nfurther down the  track Ducati would still  have notched \nup win number 200, but  the  Briton would've lost  his \nperfect sequence. Third place went to  Lavilla and the \nincreasingly competitive Suzuki, leading many to  think \nthat a win  was surely ‘when’ rather than ‘if’.  The  second \nrace was a Classic Monza multi-rider slipstreaming \nbattle, with Hodgson, Chili, Lavilla and  Laconi all  in \nwith a  chance of victory, to  entertain the  72,000-strong \ncrowd. Leaving the  Ascari for the  final time, however, \nthe  factory grunt of Hodgson’s Ducati was enough to \nclinch top  spot, though the  margin of 0.044s over the \nSuzuki was the  closest so  far.

It was \nnot  a good day for the  other title  contender, with Ascari \nthe  scene of Xaus’s problems on  both occasions.

Ruben left  Monza bruised and \nbattered, still  second in the  championship but  now just \nfour points ahead of Lavilla. \nOschersleben was a real  Brit-fest, with five  out  of six \npodium places taken by British riders. Only Chili, on  his \naged customer Ducati, spoiled the  symmetry of the  first \nrostrum. He  almost halted Hodgson’s run  of victories \ntoo, but  Neils last-corner move was astute enough \nto  secure his  ninth win  of the  year. Toseland was \npushed off track by the  crashing Lavilla at the  first  turn, \nthundered across the  run-off area and  was lucky not  to \ncause a  multiple pile-up with the  leaders as  he  rejoined. \nBy the  time he sorted himself out  he was dead last. \nJames then fought his way through the  field to finish \nan  aggressive third, but  better was to  come in Race 2. \nHodgson and  Toseland led  the  pack and clattered into \neach other with sufficient force to temporarily dislodge \nNeil's clutch lever and redesign some of the  Fila  Ducati’s \npaintwork. Both riders called the  incident ‘an  accident’; \nthe  fans loved it. Toseland’s maiden World Superbike \nwin  saw not  only the  first-ever all-British podium but \nwas also significant for  Dunlop, recording their first \nvictory since Sugo in 2002. \nSilverstone in June was as  June should be —  warm \nand  sunny. A crowd of 83,000 was rewarded by two \nsuperbly entertaining races, with British riders prominent \nboth, but  everyone agreed the  final chicane was a \nsaster. Chicanes are  a  necessary nuisance but  the \nlverstone effort, comprising a  stupid mid-apex bump \nnd  obtuse left-right design attracted criticism from all \nuarters. However, it did  serve some purpose, causing \nclose ten-rider pack to  bunch up  on  almost every lap \nthe  first race. It was a  particularly important round \nfor  Lavilla. Machine improvements after the  start of \nthe  season had  given him  the  scent of victory, and \nSilverstone was  just  the  kind of track where the  Suzuki \ncould get the  better of Hodgson’s Ducati. Gregorio, \nthough, hadn't reckoned on  Neil’s self-belief and \ndetermination not  to  be  beaten by a  four-cylinder bike. \nThere were also two other strong GSX-R1000s in  the \nshape of British Superbike contenders John Reynolds and \nYukio Kagayama. \nRace 1 featured a five-rider freight train, all  in  with \nchance, but  Hodgson kept his  nerve and showed his \naggression, a  testament to  his  improvement since 2002: \nwhen it mattered he delivered the  goods and  took the \nwin, his tenth of the  season, with Toseland second, Xaus \nthird and  Japanese rider and British crowd favourite \nKagayama providing further entertainment. Race 2 was \nno  less  of a  battle: Lavilla had  been in  contention in  the \nfirst race until a fall  at the  final chicane, now he was a \ngenuine challenger.

The  ever-popular Chili took third, ahead of \nLacon! and  Lavilla, who was almost embarrassed by \nformer Superstock Champion Vittorio lannuzzo on  an \nAlstare Suzuki GSX-R1000 that was of  a much lower \nspec than the  Spaniards bike. \nLaguna Seca is one of the  most breathtaking circuits \non  the  calendar, with the  infamous Corkscrew at  its \nheart providing a  riding experience like  no  other. It \ndoesn’t help that wild-card riders always want to  put \none  over the  Superbike regulars and  can  use  their \nsuperior local knowledge to  good advantage. Led  by \nYoshimura USA's Mat Mladin, the  locals were good \nin  qualifying but  couldn't produce the  goods in either \nrace; Mladin didn't even take part in Race 2, citing \n‘fatigue’. Xaus led  the  first race, and looked on  course \n170 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nfor win  number three, but then crashed out  leaving Chili \nto  inherit the  victory. Hodgson consolidated his series \nlead with second, ahead of Toseland and Mladin. Race \n2 saw Ruben more than make up for  his earlier fall, \ntaking his third win  in four races by an  easy 11  seconds. \nSecond again was Hodgson, with Walker third and \nLaconi fourth, ahead of a  bruised and  battered Lavilla. \nBoth races had  been all-action affairs, which was  just \nas  well as  there were two major announcements that \nsent shock waves through the  paddock. First, SBK CEO \nPaolo Flammini announced that Pirelli would be the \none-make tyre supplier in 2004. Second, and no  less \nsignificant, was the  MSMA statement that none of the \nmajor factories, or  Aprilia, would be  running their new \nsuperbikes in the  series. \nThe  two-week gap  between Laguna Seca and  Brands \nHatch gave everybody time to  digest this  news but, if \nthere was doom and  gloom around, it certainly didn’t \naffect the  racing at one of the  sport’s most popular \nvenues. The  weather had  been poor on  both practice \ndays but  stayed dry for  race day —  good for the  fans, \nbut  not  for the  SBK  regulars who'd had  hardly any  dry \ntrack time. Shane Byrne joined a  long list of locals who \nhave ‘done good’ when they've competed at their \nhome round, winning both races at the  undulating Kent \ncircuit. He  used his  long-time track knowledge to  blitz \nthe  opposition, though Race 2 was a  much tougher \ncall. Britons filled all the  remaining rostrum places, \ntoo  (Hodgson and  Walker in the  first race, Reynolds \nand  Toseland in the  second), bettering the  result at \nOschersleben earlier in the  year. Xaus was now 140 \npoints behind Hodgson, with only a  possible 150  points \nremaining, having DNFd in Race 1 and  then taken \nfourth. But  at  least he was better off than Petronas. \nThree DNFs and a finish outside the  points were hardly \nwhat they’d have hoped for,  or  might have expected, at \na  ‘home’ event."

      "text": "Hodgson had  become a father just before Assen and \nhe celebrated that, and winning the  title, with a second \nplace in Race 1. On  his slow-down lap the  crowd, \nfull  of the  usual legion of British fans, was treated \nto  Hodgson’s T-shirt bearing the  slogan ‘Who's your \nDaddy?’ It was almost like  the  glory days of another \nLancastrian, Carl Fogarty, though perhaps lacking the \nsame intensity. The first race had been a  nervy, close- \nquarter, four-way affair, with Xaus and  Hodgson both \nlittering the  6.027-km circuit with mistakes; they finished \nin that order, with Chill third and  Toseland losing out \non  the  run  to the  flag. Chili had  taken Superpole with a \ntime only a second slower than the  best of the  MotoGP \nboys earlier in the  year —  and on  a  Ducati two levels \nbelow Hodgson’s. In Race 2 the  new champion, freed of \npressure, got  his own back on  his team-mate, winning \nhis  12th race of the year by almost half  a second. Lavilla \nwas a distant third, to  make up for  his  DNF in Race \n1, and  even Petronas had a positive day, with Corser \ncoming sixth and  ninth. \nThe  title  might have been decided before Imola, with \nXaus virtually assured the  runner-up spot, but  it didn’t \nstop the  Fila  team-mates slugging it out, lap after lap, \nfor top spot at  Ducati’s home circuit. In the  first  part \nof the  season Xaus had  struggled with the  new \n999 FO3, but  Imola was a  perfect example of how far \nhe’d progressed and, although Hodgson had  lost  none \nof his determination and  tried everything he knew (and \nmore!), the  Spaniard was too  strong. Third went to \nLaconi, with Lavilla fourth and  Chili a tremendous fifth \nafter starting from pit lane. Hodgson outbraked himself \nin Race 2 and  lost  places as  he thundered through the \ngravel. To  his credit, he fought back and  even managed \nto  pass Walker in the  final stages. Xaus was again the \ncomfortable winner, taking the flag some 12  seconds \nahead of Laconi, with Lavilla third. Toseland failed to \nscore, but  Corser and  Petronas had  more cause for \noptimism with a  pair of sevenths. The  biggest story of \nthe weekend, though, was Michelin lining up their top  - \nduo of Hodgson and  Xaus on  what seemed to  be  rear \ncut  slicks. There had  been no  change in track conditions, \nso  what were the  French company playing at?  According \nto their spokesman, it was the  first  use  of the  type of \n(production?) tyre they'd intended to  run  in Supersport \nin 2004 —  had  they not  been denied the  chance by the \nFGSport/Pirelli tie-up. It was obvious that Pirelli didn’t \nbelieve this, preferring to think of the  rubber on  show \nas  merely hand-cut clicks made to  look like  Michelin’s \nDOT offerings. Whatever the  point, it was a  more than \neffective message to those concerned. \nMagny-Cours in mid-October is not  renowned \nfor  its warm, balmy conditions and  although rain \nwasn’t on  the  menu, bitterly cold conditions were. \nThe  track temperature never rose above 21°C, even \nin the  afternoon, and  the  freezing cold caused many \nfallers, with just  15 finishers in Race 1 and 17  in Race \n2.  Hodgson led  the  charge in the  first race, despite his \nboot almost coming loose, taking his  13th win  of the \nseason. Once again it was team-mate Xaus who pushed \nhim  all the  way, even though he’d only qualified eighth. \nRuben rode with determined but  controlled aggression \nto finish a very close second, leaving many wondering \nwhy he'd not  done that from the  start, and  then took a \nvery comfortable win  in the  second race, a total of seven \nvictories from his  last twelve outings. Toseland posted \nfifth and  second places to  secure third spot overall in the \nchampionship on  271, just four points clear of Laconi. \nJames then performed a  burn-out with friend and \nteam-mate Walker, happy in the  knowledge that 2004 \nwould see  him  in an  all-changed factory Ducati team \nalongside his French rival. Walker's prospects were not \nso  clear, though he'd ended the  season strongly with \ntwo thirds, finishing sixth overall. Lavilla’s two fourths \nalso saw him  fourth in the  championship, ahead of \nChili, who had suffered a  pair of DNFs. The new boys, \nPetronas, fizzled out  with just an  eighth place from \nCorser in the  penultimate race. As  starts go,  it had  been \nan  inauspicious one, but  there was always 2004 to  look \nforward to. \nAbove: Support for the  Brits \nat  Brands Hatch, with just a \ntouch of Japanese. \nBelow: Team-mates Chris \nWalker and  James Toseland \nburn rubber at  Magny-Cours \nbefore going their separate \nways. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 171"

What he and \nthe  Flammini Group put  in  place was a  gamble, no \ndoubt, but  by the  end  of the  year it wasn’t looking such \na  bad idea —  and  the  proof was consistently close and \nexciting racing. Furthermore, the  Big Four were gearing \nthemselves up  to  return, albeit with importer, dealer or \nprivateer teams. \nWith 2004 champ Hodgson and runner-up Ruben \nXaus off  to  MotoGP, the  factory Fila  Ducati team called \nup  the  riders who'd placed third and  fourth in  the \n2003 standings —  Toseland and Laconi. Both had  been \nwith satellite Ducati teams, so  it was almost a  smooth \ntransition. What was not  so  smooth, though, was the \nmove to  the  new one-make Pirelli tyres and  all  the \nproblems that entailed. Fila  Ducati found themselves, \nuncharacteristically, in the  same boat as  everybody else, \nsomething they'd probably not  experienced since the \nchampionship’s early years. Their 999 FO4s were not \nappreciably different from the  2003 bikes —  they didn’t \nreally have to  be, after all —  but  strangely it was the \nchassis that proved tricky at  times. Indeed, Toseland \nwould spend a large part of the  season not  being \ncomfortable with the  bike and it took a  private Mugello \ntest  in the  summer before he felt  at  home with the \nmachine. Once he did, he took two wins and  was on  the \npodium six times in the  last  six  races. He  might only have \nwon three races compared to  his  team-mate’s seven, but \nhe  DNFd three times to  Laconi’s five  and  that difference \n—  and his  unbelievable performance in the  last  round \n—  was enough to take the  title. \nTheir biggest challenge came from the  ‘Samurai \nof Slide’, Noriyuki Haga, on  the  Ducati 999 RSO4, the \nPrevious spread: James \nToseland, the  youngest-ever \nWorld Superbike Champio1 \nFar left: Toseland celebrates \nin Assen. \nLeft: The  emotions get to \nToseland after crossing the \nline  in  Magny-Cours. \nBelow: Chris Vermeulen \nand the  Ten Kate Honda \ngot  better and better as  the \nseason wore on. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 177"

Haga’s bike looked almost \nidentical and  was close in performance, but  it was an \nexpensive and  finicky beast and  would test  the \nresources (technical and  financial) of team owner Mark \nGriffiths and his crew. Nori was partnered by 21-year-old \nLeon Haslam, son  of racing legend ‘Rocket’ Ron, but \nalthough the  bikes were patently very competitive, both \nwould suffer from a seemingly never-ending demand for \nnew parts. \nThe  other challenge to Toseland and Laconi came \nfrom a  most unlikely source: rookie team Ten  Kate \nHonda. The Dutch outfit had  won the World Supersport \ntitle  the  year before and decided to  play with the  big \nboys in 2004, using the  new 1000cc Fireblade piloted \nby their Supersport Champion, Aussie Chris Vermeulen. \nAt the  beginning of the  year, and  in the  early races, \nthe  bike was more of a  road bike with some race \nparts instead of a fully fledged member of the  World \nSuperbike fast  club, but  the  CBR1OOORR just got better \nand better as  the  season progressed. Ten  Kate were \nquick to  point out  that theirs was not  a  ‘factory HRC’ \nbike by any  means, rather it was all their own work \n—  with a little help from their friends in Japan. \nFoggy Petronas returned for their second season \nwith a  new engine partner: Ricardo Engineering took \nover from Suter Racing Technologies. Troy Corser was \njoined by Chris Walker but, although the  team took a \ncouple of podium finishes and  two Superpoles, it was \nanother tough year for the  British-based outfit. The \nevergreen Chili showed up  again, on  one  of the  new \n999RS Ducatis, and  took to  it like  a duck to  a frozen \nlake. Frankie just didn’t get on  with the  new bike \nand  it wasn’t long before the  paddock was treated \nto  one  he and  the  team had  made earlier —  a 998.5 \nas  he affectionately called it.  It was part 999RS and \npart 998FO2 and  gave the  Italian the  feel  he wanted \n—and it was legal. Not  that the  (Italian) organisers of \nthe  series would have thrown out  one  of the  crowd's \nfavourites, even if the  bike was a bit of a sore point \n178 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nfor  Ducati. Alstare Suzuki were noticeable absentees, \nhaving decided to  sit the  year out, so  the  Hamamatsu \nflag was carried mainly by Chinese company Zongshen. \nWith Superbike veteran Piergiorgio Bontempi and former \nWorld Endurance Champion Warwick Nowland on \nboard, the  riders had  pedigree, but  with zero factory \ninvolvement their highest finish was ninth. \nThe  first race took place in  Valencia, in late  February, \nand  it was clearly too  early in the  year for  most of the \nplayers, with only the  factory Ducati team really ready. It \nwas also the  first time with the  new Pirelli control tyres \nand  the  initial effect was slower lap times than previous \nseasons. Conditions on  race-day morning were tricky, to \nsay  the  least, with rain  giving way to  a  drying track and \ncausing a variety of tyre choices. There were numerous \nfallers, including Laconi, who only got as  far as  Turn 2 \non  the  opening lap. Team-mate Toseland took the win, \ndespite pressure from Chili and Steve Martin throughout \nthe  23-lapper. The unlucky Aussie should have had  third, \nbut  his  privateer Ducati blew up just two laps from the \nend, letting Walker into  third place —  and  the  first-ever \npodium for  Foggy Petronas. Haga took a comfortable \nwin  in Race 2, with Toseland second and Martin getting \nhis just rewards with a third place. The hapless Laconi \nonce again failed to score, though this  time it was his \nchain coming off  rather than any  mistake of his own. \nAt  Round 2, in Phillip Island, Laconi made up for  his \nweekend to forget in Spain by completely dominating \nthe  first race, running out  the  winner by a whopping \nseven seconds. Behind, though, was a thrilling four-rider \nbattle between Vermeulen, Toseland, Martin and McCoy \nfor the  remaining podium places. In a frantic dash to the \nline  Vermeulen took runner-up spot, with Toseland third, \nbut the  gap  between Chris and  fifth-placed McCoy \nwas  just seven-tenths of a second at the  flag. Former \nMotoGP race winner McCoy then gave his  home fans a \ntreat by taking victory in Race 2, despite luridly sliding \nhis 999 Ducati the whole way round the 4.445-km \ncircuit. Fellow-countryman Vermeulen was second, Chili \nthird, with Borciani’s privateer Ducati fourth, ahead of \nyet another Aussie, Corser, in fifth. Martin had  been \nfighting McCoy for the  lead in the  race, but  another \nblow-up saw his challenge evaporate three laps from \nthe  end. Although lap times were down compared to \nprevious years, the  fans enjoyed a spectacle of rear-end \nslides, smoking tyres and  closer racing, with the  four \nraces to  date producing four different winners. \nMisano was the  scene for  Round 3, in April rather \nthan its usual summertime slot  —  and  it seemed the \nmove was not  a good one, for the  weekend was \nblighted by rain. At  least the  home fans left the  Adriatic \ncircuit happy because Chili's third in Race 1 and \nemotional victory in the  second race were enough to \nmove the  Italian into  the  title  lead. The  first race was \nshortened by a  lap after Bontempi’s Suzuki failed to fire \nup  on  the  start line  and  then stopped after 17  laps due \nto the  adverse conditions. Corser had  put the  Petronas \nin front for the  best part of the  first 14  laps, but  Laconi \novertook him  just before the  heavens opened again. \nTroy had  been tantalisingly close to  giving the  Malaysian"

Series \nleader Toseland had only qualified 20th, but  a  gritty \ntenth kept his  points tally ticking over. Race 2 was wet \nand rain-master Chili took the  win after slipping and \nsliding around in  the  early stages behind Laconi. The \nFrenchman held second comfortably, with Martin taking \na thoroughly well-deserved third. Toseland charged to \nsixth place and  20  points behind Chili going into Round \n4, knowing it was going to  be yet another ‘home’ race \nfor the  Italian. \nThere had  now been five  different winners in six \nraces, but  Monza saw something of a  return to  normal \nbusiness. The  factory Ducati team of Laconi and \nToseland took a  1-2  in both races and, to  keep the \npodium symmetrical, McCoy took two thirds. If Ducati \nhad  been unhappy about Chili's adoption of old  chassis \nand new engine in  his  998.5 they must have had  a wry \nsmile as  the  Italian suffered two DNFs. In  Race 1 his \nbike failed at the  first  chicane and  he  had  to  ‘borrow’ \na  scooter to  get  back to  pit lane and  jump onto his \nunfavoured 999. \nHe  started dead last, but  got  up  to  14th after five \nlaps before his  engine went bang. Worse was to  come in \nRace 2, when he crashed at  the  Parabolica after pushing \nthe  front too  hard.

The  German track suited \nthe  sweet-handling Petronas, where power is  not  at \na  premium, but  Troy couldn't repeat the  feat in  Race \n2, retiring like  so  many others. There were only 14 \nfinishers, Laconi won the  race by a  massive 21  seconds \nfrom Toseland and fellow-Briton Haslam took third. \nHaga had led  the  race and looked set  for  a superb \ndouble, but  his  unreliable bike let  him  down again, \nsix  laps from the  end. Toseland’s pair of seconds took \nhim  back to  the  top  of the  standings, but  the  margin \nbetween him  and Laconi was just  two points. \nToseland was hoping for  a home success at \nSilverstone, but  although the  crowd could enjoy the \nsunshine they didn’t get the  result they wanted. James \nfailed to  finish in  the  first  race and  only managed fifth \nin the  second. Fortunately for  him, Laconi also had \na  first-race crash, so  the  points damage was limited. \nHaga took his third win  of the  year, narrowly beating \nVermeulen after 20  action-packed laps, with Chili third. \nRace 2 saw history made, with Vermeulen giving a \n1000cc four-cylinder bike its first-ever World Superbike \nwin.

Race 1 began with \n~  an  eight-rider battle and  ended with Haga and  Laconi \nfighting for top  honours after Chili crashed out  of \ncontention with seven laps remaining. When Haga’s bike \nwas on  song, the  Japanese rider was almost unbeatable. \nThat, together with his gutsyness, saw off  Laconi’s \nchallenge, though once again the  margin of victory was \nsmall —  0.134s. Superpole winner Martin took third, \nahead of fellow-Aussies Vermeulen and  Corser. The \nsecond race was a two-parter, after Italian De  Matteis \ncrashed and broke his collarbone. His  team-mate Chili's \nDucati had  only just  been rebuilt in time to  make the \nStart line  and  the  Italian was all  fired up  in  front of a \ncrowd who had  learned to  love him  as  their own. Haga \nwas in  front when the  race was stopped and  then he \nand Laconi had a terrific scrap in  the  second part, until \nthe  Frenchman crashed out. Chili crossed the  line  first \nand  thought he was the  outright winner, but  when the \ntimes were aggregated he’d finished second to  Haga. \nHis  celebrations on  the  slow-down lap were those of a \nourite Walker \n: uble  had  seen him close up to third in \nthe championship, with Vermeuelen now lying second \nto leader-Laconi and  Toseland in fourth, the top four \ncovered by just eight points. \nThe  summer break gave Toseland the  chance for \na  private test  at Mugello to  unlock some of his 999’s \nsecrets. Suddenly, from having to  fight his  bike, he was \nnow in control. Assen is one  of the  best-loved circuits \non  the  calendar and  has  always been eventful for  Chili: \nthis  time he took Superpole.

Laconi was equally determined that he \nwould leave Imola a  clear championship leader and, \nright from the  start, he  looked fluent and in  control of \nboth himself and  his  bike. He  had  to work hard for the \nwin  in  Race 1, chasing Vermeulen down before surging \npast the  Australian in  the  closing stages. Toseland hung \nin  as  best he could to  take third after fighting off  Haga \nfor  most of the  race. Laconi and  Toseland then went at \nit like  hammer and  tongs in  the  second race, hurtling \naround the  undulating track, leaving the  pack trailing \nway behind, in  their own personal duel. Team-mates \nthey might have been, but  no  quarter was given. The \nFrenchman won the  battle, by just  0.041s, but the  war \nwas  far from over. Martin took third, a  long way back, \nwith the  Ducatis of Nannelli and McCoy fourth and  fifth. \nVermeulen had  been highsided on  the  sighting lap and \ninjured his foot, hand and  hip.  He  was given a lift back \nto the  grid by Bussei and had  to  scramble through a \nsignalling gap to  get to  his  pit, where he jumped onto \nhis spare bike. He  then had  to  start the  race from pit \nlane, but  although he  lapped as  fast  as  the  leaders he \nwas too  far  back to  catch them. He  finished sixth, his \ntitle hopes in tatters, but  he  had  signalled that he was \nundoubtedly a  rider to watch. Haga also put  himself \nout  of contention with another DNF, leaving the  title a \nstraight fight between team-mates Laconi and  Toseland. \nWith one  round remaining Regis had  a four-point lead — \nand he was heading for  his  home race and  the  support \nof all the  French fans. \nJames Toseland might have been behind in \nthe  points, but  it was Laconi who appeared to  be \nsuffering more from the  pressure. Despite his  points \nand home advantage, and the  fact that the  Ducati \nhierarchy seemed to  favour him  over the  more reserved \nEnglishman, he could only manage fifth quickest in \nSuperpole. In  Race 1 Toseland and Haga disputed the \nlead throughout the  23  laps, but  it was Toseland who \ndeterminedly took the  win  and  put  Laconi under even \nmore pressure. The Frenchman took third place after \nVermeulen’s Honda ran  into problems. He  was now \nfive  points behind his team-mate and rival. Superpole \nwinner Corser got the  holeshot in Race 2, but Toseland, \nVermeulen and Haga led  the  cavalry charge, with the \nJapanese running out  the  eventual winner, by some \nthree seconds. Toseland was second and  claimed the \ntitle, the  distraught Laconi down in third. The  see-saw \nnature of the  title  chase had  seen the  leadership change \nhands nine times during the  season, but  Toseland’s extra \ndetermination and  desire to win  was the  crucial factor in \ncarrying him  to victory. \n‘During the  first part of the  season, it was hard going \nand | wondered if | was ever going to  get on  with the \nbike,’ said the  new champion, ‘but | kept on  working. | \nwas determined to  understand the  bike and  ride  it to  Its, \nand my,  potential —  probably to  the  despair of the  team! \nThe  Mugello test  was  a  real  turning point and, after that, \n| knew | had  a very good chance. | went into  the  last \nround knowing that | could win  the  title.

The \nnew bikes were well balanced, had  a  strong torque \nrange and  benefited from factory Showa suspension, \ncomplete with a dedicated technician. There was further \nJapanese content with the  welcome arrival of Yukio \nKagayama, a  long-time favourite in the  British Superbike \nChampionship and  self-confessed ‘crazy rider’. He  wasn't \nin the  team just to  make up  the  numbers, though \n—he won the  second race and  left  the  first  round as \nchampionship leader. \nPetronas FP-1 had  a  new team-manager, Jack \nValentine, and new top-name riders in  Steve Martin and \nGarry McCoy, but  their 900cc triple was always destined \nto  struggle against the  massed hordes of  1000cc fours. \nThe original concept of a triple, with a  reversed cylinder \nhead, was clearly up  against it and no  amount of rider \nskill  or  commitment could make up  for the  machine's \nfailings. \nlf Corser and Suzuki had been a  marriage made in \nheaven (or  at  least Hamamatsu), then Noriyuki Haga \nand Yamaha were an  equivalent pairing. The R1  had \nbeen a  potent tool in  the  Superstock class and  the  newly \nformed Yamaha Motor Italia squad had  the  look of a \n‘factory team’, based as  they were in  the  same building \nas  Yamaha's MotoGP squad. Former World Supersport \nChampion Andrew Pitt  joined Haga on a bike that \nstarted the  season more Superstock than Superbike and \nit was the  seventh round before rider and bike worked \n190 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nin perfect harmony and recorded their first win. \nThe increased grid saw the  return of Ben Bostrom, \nwho replaced Haga in the  Renegade team (now on \nCBR1000RR Hondas) from the  year before. It was a \nfrustratingly mixed season of crashes and  few highlights \nfor the  American, due  to the  unreliability of the  bikes \nand behind-the-scenes squabbles. Also Honda-mounted \nwas the  oldest racer in the  field, Pierfrancesco Chili, and \nthe  youngest, Max Neukirchner, both riding for Team \nKlaffi Honda. Like  Team Renegade (and many others) \nthey'd spend most of the  year trying to  improve their \nbikes. Yamaha Motor France entered the  fray with \nformer GP  winner Norick Abe and  Sébastien Gimbert, \nand two other ex-GP riders —  Fonsi Nieto (partnered \nby rising Italian Lorenzo Lanzi) in Team Ducati SC \nCaracchi and fellow-Spaniard José Luis  Cardoso (Yamaha \nDFXtreme) —  also  joined the  Superbike club. \nSo  a  new era  for World Superbikes and a  new track \nfor the  first race of the  year: Losail, Qatar. The  facility \nwas brand new and had  everything a  modern race track \ncould offer; the  only thing missing was the  fans. Not \nthat Corser and team-mate Kagayama noticed, for  each \ntook a win and a  podium to  give Alstare Suzuki a  dream \nstart and leave the  rest of the  pack worried. It was the \nfirst time in  the  history of the  series that Suzuki had \nscored a  double and, ominously, looked like  it wouldn't \nbe the  last. Troy’s win in  Race 1 came after an  unusual \noccurrence in  the  desert: rain! The race started dry, \nbut  when rain  began to  fall  after ten  laps, and Laconi \ncrashed as  the  conditions worsened, it was red-flagged."

      "text": "Kagayama won the  second part ‘on  the  road’, but \nCorser had  stuck close by in  second and  took the  overall \nwin, with Laconi third. New boy Pitt  took fourth, with \nteam-mate Haga fifth and  2004 champion Toseland \nsixth. In the  second race, a  too-hard rear  tyre cost \nCorser the  double and  he  had  to settle for third, but  at \nleast team-mate Kagayama won, with Laconi second. \nEight riders began the  battle for fourth, with Vermeulen \ntaking the  honours ahead of Chili and  Toseland —  not  an \nauspicious start for the  former GP  stars, with Abe's pair \nof top tens the  best of the  bunch. It was, however, a  lot \nbetter than Petronas, who managed just a  single point \nbetween them. \nIf ever a  rider was made for  Phillip Island, that rider \nwas Troy Corser —  especially when he  had  the  right \ntool for the job. He  and  the  GSX-R1000 had  topped \nthe  tests there and  should have led  the  charge in \nqualifying, but  he found himself way down the  pecking \norder after Superpole —  even behind the  Petronas. Chili \nwas a  non-starter, thanks to  a  broken collarbone, and \nthe  new 1000cc four-cylinder bikes were surprisingly \noutgunned (in top  speed anyway) by Laconi’s Ducati, \nwhich burst through the  speed trap at a  staggering \n318km/h (197.6mph). Only 16  riders finished Race 1, \ndue  to crashes and  other DNFs, with Corser taking \nthe win, eight seconds ahead of team-mate (and \nSuperpole winner), Kagayama. Vermeulen used his  local \nknowledge to take third, but  only after a  battle with \nrookie Neukirchner, which saw both paint and rubber \ntraded. The  good news for the  start of Race 2 was that \nthe  wind had  died down; the  bad  news was rain  after \n12  laps, which caused the  red  flag to come out. And \nso,  for the  second time in two rounds, another two- \nparter. Conditions were tricky to  say  the  least, and  there \nwere numerous fallers, notably at the  Hayshed, where \nWalker, Pitt  and Haga all succumbed. Laconi managed a \nspectacular ‘save’ there, only to fall  further up  the  hill  at \nLukey Heights. He  restarted and  took seventh place in a \nrace that saw only 14 finishers. Corser kept his  head to  . \ntake his second win  of the  day, with Kagayama second \nand Neukirchner a  superb third. \nThe  Corser roadshow continued its  momentum at \nValencia, with yet another double for the  Alstare rider, \nbut  the  big surprise of the  weekend was that none of \nthe  Ducatis really featured on  a track that’s normally \ntheir kind of territory. The  best they could manage was \nToseland’s ninth in the  first  race and  no  Ducati (factory \nOr  private) even got  a  point in the  second —  a  big change \nfrom the  year before when they practically filled the \ntop  ten. Honda was Suzuki's main challenger, with \nVermeulen taking a  pair of runner-up spots. Kagayama \nwas third in  Race 1 and  Walker third on  the  Kawasaki \nin  Race 2, leaving only Yamaha without a  podium \nplace so  far.  Laconi didn’t even get to  the  start line: a \nheavy fall  in  qualifying left  him  with concussion and  the \ndoctors wisely ruled him  out. Neukirchner was back in \nthe  news again, this  time for different reasons, when \nhe suffered the  biggest highside of the  year in  the  first \nrace, his sliding Honda taking out  Lanzi before pushing \nMuggeridge off  track.

It wasn’t quite \nenough to  stop Corser racking up win number six  out \nof seven starts, but  they did  take two podiums. As \nusual, the  Italian circuit served a feast of high-speed \naction, with the  opening race ending with just 1.75s \ncovering the  top  four. Kagayama played wingman to \nCorser, with Toseland third and Laconi fourth. The Ten \nKate Hondas should have been challengers but, for \nsome unaccountable reason, the  team decided not  to \nuse  the  special ‘Monza’ motors in  Race 1. The plan \nfailed for Vermeulen when his  CBR1000RR ground to  an \nundignified halt  after only a  lap.  In  Race 2, the  ‘Monza’ \nmotor went in and  Vermeulen stole the  win, a  mere \nhalf-second ahead of Laconi. Corser took third, after \ncomplaining about brake problems, ahead of Toseland \nand  Pitt.  There had  been eight riders contesting the \nlead at one  stage of the  race, conclusive proof that you \ndon't need the  fastest bike to  have a  good result at a \nfast  track. \nThe  season took an  unpredictable turn at  Silverstone \nwhen Laconi and  Toseland gave Ducati a win  apiece. \nNormally the  Northants track is suited to the  high-speed \nfours, despite the  mickey-mouse chicane just before the \nstart-finish straight, but the  use  of the  so-called shorter \n‘International’ circuit negated much of the  1000cc bikes’ \nadvantage. There was universal disapproval, from riders \nand  teams alike, especially as  the  information about \nwhich circuit was to  be  used was only discovered a \nweek or  so  before the  event. Nevertheless, the  racing \nwas exciting, the  result unexpected and  the  crowd \nenjoyed Toseland taking a win  on  home soil. James was \nalso in contention in the  first race, but  that was won by \nteam-mate Laconi, with Corser second. However, a win \nand a third for  Ducati was a  huge turnaround, and  a \ngreat relief to  Ducatisti everywhere. Corser led  most of \nthe  second race until overtaken by Toseland, then settled \nfor  runner-up spot after Laconi crashed out  and Haga \nwasn’t close enough to  cause any  problems, knowing \nhe’d increased his championship lead over his  nearest \nrival —  team-mate Kagayama. \nMisano returned to  its traditional summer slot, \nmuch to  everybody’s relief, except perhaps Pirelli: track \ntemperatures were in the  fifties on  race day. Ducati’s \nrecent testing programme (riders and tyres) reaped \ndividends, with Laconi winning both races. Vermeulen \ntook a  pair  of seconds, Corser a  pair of thirds and  the \nsymmetry even extended to Toseland’ s pair  of fourths. \nAlthough the  top  four may have been the  same in  both \n24-lap races, they were very different kettles of fish. \nLaconi ran  away with Race 1, four seconds in  front of \nVermeulen, with Corser a further four seconds adrift; \nRace 2 was a  much closer affair. And Kagayama lost  his \nsecond place in  the  championship. He’d been fined for a \nfist  fight with Spaniard Cardoso in  qualifying and maybe \nthe  red  mist hadn't cleared in  time for  race day.

He \nwas on  course for another double, but  he’d reckoned \nwithout Haga. The  Japanese rider hadn't even qualified \nfor  Superpole and his  18th position on  the  grid meant \nhe had  to  do  something really special. Nobody had  ever \nwon a  Superbike race from outside the  top  16  before, \nbut  Haga didn’t care about statistics. Lap after lap he \ncharged though the  field, at  record pace, forcing his way \nthrough gaps that didn’t exist until nobody was in front. \nThose fortunate enough to witness it will  never forget \nit—  and  that probably includes runner-up Corser, third- \nplaced Vermeulen and the  rest  of the  riders who saw a \nflash of blue and  white go  past. \nAs  usual the  biggest race on  the  World Superbike \ncalendar was Brands Hatch and, as  ever, the  on-track \naction didn’t disappoint the  massed crowds. Haga, \nfresh from his victory in Brno, was the  only rider to  give \nOVA AUK MV AH \n} 5 Wat ql \n1A Y anil \nCorser a  hard time in the  opening race. The  duo  stuck \nto each other like  glue throughout the  25-lapper, with \nthe  lead changing hands no  less  than seven times, but \nin the  end  Troy just sneaked it, by less  than two-tenths \nof a second. Laconi took third, with Vermeulen fourth \nand  crowd favourite Walker fifth. Toseland DNFd with \nan  ‘electrical problem’, much to the  dismay of his  legions \nof fans looking for  a home win  for the  number-one \nplate-holder. If Race 1 was a  Corser/Haga thriller, Race \n2 was even more of the  same —  if that were possible! \nWith nearest title  rival  Vermeulen finishing only fourth in \nthe  first  Troy didn’t need to win, but  that didn’t prevent \nhim  pulling out  all the  stops and  giving Nori a  helluva \nfight. For  virtually every lap there was hardly daylight \nbetween them. They tangled on  the  back part of the \n4.197-km circuit —  far from the  eyes of the  crowd, but \nvisible on  the  big-screen monitors —  with Corser running \noff-track. He  got  back on  course but  that excursion into \nthe  dirt  gave Haga just the  gap he  needed to  take the \nchequered flag. Vermeulen was third, a  long way down, \nwith Walker netting his second fourth place of the \nday. Two fantastic races with the  top four in each race \ndifferent manufacturers —  what more could the  series \nask  for? \nIf Vermeulen needed to  reassert himself, Assen was \na  good place to  do  it.  His  Ten  Kate team’s headquarters \nwere just down the  road and  hordes of home fans were \nready and willing to  provide vocal support. Like Brands, \nAssen is  another great Superbike venue and  although \nthe  circuit had  been remodelled there was still  enough \nof the  ‘old’ Assen to  please riders and  fans. The  racing \nwas top  notch, too, with the  track still  favouring the \nbest and  fastest riders. Vermeulen started his campaign \nwell, by taking Superpole, and  then fastest lap in  Race 1, \na  record that will  last  forever as  it would be the  last  year \nof the  North Loop. Four riders disputed the  lead until \nAbove: Pole-setter Yukio \nKagayama gets the  holeshot \nat  Phillip Island. \nLeft: Chris Vermuelen \nsmokes the rear at  Assen. \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 193"

      "text": "Chris decided it was going to  be  his  race, leaving behind \na frenetic battle between Haga, Corser and  Toseland, \nwith James taking second and  Nori third. Corser was \nfourth —  the first  time he’d not  been on  the  podium all \nyear. Race 2 was a straight three-way fight: Vermeulen, \nHaga, Toseland. All three led  several times, but the \nyoung Aussie just held off  Haga out  of the  final chicane \nto take the flag by 0.85s. Toseland was  third, Corser \noff the  podium again in fourth. A crisis? Maybe. But  at \nleast he was  better off than Laconi. The  Frenchman had \ncrashed in qualifying, injuring the tendons in his elbow, \nremoving skin  from his arm  as  he made contact with \nfirst  the tarmac and  then his bike. It was  the  second \ntime this year he’d been forced to  miss races after a \npractice crash. \nThroughout the  season young Italian Lorenzo Lanzi \nhad been doing well on  the  SC  Caracchi Ducati, and \nwhen the  factory Xerox Ducati team looked for a \nreplacement for Laconi at Lausitz the  choice was simple \nbut obvious. Lanzi took his chance right from the  start \nof practice and  surprised even the  Ducati top  brass by \nwinning Superpole. Could he go on  to take victory as \nwell? Championship leader Corser’s non-podium finishes \nin Assen had  given his nearest challenger, Vermeulen, \na glimmer of hope and  the  deficit was now down to \n86  points —  still  a good lead, but  not  an  impossible \ntarget. Lanzi got overexcited at the  start of Race 1 and \ncompletely lost  his Superpole advantage by going into \nthe first  turn too  hot. He  had  to take to the  slip road \nand, by the  time he  recovered, he was in the  middle of \nthe  pack. Vermeulen kept up  his winning streak, making \nit three in a  row, with Haga second and  Corser third, in \na  race halted by rain  on  lap 20  out  of 24. Maybe seeing \nhis young countryman on  the  up was  what prompted \nCorser to  push so  hard in Race 2. Too  hard as  it turned \nout, as  he lost the front going into  Turn 1 and  crashed. \nTroy picked up the  bike and  got going again, dead last, \nbut  rode the wheels off his Suzuki to take 13th place. \nAt the  sharp end  Lanzi showed that his qualifying and \nSuperpole form had  been no  fluke, controlling the  race \nand  running out  the winner 0.84s ahead of Vermeulen, \nwith Haga third. Kagayama’s fifth and  fourth confirmed \nhe'd now completely recovered from his trips to and \nfrom Japan on  Suzuka 8 Hour duties. \nLaconi was deemed fit for  Imola, so  Lausitz hero \nLanzi moved back to the  SC  Caracchi squad, though this \ntime he had  factory engines to  play with. A large part \nof the  crowd had  come to see  the  young Italian and \neven the wet  conditions didn’t put them off,  but they \nwere destined to  leave the  old  circuit feeling robbed. \nA rainstorm of biblical proportions flooded the track \nafter Race 1, causing deep puddles round the 4.933-km \ncircuit. The drains did  their best, but  lakes of standing \nwater and  small rivers running across the  track caused \nthe  top  riders to stop the  second race’s proceedings \nbefore they started. The  start was delayed, then delayed \nfurther, and  finally Corser, Vermeulen and  Laconi went \nout  in pace cars  to take a closer look. They confirmed \nwhat everybody feared, but  it was Race Control who \nmade the  decision to cancel Race 2.  The  decision \nalso meant that Corser was World Champion, for the \nsecond time, depriving Vermeulen of the  chance to \ntake the  fight to the  last  round in Magny-Cours. All  this \novershadowed events in Race 1, where Vermeulen had \ntaken victory in difficult conditions. The  race started \nwet, then the  track began to dry out  as  he and  Corser \nsought to  master both each other and  the  conditions. \nAt  the end  there was only 0.297s between them, with \nHaga a  distant third, Toseland fourth, Martin fifth and \nWalker sixth. Six different manufacturers in the  top six \nwas a vindication of FGSport’s decision to  go with the \none-make tyre rule; it was  just a shame that the  rain \ncame down and  decided everything. \nThere was still  plenty to fight for at  Magny-Cours \n—  apart from first and  second places in the  standings \n—  and  even new champ Corser and  Vermeulen wanted \nto end  the  season on a high. Troy was  taken out  of the \nequation early on  with a  disastrous Superpole, through \nno  fault of his own. Unknown to  him, at least until \nthe  first turn or  so,  a team member had  over-inflated \nhis  rear  tyre by a substantial margin and he spent the \nwhole lap slipping and  sliding around the  track with \nclouds of smoke coming from his  rear  tyre. Entertaining \nto watch, but  an  unsatisfactory 16th-quickest lap time \nand  a fourth-row start as  a  result, so  it’s to  his credit \nhe still  found the  hunger to fight his way up to fifth in \nthe first race and  an  even better fourth in the  second. \nVermeulen continued his run  of good form by leading \nfrom the  start of Race 1 and  was  never headed on  his \nway to  a comfortable eight-second victory. Kagayama \ntook second with Toseland third and  Muggeridge \nfourth, not  far ahead of the  charging Corser. The  start \nof Race 2 witnessed one  of the  most dramatic first-lap \npile-ups in Superbike history. Pitt  and Muggeridge got \ntangled up as  they left the  start line, causing widespread \ncarnage. Wild card Julien Da  Costa hit Bussei, who was \nalready on  the  deck, with Martin another unwilling \nfaller. Bussei suffered concussion and  hurt his  neck and \nshoulder, Martin damaged his  kidney, with Muggeridge \nneeding stitches in his head after his footpeg gouged its \nway into  and under his  helmet. Pitt  skinned his  hands \nbut, like  Da  Costa, made it back for the  restart. No such \ndrama at the  second time of asking as  Vermeulen and \nLanzi battled for the  win, but then Chris's rear  sprocket \nbroke, leaving the  young Italian to take an  unchallenged \nvictory. Good friends off the  track, but  fierce opponents \non  it, Kagayama and  Haga fought tooth and  nail  for \nsecond, with the  Suzuki rider taking the  honours \nater the  Yamaha's tyres faded. It had  been a  long, \nhard season, but  one  of the  elder statesmen of World \nSuperbike had  proved that, with the  right bike and  the \nright team, anything Is possible. \n‘During my years with Petronas, | never doubted my \nability to win  another title,’ said Corser, ‘| knew that all | \nneeded was the  right bike and  the  right team. For years \nI've  seen the  Alstare set-up in the  paddock and  always \nwanted to  ride  for  Francis Batta, so  when | got the  call, \n| didn't hesitate for a second. We  put in a lot of hard \nwork before the  season began, did a lot of testing and  it \npaid off  big time.’ \nCHAPTER \n18 \nLeft: Troy Corser leads the \ncharge of the  heavy brigade \nat the  Eurospeedway \nLausitz. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 195"

The veteran Aussie proved that his  time \naway from World Superbike had  honed rather than \ndiminished his skills, and his  hunger to win  was as  strong \nas  ever. He  led  the  championship from the  first round \nand, despite a few  crashes along the  way, failed to  finish \njust twice all season. Only runner-up James Toseland on \nthe  Ten  Kate Honda was more consistent but  his  three \nvictories throughout the  year were dwarfed by Bayliss’s \ntwelve wins, and Troy suitably wrapped up  the  title with \none round to  go  at  Ducati’s home track, Imola. He  then \ncrowned a  superb season by winning the  last  MotoGP \nrace of the  year at Valencia to  show that Superbikers \ncan  win  in MotoGPs. It had  been five  years since his first \nWorld Superbike title, but  once the  season got  into its \nStride his  rivals knew that Bayliss would be  hard, if not \nimpossible, to  stop. \nAfter the  fire  sale  that saw both Toseland and Regis \nLaconi thrown out  of the  official Ducati team at  the \nend of 2005, Bayliss was seen as  the  man to  reinstate \nthe  Italian manufacturer's position at  the  top  of the \nSuperbike pile and he  didn’t disappoint. Not  even a \nhorrible wrist injury while doing a  spot of winter off- \nroading prevented the  Australian from starting the  new \nyear in  aggressive mode right from the  first tests \nIf the  injury caused any  discomfort or  pain it was \nnever acknowledged, and at  the  end of a  gruelling day’s \ntesting he would just  say, ‘| guess it gets a  bit  sore when \nI'm  done riding, but  it’s  no  problem really.’ \nBayliss’s team-mate in  the  Xerox Ducati squad \nwas the  young Italian hope Lorenzo Lanzi, having his \nfirst full  year as  a  factory rider, but  a  family tragedy \ngot  his season off  to  a  slow start and  although he \nmustered two podiums at  Valencia, he  never looked like \nthreatening the  rostrum again \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 199"

Here seven \nriders fell  in a  dramatic \ndomino effect. \nXerox Ducati were once more the  only real  factory \nteam contesting the  nineteenth running of the \nchampionship, unless you  count Foggy Petronas —  and \nmost people didn’t. The  main differences between the \n2006 FO6  Ducatis and  the  previous year’s models were \nthe  electronics and  suspension. Bayliss and Lanzi had  the \nbenefit of the  superbly working Magneti Marelli traction \ncontrol system with Ohlins TTX20 upside-down forks \nand  TTX36 rear  shocks. Their traction control was  far \nbetter than any  rival  offerings and  allowed Bayliss and \nLanzi to  get away with things the  rest  could only dream \nabout. \nDucati’s B teams consisted of Team Berik Sterilgarda, \nwith the  experienced Ruben Xaus partnered by Marco \nBorciani, and  Ducati SC  Caracchi with affable ex-GP \nrider Robby Rolfo on  board. It’s  hard to  know in which \ncategory to  put Pedercini’s Ducatis, as  they were running \n999RS machines which many considered well past their \nsell-by date. They started the  season with a three-rider \nline-up of Lucio Pedercini, lvan Clementi and  young \nGerman hopeful Max Neukirchner, but  after yet another \ncrash due  to technical problems on  the  outdated bikes \nMax decided that he’d had  enough, limping away before \ndoing any  serious damage to  himself. \nWhen Ducati got rid  of Toseland, their 2004 World \nChampion, James found himself in an  awkward position. \nHe was entertaining all and  sundry at the  piano in a  hotel \nbar  in Imola after the  last  race  of 2005 but  had  no  ride \nlined up for 2006, so  when Ten Kate Honda threw him \na  lifeline he grabbed it eagerly. The  previous incumbent, \nChris Vermeulen, had  departed to the  perceived holy \ngrail of MotoGP and  the  Dutch outfit were looking for \na title  contender to  partner Aussie Karl  Muggeridge. \nToseland, and  all the  Honda riders, struggled with a \ntraction control system far inferior to those of Ducati, \nSuzuki and  Yamaha (as witnessed by James's regular \ntyre-smoking antics) and it is greatly to  his credit that he \nwas able to finish the  season in second spot. \nPierfrancesco Chili was riding for  DFX Treme Honda \nin what would be his swan-song season, together \nwith his young pupil, Michel Fabrizio. There was also \nanother Honda team of note —  Klaffi Honda —  and  the \nGerman outfit had  signed MotoGP star  Alex Barros. \nThe  Brazilian was obviously a class act,  but  his generally \npoor performances in qualifying usually left  him  with too \nmuch work to  do come race day. \nAlstare Suzuki retained 2005 champ Troy Corser \nand  Yukio Kagayama. They had  come out  of the \nStarting blocks the  previous year firing on  all cylinders, \nbut  the  2006 season would turn out  to  be one of \ndisappointment, especially for  Corser, who only"

Kagayama’s podium at the  previous \nround had  been just the  confidence boost he needed \nand  that, together with a  productive test  at  Brno one \nmonth earlier, allowed him to  take two comfortable \nvictories. Toseland had  to  settle for second in Race 1, \nafter leading the  charge early on,  with Fabrizio third. \nKagayama’s screaming start in the  second race left  the \nrest  trailing and  the  main battle for the  minor podium \nplaces was between Haga, Corser and  Fabrizio. Michel \nhad  only qualified 12th, but  there was something about \nBrno that suited the  young Roman and  an  even better \nresult was in store. He  went into  the  final chicane in \nfourth place, then pulled out  an  audacious move, block \npassed Corser, pushed Haga wide and  emerged ahead \nof his two vastly more experienced rivals. At the  flag \nthe  trio  were separated by less  than 0.083s, with Haga \ntaking third. The  Japanese rider and  the  Aussie were \nunited, though, in  their comments about the  Italian’s \nantics: ‘What he did  was plain crazy. He  could've taken \nall three of us  out  there!’ Troy Corser had  missed the \nBrno test  after his son  had  kindly given him  chicken pox, \nbut  his fifth and  fourth showed that he was getting \nback to form. \nAnother favourite circuit for fans, if not  always for \nriders, loomed large next. Brands Hatch’s natural setting, \nwith the  crowds close to  the  action, witnessed Bayliss \nand Lanzi wearing Superman-style leathers on  race day. \nThe rest of the  field could have used some Kryptonite \nin the  first race as  the  Aussie got  back to winning ways, \ngiving Ducati its  250th victory in  World Superbike. \nSecond went to  local favourite Toseland, with Haga third \nand Pitt  fourth. Race 2 saw Haga’s well-overdue first \nwin  of the  year and his  entry into  the  record books as \nBrands Hatch’s most successful racer in  the  21st century, \nwith four wins from six  starts. Second was the  perennial \nAbove: The  Aussie fans \ndidn't care as  long as  one \nTroy won. \nLeft: Frankie Chili bids an \nemotional farewell to  the \nBrands Hatch fans. \nBelow: Chris Walker gave \nKawasaki their first  World \nSuperbike win since 2000, \nin appalling conditions \nat  Assen. \nie \nWorld Superbikes: The First 20  Years 205"

      "text": "the  celebrations would have to  stay on  hold for at  least \nanother round. \nIf a  Ducati rider is going to win  a  championship then \nthere is  no  better place than at  their home track, Imola. \nBayliss didn’t need to win  or  do anything spectacular \nto  take the  title, and  his cruise round the  4.959-km \ncircuit to  fifth place in  Race 1 was all that was required \nto  send the  Ducati fans into  a frenzy of flag-waving \nand  celebration. Barros was in  eighth at  the  end  of \nthe  first lap of Race 1 and  then had  to  keep clear of \ncrashes before starting his charge. This was to  be the \nBrazillan’s day. He  rode with all the  poise and experience \nof his GP  days to  take his  first-ever World Superbike \nvictory and become the  eighth different winner of the \nseason. Second was Toseland, with Pitt  and  Haga third \nand  fourth. By the  time Bayliss returned to  the  pit lane \nafter his cool-down lap he was already wearing a  2007 \nWorld Champion T-shirt, but  if anybody thought he'd \nbe  resting on  his  laurels in  the  second race they were to \nbe  disappointed. With all the  pressure off,  he stormed \nto  his eleventh win of the  season, with Barros a  superb \nsecond and Kagayama third. Pitt  took fourth ahead of \nToseland, with Haga an  indifferent sixth. And what of \nthe  outgoing champion? Another depressing afternoon \nfor  Corser saw him retire in  Race 1 —  he  said his  gearbox \nwas finding false neutrals —  and struggle to  seventh in \nthe  second race as  a  result of a  spinning rear  tyre. He \nAbove left: A life-size cut- \nout  of Toseland brought \nby one of his  many loyal \nfollowers. \nwas now a lowly sixth in  the  championship standings \n—  hard to  believe after his success the  year before. \nAlthough the  title  was decided, the  Magny-Cours \ncrowd were treated to two of the  finest races of the \nyear after qualifying sessions blighted by bad  weather, \ndelays, crashes and  oil spills. Corser responded to \nthe  unwelcome news that he was to  be  replaced in \nthe  Alstare team for  2007 by GP  refugee Max Biaggi \nby taking the  38th Superpole of his  career and then \nfighting hard for a  third in  the  first race and  second in \nRace 2, showing his  new employers Yamaha that he  still \nhad  the  desire and  belief to  compete at  the  highest level. \nToseland had been fast  throughout practice and \nqualifying and  determinedly kept Haga at  bay  in  Race \n1, although his  margin of victory was just  0.115s, with \nCorser only 0.4s behind. Bayliss had been a contender \nthroughout the  23-lapper, but  faded at  the  end. In  the \nsecond race he showed just  why he was the  champion \nDespite being battered by Corser, Toseland and Haga \nhe  fought his  way to  victory, setting a  new lap record \nin  the  process. He  took the  final flag of the  season \n1.282 seconds ahead of Corser, with Toseland third \n—  enough for  the  Briton to  secure runner-up spot in \nthe  championship —  and Haga fourth. The  top  four \nhad  traded paint several times throughout the  race, a \nfitting end  to  a  championship which saw a different Troy \n(Bayliss this  time) take the  title, and deservedly so \nAbove right: Supermen \nfor  the  weekend —  Lorenzo \nLanzi and  Troy Bayliss at \nBrands Hatch. \nLeft: Toseland and Corser \nget down to  business. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 207"

Joining him  from the \nDucati SC  Caracchi team was Roby Rolfo. The  likeable \nItalian was fairly consistent throughout the  season and \nwas even on  course for a  podium at  Monza, but  a  ‘fuel \nsupply problem’ prevented him  from what would've \nbeen his  best result of the  year.

The  scene \nwas shown on  live TV,  much to the  amusement of all \nand  sundry, but very much in keeping with the  relaxed \natmosphere of World Superbike. There were no  such \n‘oddities’ in Race 2. Xaus was again in contention for \nthe  first 11  laps or  so,  but  was then passed by Toseland, \nHaga and Biaggi and  gradually lost  touch with the trio \nas  the  race wore on.  James took the victory from Max, \nwho'd squeezed past the  Japanese rider just three \ncorners from the  end; Bayliss finished sixth, the  2006 \nchamp now 61  points adrift of series leader Toseland. \nThe  Assen round normally takes place in September, \nbut  this  year the  event was switched to April. Well- \nprepared Assen fans always turn up for  races with \nwaterproofs —  they certainly came in handy in 2006 \n—  but  the  weather gods were in a good mood for \nRound 5 and  the  rainwear stayed packed away on  race \nday. Toseland won the  first race by a  hair  from Haga, \nwith Xaus third. The  second race then witnessed one \nof the  greatest battles in World Superbike history, with \nToseland and  Bayliss wheel to wheel for almost the \nentire distance. It came down to the  final turn, Bayliss \ngetting through an  impossible gap  and  taking the  win \nby just 0.009s. Biaggi was a  long way back in third but \nstill  second in the  championship, as  he  had  been since \nthe  second round. \nA huge number of fans came to  Monza, the  first of \nthe  three scheduled Italian rounds, and many of them \npacked the  paddock to  try and get an  autograph or \nphoto with their hero, Max Biaggi. His  team had  to  hire \nthree beefy security guards to  ensure his safe passage \nfrom pits to  hospitality or  motorhome. The  crowd \n216 World Superbikes: The  First 20  Years \nX y 2 \nfigures quoted by the  organisers suggested over 75,000 \nwere there on  race day alone, and  it sometimes seemed \nas  if most of them were in the  paddock. Those that did \nfill the  grandstands, though, didn’t get the  result they \nwanted, a win  from either Biaggi or  Ducati. Instead the \nday belonged to  Haga, who took both wins in comfort \nand in style. The  first was like  a stroll in the  Monza \nwoods, as  he took victory by well over eight seconds \nfrom Bayliss, with Biaggi third and  Toseland fourth. The \nsecond was more of a  brisk hike, though the  margin \nof victory was still  quite substantial —  2.691 seconds. \nToseland, Bayliss, Rolfo and  Biaggi were all  in contention \nfor the  runner-up spot until the  final lap when Troy and \nMax clashed with each other at the  exit  of Ascari. Biaggi \nhad  run  wide and  collided with Bayliss when he  rejoined \nthe  track, the  impact bending the  Suzuki's clutch lever \nout  of position so  the  clutch didn’t work when he tried \nto  slow down for the  Parabolica. Biaggi was forced to \nstamp on  the  rear brake to  try and reduce his speed \nand in doing that ran  onto the  kerbstones and nearly \ncrashed. By then Toseland, Rolfo and  Bayliss were gone. \nRolfo was ready to  take his first podium of the  year, but \nwith the  line  almost in sight his  Honda ran  out  of fuel, \nleaving Bayliss to  inherit third. \nEarly on  race day Silverstone was hit  by heavy rain, \nthen by an  absolute deluge and  Race 1 took place in \nsoaking wet conditions that had  most of the  21  two- \nwheeled gladiators slipping, sliding and  crashing.

Reigning champion \nBayliss kept his  head and  somehow brought his  FO7 \nDucati home in  one piece to take the  chequered flag, \ntwo seconds ahead of Haga, with Corser filling the  final \npodium spot.

They were not \ndisappointed, for Toseland took a  remarkable double, \nwith Corser second and  Biaggi third in the  first race. \nJames's title aspirations were helped by two of his \nnearest rivals, Haga and  Bayliss, crashing out  and  he \nwas full  of confidence for  Race 2, which saw a real \ndogfight between him  and  Haga for over three-quarters \nof the  race distance. In the  end, Haga had  to  concede \nvictory to James, with the  margin of victory just over \n1.5  seconds. Corser took third, with Fabrizio fourth \nand Kagayama fifth despite being in pain from a  heavy \ncrash in the  first  race. Toseland’s double was his first \nin World Superbike and  he was so  happy that, on  the \ncooling-down lap,  he stopped on  the front straight, \nstripped off  his  leathers and  then hurled them into  the \ncrowd. He  left  Brands Hatch with a  66-point lead in \nthe  series over his  nearest rival, Haga, with Biaggi close \nby in third. Bayliss was now nearly a  hundred points \nadrift of Toseland, something nobody would have \nthought possible at the  start of the  year. With three \nrounds remaining the  Briton had  one strong hand on \nthe  trophy, but  Haga and  Biaggi were not  giving up the \nchase yet. \nIt’s  hard to find beauty in the  monolith that is the \nEurospeedway Lausitz, and not  easy to  believe it’s  a \nplace for good racing. The  crowd, trapped as  they are \nin the  only place they can  go,  have a  reasonable view \nof the  track action, but  the  complex is so  vast that it \nonly really comes to  life  if there over 100,000 spectators \nthere. No  such luck for World Superbikes, whose \nweekend crowd figure of 49,000 looked respectable \nrather than remarkable. Haga won Race 1 by 11  seconds \nafter Bayliss's tyre faded. Biaggi took advantage to  take \nsecond place, with Corser third. Series leader Toseland \nsuffered a swinging-arm problem, but  instead of pulling \nout  he  kept going and  finished in ninth. Bayliss and \nHaga once again led  the  charge in the  second race, but \nthis  time Troy got  his  revenge, beating Nori by 1.353s at \nthe  flag. Biaggi was third, some 13  seconds or  so  back, \nwith Toseland a  gritty fourth despite a tyre problem. \nVallelunga was the  event that FGSport had been \nwanting to  stage ever since they took over the  series, \nbut  until this  year there was no  reason to  hold a  race \nat what is, at  best, a club circuit. With a certain Max \nBiaggi taking part, though, they finally had  enough"

      "text": "ammunition. How the track was homologated is \nanybody's guess, because there were at least three \nareas which gave cause for concern. When Troy Corser \nasked for some airfencing at the  dangerous exit  of the \nlast  turn he was told that it was not  possible because \nthe  airfence might intrude onto the  ripple strips. The \npaddock was nowhere big enough for all the  teams, \nso  the  support classes were out  in fields with minimal \nfacilities a  long way from the  pits. The Saturday \nafternoon press conference had  to  be cancelled because \npolice and  security officials, despite being there in \nhuge numbers, could not  or  would not  guarantee the \nsafety of the  riders going to  and  from the  pits. It was \na  logistical nightmare, to  say the  least, but  happily the \nracing, especially on  TV,  was good and  there were no \naccidents or  serious injuries. As  more than one rider said \nafterwards, though, ‘We were lucky today. \nOf course the  fairytale would not  have been \ncomplete without a  Biaggi win  and  fortunately, for \nthe  massive crowd present, he duly obliged in Race \n1, overtaking Bayliss after three laps and  then never \nheaded on  his way to  an  historic victory. Toseland was \nthird, ahead of Haga. Throughout the  season Biaggi \nhad  shown, more than any  other rider, that he was \nthe  smoothest racer out  there, best able to conserve \nhis tyres and  still  run  fast  at the  end  of a  race. He \nobviously wanted to  do the  double, but  Bayliss spoiled \nthe  Roman’s party. Troy led  most of the  race, apart from \na six-lap stint by Haga, but  was back in control, with \nBiaggi second, with five  laps to  go.  Then Max made a \nmistake and  ran  wide, allowing Bayliss just the  breathing \nspace he  needed to  ease away and  take the  chequered \nflag. Biaggi was 1.431s behind at the  finish line, with \nHaga third and  Corser fourth. Toseland crashed at the \nvery slow hairpin but  once again remounted to  take 11th \nplace, but  his  lead over second-placed Biaggi was down \nto  29  points, with Haga just four points further back. \nNow both Toseland’s pursuers were scenting blood. \nThe  odds were still  stacked heavily in James \nToseland’s favour when the  teams arrived for the  final \nshowdown at  Magny-Cours, and normally a  29-point \nadvantage would seem pretty good, but  an  incident \non  the  opening lap of the first race nearly changed \neverything. Lanzi’s fall  at Turn 1 almost caused James \nto  crash. He  managed to stay onboard his  Honda, but \navoiding the  crash dropped him  way down the  order \nand  suddenly, for  Haga and Biaggi, there was light and \npossible glory at the  end  of the  tunnel. Toseland finished \nseventh, with Haga the  biggest benefactor thanks to \nhis win. Biaggi was sixth —  not  out  of contention, but \nknowing now that only a win  and poor results from \nthe  other two would give him  the  title. The  final race \nwas a tense and  nervy affair, which Haga duly won, but \nToseland’s sixth place was enough to give him  the  title \nby just two points. It was a fitting send-off to  a  rider \nwho has  graced the  World Superbike Championship \nsince 2001 and will  ply his trade in MotoGP in 2008. \nAfterwards he said, ‘It’s  hard to  believe that I've \nbeen in this  championship for seven years. | have really \nenjoyed racing against the  likes of Bayliss, Haga, Biaggi, \nCorser and  the  rest  of the  guys and  am  proud to  have \nbeaten them and  taken the  title. The  trophy | won in \n2004 has  been sitting on  the  shelf and getting a  bit \nlonely, so  | thought I'd  better get  it some company. | \nknew that I'd  be going to  MotoGPs three races before \nthe  end  of the  season, but  | was determined to  leave as \na  champion —  for  myself, my family, the Ten  Kate team \nand  everybody who has  helped and  supported me.’ \nToseland has  been dealt more than his fair  share of \nhard knocks in life,  but  every time he  has  bounced back \nmore strongly. His  title win in 2004 was a testament to \nhis determination to overcome all odds, and  if anything \n2007 was a  much harder task, but  one  that he once \nagain accomplished though his strength, resilience \nand  consistency —  a truly worthy champion for World \nSuperbike’s 20th year. \nAbove: Bayliss and  Haga \nled  Race 1 at  Brands Hatch, \nbut  both crashed out. \nUpper left: Toseland leads \nCorser through the  Ascari at \nMonza. \nLower left: Corser and \nhis Yamaha part  company, \nBayliss looks on. \nWorld Superbikes: The  First 20  Years 219"

So  I’d  like  to  thank the  man \nwho \nstarted \nit \nall, \nSteve \nMcLaughlin, \nand \nthe \nmen who picked up  the  ball  and ran  with it, \nMaurizio and Paolo Flammini, for their faith \nin Superbike. \nMotorcycle racing should be fun  and \nthankfully the  people involved in the  World \nSuperbike Championship have always \nremembered that. This has  never stopped \nthem from competing at the  highest level \nhowever. \nThanks also to  the  Haynes team of Mark \nHughes and  Flora Myer and  Lee  Parsons, and \nto  Kay  Edge for  her  eagle-eyed subbing. \nFinally, | must say  thanks to  my  wife \nWendy who has  had  to  put  up  with my \nregular excursions to  race tracks and other \nstrange motorcycle-connected behaviour. \nJULIAN RYDER \nCheshire, 2008 \nwould \nlike  \nto \nthank \nmy  \nwife \nKay \nfor \nall \nher \ntremendous support and understanding \nthroughout the  20  years of the  World \nSuperbike Championship, particularly all  her \nhard work and  the  hours spent editing this \nedition of the  book, but  especially for  putting \nup with my  frequent excursions. She  was one \nof the  few  people who didn’t think | was mad \nto  leave the  Grand Prix  scene in  1988 for the \nunknown joys of World Superbikes —  though \n| bet  even she  didn’t think that I'd still  be \ninvolved in it two decades later! \nWarmest thanks to  all at  Haynes, but \nespecially to  Carole Bohanan who designed \nthis  wonderful new edition of the  book. \n| would also like  to thank all the  riders, \nmechanics and  team personnel who have \nmade the  Superbike scene a  great place \nto work and  a  good place to  have a  party. \nMany a  Sunday night has  been spent in \ntheir company and many have become good \nfriends, particularly Fred Merkel —  the  first \nchampion. He  was a  great ambassador for the \nseries when it started, and  quickly became a \ntravelling companion and  friend of the  family. \nIn latter years many an  enjoyable evening \nhas  been spent in the  company of Scott \nRussell, Troy Corser and  James Toseland; \nall race hard and  know how to  have fun \nafterwards. \nThanks \nalso \nto \nFrancis \nand \nPatricia \nBatta for  employing this  freelancer ten  years \nago \nand \nmaking \nsure \nhe \nwas \nwell \nfed \nand \nwatered in their hospitality unit. \nWhen the  championship first  started, there \nwere \nonly \nsmall \ntrucks \nand \nhardly \nany \ncatering, \nbut \nnow \nthat \nWorld \nSuperbikes \nis \na \nglobal \nphenomenon that has  changed to  packed \npaddocks \nof \nsemi-trailers \nand \nlavish \nhospitality \nunits. What has  not  changed from those \nearly days, though, is the  warm and  friendly \natmosphere; on  the  track it’s war, but  off  it \nthe \nriders, \nmechanics \nand \npress \nall \nmix \nfreely \nand manage to  have fun. \n| am  happy to  have joined the World \nSuperbike Championship right at the  very \nbeginning and I’m  even happier to  be still \ninvolved with it today. \nKEL EDGE \nLondon, 2008"
