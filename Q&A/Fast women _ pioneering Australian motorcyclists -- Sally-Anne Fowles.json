FOREWARD 3   1 \nFOREWORD \nTo  a  motorcyclist, the  reason we  ride needs no  explanation, but  for those unfamiliar with the joy and sense \nof freedom it brings, it can  only be described as  an  unparalleled experience of simultaneous exhilaration and \npeace. Exhilaration through the adrenalin hit we  get from the  sensation of flying through the  air, unimpeded \nby a steel cage, with the wind passing over you  and the roar  of the engine in your ears. And peace, as you  exist \ntotally in the  moment, undistracted, focused only on  carving the  corner ahead or just relaxing and  taking in \nthe scenery and  scents. \nWith so  much to offer, this sport, this activity, this passion, is increasingly being enjoyed by girls and women \nalong with boys and men. Participating in competition, supporting the sport through journalism, running club \nevents, or simply getting on  a bike to ride recreationally no  longer raises eyebrows. The women in this book are \nthe  reason why. They have pioneered the way forward and  are  the  reason we  now see  more women realising \nthe opportunities, friendships and  passion that comes from being on  two  wheels. \n| wish | had  had this  book when | was a little girl. Every page inspires courage, determination, individualism \nand achievement. No  matter what your aspirations as  a  motorcyclist, these stories will  help you realise your \nown riding dream and, if not already, will  see  you  appreciate motorcycling in a whole new light. \nTania Lawrence \nFIM Oceania and Motorcycling Australia President 2015-16 \n\n2  3 FASTWOMEN. \n* \nS \na — ‘ is \n¢ i \n> - \n© \n= \na \n2 Mi, \np co \n< \n: - an ; \n7 as oa \n¢ _ \nww as a: \na es) — \n, = \naf \n5 \n\nINTRODUCTION 2%  3 \nINTRODUCTION \n“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you  didn’t do \nthan by the ones you  did do. \nSo, throw off the bowlines.

The  Yamaha Agricultural ‘Ag’ bike was a crucial work horse to  Dad and Mum, \ntransporting them around our  3000-acre property and used for  rounding up the  cattle and sheep, with our \nworking dog Jack’ always perched on  the back. This bike was more than just a source of fun for me,  it delivered \nthe exhilaration of simply being myself and  being within myself as | zoomed across the dusty paddocks, racing \nthe grain trains that thundered past. \nAs for many country kids, the  bright lights of city life beckoned and  | headed off for Sydney at the  age  of \n18, so  beginning a 20-year hiatus from being aboard a  bike. My weekly ‘fix’ was my  pilgrimage to the  Harley \nDavidson dealership in Chatswood every weekend. | was  19 when my ultimate vision of motorcycle perfection, \nthe \nHarley \nDavidson \n‘Fat \nBoy’, \nwas \nreleased. \nArmed \nwith \nthe \nmarketing \nbrochure \nand \na \ngenuine \npair \nof \nHarley \nDavidson \nboots, \nbut \nnot \nwith \nfinancial \nsavvy, \nthe \ndream \nslipped \naway \nfrom \nme, \nhowever \nit \nwas  \nclearly \nimprinted \nfirmly in the  recesses of my subconscious. \n\n4  3s  FASTWOMEN \nFortune found me  when | met my  wonderful husband, lan,  whose life-long passion and exuberance for \nmotorcycles reignited the flame that resided in me.  With lan’s encouragement and support and Mark Twain's \ninspirational quote singing in  my  ears, at the  ripe age  of 38,  | gained my  road licence, and so  followed the \nexhilarating and  challenging journey of learning that lead to owning my dream Harley Davidson Fat Boy. \nIn 2013, as  my  passion grew, | went searching for stories about like-minded women that | could relate to \nand  women who had  previously discovered the joy of motorcycling. | soon came to  realise these stories were \nhard to find. Where could | find the  literature that presented Australian women’s stories that | craved to  read? \nAs any  avid motorcyclist understands, a journey to a  newsagent or  bookstore is a constant search for writing \nthat satisfies the  rider’s soul. After placing a very simple advertisement in the  free, ‘Can you help?’ section of \nthe Adelaide Advertiser ‘Sunday Mail; | was inundated with phone calls and-emails from women and men who \nexpressed heartfelt stories of themselves, their mothers, aunts and  sisters, aboard their two-wheeled steeds. \nEvery story, every expression and every photo received, told me  that | was on  the  tip of a very inspiring and \nhistorically significant ‘iceberg’ \nMy only recollection of History class during my high school years, yes,  relayed facts from ancient Greece to \nWorld War Il. But for me,  and | would imagine for many students, it didn’t feel  real. In my teenaged brain, there \nwas no  link to the fact that my predecessors were no  different in anatomy to me,  had the same life concerns — \nmaking a crust, paying the bills and  raising children and  pursued their enjoyment and  passion wherever it laid. \nBut these incredible women’s stories that poured in from my advertisement struck a chord. \nThe importance of telling these stories now really hit home while caring for our  2% year old granddaughter, \nwho was  playing with two toy motorbikes, | said to her “Are they your motorbikes?” and she said matter of factly, \n“No Nanny, girls don’t have motorbikes!” \nHad \nsomeone \ntold \nher \nthis  \nor  \nwas \nit \nsimply \nthat \nshe  \nhad  \nonly \nobserved \nlittle \nboys \non  \ntheir \nPee \nWee \n50s  \nin \nrural \nSouth \nAustralia? \nIn \nthis \nsame \nweek \nmy \nbeloved \nfather \nhad \nturned \n80! \nMany \nof \nthe \nwomen \nfeatured \nin \nthe \nbook, \nowned \nand \nrelished \ntheir \nmotorcycles \nmany \nyears \nbefore \nmy \nfather \nwas \neven \nborn. \nThankfully \nfor  \nmy \n\n, INTRODUCTION 3%  5 \nbeautiful granddaughters, the  world is now more open for them to  live  their dreams and to  explore, dream \nand  discover. \nSo, with that, | am  extremely grateful and humble that | have the opportunity to present \n‘FAST WOMEN -  pioneering Australian motorcyclists: \nSally-Anne Fowles \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1 MISS JANE QUEAN “   7 \nMISS JANE QUEAIN \nAUSTRALIAN TRAILBLAZER \nMiss Jane Queain was most certainly an  extraordinary woman. Although little is known about her  life, she  is \nconsidered one of the  earliest pioneering female motorcyclists in Australia and it is understood that she was \nthe first lady in South Australia to ride her own machine. \nMiss Queain grew up in Minlaton on  the Yorke Peninsula of South Australia, approximately 125  miles (202 km) \nto the west of Adelaide. In the early 1900s Minlaton was  considered remote from the capital city Adelaide, as \nhorse-powered vehicles were mainly of the four-legged variety. \nJane was a  well known teacher of music and art  and her  dedication saw her  driving her  pair of ponies \nin a  loop of approximately 150  km  over rocky, unsealed, challenging roads to  regularly reach her  students. \nFinding that she  lost  considerable time travelling these distances, in April of 1913 she  decided to  purchase a \nmotorcycle, a 234 (horsepower) Douglas. The fact that Miss Queain was  able to acquire her Douglas, considering \nshe \nresided \non \nthe \nother \nside \nof \nthe \nglobe \nfrom \nher \nacquisition, \nwas \nquite \nastounding \nas \nmotorcycles \nwith \ninternal \ncombustion \nengines \nwere \nonly \nmade \ncommercially \navailable \nin \nEurope \nin \nthe \nlate \n1880s \nand \nit \nwas \nat \na \ntime \nwhen \nproduct \nmarketing \nwas \nminimal \nand \nfreight \nservices \nwere \nslow. \nCapturing \nmore \nthan \njust \na \nmoment \nin \nhistory, \nthe \nonly \nknown \nphotograph \nof \nMiss \nQueain \nreflects \nthe \nstyle \nof \nthe \nera.  \nWearing \npants \nor  \neven \nskirts \nabove \nthe  \nankle \nwas \ncertainly \nnot  \nconsidered \nappropriate \nattire \nfor \na \n\n8   =s  FASTWOMEN \nwoman in the  early 20th century, so  Jane wore her full  length silk skirts and gowns on  her teaching rounds \nand  only her large leather gauntlet gloves for protection. As for comfort, her Douglas motorcycle was in-itself \na challenge! With only a minimal bicycle-type seat, springer front end  and  no  rear  shocks it certainly would not \nhave been the most hospitable form of transport on  the  rough, unsealed roads of country South Australia. But \nJane loved it and  her first feelings of nervousness soon wore off! \n“Now | don’t seem to be able to travel fast enough” she declared. \n“I've had one  or  two  falls, but that’s all in the game. Once the skirt of my silk dustcoat became caught in the \nflywheel, and then | nearly went. | managed to pull up in time, however, and released it. On several occasions I’ve \nrun  over snakes, but they were only small ones. All the girls on  the Peninsula are in love with my Douglas, and | think \nthat very soon many others will get motor cycles. | save quite two-thirds of my time now, and not only is the machine \nquicker than ponies, but it is also more convenient. There is nothing to compare with motor cycling, and I'm sorry for \nthose poor people who cannot indulge in it. It is wonderfully exhilarating, and it is impossible to describe the glorious \nsensation that one gets when travelling on a speedy machine. I’m glad I've got a motor cycle and | don’t think I'll ever \ngive it up” (The Register, 22 October 1913). \nMiss Jane Queain’s desire for adventure took her from Minlaton to Paris in  1914 to study art and  it is believed \nthat she returned to Australia to teach art at Loreto Catholic School for Girls in Kirribilli, Sydney. \nTo date, Miss Jane Queain’s life story is  a mystery and  who knows if her desire for motorcycling continued? \nPhoto supplied by Mr Michael Mahar (great-nephew) \n\nCHAPTER 2  EVELYN ‘BOBBIE’ROBERTS =  9 \nEVELYN ‘BOBBIE’ ROBERTS \nA GYPSY AT HEART \nAt  3  am, the depths of  the dark, foggy extreme early \nhours of the  morning did  not  bother avid and  courageous \nmotorcyclist Miss Evelyn ‘Bobbie’ Roberts.

Forty Indian machines and  their riders departed Melbourne \non  Christmas Eve, riding 1500 miles (2414 kilometres) along the coastline to Sydney and they were only allowed \nthree days and nights on  the  run  over and five  nights on  the  return journey. \nEvelyn, described as the ‘plucky Richmond girl, was  the only \nfemale rider on  the tour. Riding her beloved Indian Prince and \nwith her never-failing spirit, ‘Bobbie’ relished the challenges of \ntrial riding. As  reported by Motorcycle Sparkings —  The  Truth \n17-12-1927 she “has once again proved that she  is no  mean \nhand as  a motorcyclist. She  is mounted on a solo Indian Prince, \nhas actually shown some of the male members of the club a few \npoints on  the art of driving: Coming down twice while her Indian \nPrince was  negotiating the long run  stretch reportedly made no \ndifference to her geniality. Upon arriving in Sydney more than 100 \nSydney Indian club riders met the Victorians at Tom Ugly’s point.” \nEvery day of the  club's Gypsy Tours was full  to  the  brim of \nriding and revelry. There was great camaraderie amongst the \nclan of  riders and,at the conclusion of  the  day’s long ride, \nthey were hosted to gala dinners and concerts by Indian Club \nmembers of the towns they passed through. Upon their arrival \ninto Sydney, they were treated to  a  moonlight harbour trip \nwhere it was reported that “Those appearing the freshest at the \nconclusion were the girl rider, Miss. R.

Civilians volunteered their time and  services, akin to ‘The Home Guard’ \nin England. \nWomen in  most Australian capital cities formed voluntary motorcycle despatch units, which provided \nAustralia \nwith \na \n‘silent \nservice, \neven \nthough \nmedia \ninterest \nwas \nintense. \nWomen \nriders \nwere \nglamorised, \nand \nidolised \nin \nthe \nmedia, \nreflecting \nthe \ndesire \nof \nthe \nAustralian \nleaders \nto \nkeep \nup \nthe \nmorale \nof \nAustralian \nsociety. \n\n16 “   FASTWOMEN \nThe  need for secrecy was  firmly understood by the Women of Despatch, who delivered crucial messages and \nprovided an  efficient link between wardens, camp barracks, ambulances, and  hospitals, when “on air” methods \nof communications were not advised or if a crisis occurred that rendered normal methods of communications \nout of action. \nThe women’s auxiliary of the  Central Motorcycle Club (Sydney, NSW) was a  driving force behind the \nformation of the  NES Women’s Motorcycle Messenger Corps. Businessman Mr.  M.J. Doogan, attempted to \ninspire many organisations to form this  service. However, most were stretched at the time by the enormity of \nthe  requirement for war  time assistance. Many of the women were taught to ride by Doogan, but for business \nreasons he was  unable to continue the training after a few months. Due to the efforts of Miss Anne McLaughlan \nand Mrs  Margaret Golder, the Corps were able to continue. Realising the  importance of the  despatch service, \nMiss A. McLaughlan, a foundation member of the National Emergency Services ambulance drivers, volunteered \nher time and  skills, undertaking the task of recruiting, and  organising the training programme for the women. \nRecruiting advertisements in  newspapers were easily filled, with many women who were already keen \nmotorcyclists (some belonging to the Sydney Women’s Motorcycle club, see  Chapter 5), answering the call. \nRiding training took place at Centennial Park, Sydney, where women who did not own their own motorcycle \ntrained on a Royal Enfield 2 stroke and were versed in tight manoeuvres, mechanics, first aid and stretcher drills. \nAs reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on  13 August 1940 \n‘NEW WAR UNIT. \nItem \nof \nthe \nproposed \ntraining \nscheme \nfor \nthe  \nNational \nEmergency \nServices \nWomen’s \nMotor \nCycle \nMessenger \nCorps, \nof \nwhich \nthe \nfirst \nannual \ngeneral \nmeeting \ntook \nplace \nat  \n149 \nCastlereagh \nStreet \nlast \nnight. \nMotor \nCycle \nriding \nand \nmaintenance, \nfirst \naid, \nphysical \ntraining, \nsignalling, \nand \nsquad \nfield \ndrill \nwill \nalso \nbe \nincluded \nin \nthe \nprogramme. \nThe \norganisation \nhopes \nto \nprovide \ncommunication \nbetween \nwardens, \nambulances, \nhospitals, \nand \nsimilar \nbodies \nifa \ndisruption \nof \nnormal \ncommunications \noccurred. \nSeveral \nwomen \nmotor \ncyclists \nwere \namong \nthose \npresent. \nMiss \nEve \nWarnaby, \nof \nLiverpool \nhas \nbeen \na \nmotor \ncyclist \nfor \neight \nyears, \nand \ntravelled \nto \ntown \non  \nher \nmachine, \nreturning \n\nCHAPTER 3 THE NES WMMC-WWII °°   17 \nwith Miss Nancy Russell as pillion rider.

Blanchfield honorary assistance secretary, and Miss B. Hanken honorary treasurer. Mr M.J.  Doogan \npresided last night.’ \nMany of the  women were already skilled at  competition scrambling, road racing and hill  climbs. In  1940, \nwomen were not permitted to  compete in  organised, \nlicenced club rides/ races so  they formed their \nown clubs, which in  turn gave them the skill and \ndetermination to  ride their own motorcycles for  the \nservice of their country. \nThe beauty of this tale is that the  Women of the \nNational Emergency Services Women’s Motor Cycle \nMessenger Corps volunteered their own time, paid \nfor  their own uniforms and most supplied their own \nmotorcycles. \n‘Cost of each item of uniform is: Cap, 6s  11d; gloves, \n16s  11d; goggles 2s; NES badge, 1s 6d; arm badges, 2s; \ncoat, \n£3; \nbreeches, \n£1 \n15s; \nboots, \n£1 \n15s. \nEach \nmember \npays \nfor \nown \nuniform, \nwhich \nwas \nsmartly \ntailored \nand \ndark \nblue \nin \ncolour’ \nPIX \nMagazine \n1942 \n(s \n= \nshillings, \nd \n= \npenny, \n£ =  Pound). \nAs \nthe \nsun  \nset \nand \nthe \nshroud \nof \ndarkness \ndescended, \nheadlights \nwere \nnot \nallowed \non \ndespatch \ndeliveries. \nSo,  \nriders \nwere \ntrained \nto  \nride, \ndespatch \nmessages \nand \nNancy Campbell and unknown in uniform. \n\nMiss \nShirley \nWinter, \nLeft, \nand \nMiss \nEve \nWarnaby, \nwomen \nmotorcycle \nmessengers \nof \nthe \nNational \nEmergency \nService, \nriding \ntheir \nRoyal \nEnfield \nand \nVelocette \nmachines \nthrough \nthe \ncity. \nImage \nis \nowned \nby \nAustralian \nWar \nMemorial \n(image \nreference: \n006678). \n\nCHAPTER 3 THE NES WMMC-WWII 3   19 \nrepair their motorcycles even in the  depths of the  night.

By the time, she was  riding Despatch (riding an Ariel), she had owned five \nmachines and covered approximately 40,000 miles (approximately 64,373 km).

The  three sisters were a driving force behind the  inception of \nthe  Club. In the  1930s/40s it was forbidden for women to compete in registered Motorcycle race events. Not \ndeterred, Nancy and her  sisters created a  club where women had the  opportunity to  enjoy the  excitement \nof competing against each other in  all  types of disciplines.

Her  entry into society did \nnot involve debutante dresses and  society balls. Even from an  early age June was  an  enthralling and  believable \nstoryteller, only lying about her age so as to join the Australian Women’s Land Army (AWLA). She did this not for \nrebellion or attention seeking, but only in an  attempt to assist her country and the war  effort. \nWorld War II pressed on, and labour shortages within the farming sector of Australia instigated the formation \nof \nthe \nAWLA. \nJune \naccompanied \nmany \nother \nAuxiliary \nmembers \nwho \nwere \nemployed \nto \nperform \nsuch \nduties \nas \nfruit \nand \nvegetable \nproduction, \nand \nanimal \nhusbandry. \nTo \nbe \neligible \nto \nenlist, \nwomen \nhad \nto \nbe \nbetween \nthe \nages \nof \n18 \nand \n50 \nand \nbe \nBritish \nsubjects \nor \nimmigrants \nfrom \nAllied \nnations. \nThe \nmajority \nof \nwomen \noriginated \nfrom \ncity \nareas \nas \nthey \nwere \nnot \neligible \nto \nenlist \nif \nthey \nwere \nalready \na \nfarmer, \na \nrural \nemployee, \nor \na \nrelative \nof \na land holder. \nHer \nfather, \nCouncillor \nand  \nMayor \nof \nRingwood, \nVictoria, \nH.E. \nParker, \nwas  \na \ngreat \ninspiration, \nencouraging \nher \nto \nlive \nher \ndreams \nand \nfollow \nher \nheart. \nJune \nwas  \nborn \ninto \na \nmaternal \nline \nof \nintuitives, \nand  \nraised \nby \nwomen \nwhose \npassionate \nbeliefs \nwere \nspiritualism, \nmetaphysics, \ntarot \ncards \nand \nclairvoyance. \nHer \ngrandmother \nwas \nalways \ntaking \nin \nthe \nhomeless \nand \nmothers \nand \nbabies \nwho \nhad \nnowhere \nto \ngo. \nSo \nJune's \npsyche \nwas \ningrained \nwith \ncompassion, \nempathy \nand \nthe  \nimportance \nof \nhelping \nothers \nin \nneed. \n\nJune \nand \nPat \non \nthe \nverge \nof \ntheir \njourney, \nloading \nup \nwith \nraffle \ntickets. \n\nCHAPTER 4 JUNE PARKER “   25 \nJune \nfell \nin \nlove \nwith \nthe  \nrural \nlifestyle \nshe \nexperienced \nwhilst \nwith \nthe \nAWLA, \nand  \nafter \nthe \nwar  \ndecided \nto \nstick \nto \noutdoor \nlife.  \nShe \nlived \non  \na \ncattle \nstation, \nand  \ntook \nup \nsmoking \nso  \nthat \nshe  \nwould \nbe \nentitled \nto \ntake \na ‘smoko’ with the boys, and developed \nan ambition \nnot only to bring cattle from the Northern \nTerritory \nto \nAdelaide, \nbut also to own her own sheep station. \nHowever, at 21, June's immediate dream was to ride and explore Australia on  a motorcycle. So that is what \nshe did! \nJune purchased her  motorcycle when her father refused her the  use  of the family car  and  she wanted to \nbe independent. With only one hour's teaching before obtaining her  licence, she clocked 4000 miles within a \nyear on  her BSA, and even though June had four brothers and two  sisters, they never borrowed her motorcycle. \nJune was the  embodiment of the  determination of young women who graciously and eagerly filled the \nshoes of  the men who had  been sent to war. It was  a time of great realisation where women who had formerly \nsat  in the culturally-expected background rose to many occasions. \nAfter the war, June’s spirit of adventure guided her to advertise for a female motorcycle riding companion \nto tour and explore Victoria. Her charitable spirit inspired her concept of raising funds for the Returned Services \nLeague (RSL) whilst on  tour. Patriotic work was  nothing new to June as she had  been involved in voluntary Red \nCross work for some years. \nJune Parker had  the ‘gift of the  gab’ and had “an amazing knack of engaging people and getting them swept \nup in whatever was  interesting her at the time.” (A Life Fully Lived by Lesley Antonoff) \nMiss Pat Hansford (21) was the selected woman who answered June’s call and she  became June’s travelling \ncompanion, riding her own motorcycle. Pat was accomplished in her own right. She  spent the wartime years \nwith the  Department of Aircraft Production, where she  introduced a  device which doubled the  output of a \nduplicating \nmachine. \nPat \nwas \ninspired \nand \ndetermined \nto \nbecome \nan \nauthoress \nand \nhad \npreviously \nwritten \nchildren’s \nstories \nwhich \nwere \npublished \nin \nAustralian \nand \nAmerican \nmagazines \nand \npapers. \nSo, \nJune \nand \nPat \nset  \noff \nfrom \nElizabeth \nStreet, \nMelbourne \non  \ntheir \ncharitable \ntour \nof \nVictoria, \nraising \nfunds \n\nJune’s love of motorcycles is evident \nhere whilst experiencing a race meet. \n\nCHAPTER 4 JUNE PARKER %   27 \nfor \nthe  \nMiddle \nPark \nRSL, \nin \naid  \nof \nits \nMemorial \nHall  \nand \nFree \nKindergarten \nBuilding \nFund. \nHandsome \nprizes \nin \nthe \nBuilding \nFund \nAppeal \nincluded \na \nmodern \nhome \nvalued \nat \n£4,000, \na \nDodge \nsedan \nand \nluxury \ncaravan \nand \na \nDodge \nutility. \nJune rode a  BSA 250 and Pat  a  BSA 125. The women were very proud of their motorcycles reporting that \nthey had had no  trouble with the  machines since they started their journey. Their only disappointment was \non  arrival in Cobram —  their bikes were not  as  “spick and span’ as they had been earlier on  their journey, but \nthat was due to heavy rain  and bad  roads. When they departed Cobram their machines were as  bright as  pins. \nIt is reported that the  BSA 250  motorcycle was Australian built and was being tested in general running. It is \nunknown how June acquired the  BSA (Australian produced) test bike and the  history or  outcome of the test \nbike is to date unknown. \n“Women need not  be out of any fun  in motorcycle clubs if they ride  their own machines. Formerly they stayed \nbehind and merely acted in their social sphere. There is nothing wrong with women riding motorcycles provided \nthey do not get machines which are  too heavy for them to handle. There is no difference between a woman riding a \nmotorcycle and a pedal bicycle. Women have more sense than the boys, and are not inclined to show off like the men \ndo.  Women generally are  also more considerate to other people, and that applies to the road as  well” (June Parker \n—  unknown newspaper interview April 1949) \nEvery town brought an  entirely new experience. \nArriving in Rochester (near Echuca), Victoria, well after midnight, they had  no  place to camp. June and  Pat \nfound the Rochester showgrounds and set up camp under a large pepper tree near the pavilions and sale yards. \nWaking up to bright sunshine several hours later, they were rather startled to find themselves surrounded by a \ncrowd of people, in the  midst of a pig sale. June and  Pat hurriedly adjourned to a less crowded area, followed \nby the curious glances of the auctioneers and farmers. \nUnfortunately, their opinion of Echuca as  a  nice town was considerably lowered following the  theft of a \nnumber \nof \narticles \nfrom \ntheir \nmotorcycles, \nwhich \nwere \nparked \noutside \nthe \nlocal \nAstoria \nCafé. \nTheir \nkit, \nincluding \n\n28 =   FASTWOMEN \npromotions flags and  pennants and  their riding goggles was  stolen by lowly thieves while June and Pat were \nhaving supper. \nEven after these events, the two determined women were not daunted and  carried on. \n“People are  wonderful. Anyone else with a motorbike will always stop and do anything to help you. We have met \na lot of nice people and are looking forward to meeting more”. \nLater in life June relayed to  her  daughter, Lesley, that when she  wanted men to  buy tickets from her  she \nwould ensure she was  always sitting down and  would look up slowly at them through her eyelashes. She  said, \n“they always bought more that way!” June was  the  ultimate sales-lady without compromising her integrity! \nSleeping under haystacks, in stables, and  a disused bake house shared with a  horse for company, the two \nwomen generally “roughed it”, but both regarded it as  “good fun” “One evening they could not find somewhere to \nsleep and decided to spend the night in an abandoned barn. They awoke in a panic to the sound of heavy breathing \njust outside their window. They lay awake all night clutching each other and as dawn broke they peeped out to find \nthey were surrounded by a herd of cows”. (A Life Fully Lived by Lesley Antonoff) \nSketchy details in  newspapers reported that Pat  Hansford was injured in  a  car  collision in July of 1949. \nBattered and bruised she  was laid up  in  hospital for  one month. Due to  the  mishap, Pat  was unfortunately \ncompelled to withdraw from the tour. \nJune continued on  alone, successfully completing the fund-raising tour and  satisfying the  dream she  had \noriginally envisaged. \nIn November 1949, the  BSA  250 test  bike was returned and  June's next pride and joy came in the form of a \nTriumph Tiger 100. \nJune had  earned her stripes! Her  months of charitable touring earned her the  respect of the  most revered \nnames in Australian motorcycling of the time. Applauded and invited, June attended Scrambling at Castlemaine \nVic., \nRoad \nracing \nat \nBallarat \nand \nFlinders \nNaval \nBase \nVic., \nMud \nbattling \nat \nGladstone \nPark \nVic., \nGrass \ntrack \nracing \nat \nWarragul, \nand  \nAirstrip \nracing \nat \nValleyfield \nTas.  \nHer \nand  \nher \nclub \ncomrades’ \nbikes \nwere \nnervously \nhoisted \nin \n\nJune and Part leaving Elizabeth Street, Melbourne 1949, \n\nJune, comfortable on  her motorcycle. \n\nCHAPTER 4 JUNE PARKER *   31 \nnets \nonto \nthe \nferry \nto \nTasmania \nto \nattend \nthe \nValleyfield \nraces. \nFaces \nat \nthe  \nrace \nincluded \nlegendary \nAustralian \nracers such as Ken Kavanagh \nand Ray Owens. \nHugh Antonoff unexpectedly came into June's life  when on a slippery road she  lost  control and crashed \nher Triumph Tiger.

Many of \nthe  members of the  club were also associated with the  Central Motor Cycle Club of Sydney to  which their \nhusbands belonged. The Central MCC’s members had the  opportunity to  compete in registered race events \nAustralia-wide, including the 1954 Redex Reliability Trial (Monica’s husband Keith being the outright winner), \nthe  Bathurst Grand Prix  and Ballarat Grand Prix  events. However, in  1948, women competing in events were \nstrictly restricted to  in-club reliability trials. Road racing was forbidden and, even in group recreational rides, \nthe  women were resigned to  riding behind the  men. Many were experienced riders that rode many miles \ninterstate to watch their husbands and  other Central members compete in Grand Prix events. \nYoung, brave and daring, Margaret, Monica and Nancy, along with their friends, \ndid \nnot \nsubmit \nto \nrules \nand \nregulations \nand \nboth \ndefiantly \nand \njoyously \ncreated \nThe \nSydney \nWomen’s \nMotorcycle \nClub \nso \nthat \nthey \ncould \nexperience \nthe \nexhilaration \nof \ncompetition and racing. \nAnd \nso  \nfollows \na \nbeautiful, \nvisual \nportrayal \nof \nthe \nthree \nsisters \nMargaret, \nMonica \nand \nNancy \nDonkin \nand \ntheir \nfriends \nwho \nshared \nin \ntheir \npassion \nfor \nmotorcycling. \né \na \n~ \nMonica \nStewart \n(nee \nDonkin) \nriding \nher sister Nancy's \nmotorcycle. \n\n34 %   FASTWOMEN \nPhotos supplied by —  Margaret Williams (nee Donkin) \nand Monica Stewart (nee Donkin). \nBelow: Nancy Campbell (nee Donkin) riding the bike \nshe rode for the National Emergency Service Despatch \nCorps, note the blackout blades on  the headlight. \nAbove: The Sydney Women’s Motorcycle club in uniform, ready to ride. \nRight: Margaret “Midge” Donkin racing against fellow club member \nonly known as  “Butch” with Mrs.  Margaret Golder (Deputy-Chief \nN.E.S Motorcycle Despatch Corps- see chapter 3) waiving white flag. \n\nOc \n18:pmsioaane \nayn \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 THE THREE SISTERS 37 \nMargaret \n“Midge” \nDonkin \nposing \nfor \nThe \nSun \nNewspaper. \nTo \ndate \nshe \ndoesn't \nknow \nwhy \nthe \njournalist \nasked \nher \nto \nknit. \nShe \nhad \nnever \nknitted \na \nstitch \nin \nher \nlife. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \nCHAPTER 6 WINIFRED WELLS *s  39 \nWINIFRED WELLS \nTHE HEROINE OF AN UNIMAGINABLE EPIC RIDE \n“Travellers on  the  long overland route across Australia were \namazed to see agirl, travelling alone ona high-powered motor \ncycle, flash past them with a cheery wave. The lone rider was \nWinifred Wells, of Derby Road, Shinton Park, spending three \nweeks holiday by travelling 5505 miles from her home city of \nPerth to Sydney and back.” (People Magazine, April 11,1951) \nSetting her  sights on  an  unimaginable journey across \nthe  Nullarbor Plain, Winifred was well and truly prepared, \ndefying the  many naysayers who told the  21-year-old she \ncouldn't do it. \nWinifred was 11  years old  when she  decided that she \nwanted a  motorbike. Her  parents laughed at the  idea and \nonly commented “later dear’ but  she was determined and \nwhen old  enough gained her  motorcycle licence and  also \nbought her  very first bike a  250cc BSA.

At this  stage \nshe changed up  to  a  350cc Triumph Tiger, a \nlarger framed bike, which gave her  a  greater \npresence on  the road and of course more power. \nInevitably, Winifred convinced the club that \nshe was a skilled motorcyclist and worthy of \nacceptance. The members of the  club accepted \nher but also attempted to convince her that her \ndreams of crossing the  Nullarbor would never \neventuate. They told Winifred that “she would \nblow \nher \nbike \nup, \nher \nmetal \nbearings \nwould \nself- \ndestruct and she would perish!” \nNot \ndeterred, \nthe \nyoung \nadventurous \nand \ncaptivating \nwoman \napproached \nthe  \nlocal \nRoyal \nEnfield \nagency \nin \nPerth, \nCarlyle \nand \nCo., \nwho \nrealised \nthe  \nmarketing \npossibilities \nof \nsigning \n\nCHAPTER 6 WINIFRED WELLS “s   41 \nWinifred up to  purchase the  bike that would take her from Perth to  Sydney and back, on  her epic ride  across \nthe ‘never-never’ The owner, Carl Cohen, obviously saw the potential that Winifred exuded and the determined \nspirit she  possessed. However, he still  concreted in the  contract that the  Royal Enfield Bullet 350  would only \nbecome hers upon final payment. Winifred had  secured finance from IAG  (Insurance Australia Group), but had \nto obtain permission from them to take the  Enfield out  of the state. \nSetting off at noon, 26 December (Boxing Day) 1950 from Perth, Winifred was  prepared. She had packed her \nprovisions and spare clothing into pannier bags, a suitcase and  a knapsack and  in her pocket was  £25. \nWinifred’s natural grace and  style were captured beautifully in the  numerous photographs that were taken \nas  she departed. The black and  white images were striking, however they did  not  capture the coloured charm \nof her fawn breeches, blue sweater and  old tweed hat. \nBeginning in the height of Australia’s harsh summer, Winifred’s immediate sights were set on the most intense \npart of her  journey crossing nullusarbor (Latin) meaning ‘no trees’. Most of her  journey was ridden in extreme \nheat, with only the  most minimal of relief from the sun  when she erected a shelter from her groundsheet and \nblanket or taking cover under the occasional structures that covered bore water holes. Her first day’s journey \ntook her to Southern Cross, approximately 231  miles (372 kms) from Perth. An average 366  miles (589 kms) per \nday and 95 miles per gallon was her goal, a mean feat considering the 350cc Royal Enfield Bullet averaged a top \nspeed of approximately 70 miles (112.65 kms). \nAs the sun  rose on  the morning after reaching the edge of the Nullarbor Plain, so  began the most gruelling \npart \nof \nher \nadventure. \nShe \ncontinued \non, \nreaching \nthe \ntown \nof \nNorseman \nsafely \non \nthe \nevening \nof \n27 \nDecember \n1950.

Don Oxford, of the Central Motorcycle Club, arrived on  June’s doorstep, presenting the article \nto  see  if June “really would” go  on  the  trial. June’s husband Hilton, had put  her  name down as  a  member of \nthe  Matchless team, without consulting her first! “Dad would initiate something, and subsequently Mum would \nsucceed, often to the point where he was  faced with her superiority! Not an  easy situation for  a man in those times! \n| remember his irritation (a euphemism for ire!) at being called “Mr  June Murray” by his mates when all the publicity \nabout the Redex came out” (Cynthia Atkin- daughter). \nJune was born on  18th April 1925 in Byron Bay, NSW, into a family of four boys and three girls. She  had \nalways wanted a  motorcycle and her  passion was beautifully captured in an  image of her  riding the  New \nEngland \nHighway \nin \nthe \nautumn \nof \n1942, \non \na \nTriumph \n500cc \n(belonging \nto \nher \nfuture \nhusband \nHilton \nMurray). \nJune \nwas \n17 \nat \nthe \ntime \nand \nby \nthe \ntime \nshe \nhad \nreached \n21, \nshe \nand \nHilton \nhad \ngiven \nbirth \nto \nthree daughters. \n\n52 =   FASTWOMEN \n“On her own she raised my two sisters and myself, while my father was  doing his duty as a despatch rider in the \nwar years. Mum taught herself to type on  a Royal typewriter. She then got a position as secretary with A.F Morgan \nand Sons Pty Ltd (a large plumbing company in Mosman Sydney, NSW). Mum also worked as  an  usherette at the \nNarrabeen movie theatre, on  Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. The  late 1940s and 1950s were post Second \nWorld War years. During this time there was  very little money around or jobs. Both my mother and father had two \njobs each. My dad was  a diesel engineer and he also worked in a company called Pyrex (a glass manufacturer) as a \nproduct quality control inspector. Both my parents were hard-working conscientious people. This was  to help them \neducate, feed and put a roof over our heads.” (Judith Zielinski -  daughter). \nMotorcycling was a  family affair for  the  Murrays, with their three young daughters, Cynthia, Judith and \nSusan, joining them at  motorcycling events. The girls helped with oiling the  chains, push starting bikes and \nhelping unload their trailer for  Sunday race events. As children were not  allowed in the  pits, the  girls would \nwatch their dad  racing for a while, then when they got bored, as  kids  do,they would walk around picking up \nempty milk and  cordial bottles, returning them to the  kiosk as  a boost to their pocket money. The three girls \nalso sold programmes at the gate. \nHilton was a fanatic, owning up to  13 motorbikes at one  time, and  while he raced at Mount Druitt, Bathurst, \nWallacia, Frenchs Forest and  Holdsworthy Army track in Liverpool, June would often be in the tower scoring laps. \nJune \nwas \na \nnatural \nrider \nand \nloved \nthe \nfreedom \nfelt \non \ntwo \nwheels. \nShe \nregularly \nrode \nto \nher \njob \nas \na \nsecretary, \npicking \none  \nof \nthe \ngirls \nup \nfrom \nschool \n(much \nto \ntheir \nembarrassment, \nas  \nhaving \na \nmotorcycling \nmother \nin \nthe \n1950s \nwas \nnot  \nnormal) \nand \ncompeting \nin \nevents \non  \nweekends, \nincluding \nthe  \nGoodwin \nShield \nTrial. \nThe \nbike \nthat \nAP \nNorth \nPty. \nLtd. \n(the \nMatchless \nDealership, \nlocated \nin \nSydney, \nNSW) \ngave \nJune \nto \nride \nin \nthe \nRedex \nwas \nbrand \nnew \nand \nin \nthose \ndays \nand \nall \nnew \nvehicles \nhad \nto \nbe \n“run \nin”. \nThis \nmeant \nnot \npushed \nabove \na \ncertain \nspeed \nfor \na \nspecified \ndistance, \nwhich \nwould \ngive \nthe \nengine \ntime \nto \nloosen \nup. \nThe \nonly \nway \nshe \ncould \n“run \nthe \nbike \nin” \nwas \nto \nride \nfrom \nher \nhome \nin \nCollaroy \nPlateau \nto \nthe \nHawkesbury \nRiver, \nNSW, \nat \nnight, \nafter \nthe \ngirls \nwere in bed, a ride of at least an  hour each way. \n\nCHAPTER 7 JUNE MURRAY =   53 \nJune with fellow competitors after the Redex Trial. \n\n54 =“   FASTWOMEN \nJune ready to start \nthe Redex Trial \nJune \nalways \nmaintained \nher \nown \nbike, \nchanging \nits \ntyres, \nde-coking \nthe  \nengine \nto \nremove \ncarbon \nbuild \nup, \nregrinding \nthe \nvalves \nand \nchanging \nrings. \nHoning \nher \nskills \nproved \nvaluable, \nequipping \nher \nwell \nfor \nfuture \nevents. \nJune \nand \nHilton \nbecame \nmembers \nof \nthe \nCentral \nMotorcycle \nClub \nof \nSydney, \nManly-Warringah \nMotorcycle \nClub \nand \nRacing \nRiders \nMotorcycle \nClub. \nAs \nJune \nwasn't \nofficially \nrecognised \nby \nthe \nclubs \n(at \nthe \ntime \nwomen \nwere \nnot \nallowed \nto \nofficially \ncompete) \nshe \nattended \nall \nthe \nevents \nbut \nwas \nrelegated \nto \nride \nbehind. \nHowever, by 1951 June’s achievements were being recognised. \n“One \nof \nthe \nmost \ncommendable \nperformances \nof \nthis \nyear’s \nGoodwin \nShield \nwas  \nthat \nof \nthe \nlone \nlady \ncompetitor, \nMrs. \nJune \nMurray. \nThis \ngrand \nsportswoman \nwas \ncontesting \nher \nsecond \nGoodwin \nShield. \nIn  \n195 \n1, \nwhen \nconditions \nwere \nmuch \nbetter \nthan \nthis \nyear, \nthis \nenthusiastic \nmotor \ncyclist \ncompleted \nthe \ncourse, \nthis \ntime \nfor \na \nloss \nof \n138 \npoints. \nIn \nthe  \n1952 \nedition, \nunder \nextreme \nconditions, \nshe \nagain \ncompleted \nthe \ncourse, \nthis  \ntime \nfor \na \nloss \nof \nonly \n73 \npoints. \nWhen \nit \nis \ntaken \ninto \nconsideration \nthat \nthis \ngallant \nlady \nis \nthe \nmother \nof \nthree \nchildren, \nand \nbattled \nher \nway \nthrough \nthe \nentire \ndistance, \nwhilst \nmany \nmen \nretired \nfrom \nthe \nevent \nbefore \nnegotiating \nhalf \nthe \ndistance, \nthe \nAuto \nCycle \n\nCHAPTER 7 JUNE MURRAY %*   55 \nUnion \ncould \ndo \nfar \nworse \nthan \npresent \nMrs. \nMurray \nwith \na \ntrophy \nfor \na \nvery \ngallant \neffort.” \nAnd \n‘In \nour \nlast \nissue \nwe \nsuggested \nthat \nour \nonly \nlady \nTrials \nrider \nshould \nreceive \nsome \nrecognition \nby \nthe \nA.C.U. \nfor \nher \nsplendid \nperformance \nin \nthe \n1952 \nGoodwin \nShield. \nThe \nMatter \nwas \nbrought \nto \nthe \nfore \nat \nthe \nlast \ngeneral \nmeeting \nby \nMr. \nHarry \nBartrop. \nResult: \nA \ntrophy \nfor \nMrs. \nMurray.” \nAlso \n‘Another \nto \ndisplay \nthe \ncourage \nand \nperseverance \nwe  \nknow \nour \nsport \nbrings \nto \nthe \nfore, \nwas  \nMrs. \nMurray \nwho, \nthough \ntaking \na \ntoss \nlost \npoints \non \nthe \nfirst \ndays, \nbut \nturned \nup \nat \nthe \nsocial \non \nSaturday \nnight.” \n“Mrs. \nMurray, \nof \nthe \nCentral \nM.C.C, \nwill \nagain \ntry \nher \nluck \nin \nthe \nGoodwin \nShield. \nThis \nenthusiastic \nTrials \nrider \nnever \nmisses \na \ncompetition \nof \nthis \nnature, \nand \nnow \nbecomes \nthe \nsole \nlady \nentrant \nin \nNSW \ncompetition. \nWe \nraise \nour \nhats \ntoa grand sport.” \nThen \n“Popular June Murray (Central) arrived at the start well prepared to do battle for her club, but, alas, no support, \nso June was prevailed upon not to start.

Not for the faint hearted, the trial was  laced with snow, \nrain, mud, gale-force winds, desert, bulldust, culverts, extreme cold, unsealed roads, kangaroos, and  sand banks. \nJune was prepared!

The  Australian Women’s Weekly, in April of 1954, posted the \nheadline, “Mother contests motor-cycle race —  She  finds de-coking bike easier than making kiddies’ dresses” \ndescribing June to be the “Only” woman entrant in the Redex. \nThe one event that stole the  limelight from Mrs  June Murray was the  Petrov Affair (the defection of two \nRussian spies to Australia). \nJune was  named by The Women's International Motorcycling Association (based in the USA) the World’s Most \nOutstanding Woman Rider of 1954. She  received a congratulatory letter from the  President who described \nher  efforts as  “magnificent” and a trophy in the  form of a golden robed woman with wings. An  appropriate \ntribute to June who had certainly gained her wings within the  motorcycling fraternity. \nThe only Redex Reliability Motorcycle Trial was  held in  1954.

As  a  young music student Peggy \nnever imagined that in just a few  short years, she would become a world first, leading the way for women to \nrace unrestricted capacity motorcycles and to compete in world class race events. \nAs a  10-year-old child, not  yet interested in motorcycles, Peggy did  however passionately desire to  ride a \npushbike. A neighbour had paused at the  front gate of her family home to chat with her  mother —  a child in \ntow, with pushbike. Whilst the  mothers were chatting and not  attending to  their daughters the  scene was \nset.  “Hence my hurried exit, having quietly organised a ride  with the child ‘owner’ of the pushy!” Peggy's mother \nscreaming, “Come back, you'll be killed!” Peggy pedalled away as  fast as  she  could. “Oh  what fun!” This was \nPeggy’s first taste of the exhilaration and freedom felt on  two  wheels. \nEarly photographs of Peggy’s father, who passed away when she was  nine, show him driving a sidecar outfit. \nHowever, motorcycling was  certainly not  part of her family life and  upbringing. Her only early experience was \nbeing given a ride  in a sidecar belonging to a friend’s father. Peggy was  not  particularly impressed! \nPeggy bought her first motorbike in  early 1963, whilst studying at  the Melbourne University and \nConservatory of Music. A few months later, Peggy’s left wrist was crushed when a careless car  driver made a \nLeft: Peggy Hyde. \n\n64 =   FASTWOMEN \nU-turn in front of her  without signalling. Despite this  serious setback, she  continued her  studies and helped \npay her  way by working as  a  commercial despatch rider, on  scooters and motorbikes. Five collisions in  six \nweeks, due to  a  scooter with no  brakes quelled her  enthusiasm for  poorly-maintained scooters but  did  not \nquell her enthusiasm for two wheels. \nThose early years dealing with Melbourne traffic, braking and cornering, the  wet slippery oil  laden inner \ncity streets and unmade outer suburban roads inadvertently taught Peggy fundamental skills. With nothing in \nmind other than using the cheapest form of transport to carry her to  her  position as  Choirmaster and church \norganist, Peggy's lifelong love affair with motorcycles was  about to begin. \nApproaching a local scooter shop in the  Elizabeth Street motorcycle hub of Melbourne she was  greeted by \na keen salesman advising that “girls ride scooters”. Realising that the salesman was prejudiced and that he hada \nvested interest in selling her a scooter, she moved onto a motorcycle dealership to be given the same response, \n“girls ride scooters.” In Peggy’s mind both dealerships had just done themselves out of a sale. Not to be defeated, \nand  now possessing simmering determination, Peggy marched out of the shop, up a side lane to Keith ‘Dutchy’ \nHolland's motorcycle repair shop, where again she was  told “girls ride scooters.” Peggy, now mentally prepared \nfor \nthis \nsame \nunqualified \nresponse \nasked \n“Why?” \nHis \nanswer \nwas \nsimple, \n“/ \nhave \nno \nidea \nreally!” \nThen \nPeggy \nasked, \n“So \nwhat’; \nsafer?” \nand \nhe \nsaid, \n“A \nmotorbike’. \nSo \nthat \nis \nwhat \nPeggy \nbought, \na \n350cc \nMatchless \nsingle \ncylinder motorcycle purchased for 55  pounds. \n“My \nfirst \nride \non \nit \nwas \nspectacular, \nopened \nthe \nthrottle \nand \ndropped \nthe \nclutch, \nin \nthe \ngravel, \nleaving \nthe \nroad \nand \nveering \noff \ninto \nthe \nscrub, \n| \ndid \nemerge \nthe \nvictor, \nhaving \nimmediately \ndiscovered \nthat \nwhen \nfeeling \nunstable \nthe \nbest \nthing \nto \ndo \nis \nto \nopen \nthe \nthrottle \nsome \nmore. \nIt \nwas \nprobably \nlucky \nthat \nthere \nwere \nenough \ngaps \nbetween \ntrees, \nand \nthat \nscrubby \nstuff \nwas \nnot \nthick, \nas \n| \ngot \ncontrol \nand \nreturned \nto \nthe \ndirt \nroad \nI'd \nstarted \non, \nhaving \ngravel \nblasted \nthe \nfriend \nwho \nhad \nelected \nto \nhelp \nme \nlearn \nto \nride. \nThis \nwas \n(later) \nmy \nhusband. \nWHAT \nFUN!!! \nAnd \n| \nwas \n‘hooked’” \nIt \nwas \nnot  \nlong \nbefore \nPeggy \nrealized \nthat \nmotorcycling \nwas \nnot \nonly \neconomical \nbut \nalso \nfun \nand \nshe \nwas \ngood at it. \n\nCHAPTER 8 PEGGY HYDE 3°   65 \nWhen \nPeggy \nfirst \nmet \nJulian \nHyde \nhe  \nhad \nhad \na \nrun  \nin \nwith \na  \ncar  \non  \nhis \nJawa \n250cc, \nwhich \nresulted \nin \na \nbandaged \nsorry \nsight \nwhen \nPeggy \nfirst \nmet \nhim \nat \n‘The \nHorse \nMarket \nHotel’ \n(a \npopular \nstudent \nhang-out), \nwhere \nshe  \nhad  \nasked \naround \nfor \nassistance \nin \nbuying \na \nmotorcycle. \nThe \nold \nhouse \nin \nCarlton, \nwhere \nPeggy \nlived \nwith \nfive \nother \nstudents, \nbecame \na \nhaven \nfor \nmotorcycles. \nOne \ncount \nput \nthe \nnumber \nat \n13. \nSays \nPeggy: \n“Not \nto \nbe \noutdone, \neveryone \nbought \nat \nleast \none \nbike \neach, \nand \nwe \nused \nto \nswap.” \n(The \nAustralian \nWomen’s \nWeekly \n21  \nJune \n1972). \nDubbed \nthe  \n‘Melbourne \nUni \nMotorcycle \nPutsch’ \n' \n(by \nRic  \nBegg, \na \nfellow \nstudent \nand \nrider) \nher \nsocial \nriding \nlife \nexpanded. \nPeggy’s \nriding \nprowess \nwas \nenhanced \nby \nexperiencing \nmany \ndifferent \nriding \nstyles \nand \nsurfaces, \nparticipating \nin many formal and informal \nevents including \nhill climbs, trials, sand racing, and trail riding (including \non a \nNorton 750cc). She rode off road a lot, always on road tyres and without footing; mainly because she couldn't \nreach the ground and it hurt her back to try. \nUpgrading from Matchless and Ariel 350cc and 500cc, Peggy naturally progressed to a much larger machine, \na  750cc Norton Atlas, which famously carried her  on  a  solo adventure in  1964 from Melbourne, Victoria to \nMarlborough, Queensland and back. She rode the  Norton in  all  conditions taking the  challenge of riding \nthrough bulldust every day near her home and once getting trapped between rocks in the Grampians National \nPark in Victoria. \n“| loved riding anywhere, often took off with only the foggiest notion of where | was  going, seldom looked at a \nmap, typically got fuel at corner service stations, came in on  the highway entrance and left via the side road exit, \nwaking up 80 miles later | was out of fuel again and not on the highway. Slept in funny places, met interesting people.” \nMedia interest in Peggy’s adventures began early in her  riding career. In  1964, Peggy effortlessly rode her \nNorton Atlas 750cc, ‘a large one fora woman to handle’ as quoted in The Maryborough Chronicles, from Melbourne \nthroughout country NSW, having to detour from her planned route to Sydney to have a cracked cylinder repaired. \nThe  next morning, she moved on  from Sydney and arrived in Warwick Queensland (778.1 km) on  the same day. \n1 Putsch —  an  attempt to overthrow a government, a coup. \n\n66 %  FASTWOMEN \nHAA \ni \n(A \niil \nGN \nAH \nWN \nca \nPeggy Hyde taking on and out in front of the legendry Ken Blake \n\nCHAPTER 8 PEGGY HYDE “°   67 \n‘Despite \na \nwarning \non  \nthe \nstate \nof \nthe \nweather, \nshe \nleft \nMaryborough \nyesterday, \nwith \nskies \ndarkened \nby \napproaching \nstorm \nclouds... \nthat \ndid \nnot \nappear \nto \nworry \nher, \nand \nsmiling \nshe \naccepted \nit \nall \nwith \nthe \ndetermined \n“I'l \ngive \nitago” \nspirit \n(from \nThe \nMaryborough \nChronicles). \nPeggy \nand  \nJulian \nHyde \nwent \non  \nto \njoin \nthe  \nlocal \nHartwell \nmotorcycling \nclub. \nPeggy \ndecided \nthat \nclub \nroad \nruns \nweren't \nfor \nher,  \nPeggy \ndid  \nnot  \nlike  \nbeing \nslipstreamed \nand \nshe  \npreferred \nriding \nfaster \non  \nwinding \nroads. \nPeggy wanted to race! At first her interest was scrambling, \nbut by the time she was thinking \nof preparing \na bike \nto race, Matchless \nhad become outdated \nby new brands. That left road racing, where she could ride her own \nbike, at this time the Norton. She was a natural at riding and road racing became \na natural extension \nof \nher experience \nto date. \nAs  motorcycle technology improved dramatically and machines that were considered ‘high-powered’ in \nthe 1960s were overtaken by more powerful motorcycles, the  racing world thrived. Not  so  for women! The \nperception then was  that a woman simply could not handle the weight and power of higher capacity machines. \nPeggy Hyde proved the world wrong! \nWhat Peggy didn’t know was that racing licences were issued to  women only to  enter bikes, not  to  race \nthem. Race licences were required for  both entrants and riders in the  1960s. When applying for  her  licence \nPeggy omitted to tick the two boxes that determined you to be either a race entrant or competitor (an entrant \nis the  owner of the  motorcycle. The competitor is the  rider of the  motorcycle. A competitor can  also be an \nentrant if the  motorcycle she  or  he  is riding is her/his own registered motorcycle). This went unnoticed by \nLicencing Authorities and an  unrestricted Victorian Open Competition Licence was granted. \nLate in  1966 when Peggy started racing there were no  women racing. Her  local club, Hartwell Motorcycle \nRoad Racing Club, was supportive; they had ridden with her on  the  road. It was crucial to her future access to \nthe track that this first race report be unbiased. The Club secretary, a woman (Ruth Love) knew that if the track \nofficials realised Peggy was a  woman, her first performance would be criticised unfairly, to  keep her  off the \ntrack. \nThe \nClub \norganising \nteam \nkept \nthe \nsecret \nand  \nassisted \nby \npublishing \nonly \nsurnames \nand  \ninitials \nof \nriders. \n\n68 FAST WOMEN \nPeggy and Julian parked their van  far from other competitors and  officials, rode the same bike, wore the same \nleathers and  changed out of view. So, combined with the assumption that a woman would only be an  entrant, \nand that women were not expected to be seen on  the  race track, officials and  spectators simply assumed that \nM.J.  Hyde (Peggy’s birth name being Margaret) and J.P. Hyde were in fact  brothers. \n‘M.J. Hyde's’ post-race steward’s reports were good, quickly moving her  up from D-grade to C-Grade. Two \nmore race meetings followed quickly, but  being run  by other clubs, Peggy’s gender was no  longer a secret. \nWhen she  applied for her annual licence renewal, she was issued a licence restricted to 250cc. After an  initial \nexchange of correspondence with the Auto Cycle Council of Australia stating her case that there was no  basis \nfor any  restriction because she  was not  a Junior and her  steward reports were good. She added ‘could it be \nbecause the Victorian Committee were all men? Peggy said that it was not so  much that she was doing it for the \nwomen’s libbers, she just wanted what was  fair: there was no  rational reason for excluding women from open \ncompetition or  restricting what they could ride. \nIn  \n1969 \na  \nprompt \nresponse \nand \napology \nfrom \nthe  \nNational \nCouncil \nfollowed \nwith \nthe  \ngranting \nof \nan \nunrestricted \nracing \nlicence \nand  \na \nnew \npolicy \npermitting \nwomen \nto \ncompete \non  \nmachines \nof \nany \nsize. \nPeggy \nat \nthat \nstage \ndid \nnot \nrealise \nshe \nwas \nthe \nfirst \nwoman \nin \nthe \nworld \nto \nhold \nsuch \na \nlicence. \nPeggy’s \nnatural \ntalent \nwas  \nseldom \nreflected \nin \nthe \nmedia \nof \nthe \nday \nwith \nher \nfinding \nmany \nof \nthe \njournalists \n“rather \nirritating” \nand \nsome \n“rather \nwell \nmeaning’, \nalways \nwith \nthe  \ncomment \nthat \nshe  \nhandled \nher  \nmachine \n“like \na \nman”. \nJournalist \nLance \nLowe \nfor \nThe \nOpen \nRoad \n(1 \nMarch \n1970) \nin \nhis \narticle \nentitled \n“Brown-eyed \nblonde \nbeats \n90 \nmen” \ndetails \nhis \ndescription \nof \nPeggy's \n“Vital \nStatistics” \n(her \nbust-waist-hip \nmeasurements). \nLowe \nwent \non \nto \npartially \nsalvage \nthe \ncredibility \nof \nhis \nwork \nby \ndocumenting \nPeggy \nHyde's \nmany \ntalents \ndescribing \nPeggy \nas \nastute \nand \n“in \ncontrast \nto \nher \naverage \nmale \nenthusiast \nwho \ntends \nto \nbecome \ncompletely \nabsorbed \nin \nhis \nracing \nand \ntuning \nworld, \nshe \nalso \nhas \nother \nactivities \nas \nwidely \ndiverse \nas \nraising \npedigreed \ngoats \nand \nstudying \nmusic. \nShe \nplays \nthe \npiano, \nis \nan \naccomplished \npipe \norganist \nand \nhas \none \nsubject \nto \npass \nat \nthe \nMelbourne \nConservatorium \nof \nMusic \nto \ngain \nher \nBachelor \nof \nMusic \nDegree. \nHer \nToggenburg \ngoats \nare  \nfamous \nin \n\nCHAPTER 8 PEGGY HYDE =   69 \nPeggy in the pits riding the Castrol 6 hour event. \n\n70 FAST WOMEN \nPeggy Hyde riding again at the \nBroadford Motorcycle Complex, \nVictoria 2015. \nVictoria \nand \nsuccessful \nat \nagricultural \nshows. \nAs \nif \nall \nthis \nis \nnot \nenough, \nMrs \nHyde \nalso \nhas \na \nfull-time \njob-delivering \nautomotive \nspare \nparts \nfora \nMelbourne \ncar \ncompany.” \nWhen \none \njournalist \nexpressed \nhis \nconcern \nthat \nshe \nmay \nhurt \nherself \nin \nan  \nevent, \nPeggy's \nresponse \nwas  \nthat \nshe \n“was \nsure \nshe \nwould \nheal \nexactly \nas   \naman \nwould”. \nWhispers \ncame \nfrom \nsome \nin \nthe \nmedia \neven \nquestioning \nif \nPeggy \nwas \nindeed \na \nwoman, \nleading \nto \nPeggy \nreluctantly \nallowing \na \nphoto \nof \nher \nin \na \nbikini \nto \nbe \npublished. \n\nCHAPTER 8 PEGGY HYDE “   71 \nPeggy \nmaintained \nher  \ncomposure \nand \nalways \ngraciously \nand \ncalmly \nresponded \nto  \nmedia \nscrutiny. \nAt  \nthis \nstage \nand \nomitted \nin \nmedia \nreports \nwas \nthe \nfact \nthat \nPeggy \nwas \nthe \nfirst \nwoman \nin \nAustralia \nto \nwin \nan \nopen \nroad \nrace. \n“won my first race —-  C grade Unlimited —  in 1969 at Phillip Island- a runaway win.

The 26-year- \nold  Peggy was “Victoria’s Wonder Woman” orchestrating her  moves on  the  most accomplished and  awarded \nracers of the time. Peggy never bowed.

Much to the \namusement of some of the  older and  wiser competitors (one jesting “If you  beat me  again I'll retire!”), Peggy \noutgunned the young guns who were riding the  most modern of motorcycles. She  created history at Phillip \nIsland, Victoria, by winning the Senior C grade race on  her Kawasaki 500, becoming the first woman in Australia \nto win  a road race and also qualifying her to  run  in the  Senior and Unlimited Tourist Trophy (T/T) title events \nwhere she finished third.“Lap two she took the lead from Jones and then, trying to save face for the male sex,  he \nslid off on the thwird lap to retire. From then on Hyde had two seconds from Blake, who made a desperate attempt on \nthe last lap to regain male honour but went down too, coming off at Shell Corner!” (Australian Motorcycle News, \n1 May 1970 edition).

She  contacted her friends in \nSucre saying she would arrive on  the 21**  November by motorcycle with her tin whistle and lager phone ready \nto celebrate and  play music with them. \nTheir initial reply was  “you will suffer from the high altitudes and you will get sick’ “the roads are really too bad \nfora motorbike’or “it’s too cold, too wet and the terrain is too harsh!” Yet Linda learned to ride motorbikes in 1963, \nand most of the travelling that Linda had  done in her life had  been on  motorcycles, so  her friend’s comments \ndid  not deter her. \nWhen asked what brought her to motorcycling in the first place this was her reply: \n“My elder sister, Anne, had a boyfriend with a beautiful BSA Gold Star which fascinated me  (and so did he, but to \nno avail)”. \nHer  teenaged entry to freedom on  wheels came in the  form of a three wheeled Bond Minicar which she \npurchased out of her pocket money and  her father helped rebuild. It was  the oddest looking little car with one \nwheel at the front and  two wheels at the  back and a  rather enthralling skull and crossbones emblazoned on \nthe  bonnet. This little car  had the  unlikely title Hiroshima II. Linda and her  school friend, Lynn Filmore toured \nthe  south-west of England in the  Bond and whilst gracing the  open roads, the  two friends met a  couple of \nlikely lads on  motorcycles who invited the two  young women for a ride. Sitting on  the  pillion pad was a short- \nlived experience for Linda as  her pilot took a bend too fast and she ended up in hospital with concussion and \ncracked ribs. \n“From \nthen \non  \n| \ndecided \nthat \n| \nwould \ntake \nall \nbike \nriding \ninto \nmy \nown \nhands, \njoined \nthe \nSaltbox \nMotorcycle \nClub \nin \nBiggin \nHill \nnear \nthe \nfamous \nWorld \nWar \nII \nairfield, \nand \nbought \nmy \nown \nbike. \nThis  \nwas  \na \n250 \nBSA  \nC10L \nupon \nwhich \nLynn \nand \n| \nlearnt \nto \nride.  \nUnfortunately, \nduring \none \nof \nher \noutings \na \ngentleman \nin \na \nRover \nmade \na \nwrong \nturn, \nLynn \nended \nup \non \nthe \nbonnet \nand \nthe \nbike \nneeded \nnew \nforks. \nHaving \nsaved \nmy \nsixpences \n(in \na \nDimple \nwhiskey \nbottle) \n| \nlashed \nout \nits \ncontents, \nall \nof \n£40, \non \na \nTriumph \n200cc \nTiger \nCub \nand \nmade \nseveral \nattempts \nat \ngetting \nfurther \nthan \n\nCHAPTER 9 LINDA BOOTHERSTONE-BICK %&   77 \nthe \nNorth \nCircular \nroad \nbut \nthe \nbike's \nhabit \nof \nthrowing \nbig \nends \ndeterred \nme  \nso  \n| \ngraduated \nin \nto \na  \nTriumph \n3TA \nwhich \neasily \ntransported \nme \nto \nthe \nLake \nDistrict \nand \nNorth \nWales. \nA \ngreat \nlittle \nbike, \nit \nwould \ndo \n90 \nmile-per-hour \nwith \n70 \nmile-per- \ngallon.” \nIt \nwas \nnot  \nlong \nbefore \nLinda \ndiscovered \nthe \njoy \nof \ncross-continent \nadventure, \nriding \naboard \nher  \nnext \nbike, \na \nTriumph \n500cc \n5TA \nmotorcycle \nwhich \nshe \nhad \nre-painted \n“go-faster \nBonneville \nblue” \nThis \nbike \ndelivered \nher \nto \nmany \nmotorcycle \nrallies \nin \nthe \nUK \nand \nEurope, \nincluding \nthe \nDragon \nRally \n(held \nonly \nfor \nthe \nbrave \nof \nheart \nduring \nwinter \nin \nNorth \nWales), \nthe \nChamois \n(a \nsummertime \ngathering \nat \nhigh \naltitude \nin \nthe \nFrench \nAlps), \nthe \nStella \nAlpina \n(taking \nplace \nin \nthe \nItalian \nAlps \nriding \nin \nsome \nof \nthe \nmost \nchallenging \nterrain, \nquite \noften \nriding \non \ngravel \ntracks \nthrough \nsnow) \nand \nthe \n1967 \nFédération \nInternationale \nde \nMotocyclisme \n(FIM) \nRally \nin \nMoscow. \nThis \nrally \nwas \nvery \nsignificant \nin \nconfirming \nLinda’s \ngrowing \nbelief \nthat \nmotorcycling \nhelped \nbreak \ndown \nmany \ninternational \nbarriers. \nIn that \nyear, \n1967, \nRussia \nwas \nbehind \nthe \nIron \ncurtain, \ncontrolled \nby Khrushchev, \nand \nit \nwas \nvery \ndifficult \nto travel \nthere. \nInvitations \nfor \nthe \nFIM rally \nwere \nissued \nto enable \nparticipants \nto acquire \nvisas \nto \nenter \nand \nall \nof \nthem \nhad \nto \nfollow \nstrict \nrules \nwhile \ntravelling \nin \nthe \ncountry, \nescorted \nby \ntourist \nguides. \nHowever, \nsharing \nvodka \nand \ncaviar \nin \nthe \ngracious \nbuildings \nin \nMoscow \nwith \nthe rally \norganizers \nand \nother \neast \nEuropean \nparticipants \nwas \na \ngreat \nexample \nof \ninternational \nfriendship, \ndespite \nlanguage \nand \ncultural \ndifferences. \nThe \nmotorcycles \nwere \na \ncommon \nlink. \nWhilst attending the  FIM  Rally Linda met a  couple of Aussie guys who were touring the  world on  BMWs. \n“I travelled with one  of them to the Troll Rally in Norway the following year and noted that, while he sat back and \nboiled the  billy each night, | was still  busy adjusting my chain and screwing up all the  bolts that had loosened \nduring the day’s ride. This proved to me  that BMWs needed less maintenance than Triumphs so  | bought a  1960 \nR60 and took it with me  on  the ship when | immigrated to Oz in  1969. Unloading it in Melbourne | rode it across to \nAdelaide and then back east to Sydney, stopping at the Kangaroo Rally in Ballarat.” Linda came to Australia as  a \n‘Ten pound Pom’ and  it didn’t take her  long to find her circle of motorcycling friends and  to also  expand her \nmotorcycling disciplines. Living in Sydney in 1970, she  and  her flatmates, Jacky and  Angie Griffin, befriended \n\n78 %*   FASTWOMEN \nthe members of the Willoughby Motorcycle Club and the University \nof NSW Motorcycle club and it was here that she  was introduced \nto  racing.

They had been sponsors in  a \nRoad Safety Run event in which Linda had  won best Solo and best \nTeam with sisters Sandra and  Deirdre Davis.

But the hospitality of the people there was  something special.” \nAfter her epic journey to \nAustralia from Europe, Linda \nreturned to Spain to sell her houses \nand, realising that South America \nwas one of the  last  continents to \nvisit, she bought a  250cc bike in \nNorth America with the  intention \nof riding it down into the southern \ncountries. Unfortunately, ill health \nprevented her completing this trip \nand she flew from Louisiana to \nAustralia, leaving the  bike behind \nto  be  later transported to  the \nplace where she finally decided to \nlive, Port Lincoln, South Australia. \nA couple of days short of her \n70th birthday, Linda did indeed \narrive in   Sucre, Bolivia, South \nAmerica. She celebrated her  day \nLinda in Chile. \n\nCHAPTER 9 LINDA BOOTHERSTONE-BICK 83 \nwith her  beloved friends playing music. For  three months she  toured Chile, Bolivia and Argentina on  a  125 \nYamaha bought in Santiago and  then sold 8,000 kms later in the same city, before flying out to visit her family \nin UK, friends in Europe and  then returning to Australia. \nEssentially traveling the  world solo her  entire life  Linda’s most important advice is to take a  positive and \nopen minded attitude, always trust your intuition, take things as they come and  don't go looking for trouble. \nLinda's deep love of folk music and  motorcycling and  her generous spirit reward her with many friends from \nmany different parts of the world who always open their arms and  homes to her. \n“The motivation is travelling and meeting people. The  motorcycle is the  best way of doing that. | am \nnot interested in records or going anywhere fast. Sponsorships are  not worth it. For me,  it’s too  much of a \nhassle. | want to do this trip slowly and go where! want. | have seen people who have to be at a certain place \nat acertain time for television. It really isn’t worth it.” \nLinda believes that her independent spirit and  positive attitude is a direct result of her upbringing by open \nminded and  supportive parents. Her father insisted that “there is no  such word as can’t” and  her mother, always \na working wife, gave a strong example of a woman who, even in a loving relationship, made her own decisions \nin life and was an  equal partner in the  marriage. Linda was encouraged to be independent and, as  long as  her \nparents knew where she was  and who she was  with, she was  not forbidden to go anywhere. \nAs age is taking its toll  Linda has  downsized her  bike from the  250  to a  110  Honda ‘postie’ bike which she \nhas \nkitted \nout \nwith \na \nbig \ntank \nand \nis \nintending \nto \nuse \nfor \ntouring \nin \nAustralia \nwhen \nshe \nhas \ntime \nbetween \nperforming folk music and writing books. \nAll her books are  available on  Amazon in paperback or  Kindle format. \nPhotos supplied by Linda Bootherstone-Bick \n\n84 &   FAST WOMEN é \nTina on  her beloved Ducati single. \n\nCHAPTER 10 TINA KARAN %   85 \nKARAN \nAUSTRALIA’S \nFIRST \nAND \nONLY \nWOMAN \nTO \nWIN \nAN \nAUSTRALIAN \nSPEEDWAY \nSIDECAR \nCHAMPIONSHIP \nWhat \nis  \na \nSpeedway \nSidecar? \nA \nthree-wheeled \npurpose \nbuilt \nmachine, \nhousing \na  \n1000cc \nmotor \nand  \ndesigned \nto \nonly \nturn \nright \nat \nthe  \nend \nof \nthe  \nstraight \nof \nan  \noval \ndirt \ntrack \n-  \nthat \ncan  \nbe \nas  \nshort \nas  \n250  \nmetres \nand \nup \nto \n1600 \nmetres. \n“OH \nand \nno \nbrakes \nwith \n2 \npeople \non \nboard! \n“Really \nthere \nis \nno \ntrack \nor \nsurface \nthe \nsame \nand \nthe \nsurface \ncan \nchange \nfor \neach \nrace \non \nthe \nsame \nnight. \nTracks \nare \ngenerally \nflat \nor \nslightly \nbanked \nand \ncan \nbe \nclay \n(not \nnice \nfor \nbikes), \nshale, \ngranite/sand, \nor \ndolomite. \nYou \njust \nnever \nknow \nwhat \nyou \nwill \nbe \nserved \nup. \nOne \nthing \nfor \nsure \nis \nthat \nit \nis \nsuperfast \nand \nfull \nthrottle \nfrom \nthe \ntime \nthe \ntapes \ngo \nup \nright \nto \nthe \ncheckered \nflag, \nabout \na \nminute \nand \na \nhalf \nlater, \nand \nspeeds \ncan \nreach \naround \n250 \nkph. \nAs \nthe \nmachines \nnear \nthe \ncorners, \nthey \nare \nmercilessly \nthrown \nsideways \nwith \nthe \nfront \nwheel \nseemingly \nin \nopposite \nlock \nto \nthe \nrear \nwheel, \nwhilst \nexperiencing \nstrong \ncentrifugal \nforces. \nSo, for the daring, Speedway is an  exhilarating, adrenalin fuelled, crowd pleasing sport. \nTina Karan took to Speedway Sidecar racing “like a fish to water”. \nIn the  1980s, whilst studying Fashion Design at Technical College, Tina became interested in fashion from \nearlier decades, in particular the  Mod era  of the  1960s. Her  love of the  styling and  culture of the  Mods of the \nUK led her as far as  buying a Vespa scooter which she fashioned into period style, modifying with the additions \n\n86 %   FASTWOMEN \nof chrome, mirrors galore and  foxtails. The  scooter was her first experience on  two-wheels but  it was a short- \nlived relationship. In the  years previous, Tina’s older brother was quite regularly visited by his friend, Russell \nMitchell who would roll  up  on  his  900  Ducati Darmah. “I think that may have sown the  seed a little without \nme  realising”. The scooter was soon traded for a Yamaha 400  and by that stage Tina and Russell had started \ndating. Tina mentions that one  of their regular friends had a kaleidoscope of bikes and  needed to sell  a few and \nshe  perused the collection. The little yellow 1974 250  Desmo popped up and seemed to say ‘you need to  buy \nme’ and it is a bike that Tina still  owns and  adores today. \nTina was 18  when her  love affair with Speedway began. In  1985, Russell, working in Wickham, Western \nAustralia, found out  that he  had a  mate in Mt  Newman, north west Western Australia, who had  just started \n‘swinging’ (a term used for a passenger) on  a speedway sidecar. Tina was on  holiday at the time in Melbourne, \nbut  Russell was keen to  see  their friend race. “This triggered his competitive nature (he used to race Motocross \nbut got too big) and said something to the effect “I reckon! can  build something better than their bike and kick their \narse” and away he went designing and constructing it. | thought it sounded pretty exciting too and not one  to want \nto miss out on anything, claimed the passenger job.” Tina  had  never been to the speedway and had  no  idea what \nher self-appointed position entailed. She  cut  short her Melbourne holiday to head home and  she and  Russell \nheaded off to the first meeting of the Claremont Speedway season to study the races and  bikes. Witnessing the \nspectacle made her all the  more excited about competing. There began Tina's illustrious career in Speedway \nSidecar racing, one  that spanned 27 years. \nSo \nwhat \ndoes \na  \npassenger \ndo?  \n“The \npassenger \nis \nthere \nto \nassist \nin \nthe \nhandling \nof \nthe \nbike. \nIn \ncorners, \nwe  \nare \ndown \ncentimetres \nfrom \nthe \nground \nbut \nwe \nwatch \nthe \nfront \nwheel \nto \nknow \nwhere \nwe \nshould \nplace \nour \nweight. \nWithout \na \npassenger \nthe \nsidecar \ndoes \nnot \nreally \nget \naround \ncorners \nwell \nso \nour \nbody \nposition \nis \ncrucial. \nThis \ncould \nbe \nmore \nforward \nor \nmore \nback \ntoward \nback \nwheel. \nKeeping \nthe \nbike \nbalanced \nis \nimportant \non \nthe \nstart \nline \ntoo. \nThey \nhave \na \nhabit \nof \ntipping \nover \ndue \nto \nthe \nlean. \nDown \nthe \nstraights, \nwe \nget \nour \nweight \nright \nback \nand \nover \nthe \nback \nseat \na \nlittle. \nThis \nis \nto \ntry \nto \nhelp \nget \nmaximum \ndrive. \nSometimes \nwe  \nknow \nwhere \nother \nriders \nare  \non  \nthe \ntrack \nand \ncan \n\nalert our rider with tap signals on \ntheir leg.” \nRussell built their race outfit \naround a Kawasaki 900cc, which \nthey took to the abandoned and \nderelict Roebourne Speedway \ntrack to  practice and develop \ntheir skills before hitting the  big \ntime at Claremont Speedway. \n“When we  appeared on  the \nscene there were a  few funny \nlooks about how effective | would \nbe,  being 50  kg wringing wet.

Yee-ha! | finally got it! And I'm still the only female to have won one.” (taken from Peter White’s 100 More \nAussie Legends of the Speedway). Up until around early 2000s, to  be eligible to compete in the  nerve racking \nAustralian Title you  must have won your state title or have placed 2nd. Rules then changed to only first placing \nin  each state title, with other positions to  qualify for  available only to  in-form riders. So, with only six  state \nchampions seeded, the qualifying event for the  remaining 10 race positions is an  incredible spectacle in itself. \nThe fastest speed that was recorded during Tina and  Mark's time as  a team came while racing the  Aussie \nLong Track Title in Morgan (the event is the  Morgan Mile). The  local constabulary were there having a sticky \nbeak and decided to  see  what the  top  speed was on  the  longest part of the  track with their speed radar. \n\n90 =   FASTWOMEN \nThey dutifully approached Tina and Mark to  advise that they reached close to  285 kmh. “No  brakes —  who \nneeds them!” \nTina sustained quite a few injuries and  broken bones over the years but there was  one  accident in 1988 that \nhad  Russell rattled and  he didn't want her to continue. It was  on  the back straight at Claremont “It was a handicap \nrace and we  were back on  the  110 metre mark chasing down the back markers. A rider had troubles and he was  out \nnear the fence.

This event marked the  beginning \nof aremarkable chapter in Mandy's life and a remarkable chapter \nin the  history of motorcycle racing in Australia. \nAs  a  young woman, Mandy's striking face, form and skill \nbehind the handlebars was well known within Adelaide's \nmotorcycling communities. She was known as  the chick on  the \nblue bike (Kawasaki ZX9R Ninja) who could do  wheelies and \nwho smoked up the  roads doing burn-outs. Mandy was a self- \nconfessed “Rat Bag”! It was  on  this  bike that Mandy almost met \nher maker! \n“| had just finished work (as a cleaner) and | wanted to go fora \nride. | wasn’t speeding, | was just tired and, apparently, | fell asleep. \nMandy and one of her famous wheelies. \n\n94 =   FASTWOMEN \nA taxi driver saw me  slump over the petrol tank, | hit a tree  and ended up with my kneecap ripped in half, | broke \nmy left wrist, hand and arm, three ribs, snapped my scapula, lacerated my liver, bruised my pancreas and ruptured \nmy spleen. | also had some skin missing and down one  side of my body was  black and blue. | remember waking up \nand there was  blood splattered on  the road in front of my face and | couldn't breathe. It was  totally frightening.” \n(interview with Mandy Beales, The Advertiser Magazine, Adelaide April 2009). \nComing from a lineage of rally car  racing parents, the need for speed was in her blood but she also had the \ninnate ability to  race. Mandy’s greatest inspiration is her mother, Lyn Peake, who was one of South Australia’s \nfirst female jockeys, a winner at the Collingrove Hill Climb and  now competes as  a Master’s Athlete 200  metre \nrunner. \nLyn \nwas \nalso \nthe \ninitiator \nof \nMandy's \nlifetime \nconnection \nwith \nmotorcycles \nwhen \nshe \nbought \nher \na \nHonda \nMR50 \ndirt \nbike. \nBeing \na \n10-year-old \ncountry \nkid \nMandy \nuse \nto \n“hoon \naround’ \ntheir \nfarm \nbut \nwhen \nthey \nmoved \nto \nsuburbia, \na \nfew \nyears \nlater, \nthe \ndirt \nbike \nwas \nrelegated \nto \nthe \nshed. \nThoughts \nof \nsaving \nfor \na \nfour- \nwheeled \nsteed \ndid \nnot \nenter \nMandy's \nmind. \nWhen \nshe \ngot \na \npart-time \njob \nin \na \nsupermarket \nshe \nsaved \nfuriously \nand \nas \nsoon \nas \nshe \nturned \n16, \ngot \nher \nlicence \nand \npurchased \na \nHonda \nCB250T. \nIt \nwas \nnot \nlong \nbefore \nMandy \ndeterminedly \nsaved \nagain \nand \nwhen \nher \nunrestricted \nlicence \nwas \nissued \nshe \nhad \nher \nsights \nset \non \nthe \nvery \nfast, \nvery exciting, Kawasaki ZX9R Ninja. \nMandy's \nfascination \nwith \nmotorcycle \nracing \ndeveloped \nwhilst \nwatching \ngreat \nracers \nlike  \nMick \nDoohan \non \nTV, \nbut \nat \nthat \nstage \nshe \ndid \nnot  \nknow \nthat \na \nlocal \nrace \nscene \nexisted. \nThis \ndiscovery \nonly \ncame \nafter \nher \ndeath- \ndefying \nmisadventure \nwhen \nShane \nLynch \nof \nAdelaide \nMotorcycle \nRecovery, \nwho \nhad \ncollected \nher \ncrashed \nNinja, \nrecognised \nMandy's \npotential \nfor \nracing \nand \nalso \nrecommended \nthat \nthe \nrace \ntrack \nmay \nbe \na \nsafer \npartner \nfor \nMandy \nand \nher \nmotorcycle. \nIt \nwas \nwith \nShane's \nassistance \nthat \nMandy \nwent \nto \nwork \nin \nthe \npit \ncrew \nof \nthe \nlocal \nDucati \nracing \nteam \nof \nJamie \nVideon \nand \nRussell \nPhillips. \nIn \nthree \nyears \nshe \nlearnt \na \nlot \nabout \nthe \nins \nand \nouts \nof \nthe \ninner \nworkings \nof \nmotorcycles \nand \ntrack \ntechniques. \nIn \n2003, \nwhen \nshe \nwas \n28, \nanother \nlife \nchanging \nexperience \nfor \nMandy \noccurred. \nRussell \nPhillips \ndragged \nhis \nold \nDucati \nTT2 \nout \nof \nhis \nshed \nand \nallowed \nMandy \nto \nhave \nher \nvery \nfirst \nride, \naround \nthe \nMallala \nMotor \nSport \nPark \ntrack. \nYes, \nshe \nwas \nnervous \nand \n\nno,  she  didn’t break any records, but  it was \nin that very first lap that she  knew what she \nwanted to  do  and that, of course, was race \nmotorcycles. \nStarting as  a  C-grader in  the National \nSuper Stock series in 2003, Mandy had sold \nher Ninja and her beloved electric guitar \nto  purchase a  race-suitable bike, being a \nYamaha YZF-R6 600cc. With this purchase \ncame a  job offer from Yamaha World. The \ndealership realised the vastly growing \nmarket of women motorcyclists and knew \nthat Mandy had the  knowledge and savoir- \nfaire the business needed. Mandy then \nwent on  to  compete in  the 2004 season \nof the  Shell Advance Australian Superbike \nChampionship (Super Stock and Super \nSport) riding her 600cc and within 12 \nmonths was upgraded from C to B grade. At \nthe  time, Mandy had been quite happy to \nsit in C grade to develop her skills. However, \nin  a  possible attempt to  oust Mandy from \ncompetition, an  official accompanied by a \nlawyer, pushed for her to be up-graded early. \nCHAPTER 11  MANDY BEALES 95 \nMandy's race  face. \n\nMandy in full flight. \n\nCHAPTER 11 MANDY BEALES *   97 \nThey \nsucceeded \nwith \nthe \nupgrade \nbut \nmust \nhave \nturned \non  \ntheir \nheels \nwhen \nshe \nwent \non  \nto \nachieve \nmore \nthan \neven \nshe \ncould \nhave \nimagined. \nThe \nteam \nat \nKawasaki \nrecognised \nMandy's \ndeveloping \ntalent \nand  \noffered \nher \na \nfactory-supported \nmotorcycle. \nHowever, \nthe \nacceptance \nof \nthis \ndeal \nmeant \nMandy \nhad \nto \ngive \nup \nher \nposition \nat \nYamaha \nWorld \nand \nshe \nwent \non \nto \nwork \nfor \nBlackwell \nFunerals. \nMandy \nstared \ndeath \nin \nthe  \nface \non  \nmore \nthan \none \noccasion. \nShe \nbroke \nthe  \nmould \nin \nevery \naspect \nof \nher \nlife, \nworking \nas  \na  \nmortician, \nthen \nfuneral \ndirector \nfor  \nBlackwell \nFunerals \n(her \nmajor \nrace \nsponsor) \nand \nracing \nmotorcycles \nin what was a male dominated \ndomain. \nGoing from strength to strength, Mandy was winning races and people were noticing. \nWith a burning desire to race in the 2006 125 Grand Prix series, Mandy’s family and friends banded together \nand raised the funds to purchase the bike that she needed to compete, a Honda RS 125 GP. Mandy really hit her \nstraps and accomplished her first major win, taking out  the  South Australian Championship 125  GP  Series at \nMallala Motor Sport Park South Australia. \nA term quite often used in motorcycling especially when it comes to speed and handling is ‘he  rides like  a \ngirl. Well, Mandy Beales put this term to bed! \nEncountering a barrage of sexist attitudes on  the track hardened her heart and  made her more determined \nto succeed, but when overhearing a fellow racer say that she was just a “nice piece of arse” to follow around the \ntrack, she was  heartbroken. \nOn  many levels motorcycle racing is not for the faint of heart! \n“As soon as you hit the tarmac, it’s ‘bang’! And you can’t slow down and you can’t back off, you are just there to go \nas fast as you can  and develop the bike’s performance. You take a corner and your knee is on  the ground, and when \nyou hit the brakes you're screaming ‘shit’ in your helmet, ‘cos you  think you're not going to stop, but somehow you \nend up stopping and pulling it together. If you're not out of your seat thinking, ‘I’m not going to be able to stop; then \nyou're not going fast enough. The moment you cross the finish line, whether you're first or 20th, it’s like,  ‘wow, I’ve \ndone it’” (interview with Mandy Beales, The Advertiser Magazine,Adelaide April 2009). \n\n98 FAST WOMEN \nThe reality of the  expense of racing was hard to  swallow. Even \nwith factory support (meaning the loan of  a  motorcycle and \ndiscounted parts), meeting the  constant expense of  airfares and \naccommodation, race entry fees and forking out thousands per meet \nfor  tyres alone was too  taxing for  Mandy to  continue.

It typically involves a 5 km‘run up’ then your average speed is recorded over the next \nmile (1.6 km). Records are  established from a two-way average pass, up and down the track. It’s not  as  easy as \nit sounds, as one  of the biggest hurdles is the almost complete lack of traction. “It’s like riding on a hard packed \ndirt road with a gravel surface. You are skating and wheel spinning constantly. The faster you go, the more unstable \nyour handling gets, as your machine literally becomes flighty (a Boeing 747 takes off at  180 mph).” Reaching 200 \nmph \n(321.86 \nkph) \non \nthe \nground \nis \ndifficult, \ndoing \nit \nwith \nlimited \ntraction \nis \neven \nharder. \nGoing \nat \nspeeds \nway \n\n102 ==   FASTWOMEN \nbeyond, while seated on  a‘sit-on’ bike is exponentially more difficult. \nKim  was  only six years old  when she first  encountered a motorcycle. Her  uncle, a farm mechanic, regularly \nserviced a fleet of monkey bikes that were part of the act for a nearby circus. Whilst Kim  was visiting one day, \nher  uncle gave her  and her  cousins the  chance to  ride them around a  back paddock of his  property. “/ still \nremember barrelling down the paddock, heading straight for the fence and have remembered ever since, which way \nto turn the throttle.” \nBy \nthe  \nage \nof \n10,  \nKim \nand \nher  \ncousins \nwere \nhooked! \nThey \nhad \nall  \nbought \ndirt \nbikes, \nKim’s \nwas \na  \nHonda \nXR75cc, “and the rest is history”. \nGrowing \nup  \non  \nacreage \nKim \nhad \nquite \na  \ngood \npractice \ncircuit \n“for \nmy \nchildhood \nimagination’. \nIn \nsupport, \nKim's \ndad \npurchased \na \nbike \nto \nride \nalong \nwith \nher \nwhen \nthey \nwould \ngo \non \nfamily \noutings, \ncamping \nand \nriding \nthrough \nfarms \nand \nforests. \nThis \nfamily \nfun \nlasted \nfor \na \nfew \nyears \nuntil \n“all \nthe \nDads \ndecided \nthat \nsailing \nwas \ntheir \nnext \nadventure. \n| \nwas \nthe \nonly \none \nof \nall \nmy \ncousins \nwho \nkept \non \nwith \nthe \nbikes.” \nAt  \n16, \nKim’s \npassion \nfor \nmotorcycles \nhad  \nonly \ngrown. \nShe  \nhad  \nsaved \nher  \npennies \nto  \nbuy \nher \nfirst \nroad \nbike \nand \nhoped \nfor \napproval \nfrom \nher \nparents \nthat \nwould \nseal \nthe \ndeal. \nYears \nlater \nher \nmother \nstill \nfound \nthe \nnotes \nthat \nKim \nhad \nscattered \naround \ntheir \nhouse \nand \nburied \ndeep \nwithin \nthe \nlinen \ncupboards, \nasking \n“/s \nit \nok? \nYou \ndon’t \nmind \nif \n| \nget \na \nmotorbike?” \nKnowing \nthat \nshe \ncould \nachieve \nher \nmotorcycle \nlicence \nat \n16 \nyears \nand \nnine \nmonths, \nshe \nconvinced \nher \nuncle \nto \ntest \nride \nher \ndesired \nKawasaki \nGPZ600. \nThe \nKawasaki \nwas \nspecial \nto \nKim. \nShe \nhad \nKim Krebs. \n\nCHAPTER 12 KIM KREBS 103 \nwatched \nand \nadmired \nan  \ninspirational \nneighbour, \nwho \nhad \ngone \nfrom \nnever \nhaving \nridden \na \nbike \nto \npurchasing \nand \nloving \na \nGPZ600 \nand \nKim  \ndecided \nto \nfollow \nin \nher \nfootsteps. \nKim  \nhad  \nsaved \nup \nthe  \nmoney \nfor \nher \nGPZ600 \n(1984 model) from part-time \njobs and bought it secondhand \nin 1988 with 35,000 km on the clock. By the \ntime she upgraded \nto a Yamaha FJR1100, \nanother 100,000 kms had passed under its wheels. By the way, Kim's \nfirst 4-wheeled \npurchase \ncame only when she reached the age of 42, in the form of a utility so that she could \ntransport \nher race bike. \nIn the late 80s Kim  was  a university student on  a shoestring budget, so whenever her bike needed servicing, \nor the  registration was  due, she reduced her spending and  madly saved the  money needed. “/ remember being \nreally short of cash one year, having reduced my weekly allocation of money for food down to $3.50 a week. Enough \nto buy a loaf of bread and a bag of oranges.” \n‘Kim had her  first taste of  motorcycle racing when she  joined the Pine Gully Racing Association and \nparticipated in an  InterVarsity (University) Road Race track days. It was  several years later in 2005 that she took \nup  historic road racing. The attraction of race events, like  the  MotoGP and  World Superbikes at  Phillip Island \nwas where Kim met and befriended many like-minded motorcycling enthusiasts. This is where Kim  met  Greg \nWatters! Greg is Australia’s most accomplished motorcycle land speed racer and has a lifelong connection to \nmotorsports. Racing and having been a V8 racing team mechanic in many different events (drag racing, track \ndays, V8 Ute road racing series etc.), he is proficient in the intricacies of race mechanics. So, when Greg offered \nKim  the opportunity to go land speed racing she said “yes”, then asked him  what it was! \nWith the  philosophy “Try before you say no!”, Kim  was racing with Greg only five  months after what became \na life changing offer. \nThere is no  way to  practice Land Speed Racing, although Kim did  ask the  local policeman in her one-cop \ntown of Yackandandah, his reply was “No  Way!” \nWith \nonly \none \nevent \nper  \nyear \nat  \nLake \nGairdner, \nSouth \nAustralia, \nKim \nand \nGreg \nsoon \nlooked \nto  \nthe  \niconic \nspeed trials on  Lake Bonneville in Utah, USA. \n\n104 %   FASTWOMEN \nTheir philosophy is that the only way to approach any event is to make sure the  bike is prepared and  treat \nevery run  like it’s the only opportunity you'll ever have. \nIn \nher \nfirst \nattempt \non  \nthe  \nsalt  \nat  \nLake \nGairdner \nin \n2006, \nriding \na  \n1996 \nSuzuki \nGSXR750, \nKim \nachieved \nan \nimpressive \n166  \nmph \n(267 \nkph). \nKim’s \nfirst \nthoughts \nwere \n“I \ncan  \ngo \nso \nmuch \nfaster!” \nIn \nthe \nsame \nyear \nKim \nand \nGreg \nmet \nCalifornian \nfireman \nJim \nHiggins \nand \nthey \nhit \nit \noff. \nJim \nhad \ntravelled \ninto \nthe \nheart \nof \nSouth \nAustralia’s \ndesert \ncountry, \nto \nLake \nGairdner, \nfor \nthe \nDry \nLake \nRacers \nAnnual \nSpeed \nWeek, \nto \nrace \nhis \nBuell \nturbocharged- \nnitrous \nmotorcycle. \nJim’s \nbike \nsustained \ndamage \nto \nits \nengine \nearly \nin \nthe \nrace \nweek, \nso \nhe \nhad \ntime \nup \nhis \nsleeve \nto \nmingle \nwith \nhis \nfellow \ncompetitors. \nKim, \nGreg \nand \nJim \nformed \na \nstrong \nbond \nand \nfrom \nthis \nmeeting \nof \nlike \nminds, \n‘Black \nArt \nRacing’ \nwas \nborn. \nWhen \ndeciding \non \na \nteam \nname, \nthe \nthree \nteam \nmates \nall \nacknowledged \nthat \nit \nis \nmost \ncertainly \na‘black \nart’ \nto \ncreate \na \nbike \nwith \nso \nmuch \npower. \nThe  \nnext \ntwo  \nyears \nsaw  \nLake \nGairdner \nwashed \nout, \nwith \nunseasonal \nlate \nsummer \nrain. \nBut \nin \n2009, \nKim  \nrose \nto \nthe \nchallenge \nagain \nand  \nachieved \nthe \ncelebrated \ntitle \nof \nAustralia’s \nFastest \nWoman \nona \nmotorcycle. \nKim  \nset \na \nLand \nSpeed \nRecord \nachieving \n188.41 \nmph \n(303 \nkph) \nat \nLake \nGairdner \non \na \nturbocharged \nSuzuki \nGSXR750. \nLater, \nin \nthe \nsame \nyear \nshe \njoined \nGreg \nand \nJim \nat \nBonneville \nSalt \nFlats \nin \nUtah \nwith \nthe \nthree \nriders \nsharing \nthe \nturbocharged \n1996 \nSuzuki \nGSX1350R \nHayabusa \n(Japanese \nfor \n‘Peregrine \nfalcon’, \na \nbird \nthat \noften \nserves \nas \na \nmetaphor \nfor \nspeed). \nAs \nwell \nas \nwhat \nwas \nto \nbecome \nthe \nslightly \nfamous \neBay \npurchase, \na \nsight-unseen \n1999 \nSuzuki \nGSXR750. \nIt \nwas \non \nboard \nthis \n750cc \nbike \nthat \nKim \nand \nthe \nteam \nwent \non \nto \nset \nmultiple \nAmerican \nland \nspeed \nrecords. \nLake \nGairdner, \nSouth \nAustralia \nand \nBonneville \nSalt \nFlats, \nUtah \nUSA, \nare  \ntwo \ntotally \ndifferent \nlandscapes, \nbut \nboth \nare  \nincredibly \nbeautiful \nand  \nserene! \nLake \nGairdner \nis \npositioned \napproximately \n90 \nmetres \nabove \nsea  \nlevel \nand \nBonneville \napproximately \n1600 \nmetres. \nLake \nGairdner \nis \na \nnatural \nlake, \nwhereas \nBonneville \nis \nan \nancient \nlandscape \nthat \nhas \nbecome \nmodified \nfrom \npotash \nmining \nthat \nsees \nthe \nnatural \nsalts \nextracted \nfrom \nthe \nsystem \nbetween \neach \nwinter \nand \nsummer. \nThere \nis \nalso \na \nhuge \ndifference \nin \nair \nthickness \nbetween \nthe \ntwo \nsites, \nwhich \nmakes \nfaster \nspeeds \nmuch \nmore \nachievable \nin \nthe \nthinner \nair \nof \nthe \n‘States’ \n\nCHAPTER 12  KIM KREBS 105 \nSo  what goes through Kim’s mind when \nattempting a  Land Speed Record? “7 gears! | have \nhad a few fast runs where | only got into 5th gear.

Rocking back and forth on  the  centre- \nstand, and pretending she  was actually riding, Kellie imagined \nherself pulling out  onto the  street and riding it around to  her \nNan’s house to show it off, rehearsing in her mind what she’d say \nwhen she got there. \nMost teenagers of the day had posters of rock stars on their wall, \nbut not  Kellie, she had  posters of motorcycles, always nagging her \nparents to visit friends whose kids had  motorbikes so  she  could \nKellie Buckley. \n\n112 %   FASTWOMEN \nhave a ride. Kellie’s father was no  stranger to motorcycling, owning an  old  Harley-Davidson shovel head which \n“he spent far too much time and money customising with countless front ends, a myriad of paint schemes, and even \ngoing so far as fitting fuel injection and a power commander —  pioneering stuff in the early 1990s”. \nThankfully Kellie’s father, recognised the flame that resides within Kellie's spirit and this flame was not going \nto subside. Realising it was more than just a passing phase, he arrived home late  one night with a bright red \nSuzuki DES  80 tied to the  back of his truck. \n“| think it was  my first true love.” \nKellie would ride every chance she could get, spending hours and  hours riding around and around the small \narea her father had  fenced off in their yard which was only big enough that she  could just and briefly snick \nsecond gear. It was  this  bike that got her hooked on  the  smell of two-stroke and  it was  then that she  realised \nthe  intricacy and detail of riding and learned to  appreciate the  inner workings of a  motorcycle. “One which \ninfuriated my mother that | could love and care  for something so much while | had “a bedroom that looks like that!”” \nA couple of years later Kellie's dad  bought her a near-new Honda XR100, a more reliable bike. This meant he \nwas more willing to take her to places where she could practice clutch, throttle and brake control. Unbeknown \nto her at the time the time spent “just doing doughnuts” in her parent's yard, creating elaborate designs in the \ngravel, passing hours, trying to figure out how to keep the front wheel aloft, made Kellie an  accomplished rider. \nKellie was nine years old. \n“Other days I'd pretend | was  lining up for races, heart pounding, and letting my nine-year-old imagination stand \nme  on podiums with great applause until my brother appeared to tell me  it was  time for dinner. I'd sneak into  the \nlocal newsagent and got yelled at by old Arthur for hiding behind the newsstands and reading Australasian Dirt Bike \nMagazine. \nWhen \n| \nsaw \na \nshooting \nstar, \nor \non \nbirthdays, \nI'd \nalways \nwish \none \nday \nI'd \nbe \nable \nto \nrace \nthe \nInternational \nSix \nDay \nEnduro. \nAdults \nwould \nask \nme \nwhat \nI \nwanted \nto \nbe \nwhen \n| \ngrow \nup \nand \nI'd \nanswer,’ \na \npostman! \nSo \n| \ncan \nride \nmotorbikes all day.” \nBefore Kellie turned 10, motorcycles were het life. \n\nCHAPTER 13  KELLIE BUCKLEY 3   113 \nKellie’s \ndad \nwas \nalways \nmad \nabout \nmotorcycles, \nand \nhe  \nstill  \nis.  \nHer \nbrother \nhad  \na  \nlate \n1970s \nYamaha \nDT  \n175, \nthe \ntwo-stroke \nsix \nspeed, \nand \nKellie \nspent \nher \nnext \nfew \nteenage \nyears \ndiscovering \nhow \nto \nkick \nstart \nthe \nbike, \nstanding \non \na \ncouple \nof \nold \nfuel \ndrums \nfor \nassistance. \nAfter \ncompleting \nboarding \nschool \nat \nthe \nage \nof \n20, \nshe \nmoved \nto \nNewcastle, \nNSW, \nand \nneeded \nto \nfind \na \njob. \nWith \nan \nundying \npersistence \nand \ndetermination, \nKellie \nwalked \ninto \nevery \nmotorcycle \ndealership \nin \nthe \nlocal \narea \nto ask \nif \nthere \nwas \na \nposition \navailable. \nFinally, \nChris \nHirst \nfrom \nKawasaki \nNewcastle \nagreed \nto give \nher \na \ngo. \n“Accessories \nand \nspare \nparts \nbecame \nmy \nworld \nand \nthere \nwasn’t \na \npart \nnumber \nfor \nan \nearly \n— \nmodel \nKX \noil seal or gasket that | didn’t know off by heart.” \nAt the end of 2001, Kellie learnt motorcycling’s toughest lesson. Her \nKellie and dad on  his Shovelhead, circa 1987. \ndad was contracted to  cart cotton in the  tiny northern NSW town of \nCroppa Creek. He had called asking for her help, needing someone to drive the harvester for a couple of weeks. \nIn the  mid-summer’s searing heat, with no  hesitation Kellie packed up her Yamaha TRX 850  and rode the 600 \nkm  northwest to  meet him. Kellie’s dad owned an  impressive Cagiva Raptor 1000cc. He  needed help! Kellie's \nfather knew that she had the riding skill to deliver the earnings from the business to Moree (66 kms) to cash the \ncheque. “Take my bike if you like” he offered. She  loved the power of the Raptor's TL 1000 Suzuki donor engine. \nThe  only hiccup was being unfamiliar with the weight and  the  characteristics of an  upright naked bike. After \nmaking arrangements to  meet her  Dad at the  Croppa Creek Pub a  couple of hours later, Kellie set  off!  With \ntemperatures well above 40°C and the  pub ‘just down the road’, she  removed her jacket and  gloves and  tied \nthem to the  back seat. \n‘At a fair clip | hit  a pothole, which tore the bars out from my hands and spat me off the bike. Once | stop rag-dolling \ndown the God-knows-how-hot asphalt, my shredded body burning from being torn apart by hot, coarse bitumen. \n\n114 =   FASTWOMEN \nAll | could do was jump to my feet and run  around in circles to try and think about something other than the pain. \nThe bike had cartwheeled itself into pieces and lay in the centre of the road and after | squinted up and down the \nlong, flat and  frightfully remote road, | looked down at my body and  realised the magnitude of the  damage. I'd \nskinned myself. Both hands were a bloodied mess of torn flesh, my exposed palms the first thing to hit the ground \nat  100 and something kays an  hour. The rest of me,  not much better. Something, | still don’t know what, managed \nto pierce my kneecap, I'd ground the corner of my hipbone, my stomach, shoulders, forearms and thighs all skinless \nand stinging in the searing heat.” \nAn  unlikely saviour appeared, an  old  bloke in an  old  white ute,  he sang out  “get in, I'll take you into  Moree \nHospital, but if | go over 80 K’s an  hour she  will overheat, okay?” It took her  a  long time to  realise that she  still \nwasn't bleeding. When she  looked down into the foot-well of the  ute \nshe  realised the centimetre of clear fluid her Blundstones were sitting \nin had  seeped from her wounds. She went into shock! \nKellie only rides without a jacket on  very rare occasions and has \nnever and  will  never ride without gloves again. \nKellie’s love of motorcycling never wavered. \nLaying \nher  \nemployment \nfoundations \nat  \nthe  \nKawasaki \ndealership, \nshe \nspent \na \nlot \nof \ntime \ntalking \nto \nimporters \nand  \nbuilt \na \nfirm \nrelationship \nwith \nthe \nteam \nat \nMonza \nImports, \na \nprivate \nbusiness \nthat \ndistributes \nsome \nof \nthe \nworld’s \nleading \nmotorcycle \nbrands. \nWhen \na \nphone- \nsales \nposition \nbecame \navailable \nat \nits \nSydney-based \nwarehouse \nshe \njumped \nat \nthe \nopportunity. \n“A \ngreat \nplace \nto \nwork, \na \nfun \nand \nrelaxed \nenvironment \nwhere \nevery \nsingle \nemployee \nwas \nthere \nbecause \nof \nthe \ndeep \nlove \nof \nmotorcycles \nmade \nfor \nsome \nenormously \nfond \nmemories. \nBut \nfour \nor \nfive \nyears \nin| \nwas  \ncraving \nanother \nchallenge, \nso \n| \nhad \na \nquiet \nword \nwith \nKellie on  Honda Z50R, circa 1984. \n\nCHAPTER 13  KELLIE BUCKLEY %   115 \nthe universe to keep an  eye out for one  for me.” \nIt \nwas \nnow \nthat \nKellie's \nlove \nof \nmotorcycles \nexpanded \ninto \na  \nlove \nof \nracing. \nThe \n400 \ncc  \nroad \nracing \nclass, \nwhich \nat \nthe \ntime \nwas \nbooming \nin \npopularity \non \nthe \nEast \nCoast, \nenticed \nKellie \nto \nthe \ntrack. \nRiding \na \nHonda \nVFR400, \nshe \nbegan \nracing, \nachieving \nvarying \nlevels \nof \nsuccess. \nHer \nwish \nto \nthe \nuniverse \nwas \njust \nabout \nto \nmaterialise. \nTaking \na \nday \noff \nwork \nshe \nbooked \nherself \ninto \na \nquiet, \nmid-week \ntrack \nday \nto \nspend \nsome \ntime \non \nher \nbike \nbefore \nthe \nnext \nrace. \n“The day was  going well. The sun  was  shining, | had the entire garage to myself, and Dad and | were making \ninroads with the set-up. That was until, at about 11 AM  all these blokes wearing brand-new gear rolled in, all on \nbrand-new bikes and, knowing the ego  is generally associated with the situation, Dad and | looked at each other \nwith an  all-knowing eye roll and | prepared myself for the belittling which was  sure to ensue.” When helmets were \nremoved the legendary road racers and  media faces that she had only ever read about in Australian Motorcycle \nNews stood before her; Kenny Wootton, Mick Matheson, Matt Shields and Greg Reynolds. Kellie was  star-struck! \nShe  went about her  normal day until she  plucked up the  courage to  initiate a conversation. By the end of \nthe  day, Kellie and her  Dad were having a  beer with Matt Shields (a freelance journalist who has  had  the  role \nof Editor for magazines including ‘Australian Motorcycle News’, ‘Australasian Dirt Bike’ magazine, and ‘Australian \nMountain Bike’ magazine). “By the end of my second schooner | was listening to myself talking up the advantages of \nhaving a female staff member on  the country’s best motorcycle magazine.” \nEven though Kellie awoke the  next morning scolding herself for  being so  bold, a  few hours later while \nanswering the  phone at  Monza her  boldness paid off!  Mick Matheson (Editor at ‘Australian Road Rider, and \nVideo Producer at‘Phantom 2 Media’) was  on  the other end of the line asking whether Kellie was  serious when \nshe said she’d like to work for ‘Australian Motorcycle News’. \nStarting as  a  staff journalist for ‘Australian Motorcycle News’ in  May 2006, Kellie worked for  seven years, \nalongside three editors and  worked her way through every role (except art director). \n“| was appointed the  highest rank in Australian motorcycle journalism. Becoming the  editor of AMCN was  a \n\n116 &   FASTWOMEN \ngoal I'd set myself very early on  and, like my first job in bikes at Kawasaki Newcastle, it was  sheer persistence and \ndetermination that got me  there.” \nKellie achieved the title of the first woman in Australia to be appointed as the editor of the country’s \nhighest selling car  or  motorcycle magazine. \n“| had my knockers, always the blokes with the biggest egos who were slower than me,  of course.

In  between \nthe  ages of 4 and 9 she  rapidly developed her  skills to  the  point \nof winning the  2004 NSW State Motocross titles against a  grid of \nboys on  65cc motorbikes.

Fortunately, Tania Lawrence is an  avid and accomplished \nmotorcyclist and a successful business woman, and proved she was up to the task. \nTania was elected as  President of Motorcycling Australia in 2015 and became the  first Western Australian \nand the first woman to be appointed to the role. This was no  small feat, as the organisation manages more than \n32,700 competitors, 350  + affiliated clubs and  over 3000 registered officials. Subsequent to this appointment, \nshe was elected as  the  President of FIM Oceania representing Australia and New Zealand, which resulted \nin  a  seat on  the  Board of the  International Motorcycling Federation (FIM) in  Geneva. Tania’s devotion and \ncommitment to motorcycling is clear as  her roles on  both boards were on  a voluntary basis. \nAt the time of her appointment, Tania was, and  still  is, employed by Australia’s largest independent oil and \ngas \ncompany, \nWoodside \nEnergy \nLtd., \nwhere \nshe \nis \nresponsible \nfor \noptimising \nWoodside’s \ninternational \ngrowth \nand \nperformance. \nWith \nover \n16 \nyears’ \nof \nsenior \nlevel \nexperience \nin \nstrategy, \nrisk \nand \ngovernance, \na \nBachelor \nof \nEconomics \nand  \na  \nBachelor \nof \nArts \n(Honours) \ndegree, \nTania \nwas  \ncertainly \na \nsound \nand  \nwise \nchoice \nfor \nboth \nof \nher positions. \n\n126 FAST WOMEN \nTania Lawrence. \n\nCHAPTER 15 TANIALAWRENCE %    127 \nDuring her  tenure as  President, Tania worked with Motorcycling Australia and the  FIM, to  improve the \nposition of Australian competitive motorcyclists on  the worldwide stage. \n“Joining the MA Board and FIM Board as the Oceania representative was  such a highlight for me.  |am very proud \nof what our Board delivered in such a short time, especially with re-establishing our reputation on  the international \nstage and restoring the financial stability and credibility with the national body. The groundwork is now also laid to \ncreate a national unified approach to grow the sport and advocate strongly for the interests of motorcyclists.” \nTania has, to date, been riding for 25 years competitively and  recreationally, both on  road and  off-road. “/ love \nthat, irrespective of whether | am  riding in Sydney’s Blue Mountains, Rajasthan India, The Rockies in Canada or the \nDolomites in Italy, local motorcyclists will join alongside and share the best experiences of their country with me.  The \nexhilaration of competing or simply riding through small country towns along roads with stunning scenery and in all \nweather, creates lasting memories and friendships that brings so much joy and shared happiness. | only wish | had had \nfemale mentors to encourage me along as a junior. \nUntil she  was nine years old Tania lived in  Perth. “/ have very fond memories of running out each afternoon \nto greet my dad arriving home on  his work issued Honda 250 motorbike (he was a ‘grey ghost’ parking inspector). \nFirst dad would have me  guess what he had for me  in the bike pannier -  and | was  always lucky to find it being an \n‘ice-cream sandwich’ or a ‘Hazelnut Roll: He would then lift me up onto the back of the bike and take me for a dinky \naround \nthe \nblock. \nThere \n| \nwould \nsit, \nproud \nas \npunch, \nenjoying \nthe \nwind \nin \nmy \nhair, \nice-cream \nmelting \nall \nover \nme \nand \nthe biggest smile on face.

She set  her  sights on  a Honda CBR600, \nwhich was  then considered a sport bike that could stay with anything else on  the road. \nShe decided to do it right this time and  get professional riding tuition rather than be taught by nay-saying \nmotorcycling friends. After a quick study of the  relevant section of the  Perth Yellow Pages, Tania arranged a \nlesson with a school Advantage Motorcycle Rider Training. She met and  instantly gelled with Nenad Djurdjevic, \nthe  owner/operator of the  school. Nenad became Tania’s coach and mentor and inspired Tania further along \nher motorcycling path sharing not only his passion for riding in all its forms (sport, touring dirt, adventure), but \nalso for motorcycle safety and motorcyclists’ rights. Nenad recalls: “/ first met  Tania when she was  26 when she \nbooked a lesson with my motorcycle rider training school to prepare for her open class licence test.  She originally \nwas  due to have her first lesson with another instructor but had to change her appointment so that | took her lesson. \nThe rest as  they say is history, and we have been together ever since!” Nenad not  only encouraged her to get her \nrace licence, but followed up by working through the night to prep her race bikes and was there as Tania’s moral \nsupport and  pit crew. “From the very first lesson, | knew! had finally met someone who understood my passion and \nshared it 100%.

FOREWARD 3   1 \nFOREWORD \nTo  a  motorcyclist, the  reason we  ride needs no  explanation, but  for those unfamiliar with the joy and sense \nof freedom it brings, it can  only be described as  an  unparalleled experience of simultaneous exhilaration and \npeace. Exhilaration through the adrenalin hit we  get from the  sensation of flying through the  air, unimpeded \nby a steel cage, with the wind passing over you  and the roar  of the engine in your ears. And peace, as you  exist \ntotally in the  moment, undistracted, focused only on  carving the  corner ahead or just relaxing and  taking in \nthe scenery and  scents. \nWith so  much to offer, this sport, this activity, this passion, is increasingly being enjoyed by girls and women \nalong with boys and men. Participating in competition, supporting the sport through journalism, running club \nevents, or simply getting on  a bike to ride recreationally no  longer raises eyebrows. The women in this book are \nthe  reason why. They have pioneered the way forward and  are  the  reason we  now see  more women realising \nthe opportunities, friendships and  passion that comes from being on  two  wheels. \n| wish | had  had this  book when | was a little girl. Every page inspires courage, determination, individualism \nand achievement. No  matter what your aspirations as  a  motorcyclist, these stories will  help you realise your \nown riding dream and, if not already, will  see  you  appreciate motorcycling in a whole new light. \nTania Lawrence \nFIM Oceania and Motorcycling Australia President 2015-16"

The  Yamaha Agricultural ‘Ag’ bike was a crucial work horse to  Dad and Mum, \ntransporting them around our  3000-acre property and used for  rounding up the  cattle and sheep, with our \nworking dog Jack’ always perched on  the back. This bike was more than just a source of fun for me,  it delivered \nthe exhilaration of simply being myself and  being within myself as | zoomed across the dusty paddocks, racing \nthe grain trains that thundered past. \nAs for many country kids, the  bright lights of city life beckoned and  | headed off for Sydney at the  age  of \n18, so  beginning a 20-year hiatus from being aboard a  bike.

With lan’s encouragement and support and Mark Twain's \ninspirational quote singing in  my  ears, at the  ripe age  of 38,  | gained my  road licence, and so  followed the \nexhilarating and  challenging journey of learning that lead to owning my dream Harley Davidson Fat Boy. \nIn 2013, as  my  passion grew, | went searching for stories about like-minded women that | could relate to \nand  women who had  previously discovered the joy of motorcycling. | soon came to  realise these stories were \nhard to find. Where could | find the  literature that presented Australian women’s stories that | craved to  read? \nAs any  avid motorcyclist understands, a journey to a  newsagent or  bookstore is a constant search for writing \nthat satisfies the  rider’s soul. After placing a very simple advertisement in the  free, ‘Can you help?’ section of \nthe Adelaide Advertiser ‘Sunday Mail; | was inundated with phone calls and-emails from women and men who \nexpressed heartfelt stories of themselves, their mothers, aunts and  sisters, aboard their two-wheeled steeds. \nEvery story, every expression and every photo received, told me  that | was on  the  tip of a very inspiring and \nhistorically significant ‘iceberg’ \nMy only recollection of History class during my high school years, yes,  relayed facts from ancient Greece to \nWorld War Il.

In my teenaged brain, there \nwas no  link to the fact that my predecessors were no  different in anatomy to me,  had the same life concerns — \nmaking a crust, paying the bills and  raising children and  pursued their enjoyment and  passion wherever it laid. \nBut these incredible women’s stories that poured in from my advertisement struck a chord. \nThe importance of telling these stories now really hit home while caring for our  2% year old granddaughter, \nwho was  playing with two toy motorbikes, | said to her “Are they your motorbikes?” and she said matter of factly, \n“No Nanny, girls don’t have motorbikes!” \nHad \nsomeone \ntold \nher \nthis  \nor  \nwas \nit \nsimply \nthat \nshe  \nhad  \nonly \nobserved \nlittle \nboys \non  \ntheir \nPee \nWee \n50s  \nin \nrural \nSouth \nAustralia? \nIn \nthis \nsame \nweek \nmy \nbeloved \nfather \nhad \nturned \n80! \nMany \nof \nthe \nwomen \nfeatured \nin \nthe \nbook, \nowned \nand \nrelished \ntheir \nmotorcycles \nmany \nyears \nbefore \nmy \nfather \nwas \neven \nborn. \nThankfully \nfor  \nmy"

Although little is known about her  life, she  is \nconsidered one of the  earliest pioneering female motorcyclists in Australia and it is understood that she was \nthe first lady in South Australia to ride her own machine. \nMiss Queain grew up in Minlaton on  the Yorke Peninsula of South Australia, approximately 125  miles (202 km) \nto the west of Adelaide. In the early 1900s Minlaton was  considered remote from the capital city Adelaide, as \nhorse-powered vehicles were mainly of the four-legged variety. \nJane was a  well known teacher of music and art  and her  dedication saw her  driving her  pair of ponies \nin a  loop of approximately 150  km  over rocky, unsealed, challenging roads to  regularly reach her  students. \nFinding that she  lost  considerable time travelling these distances, in April of 1913 she  decided to  purchase a \nmotorcycle, a 234 (horsepower) Douglas. The fact that Miss Queain was  able to acquire her Douglas, considering \nshe \nresided \non \nthe \nother \nside \nof \nthe \nglobe \nfrom \nher \nacquisition, \nwas \nquite \nastounding \nas \nmotorcycles \nwith \ninternal \ncombustion \nengines \nwere \nonly \nmade \ncommercially \navailable \nin \nEurope \nin \nthe \nlate \n1880s \nand \nit \nwas \nat \na \ntime \nwhen \nproduct \nmarketing \nwas \nminimal \nand \nfreight \nservices \nwere \nslow. \nCapturing \nmore \nthan \njust \na \nmoment \nin \nhistory, \nthe \nonly \nknown \nphotograph \nof \nMiss \nQueain \nreflects \nthe \nstyle \nof \nthe \nera.  \nWearing \npants \nor  \neven \nskirts \nabove \nthe  \nankle \nwas \ncertainly \nnot  \nconsidered \nappropriate \nattire \nfor \na"

As for comfort, her Douglas motorcycle was in-itself \na challenge! With only a minimal bicycle-type seat, springer front end  and  no  rear  shocks it certainly would not \nhave been the most hospitable form of transport on  the  rough, unsealed roads of country South Australia. But \nJane loved it and  her first feelings of nervousness soon wore off! \n“Now | don’t seem to be able to travel fast enough” she declared. \n“I've had one  or  two  falls, but that’s all in the game. Once the skirt of my silk dustcoat became caught in the \nflywheel, and then | nearly went. | managed to pull up in time, however, and released it. On several occasions I’ve \nrun  over snakes, but they were only small ones. All the girls on  the Peninsula are in love with my Douglas, and | think \nthat very soon many others will get motor cycles. | save quite two-thirds of my time now, and not only is the machine \nquicker than ponies, but it is also more convenient.

Civilians volunteered their time and  services, akin to ‘The Home Guard’ \nin England. \nWomen in  most Australian capital cities formed voluntary motorcycle despatch units, which provided \nAustralia \nwith \na \n‘silent \nservice, \neven \nthough \nmedia \ninterest \nwas \nintense. \nWomen \nriders \nwere \nglamorised, \nand \nidolised \nin \nthe \nmedia, \nreflecting \nthe \ndesire \nof \nthe \nAustralian \nleaders \nto \nkeep \nup \nthe \nmorale \nof \nAustralian \nsociety."

Businessman Mr.  M.J. Doogan, attempted to \ninspire many organisations to form this  service. However, most were stretched at the time by the enormity of \nthe  requirement for war  time assistance. Many of the women were taught to ride by Doogan, but for business \nreasons he was  unable to continue the training after a few months. Due to the efforts of Miss Anne McLaughlan \nand Mrs  Margaret Golder, the Corps were able to continue. Realising the  importance of the  despatch service, \nMiss A. McLaughlan, a foundation member of the National Emergency Services ambulance drivers, volunteered \nher time and  skills, undertaking the task of recruiting, and  organising the training programme for the women. \nRecruiting advertisements in  newspapers were easily filled, with many women who were already keen \nmotorcyclists (some belonging to the Sydney Women’s Motorcycle club, see  Chapter 5), answering the call. \nRiding training took place at Centennial Park, Sydney, where women who did not own their own motorcycle \ntrained on a Royal Enfield 2 stroke and were versed in tight manoeuvres, mechanics, first aid and stretcher drills. \nAs reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on  13 August 1940 \n‘NEW WAR UNIT. \nItem \nof \nthe \nproposed \ntraining \nscheme \nfor \nthe  \nNational \nEmergency \nServices \nWomen’s \nMotor \nCycle \nMessenger \nCorps, \nof \nwhich \nthe \nfirst \nannual \ngeneral \nmeeting \ntook \nplace \nat  \n149 \nCastlereagh \nStreet \nlast \nnight. \nMotor \nCycle \nriding \nand \nmaintenance, \nfirst \naid, \nphysical \ntraining, \nsignalling, \nand \nsquad \nfield \ndrill \nwill \nalso \nbe \nincluded \nin \nthe \nprogramme. \nThe \norganisation \nhopes \nto \nprovide \ncommunication \nbetween \nwardens, \nambulances, \nhospitals, \nand \nsimilar \nbodies \nifa \ndisruption \nof \nnormal \ncommunications \noccurred. \nSeveral \nwomen \nmotor \ncyclists \nwere \namong \nthose \npresent. \nMiss \nEve \nWarnaby, \nof \nLiverpool \nhas \nbeen \na \nmotor \ncyclist \nfor \neight \nyears, \nand \ntravelled \nto \ntown \non  \nher \nmachine, \nreturning"

With only one hour's teaching before obtaining her  licence, she clocked 4000 miles within a \nyear on  her BSA, and even though June had four brothers and two  sisters, they never borrowed her motorcycle. \nJune was the  embodiment of the  determination of young women who graciously and eagerly filled the \nshoes of  the men who had  been sent to war. It was  a time of great realisation where women who had formerly \nsat  in the culturally-expected background rose to many occasions. \nAfter the war, June’s spirit of adventure guided her to advertise for a female motorcycle riding companion \nto tour and explore Victoria.

She  said, \n“they always bought more that way!” June was  the  ultimate sales-lady without compromising her integrity! \nSleeping under haystacks, in stables, and  a disused bake house shared with a  horse for company, the two \nwomen generally “roughed it”, but both regarded it as  “good fun” “One evening they could not find somewhere to \nsleep and decided to spend the night in an abandoned barn.

However, in  1948, women competing in events were \nstrictly restricted to  in-club reliability trials.

Her  parents laughed at the  idea and \nonly commented “later dear’ but  she was determined and \nwhen old  enough gained her  motorcycle licence and  also \nbought her  very first bike a  250cc BSA.

However, he still  concreted in the  contract that the  Royal Enfield Bullet 350  would only \nbecome hers upon final payment. Winifred had  secured finance from IAG  (Insurance Australia Group), but had \nto obtain permission from them to take the  Enfield out  of the state. \nSetting off at noon, 26 December (Boxing Day) 1950 from Perth, Winifred was  prepared.

Her first day’s journey \ntook her to Southern Cross, approximately 231  miles (372 kms) from Perth. An average 366  miles (589 kms) per \nday and 95 miles per gallon was her goal, a mean feat considering the 350cc Royal Enfield Bullet averaged a top \nspeed of approximately 70 miles (112.65 kms). \nAs the sun  rose on  the morning after reaching the edge of the Nullarbor Plain, so  began the most gruelling \npart \nof \nher \nadventure. \nShe \ncontinued \non, \nreaching \nthe \ntown \nof \nNorseman \nsafely \non \nthe \nevening \nof \n27 \nDecember \n1950.

As  a  young music student Peggy \nnever imagined that in just a few  short years, she would become a world first, leading the way for women to \nrace unrestricted capacity motorcycles and to compete in world class race events. \nAs a  10-year-old child, not  yet interested in motorcycles, Peggy did  however passionately desire to  ride a \npushbike. A neighbour had paused at the  front gate of her family home to chat with her  mother —  a child in \ntow, with pushbike. Whilst the  mothers were chatting and not  attending to  their daughters the  scene was \nset.  “Hence my hurried exit, having quietly organised a ride  with the child ‘owner’ of the pushy!” Peggy's mother \nscreaming, “Come back, you'll be killed!” Peggy pedalled away as  fast as  she  could. “Oh  what fun!” This was \nPeggy’s first taste of the exhilaration and freedom felt on  two  wheels. \nEarly photographs of Peggy’s father, who passed away when she was  nine, show him driving a sidecar outfit. \nHowever, motorcycling was  certainly not  part of her family life and  upbringing. Her only early experience was \nbeing given a ride  in a sidecar belonging to a friend’s father.

Despite this  serious setback, she  continued her  studies and helped \npay her  way by working as  a  commercial despatch rider, on  scooters and motorbikes. Five collisions in  six \nweeks, due to  a  scooter with no  brakes quelled her  enthusiasm for  poorly-maintained scooters but  did  not \nquell her enthusiasm for two wheels. \nThose early years dealing with Melbourne traffic, braking and cornering, the  wet slippery oil  laden inner \ncity streets and unmade outer suburban roads inadvertently taught Peggy fundamental skills. With nothing in \nmind other than using the cheapest form of transport to carry her to  her  position as  Choirmaster and church \norganist, Peggy's lifelong love affair with motorcycles was  about to begin. \nApproaching a local scooter shop in the  Elizabeth Street motorcycle hub of Melbourne she was  greeted by \na keen salesman advising that “girls ride scooters”. Realising that the salesman was prejudiced and that he hada \nvested interest in selling her a scooter, she moved onto a motorcycle dealership to be given the same response, \n“girls ride scooters.” In Peggy’s mind both dealerships had just done themselves out of a sale. Not to be defeated, \nand  now possessing simmering determination, Peggy marched out of the shop, up a side lane to Keith ‘Dutchy’ \nHolland's motorcycle repair shop, where again she was  told “girls ride scooters.” Peggy, now mentally prepared \nfor \nthis \nsame \nunqualified \nresponse \nasked \n“Why?” \nHis \nanswer \nwas \nsimple, \n“/ \nhave \nno \nidea \nreally!” \nThen \nPeggy \nasked, \n“So \nwhat’; \nsafer?” \nand \nhe \nsaid, \n“A \nmotorbike’. \nSo \nthat \nis \nwhat \nPeggy \nbought, \na \n350cc \nMatchless \nsingle \ncylinder motorcycle purchased for 55  pounds. \n“My \nfirst \nride \non \nit \nwas \nspectacular, \nopened \nthe \nthrottle \nand \ndropped \nthe \nclutch, \nin \nthe \ngravel, \nleaving \nthe \nroad \nand \nveering \noff \ninto \nthe \nscrub, \n| \ndid \nemerge \nthe \nvictor, \nhaving \nimmediately \ndiscovered \nthat \nwhen \nfeeling \nunstable \nthe \nbest \nthing \nto \ndo \nis \nto \nopen \nthe \nthrottle \nsome \nmore. \nIt \nwas \nprobably \nlucky \nthat \nthere \nwere \nenough \ngaps \nbetween \ntrees, \nand \nthat \nscrubby \nstuff \nwas \nnot \nthick, \nas \n| \ngot \ncontrol \nand \nreturned \nto \nthe \ndirt \nroad \nI'd \nstarted \non, \nhaving \ngravel \nblasted \nthe \nfriend \nwho \nhad \nelected \nto \nhelp \nme \nlearn \nto \nride. \nThis \nwas \n(later) \nmy \nhusband. \nWHAT \nFUN!!! \nAnd \n| \nwas \n‘hooked’” \nIt \nwas \nnot  \nlong \nbefore \nPeggy \nrealized \nthat \nmotorcycling \nwas \nnot \nonly \neconomical \nbut \nalso \nfun \nand \nshe \nwas \ngood at it."

She rode off road a lot, always on road tyres and without footing; mainly because she couldn't \nreach the ground and it hurt her back to try. \nUpgrading from Matchless and Ariel 350cc and 500cc, Peggy naturally progressed to a much larger machine, \na  750cc Norton Atlas, which famously carried her  on  a  solo adventure in  1964 from Melbourne, Victoria to \nMarlborough, Queensland and back. She rode the  Norton in  all  conditions taking the  challenge of riding \nthrough bulldust every day near her home and once getting trapped between rocks in the Grampians National \nPark in Victoria. \n“| loved riding anywhere, often took off with only the foggiest notion of where | was  going, seldom looked at a \nmap, typically got fuel at corner service stations, came in on  the highway entrance and left via the side road exit, \nwaking up 80 miles later | was out of fuel again and not on the highway. Slept in funny places, met interesting people.” \nMedia interest in Peggy’s adventures began early in her  riding career. In  1964, Peggy effortlessly rode her \nNorton Atlas 750cc, ‘a large one fora woman to handle’ as quoted in The Maryborough Chronicles, from Melbourne \nthroughout country NSW, having to detour from her planned route to Sydney to have a cracked cylinder repaired. \nThe  next morning, she moved on  from Sydney and arrived in Warwick Queensland (778.1 km) on  the same day. \n1 Putsch —  an  attempt to overthrow a government, a coup."

She was a natural at riding and road racing became \na natural extension \nof \nher experience \nto date. \nAs  motorcycle technology improved dramatically and machines that were considered ‘high-powered’ in \nthe 1960s were overtaken by more powerful motorcycles, the  racing world thrived. Not  so  for women! The \nperception then was  that a woman simply could not handle the weight and power of higher capacity machines. \nPeggy Hyde proved the world wrong! \nWhat Peggy didn’t know was that racing licences were issued to  women only to  enter bikes, not  to  race \nthem. Race licences were required for  both entrants and riders in the  1960s. When applying for  her  licence \nPeggy omitted to tick the two boxes that determined you to be either a race entrant or competitor (an entrant \nis the  owner of the  motorcycle. The competitor is the  rider of the  motorcycle. A competitor can  also be an \nentrant if the  motorcycle she  or  he  is riding is her/his own registered motorcycle). This went unnoticed by \nLicencing Authorities and an  unrestricted Victorian Open Competition Licence was granted. \nLate in  1966 when Peggy started racing there were no  women racing. Her  local club, Hartwell Motorcycle \nRoad Racing Club, was supportive; they had ridden with her on  the  road. It was crucial to her future access to \nthe track that this first race report be unbiased. The Club secretary, a woman (Ruth Love) knew that if the track \nofficials realised Peggy was a  woman, her first performance would be criticised unfairly, to  keep her  off the \ntrack. \nThe \nClub \norganising \nteam \nkept \nthe \nsecret \nand  \nassisted \nby \npublishing \nonly \nsurnames \nand  \ninitials \nof \nriders."

Linda was encouraged to be independent and, as  long as  her \nparents knew where she was  and who she was  with, she was  not forbidden to go anywhere. \nAs age is taking its toll  Linda has  downsized her  bike from the  250  to a  110  Honda ‘postie’ bike which she \nhas \nkitted \nout \nwith \na \nbig \ntank \nand \nis \nintending \nto \nuse \nfor \ntouring \nin \nAustralia \nwhen \nshe \nhas \ntime \nbetween \nperforming folk music and writing books. \nAll her books are  available on  Amazon in paperback or  Kindle format. \nPhotos supplied by Linda Bootherstone-Bick"

In the  years previous, Tina’s older brother was quite regularly visited by his friend, Russell \nMitchell who would roll  up  on  his  900  Ducati Darmah. “I think that may have sown the  seed a little without \nme  realising”. The scooter was soon traded for a Yamaha 400  and by that stage Tina and Russell had started \ndating. Tina mentions that one  of their regular friends had a kaleidoscope of bikes and  needed to sell  a few and \nshe  perused the collection. The little yellow 1974 250  Desmo popped up and seemed to say ‘you need to  buy \nme’ and it is a bike that Tina still  owns and  adores today. \nTina was 18  when her  love affair with Speedway began. In  1985, Russell, working in Wickham, Western \nAustralia, found out  that he  had a  mate in Mt  Newman, north west Western Australia, who had  just started \n‘swinging’ (a term used for a passenger) on  a speedway sidecar. Tina was on  holiday at the time in Melbourne, \nbut  Russell was keen to  see  their friend race. “This triggered his competitive nature (he used to race Motocross \nbut got too big) and said something to the effect “I reckon! can  build something better than their bike and kick their \narse” and away he went designing and constructing it. | thought it sounded pretty exciting too and not one  to want \nto miss out on anything, claimed the passenger job.” Tina  had  never been to the speedway and had  no  idea what \nher self-appointed position entailed. She  cut  short her Melbourne holiday to head home and  she and  Russell \nheaded off to the first meeting of the Claremont Speedway season to study the races and  bikes. Witnessing the \nspectacle made her all the  more excited about competing. There began Tina's illustrious career in Speedway \nSidecar racing, one  that spanned 27 years. \nSo \nwhat \ndoes \na  \npassenger \ndo?  \n“The \npassenger \nis \nthere \nto \nassist \nin \nthe \nhandling \nof \nthe \nbike. \nIn \ncorners, \nwe  \nare \ndown \ncentimetres \nfrom \nthe \nground \nbut \nwe \nwatch \nthe \nfront \nwheel \nto \nknow \nwhere \nwe \nshould \nplace \nour \nweight. \nWithout \na \npassenger \nthe \nsidecar \ndoes \nnot \nreally \nget \naround \ncorners \nwell \nso \nour \nbody \nposition \nis \ncrucial. \nThis \ncould \nbe \nmore \nforward \nor \nmore \nback \ntoward \nback \nwheel. \nKeeping \nthe \nbike \nbalanced \nis \nimportant \non \nthe \nstart \nline \ntoo. \nThey \nhave \na \nhabit \nof \ntipping \nover \ndue \nto \nthe \nlean. \nDown \nthe \nstraights, \nwe \nget \nour \nweight \nright \nback \nand \nover \nthe \nback \nseat \na \nlittle. \nThis \nis \nto \ntry \nto \nhelp \nget \nmaximum \ndrive. \nSometimes \nwe  \nknow \nwhere \nother \nriders \nare  \non  \nthe \ntrack \nand \ncan"

Mandy really hit her \nstraps and accomplished her first major win, taking out  the  South Australian Championship 125  GP  Series at \nMallala Motor Sport Park South Australia. \nA term quite often used in motorcycling especially when it comes to speed and handling is ‘he  rides like  a \ngirl. Well, Mandy Beales put this term to bed! \nEncountering a barrage of sexist attitudes on  the track hardened her heart and  made her more determined \nto succeed, but when overhearing a fellow racer say that she was just a “nice piece of arse” to follow around the \ntrack, she was  heartbroken. \nOn  many levels motorcycle racing is not for the faint of heart! \n“As soon as you hit the tarmac, it’s ‘bang’! And you can’t slow down and you can’t back off, you are just there to go \nas fast as you can  and develop the bike’s performance. You take a corner and your knee is on  the ground, and when \nyou hit the brakes you're screaming ‘shit’ in your helmet, ‘cos you  think you're not going to stop, but somehow you \nend up stopping and pulling it together. If you're not out of your seat thinking, ‘I’m not going to be able to stop; then \nyou're not going fast enough. The moment you cross the finish line, whether you're first or 20th, it’s like,  ‘wow, I’ve \ndone it’” (interview with Mandy Beales, The Advertiser Magazine,Adelaide April 2009)."

Kellie’s father was no  stranger to motorcycling, owning an  old  Harley-Davidson shovel head which \n“he spent far too much time and money customising with countless front ends, a myriad of paint schemes, and even \ngoing so far as fitting fuel injection and a power commander —  pioneering stuff in the early 1990s”. \nThankfully Kellie’s father, recognised the flame that resides within Kellie's spirit and this flame was not going \nto subside. Realising it was more than just a passing phase, he arrived home late  one night with a bright red \nSuzuki DES  80 tied to the  back of his truck. \n“| think it was  my first true love.” \nKellie would ride every chance she could get, spending hours and  hours riding around and around the small \narea her father had  fenced off in their yard which was only big enough that she  could just and briefly snick \nsecond gear. It was  this  bike that got her hooked on  the  smell of two-stroke and  it was  then that she  realised \nthe  intricacy and detail of riding and learned to  appreciate the  inner workings of a  motorcycle. “One which \ninfuriated my mother that | could love and care  for something so much while | had “a bedroom that looks like that!”” \nA couple of years later Kellie's dad  bought her a near-new Honda XR100, a more reliable bike. This meant he \nwas more willing to take her to places where she could practice clutch, throttle and brake control. Unbeknown \nto her at the time the time spent “just doing doughnuts” in her parent's yard, creating elaborate designs in the \ngravel, passing hours, trying to figure out how to keep the front wheel aloft, made Kellie an  accomplished rider. \nKellie was nine years old. \n“Other days I'd pretend | was  lining up for races, heart pounding, and letting my nine-year-old imagination stand \nme  on podiums with great applause until my brother appeared to tell me  it was  time for dinner.

He had called asking for her help, needing someone to drive the harvester for a couple of weeks. \nIn the  mid-summer’s searing heat, with no  hesitation Kellie packed up her Yamaha TRX 850  and rode the 600 \nkm  northwest to  meet him. Kellie’s dad owned an  impressive Cagiva Raptor 1000cc. He  needed help! Kellie's \nfather knew that she had the riding skill to deliver the earnings from the business to Moree (66 kms) to cash the \ncheque. “Take my bike if you like” he offered. She  loved the power of the Raptor's TL 1000 Suzuki donor engine. \nThe  only hiccup was being unfamiliar with the weight and  the  characteristics of an  upright naked bike. After \nmaking arrangements to  meet her  Dad at the  Croppa Creek Pub a  couple of hours later, Kellie set  off!  With \ntemperatures well above 40°C and the  pub ‘just down the road’, she  removed her jacket and  gloves and  tied \nthem to the  back seat. \n‘At a fair clip | hit  a pothole, which tore the bars out from my hands and spat me off the bike. Once | stop rag-dolling \ndown the God-knows-how-hot asphalt, my shredded body burning from being torn apart by hot, coarse bitumen."
