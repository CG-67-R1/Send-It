His  now famous beaming smile \nhas  been seen many times since the  first  day he raced as  a \nfour-year-old, particularly after a successful ride. \nBut there have been lots of tough times, setbacks, injuries, \npain and  frustration and  disappointments along the  way, as \nwith most people who become world champions. Out  of the \nconsiderable number of people with a lot  of ability in  any \nsphere of life, only a select few reach the peak of their sport \nfor reasons more related to  the  mind and psychology than \nphysical ability.

Don't let the  noise of others’ opinions \ndrown out your own inner voice. And most important, \nhave the  courage to  follow your heart and intuition.’ \nSTEVE JOBS \nooking back on  your own life  is a very strange thing, \nbe for someone pretty young like me.  And, to be \nhonest, it is something I’ve  resisted for a long time. Over the \nyears I’ve had lots of people ask me  to tell my story and I have \nnever wanted to; it seemed an  odd thing to do because I was \nso  young. It'also made me  feel uncomfortable, and perhaps \na little arrogant, presuming that people would want to know \nabout my life.  I like keeping my private life private. Recently, \nXi \n\nCAS By S POIs \nthough, \nmy \nthinking \nhas \nchanged, \nfor \na \nlot \nof \nreasons. \nAs \nI \nget \nolder \nI \ncan \nappreciate \nthat \nthe \nstories \nof \npeople \nwho \nhave \nput \nin \nthe  \nhard \nwork \nto  \nfollow \na  \ndream \ncan  \ninspire \nothers \nto  \ndo \nthe \nsame. \nThat \ncan’t \nbe a \nbad \nthing. \nI’ve stepped away from MotoGP racing and am  now \nexploring \nnew \nadventures \nand \nchallenges. \nMany \npeople \nthought I was  crazy when I retired at just twenty-seven. \nHowever, for me  and  my family, it has been a long trip with \nmany ups and downs. This is my chance to tell the story of how \nI achieved my dream of becoming World Champion, and to \npay respect to those who helped me  or, I should say, us.  People \nsometimes ask me  why I refer to  myself in the  plural sense \nwhen I’m  interviewed. It’s  because even though motorbike \nracing is often seen from the outside as  an individual sport, it is \nactually quite the opposite. No racer can be successful without \na good team around them. When I won the  MotoGP World \nChampionship with Ducati in 2007 and then with Honda in \n2011, I not only had the support of a top team but of an entire \nfactory. I haven’t been able to  do  any  of this  on  my  own, it \nhas been a team effort from the beginning, with my parents’ \nsupport helping us  to  chase our  dream. We wouldn't have \nbeen able  to reach this  goal had it not  been for the kindness \nshown by certain people, people who helped us  overcome the \nobstacles and contend with some of the unfriendly people we \nencountered along the way. This book is my  chance to say \nthank you and acknowledge the goodwill and encouragement \nthat got me  here. \n\nWriting \na \nbook \nis \ndefinitely \na \nnew  \nchallenge \nfor \nme.  \nI \ndon’t \nconsider \nmyself \nspecial; \nI \nam  \nsomeone \nwho \nknows \nhow \nto \nride  \na \nbike \nfast \nand \npush \nthe \nlimits \nof \nspeed. \nBecoming \ngood \nat \nanything \ntakes \nfocus, \npractice, \ndedication \nand \npersistence \nand  \nbecause \nI \nwas  \ndoing \nsomething \nI \nlove, \nit \nwas  \neasier \nto \nstick \nwith \nit \nand \ndevelop \nmy \nskills. \nHowever, \nthe \ndrive \nto \npick \nyourself \nback \nup \nwhen \nsomething \ngoes \nwrong, \nto \n‘get \nback \non \nthe \nbike’, \nis \njust \nas \nimportant \nas \nall \nthose \nhours \nlearning \nhow \nto \naccelerate \nout \nof \na \ncorner. \nA \ncombination \nof \nall \nthese \nthings, \nalong \nwith \nthe \nsupport \nI \nreceived, \nenabled \nme \nto \nbecome \nMotoGP \nWorld \nChampion \nand \nhas \ntaken \nme \nto \namazing \nplaces \nand \nallowed \nme \nto \nmeet \nsome \nastonishing \npeople \nand \ncreate \na \nlife \nI \nonly \ndreamed \nof. \nSome may say  I’ve been lucky, but  I believe you make \nyour own luck. It took an  incredible amount of effort to  get \nto  this  point, a lot of sacrifices and  support from my family \nin the early years and from my wife more recently. I want to \nacknowledge that support and  let people know that  if they \nhave a loved one, a child, a partner who is  eng big, they \ncan  go a long way with encouragement. \nFamily is hugely important to me  and recording the experi- \nences I had  in the  early years of my career for my daughter \nis another reason I thought the time was  right to put pen  to \npaper. I want to tell the real story, not some tabloid concoction. \nI am  not  going to  sugarcoat anything; I will tell it how it was \nand is. That is what we  do in my family —  it seems pointless to \ndo it any other way.

Behind me  the  world’s best motorcycle \nracers sit impatiently on  board the fastest two-wheeled machines - \never built. Taking a deep breath of that crisp ocean air, | close my \neyes and try to think of nothing at all. \nThe  grid is packed with dignitaries, celebrities and reporters. \nBut behind my sunnies my eyes are  firmly closed. There are  53,100 \npeople here to watch from trackside, millions more at home in front \nof their televisions. There is pressure but, thankfully, pressure is \nwhat I thrive on. \nIt’s  time. \nTurn one, Doohan Corner, at Phillip Island is fast and open. \n| feel my  way through where | can, finding my  line as  we  peel \n\nCASEY SS EONER \naround the  long right and then sit up  to brake into the  long left- \nhander at turn two. \nTurn three is a fast downhill left-hander, almost flat out in fifth \ngear, and it is probably my favourite corner in the world. It's what | \ncall a ‘balls out’ corner, the kind of corner that has always seemed \nto suit me. You  get a strong wind coming at you from the  inside \nand it makes you  want to lose the  front. Some people chicken out \nwhen the  bike gets light and most riders put weight on  the  front \nto carry as  much speed as  they can. The real key, though, is to get \nthe  rear sliding way before you even hit  the  apex. This takes all \nthe  guesswork out  of trusting the  front through that corner and \nnot knowing whether it will stick or not because of the  wind. You \nhave to take the  weight off the  front and turn with the  rear and \nthat’s when it really takes guts... \nTwenty-seven laps -  the perfect number —  | come out of \nturn twelve for  the  final time and see  the  chequered flag being \nprepared. | am  about to win  the 2012 Australian MotoGP, my home \nrace. | experience a familiar moment of relief and elation but  this \ntime that flag holds extra significance... \n\nCHAPTER “1 \nBORN TO RIDE \nWw they first noticed my ability and my love for bikes, \nmy parents talked about this crazy dream that one  day \nthey would watch me  stand on the podium as world champion. \nI was  only a toddler when they made a conscious decision to \ngive me  every opportunity to achieve that dream, even though \nothers thought it impossible. \nMy father, Colin, comes from Tamworth, now a major rural \ncity in  the  New England area of New South Wales, about \n420  kilometres north-west of Sydney. It has  always been an \nagricultural hub and farmers in the region produce everything \nfrom beef, sheep and poultry to dairy and grain. These days it \nis well known as an equestrian centre and perhaps best known \nas  the country music capital of Australia. \n\n| = \nCASEY STONER \nThe fortunes of most Australian country towns are  heavily \ninfluenced by the weather. The effects of drought and flood \ncan  remain for years. Back in the seventies, there was  always \nplenty of work to  be  had  in  and  around Tamworth for  a \nyoung bloke keen to  make his  way. After leaving school \nmy  dad  tried his  hand at  pretty much everything: from \nfarming and hunting to property maintenance and training \nhorses. It wasn’t out  of the  ordinary for  country blokes to \nbe interested in  cars and  bikes and  Dad was  no  different. \nHe  got  into riding bikes when he  was fourteen, buying \nhimself an  old  Suzuki 250  Hustler which he  fixed up  and \nrode around Tamworth. After a few years of that he started \ngoing to  Sydney and  Brisbane to  race a variety of bikes. It \nwas  all pretty basic, though, because he  didn’t have much \nmoney to  spare. He’d ride his bike to  a meeting, make any \nrepairs or  adjustments needed after travelling for hours on \nthe often not-too-smooth highway, tape up the lights so  that \nthe  glass didn’t break all over the  track if he  crashed and \nline up with his fellow competitors ready to have a go. Dad \nliked to race but never had the funds to take it too  seriously \nonce he moved to  the  Gold Coast, which is where he  met \nmy mum. \nMy mum, Bronwyn, had grown up  in  Southport on \nQueensland’s Gold Coast, part of a family who were heavily \ninvolved in  horses. She  was  a  real  country girl who grew \nup \nriding \nhorses \nfrom \nas \nsoon \nas \nshe \nwas \nable \nto \nsit \nup. \nNowadays \nwhen \nyou \nsay  \n‘the \nGold \nCoast’ \npeople \nthink \n\nof \ntheme \nparks \nand  \nbeaches \nbut  \nback \nin  \nthe  \nsixties \nand \nseventies, \naway \nfrom \nthe \ntourist \nstrip, \nit \nwas \nmore \ncountry \ntown \nthan \nglittering \ncity. \nA young couple just starting out, my parents made a great \nteam, doing whatever they could to  make a  living. They \nweren't city people so  they wanted to  save enough to  buy \ntheir own farm, eventually. Mum adapted quickly to  a farm \nworker’s nomadic way of life, and she and Dad would do stints \non different properties, working hard, and hunting foxes in the \nwinter for the skins. When farm work wasn’t so  easy to come \nby, they'd head back to the Gold Coast and contract as painters \nand decorators until they could once again move back to the \ncountry, where they felt more at home. \nThey got married in  1978 at Werris Creek, a  small town \nnear Tamworth, where they were living at the time. For the \nnext few years they followed the work, moving back and forth \nfrom the  country to the  coast, and their first child, my elder \nsister, Kelly, was  born in 1979 on  the Gold Coast. By the time \nI was born six  years later, on  16  October 1985, my  family \nwere again on  the  Gold Coast. I was  about ten  months old \nwhen we  went to stay at my grandparents’ property for a few \nmonths. While we  were living there I had my first experience \non  a  bike. Like so  many other country kids, Kelly had a \nYamaha 50cc PeeWee kids’ bike. There was  a creek flat just \nbelow my grandparents’ house and  my  dad would take me \nout  there on  the  front of the  PeeWee. Mum says  the  first \ntime I rode the  bike my  eyes were like saucers. Thinking I \n| on \nS LPN Uo tahini 6 SoN Ih Sie \n\n| a \nGASEY STONER \nwas  scared, she told Dad to  stop and took me  from the bike. \nApparently I made it clear I wasn’t happy about that, so  they \nput me  back on! Mum remembers how my eyes opened wide \nfor a second time. She  says, ‘I tried to take him  off the bike \nbut  he  hung onto the  handlebars. His  eyes were like  that \nbecause he absolutely loved it. After that we  couldn’t get him \noff a bike.’ \nAnyone who knows anything about kids knows how \nobsessive they can  become about things. It can  be Pokémon, \nLego, ponies or  Tonka trucks. My thing was motorbikes, or \nmore specifically that  50cc PeeWee. I was  only just walking \nbut I made it very clear that  I wanted to ride  that bike. Dad \nwas  really patient with both Kelly and  me  and we  rode for \nhours at a time, sometimes joined by my cousin Mark. Dad put \nin a lot of hours teaching us what to do, so  Kelly was  already \nracing bikes at junior meetings by the  time she  was  seven. \nShe became the Queensland Under 9 Motocross Champion, \nbeating all the  boys. Being the  younger brother, of course \nI wanted to  do what my big sister was  doing! Dad would sit \nme  at the  front of the bike and teach me  about the throttle. \nHe'd say,  ‘pull it on’  as  we  went up hills and  ‘let it off  as  we \nwent down. I learnt to  control the  delivery of power from a \nbike’s engine to the wheels at a very young age and by the time \nI was  eighteen months old  Id  already suffered the  first  of \nmany throttle blisters to come. \nWhen I was two  we  moved back to  the  Tamworth area, \nworking and living on  a family friend’s property in a  former \n\ngold-mining \nvillage \ncalled \nNiangala \nup  \non  \nthe  \nedge \nof \nthe \nNorthern \nTablelands. \nThe \nland \naround \nNiangala \nis \npicture \nperfect: \nrolling \ngreen \nhills \nand \nthick \nnative \nbush \nwith \ncrystal- \nclear \nrivers \nand \ncreeks \nwinding \nthrough \nthem. \nIt \nis \na \nplace \nof \nfour \ndefinite \nseasons \nand \nin \nwinter \nit \ncan \nget \nbitterly \ncold, \nenough \nto \nsnow. \nKelly \nand \nI \nthought \nit \nwas \ngreat \nwhen \nit \ndid, \nmainly \nbecause \nshe \ncouldn’t \nget \nto \nschool. \nWe  lived in  the  shearers’ quarters, a very basic building \nmade of corrugated iron. I didn’t care what it was made of, \nall I needed in life was  there. I used to love  helping my dad \non  the property -  or  at least I'd think I was  helping! I guess \nthere isn’t a lot of hard yakka a two-year-old could do but Dad \nwould still take me  out on  the tractor. If I wasn’t with Dad on \nhis bike or  the tractor I'd be tagging along behind him  as  he \nfixed fences or  checked the  cattle. When he wasn’t working \nwe'd go fishing for trout or muck around with Midge, our blue \ncattle dog, or  I'd hang out with Kelly. I really thrived growing \nup in that environment. \nMum says now: “He was  such a country kid. We went up to \nthe  Gold Coast to visit  family and it was  the first time Casey \nwas  aware of being anywhere but the country. We  drove past \na two-storey office block being built and he said, “Wow, that’s \na big shearing shed!” He loved living on  the property.’ \nBy the time I was  three years old my legs were finally long \nenough for one  foot to touch the ground when I was  sitting on \nthe  PeeWee, which meant Mum and  Dad finally let me  ride \nit on  my own. I started off just rolling it down to the bottom \nie \nSE Aa See ore Ed Sse felis \n\nCAS Ey eS T CIve \nof the hill near our place and pushing it back up again, rolling \ndown and pushing it back up. After almost wearing a track in \nthe hill, Dad decided I had mastered that enough for him to \nstart the  engine up,  but  not  before the video camera came \nback from the  repair shop so  that Mum could film my first \nride! That set me  back by a couple of weeks but I was  raring \nto go as  soon as  the camera was  fixed. \nOnce I started riding the  PeeWee nobody was  going to \nstop me.  Kelly had a Suzuki DS  80 by that time and she’d be \non  that while I rode the PeeWee. We'd ride round and round, \nhaving a ball being chased by Midge, until we  ran  out of fuel. \nThen we'd hassle Dad to fill the tanks up and we’d go round \nand round until they were empty again. Eventually it would \nget dark and we'd have to  go inside. It’s  hard for me  to  say \nwhether I would have chosen to ride  over swinging a cricket \nbat or  kicking a football but living on  a property meant most \nof the time it was  only Kelly and me;  it wasn’t like living in the \nsuburbs where you’d meet up with other kids to play a game of \nfooty or  cricket at the park. With my parents’ encouragement \nand nothing else on  offer to break my obsession, my love  for \nthe bike grew and grew. \nIt wasn’t long before I really got the  hang of riding, so \nI started to  look for ways to  mix  it up.  I loved riding after \nheavy rain  because I could spin my wheels in the  mud and \nget into these big fishtails, the back end of the bike weaving \nfrom side to side. What better way to amuse a young boy than \nby making dirt  and mud fly everywhere while making heaps \n\nof \nnoise? \nDad \neven \ntook \nthe  \nsilencer \noff \nthe \nbike \nbecause \nI \nliked \nthe \nsound. \nWhen \nthe \nground \ndried \nout  \nI’'d \nask \nMum \nor \nDad \nto \npour \na \nbucket \nof \nwater \ninto  \na \nhole \nto \nmake \na \nmuddy \npatch. \nI'd \nput \nthe \nbike \nthere \nand \nhold \nthe \nthrottle \nand \nthe \nfront \nbrake \non \nso \nthe \nrear \nwheel \nwould \nspin. \nTo \nme \nthis \nwas \nall \njust \npart \nof \nthe \nfun \nbut \nDad \nencouraged \nmy \nantics \nbecause \nhe \ncould \nsee \nthey \nwere \nteaching \nme \nhow \nto \nbe \nmore \nin \ncontrol. \nHe \nwas \ngiving \nme \nthe \nskills \nto \nstay \nsafe. \nHe \nwas \nalso \nstarting \nto \nsee \nsome \npotential \nin \nme \nthat \nhe \nwanted \nto \ndevelop, \nso \nhe \ntold \nme \nto \ntry \nto \nride \nwith \nmy \nfeet \non \nthe \npegs, \nwhich \nwas \nsomething \nhe \nknew \nthe \nfamous \nBelgian \nmotocross \nracer \nRoger \nDe \nCoster \ndid \nto \ngain \nmore \ncontrol. \nThe \nidea \nis \nthat \nif \nyou \nhave \nyour \nfeet \nup \nwhen \na \nmotorbike \nstarts \nsliding \naround \nthen \nyou \nhave \nto \ncounterbalance \nthe \nmovements \nof \nthe \nbike \nwith \nyour \nbody. \nDad \ncould \nsee \nthis \nwas \nan \nimportant \ntechnique. \nSure \nenough \nthese \nmovements \nsoon \nbecame \nautomatic \nto \nme, \ntoo, \nand \nI \nquickly \nlearnt \nhow \nto \ndo \na \n‘donut’, \nwhere \nyou \nopen \nup \nthe \nthrottle \nto \nspin \nthe \nrear \nwheel \nand \nturn \nthe \nbike \n360 \ndegrees. \nMy \nrecord \nwas \neight \ndonuts \nin \na \nrow \nin \nlong \ngrass, \nfeet \non \nthe \npegs. \nI \nwish \nI \ncould \ndo that \nnow! \nEven when I wasn’t riding, I'd be thinking about it. Things \nwould be ticking over in my mind and sometimes that’s where \nthe  practice was going on.  A day, a week or  maybe a  month \nafter being shown something, I'd  be playing around and \nsuddenly it would click into place, even though I wasn’t \nnecessarily working on  it. I think that happens with any form \n| co \nS LIAN IS Scans SNe SS Fike \n\nCASEY 2a heaiNie rR \nof practice and it certainly continued for me  right to the end — \nof my MotoGP career. \n‘What do you practise?’ Mum used to  ask Kelly and  me. \nThere was  only one  correct answer: “The right way.’ Mum \napplied this to everything we  did —  riding, chores, school work. \nIt rubbed off on  me  and  even now I don’t do anything with \nthe aim  of being mediocre. Whether I’m  going out  to swing \na golf club or  ski down a mountain I try to practise the  right \nway. There is no  such thing as  perfect but  my  approach to \nanything is a continual quest to improve. There is truth in the \nsaying, ‘Anything worth doing is worth doing well.’ My mum \ntaught me  that. \nIt’s funny, but watching my own daughter grow has opened \nmy eyes more than ever to the incredible extent of children’s \ncapacity to learn. People always say that kids learn quickly but \nin reality I don’t think that is totally right. They learn over time \nthrough a  constant and  repetitive process of trial and  error. \nNo matter how many times young children are  faced with the \nsame obstacle they just tackle it again and again and again, \nmaking minor adjustments until they overcome it.  Keeping \nthat childhood tenacity is hard but it’s worth trying to do so  if \nyou can; it can  bring huge rewards. \nAs  adults the  biggest obstacle we  face when learning \nnew skills is fear, and  never more so  than in a sport such as \nracing bikes. You can’t just keep trying and trying and making \nmistakes on a bike because mistakes can mean pain and injury. \nEventually the threat of pain begins to dictate your limits and \n\nonce it has a hold on you there is no  breaking through. There \ncomes a point at any level of motorbike racing where if a rider \nkeeps getting hurt it is psychologically very difficult for them \nto improve any further. \nThe easiest comparison for me  to  back up  this  theory is \nwith car  racing, which I am  now learning as  an  adult. There \nis still  an  element of danger, of course, but  the  fear of that \ndanger is limited because you  are  protected by the  stability \nof having four wheels on  the ground and a cage surrounding \nyou. As such, the skill of driving a car  at speed can  be taught \nto pretty much anybody over  time, assuming they can  afford \nit because it’s an expensive hobby! The best drivers will always \nrise to the top, and I’m not taking anything away from them, but \nit is a lot easier to arrive at a competent level. You can  try new \nthings in car  racing without being afraid of making mistakes \nwhich, in my opinion, is also one  of the reasons why the rider \nis far  more important to  the  package in  bike racing than \n‘the driver is in car racing (the exception to all this is Formula 1 \nmotor racing due to their high speeds and open cockpit). \nYoung kids are  programmed to try things without fear and \nby the  time I turned four years old  in  October 1989 I was \ndeveloping a broad range of skills on  a bike for a child my age. \nWhen Mum and  Dad decided to  move back to  Queensland, \nagain for work, I was finally able to  test  those skills against \nother kids besides Kelly. \nI don’t really recall much about leaving the  Niangala \nproperty that Christmas but  there was something about the \nS LAF, 2S SING AS aS \n\nCASEY cCalran Be \nplace that had  taken hold of me  and, as  we  left, I promised \nmy mum and dad I would come back one  day. The feeling of \nleaving somewhere special was  one  I was  going to have to get. \nused to, because even though I didn’t know it as we  started the \nlong drive up to Wongawallan in the  Gold Coast hinterland, \nwe  were covering the  first  few kilometres of a journey that \nwould not  end for another twenty-three years. \n\nGHArP TER 2 \nHITTING THE DIRT \nur  new home at Wongawallan was  on  the  main road \nCF the  Gold Coast to  Tamborine Mountain. We \nmoved in on  New Year’s Eve 1989, when I was  four years old \nand Kelly was  ten.  It was  very different from the property at \nNiangala —  the blocks of land were much smaller —  but it was \nstill rural enough to keep us happy. Most importantly for a still \nbike-obsessed child, there was some land around the  house \nwhich we  were able to use  as a little track, like the one  where \nI first rode a bike at my grandparents’ place. I’d spend hours \nriding, not  knowing I was  picking up techniques that  would \nprove useful later in  my career. To  keep things interesting, \nDad used to set up challenges for me,  like relays and obstacles \nto negotiate. The track was  surrounded by long grass so if you \n13 \n\nCASEY S77 GNeem \nwent off it you’d stall the bike. Dad remembers how he’d try \nto trick me:  ‘Casey was  so  quick I’d cheat by pushing him off \nhis bike into  the long grass so  that he’d stall the bike and fall \nover, then I'd hop on  his bike and try to steal it. One day when \nI was  making my getaway he launched himself over the front \nof me,  across the handlebars and hit the kill  switch. He  was \nfour years old, hanging on  for dear life! It was  all a big game \nbut it showed his quickness of mind; it was  all a blur to me.’ \nI was  definitely protective of my bike. I didn’t really have \nother toys or video games or  anything like that, I just wanted \nto ride my bike and I didn’t like anybody else touching it. Now \nwe  were back on  the Gold Coast I was  able to get involved in \nracing and so  it was  my turn to join the Mike Hatcher Junior \nMotorcycle Club at  Labrador, which was about a 35-minute \ndrive down the highway from our  place. Mike Hatcher’s was \na  dirt  track and  Kelly had  already raced there many times \nbefore. My first  race was  on  24  June 1990. Mum removed \nKelly’s name from an old leather racing jacket she’d outgrown \nand sewed on  a patch that said ‘Casey’. \nAt that very first race Mum started a diary to  record how \nI went and  she was  diligent at doing so  for every single dirt- \ntrack race I ever did.  In carefully drawn columns she charted \nthe date, circuit, bike, overall position, individual heat position \nand  comments. Those diaries are  really interesting to  read \nnow, making me  remember what those early days were like: \n\nMum's diary entry, 24/6/1990 \nSe LUN al Sa ela SNE eS: eet \n\nGAS Ys SO Near \nHatcher’s | Standard | PeeWee | L, 2nd to ‘Cried before \nClub Day practice but  had \ngood fun  for the \nrest of the  day \n& likes racing.’ \nMum tells me  that the other parents thought she and Dad \nwere awful because I cried as  I lined up  on  the  start line. \nShe  remembers: ‘I was  putting his  gloves on  his  hands and \npushing his helmet over his head. The thing was, I knew Casey \nwasn't crying because he didn’t want to ride or because he was \nscared. He just didn’t like the attention of being stared at by \nall those people!’ \nTam still like that to this day; I genuinely feel uncomfortable \nabout performing in  front of big crowds so  you  can  imagine \nhow I felt  back then. I had  learnt to  ride my  bike in  the \npeace and quiet of Niangala, alongside Kelly and my cousin. \nI’d  mucked around with some of Dad’s mates before this \nrace, but being on a start line, surrounded by other kids and \nwith a whole bunch of people watching, was  a very different \nexperience. As soon as  that gate dropped, though, I was  fine. \nI was  doing what I enjoyed the  most -  racing -  and I didn’t \ncare  what anybody thought once I was  moving. \nThat first race wasn’t about results, it was about learning \na new skill  on  the bike: learning how to  race. Over the next \nfew events I improved in  every race, eventually picking up \nfifth place in the last of three races. By August, I took my first \n\npodiums, \nwith \ntwo  \nwins \nand  \nthree \nsecond \nplaces \nout  \nof \nfive \nto \nfinish \nsecond \noverall \nin \nthe \n50cc \nPeeWee \nB-Grade \nclass. \nAround \nthis \ntime \nit \nturned \nout \nI \nwas  \nstruggling \nwith \nchronic \nasthma. \nI \nhad \nthe \nflu \nand \ndidn’t \nget \nbetter \nfor \nweeks, \nbut \nthere \nwas \nno \nway \nI \nwas \ngoing \nto \nstay \nin \nbed \nand \nstop \nracing. \nMum \nremembers \nit \nclearly: \n“He \nwas \na \nvery \nsick \nboy. \nOur \ndoctor \nwas \naway \nat \nthe \ntime \nand \nthe \nasthma \nwasn’t \npicked \nup \nby \nthe \nstand-in \ndoctor. \nWhen \nthe \npaediatrician \nsaw \nCasey \nhe \nhit \nthe \nroof \nabout \nthat. \nFor \nsome \nreason \nthere \nare \na \nlot \nof \nasthmatics \non \nthe \nGold \nCoast \nbut \nwe \nwere \ntold \nCasey \nwas \nthe \npaediatrician’s \nsecond-worst \ncase. \nYou \ncould \nactually \npull \nhis \nshirt \nup \nand \nsee \nhis \nintestines \nmoving, \nthat’s \nhow \nthin \nhe \ngot \nat \nthe \ntime. \nHe \ndidn’t \nput \non \nany \nweight \nfor \nthe \ntwelve \nmonths \nbetween \nthe \nages \nof \nfour \nand \nfive. \nHe \nhad \nglue \near \nfor \na \nwhile \nand \nlost \nsome \nof \nhis \nhearing. \nThey \ntested \nhim \nfor \ncystic \nfibrosis \nand \nhe \nwas \non \nall \nkinds \nof \nmedication; \nyou \nname \nit, \nhe \nwas \non \nit. \nBut \nCasey \nstill \nraced, \nwe \ncouldn't \nstop \nhim.’ \nI know I was sick but  Mum was right, I wasn’t going to \nlet that stop me.  In February 1991, at my seventh meeting, I \nmanaged to win  all five races in the B-Grade category, which \nmeant I had to move up to A-Grade and start all over again. \nEven though I was  still only five years old the class was  open to \nUnder 9s, so  I was  often beaten by the older kids at the club. \nI also started competing in the ‘modified class’, which was  still \nfor 50cc bikes and  Under 9s but having ten-inch wheels and \nan  automatic gearbox were pretty much the  only restrictions \nSLA Sate Sa AL SieS| \n\nCASE YS Tt Giver \nyou had to have. \nMy ‘modified’ was a  real weapon for  a  five-year-old, a \n60cc \nKawasaki \nthat \nDad \nhad \nde-stroked \nto \na \n50 \nby \nchanging \nthe \ncrank \nshaft \nto \none \nhe \nhad \nmade \nhimself. \nHe \npretty \nmuch \nhand-built the whole thing with bits  and pieces given to him \nby an old racing friend of his, Terry Paviell, who had competed \nwith some success over in Europe. That thing used to fly and \nthe ‘Kwaka’ was  my pride and joy. \nWhile we  were living at Wongawallan Dad bought himself \na road bike and he used to take me  out on  the back of it to go \ndown to the shops. In the end, though, he had to stop because \nI would be hanging off the side, trying to get my knee down \naround the  corners like  the  guys I’d  seen on  the  TV.  Dad \nwould have to reach behind and haul me  back on. \nThe bug had definitely bitten, so  we  started travelling \naround Queensland to race at different tracks such as  North \nBrisbane, Gladstone, Kilcoy, Trailblazers and Wheelstanders \njunior bike clubs, racing most weekends with up to fourteen \nraces at each event. Sometimes I’d win  them all, sometimes \nI wouldn't do as  well, but I was  constantly learning from my \nsuccesses and failures. \n\nike many families, me didn’t have a lot of money but we \nLe by. Kelly and I knew if we  wanted anything extrava- \ngant we'd have to save  for it and we were soon working out our \nown  ways to make some cash. Living on the tourist road up to \nTamborine Mountain gave us the perfect opportunity to make \nsome extra money. On weekends we'd set up a roadside stall, \nMum would have made us a bit of guava relish or  fruit jam \nso we  could sit out the front of our place with our  homemade \nsigns and sell it. \nWe  were racing at  Hatcher’s every month, then in  the \nwinter of 1991, Hatcher’s literally became my home track \nwhen Dad took up a voluntary position as the circuit caretaker \nand we  moved there, living in a pop-top holiday van  borrowed \nfrom my uncle until we  could afford something bigger. Dad \nparked it next to the clubhouse on  the outside of a bend they \ncalled “Canteen Comer’. \nBeing able to practise whenever I wanted wasn’t the only \nadvantage of living at Hatcher's, it also meant that even when I \nwasn't on the track riding myself I could watch and learn from \nthe other riders. I remember one  night there was  a speedway \nmeeting —  the first one  I'd ever seen —  and I was  blown away. \nWatching all these guys come flying around together, totally \nsideways with the  throttle on  the  stops, I thought, I like  the \nlook of this! \nDad remembers the  aftermath of that night very well. \n‘The morning after the  speedway we  were cleaning up and \nI put Casey out  there to  ride, like  I normally did, and  stood \n3 ONES Se Re uN Seed \n\nCASEY \"Ss TAaNes \nwatching as he came up through Canteen Corner for the first \ntime. As he came in he didn’t back off, just stuck his leg out \nand threw the bike in sideways. He looked way out of control. \nBut then he  came around and did  it again, and again and \nagain, better every lap. I'd been teaching him to ride feet up, \nwheels in line, which eventually he went back to, but purely \nthrough his own observation he now had this  extra string to \nhis bow.’ \nThere was  one  rider I was a real fan of, a dirt-tracker called \n‘Chook’ Cartwright, who would have been fifteen or  sixteen \nat the time. I used to stand pressed up to the wire  fence and \nwatch him ride a 250cc; he used to  get so  low  and  push the \nthing so hard, I thought it was fantastic. Then I’d go out and try \nto copy him.  He was a great talent but like a lot of good young \nriders I guess he didn’t have the  support to  take him  to  the \nnext stage. It does take a lot of time, money and effort if you \nwant to try to compete at a higher level and for many families \nit is too hard; there are  too  many sacrifices to go the distance. \nMy results at  Hatcher’s quickly went from podiums in \nthe A-Grade class and wins on  the ‘modified’ to wins in both \nclasses. In August 1991, shortly after we’d moved onto the \ncircuit, I took my  first clean sweep of ten  wins from ten \nraces; five in each class. For the A-Grade races we'd actually \nborrowed a  PeeWee from a friend. In  fact, some parents \noccasionally used to ask me  to ride their kid’s bike just to see \nwhat the  bike was  capable of.  Mum or  Dad would usually \nhave to call me in after a couple of laps though because these \n\nbikes \nweren't \nused \nto  \nbeing \nridden \nso  \nhard \nand  \nI \nsomehow \nmanaged \nto \nbreak \na \ncouple \nof \nengines. \nWe \nlearnt \nto \nbe \nmore \ncautious \nafter \nthat. \nAfter I started winning more times than not, and  it was \nobvious my  passion for bikes wasn’t wavering, Mum and \nDad decided that seeking out  sponsors could be a great idea \nto  help offset some of the  costs of travelling to  meets and \nkeeping the bikes in good order. We were fortunate enough to \nget the backing of a local Kawasaki dealer, Paul Feeney, who \nhappened to be a long-time friend of Mick Doohan. We  had \nstarted going into  Paul’s shop on  the Gold Coast to buy parts \nfor the ‘modified’ and he and Dad hit it off straight away. Paul \nhad a pair of Mick’s boots and leathers hanging on  the wall of \nhis shop so  I would love going in there just to get a close look \nat them. At the time that shop was  probably the coolest place \nin the world to me. \nPaul Feeney explains: ‘Colin kept telling me  I should come \nand see  his boy ride and I was  like, “Yeah, yeah.” I'd heard it \nall before, of course, but I liked Colin, he struck me  as a real \nstraight shooter, so  I went out  to  Hatcher's to  have a look. \nCasey was a tiny little thing, timid as,  but  a  really nice kid, \nalways smiling. That’s how I knew him, so  I wasn’t prepared \nfor what I saw that day. He took off and I was just gobsmacked. \nThe thing was  on  the stops, picture perfect, you couldn't get \nbetter. For someone that age, you just don’t see  that.  I tured \nto Colin and said, “You've got a bit of a talent here, mate,” and \nimmediately agreed to help them out.’ \n= LNA a Sree San OAS fi \n\nGASEY -ShoOne A \nPaul started giving us  bits and  pieces, so  you  could say \nhe was my  first official sponsor. Looking back, he was one \nof the most important ones because it’s hard to imagine that \nI would have had anywhere near the same level of success I \nhad in Australia without his help. Not only that, he is a top \nbloke, too. \nIn October 1991, just before my sixth birthday, I had the \nopportunity to see  two  of the masters in action at Hatcher's: \nAaron Slight and Scott Doohan. Aaron had won the Australian \nSuperbike Championship that year and  Scotty ran  second to \nhim, though he didn’t go on  to have the same success in road \nracing as  his famous elder brother, Mick, who was  watching \non  from the clubhouse that day. \nSlighty and Scotty were just playing around but when I was \nlet out  onto the  track I raced them like  I would have raced \nanybody else. I attacked wherever I could, finding lines up \nthe inside and around the outside that they struggled to take \nbecause they were on  bigger bikes. A few weeks after that \nScott invited me  to be a guest at a racing school he was  hosting \nfor  some Japanese tourists and journalists, who ended up \ninterviewing me  for their magazine. It was  the first interview \nI had ever done and Mum still has the clipping from the copy \nthey sent over to us.  In return Scott did us  a great favour by \ntyping up a letter of recommendation that we  could present \nto potential sponsors. \nIt read as  follows: \n\nTo  Whom it May Concern, \n| first saw Casey Stoner when a few  of the  local road race \nboys and myself decided to have a practice on  the dirt track \nat  the  Gold Coast. We  had been riding on  the  track for  a \ncouple of hours and the  boys thought they had this dirt \ntrack thing pretty well sorted out, then Casey turned up. He \nwas five years old and on  a KX 50 so  small that the guards \nwere almost sitting on  the  wheels. Casey then proceeded \nto show us  how to ride the dirt  track. \nAnyone braking too  early on  their 250s and 500s and \nhe went straight underneath them and anyone not back on \ntheir power early enough had a KX 50 all over them. Since \nthen | have seen Casey ride many times and have come to \nknow his  family well. \nWhen instructing at  the  Pole Position School we  had \nCasey demonstrating to  the  Japanese how to slide. The \nJapanese liked him so  much that the press members were \ntaking photos of him  and doing an  interview for Japanese \npublication. \nCasey is  a gutsy, aggressive little rider with a  huge \namount of potential and anyone getting behind Casey and \nhis  family would be doing Casey and their own company a \nbig favour. \nYours sincerely, \nScott Doohan \nS.LIANI) SHALL oN Ss Aad \n\nCASE Tes TONE se \niving at  Hatcher's definitely opened up opportunities I \nena not  have experienced otherwise. For  Christmas \n1991 I was  given the best present I could have ever wished \nfor, a  fundraiser organised at  Hatcher's, with Mick Doohan \nand  Daryl Beattie as  special guests, and  I was  invited to  go \nout  and  ride the  dirt  with them as  I had  done with Scott \nDoohan and  Aaron Slight a  few  months earlier. Daryl was \nan  ex-Australian flat-track champion and would soon make \nhis  name in  the  500cc World Championship while Mick, of \ncourse, was already a  multiple Grand Prix winner and had \nfinished second to  Wayne Rainey in  the  championship that \nseason. This was  the man Id spent countless hours watching \non  videotape and  I was  actually going to  ride  next to  him. I \nwas  beyond excited. \nPaul Feeney says  now: “They put on  a  display that  was \nprobably highly illegal ...  pitting the  club’s young star  up \nagainst the  soon-to-be World Champion in the  same race. \nCasey was  riding his little KX 50 and he just gave it to ’em. I \nmean, Mick and  Daryl were messing around a bit but Casey \nwas  hanging in there. In the end it got a bit serious because \nneither of them wanted to  get shown up by this  kid; he was \na bit better than he was  supposed to  be!  But  he didn’t care \nwho they were, he just wanted to beat them. That was  when \nI said to Colin, “Look mate, if you can  keep the whole package \n\ntogether \nthis  \nkid \nis \ngoing \nto \nmake \nit.  \nThere \nis \nno  \ngrey  \narea \nwhere \nhe’s going.” \nEvery \nnow \nand \nagain \na \nkid \ncomes \nalong \nbut \nhe \nwas \na \nlevel \nabove \nthat. \nOne \nin \na \nmillion.’ \nAfter watching countless videos of Mick doing battle at \noe all around the world it was  unbelievable for me  to be \nout there on the track with him. What we  didn’t know then was \nthat Mick’s career would almost end just a few months later \nwhen he crashed at Assen in the  Netherlands and the threat \nof having his leg amputated was  very  real. I was  devastated \nwhen it happened because he was  easily going to  win  the \nchampionship that  year and  suddenly it seemed his  career \nwas  over. The fact  that  he came back from that  injury even \nstronger and went on  to dominate the  sport for the next five \nyears was  a huge source of inspiration to me,  then and now. \nWatching people like Mick, Daryl and Kevin Magee helped \nfuel my passion for bikes. I enjoyed the racing but even more \nthan that I enjoyed the winning and  it didn’t hurt that  on  a \nrare  occasion Mum and Dad would give me  an  ice-cream on \nthe  way  home to  celebrate. Some of the  older kids offered \nme  incentives, betting me  a  Kit  Kat  or  a Freddo Frog that I \ncouldn’t win  by a certain margin. All these things pushed me \nto ride harder and faster every time. \nI couldn't ride my  bike all  day, though, as  much as  I \nwould have liked to.  I’d started at a local school, not  far up \nthe  road from the track, but  I hated it from the beginning. \nIt was like  being on  the  start line at that first race, only far \nworse. There were too  many people around for  my  liking \nSNL Ste SING eS iiet \n\nCASEY S'teNER \nand I didn’t settle well into the  strict routines of school life. \nI didn’t have much in common with most of the kids because \nall I wanted to  do was get. home and ride my bike. Once I \n-  was  home, I used to  stay out  and ride until it was  dark and \nI'd be called in for dinner. \nThough she  liked to  do other things, Kelly was still  into \nbikes so  we  used to  challenge each other, riding on  one  leg, \nside-saddle or  standing on  the  seat, constantly trying new \nthings purely for  our  own entertainment. It all helped me \nlearn. \nMy bikes weren’t always the fastest because they were all \nsecond-hand, but Dad did his best to get them firing. Quite \noften we  would turn up  to  a  meeting and  struggle for the \nfirst couple of races but once we  got the bike going properly \nI would usually win. This was  pretty much the  case when \nI won my  first  Australian Short Circuit title over two  days \nin the  modified class at  Shepparton, Victoria, in December \n1991. It was a  1500-kilometre drive to  get to  the  meeting, \nwhich shows you the commitment my family had to make to \nthe sport. \nAfter the win, Mum and Dad bought me  a cheap bottle of \nfizzy wine so  I could shake it up and spray it all over the bike \nthen pretend to  drink from the  empty bottle. Like any kid I \nloved it when I got praise from my parents so those moments \nof celebration made me  fight even harder to  be successful \nin my racing. Going out  to win  became the  only thing that \nmattered to me. Bikes were everything. \n\nMum’s diary entry, 1/12/1991 \nAustralian | Mod A | Kawasaki| 1,   2,  7, ‘Didn't like track \nShort to start with. \nCircuit Bike wasn’t set \nTitles - up  for the  track \nShepparton on  Saturday. \nSunday bike & \nCasey firing & \nwon both races. \nLast race very \nclose, hard & \nfast.’ \nIn early 1992, we were on the move again. We left Hatcher's \nand after a couple of months living with my grandparents at \nParadise Point on  the Gold Coast we  took some time out at a \nfriend’s place in the country and then moved to Coombabah, \na suburb not far from my grandparents. \nWith the  moves I didn’t race again until the  following \nAugust, almost nine months from that first Australian title \non  the  Kawasaki. But  that didn’t mean I wasn’t riding, and \nwhen I did race  I won  the Gold Coast Cup with four wins  out \nof four. We  then went back to Hatcher's for a club day and I \nmanaged to win all five races. I won all five again to retain the \nQueensland state dirt-track title  at Trailblazers in  Brisbane, \nthen retained the Australian Short Circuit title at Hatcher's a \nfew days later, even though I had some problems with my bike. \nDespite that break from racing at the  start of 1992, we’d \nwon twenty-one straight meetings in  the modified class \nS JANG) SSS SINS fled \n\nCASEY eS TONER \nbetween July 1991 and November 1992, including ninety-four \nwins out  of 110  races. I lost  my chain in the  final race of an \nevent at Wheelstanders club in Oxley, south-west of Brisbane, \nand ended up third. That broke my winning streak! \nWhen I turned seven in  October 1992 I was  finally old \nenough to  race geared 50cc and 60cc bikes. Two weeks \nlater at  Gunnedah, my  second race meeting on  geared \nbikes, I won the  Under 9s 60cc class and came second in the \n50cc class. \nIn October 1993 Mum, Dad, Kelly and I packed up again \nand  moved to  a place just south of the  state border called \nDeepwater, about 40  kilometres from Glen Innes on  the \nNorthern Tablelands. Mum and  Dad found accommodation \nand work on  a 1200-hectare property. Just like  I had done at \nNiangala and Wongawallan I made myself a racetrack, riding \naround and around while imagining big battles with my 500cc \nheroes. \nIn between race meetings I’d practise at  the  home track \nand I constantly tried to  get better, practising the  right \nway.  We  had  figured out  that  in  dirt-track most kids  were \nonly using the  rear brake to  slide into the  corners so  we \ntried to  gain an  advantage by using the  front. It wasn’t easy \nbecause, as  anybody who has  ridden a  motorbike will  know, \nif you  lock up  the  front wheel there is a very good chance \nyou will  crash. The  trick is learning to  find  the  point where \nit would lock for a split second, and then releasing it before it \nwould fold. \n\nDad got a thrill watching how I was  developing. He  tells \nof the time we  went to  a meeting in Canberra: ‘There was  a \nlong back straight. It was  an  oil track so  it was  a hard surface \nwith a big, long straight into  a hairpin, and Casey went into  it \nsliding the bike on  the front and the rear. He was  braking so \nhard that he turned the tyre on the rim.  It was  perfect practice \nfor when he started road racing.’ \nids’ sport can  get ugly sometimes. Left to just the kids  I \ndon’t think there would be as  many problems but when \nadults get involved things can  turn nasty. Sadly, that’s what \nhappened to  us.  Unfortunately all the  great results we  were \ngetting made me a target. The kids I was  competing with were \nfine  but  some of the parents started resenting our  success. \nThey would complain at  every opportunity, suggesting we \nwere cheating and  they'd stand at  the  track going through \nthe rule book to see  if there was  an  infringement of any sort \nthey could pin on me  or Dad. My bikes were often taken from \nme  at  the  end  of the  races to  be checked over. One of the \nrules was  that you  had  to be strong enough to pick up your \nown  bike and because I was  so  small a couple of times a few \nparents would insist that I was  stopped on  my way back into \nthe pits, and made to lay the bike down to show I could pick \nSick LUNIA MStiels So Ne Shares \n\nCASEY SS FONER \nit up. On one  occasion, after winning a Queensland title race, \nthe officials took the bike off me  to scrutinise it and I missed \nthe presentation as  a result. I wasn’t bothered about picking \nup the  trophy; all I cared about was  getting my bike  back. \nThey didn’t give it back for a week, which was  pretty tough \non a little kid! \nWatching me  being hassled and having my  abilities \nquestioned and  my results tainted, of course got Dad  riled \nup.  He is not  one  to sit back at the best  of times and people \ncalling us  cheats would never go unchallenged. He was  also \nconcerned about the level of safety at some of the  meetings \nand, again, he wasn’t going to  be  silent and let  something \nterrible happen. Sometimes he was  too  confrontational and \nmore vocal than others and things came to a head in Canberra \nat  the  Australian Championship finals in  1993, when Dad \ncomplained about the  rolling-start system. (Most other dirt- \ntracks had self-penalising gates, which are the best way to start \na race; the gate drops back towards the wheel so  if you try to \njump the start you get stuck and stall the bike. A rolling start \nis more dangerous and is usually only used by the seniors, as \nyoung kids can  get out of control and crash into each other off \nthe  start.) He  was also concerned there was no  flag marshal \non  some of the corners. \nDad remembers what happened that  day:  “Casey was \nalright, he was  winning the meeting. But I wasn’t happy with \na few safety issues so  I went to speak to the officials and was \ntold to piss off.  If somebody tells  me  to piss off I don’t take \n\nit too well. I told them they were a pack of idiots or perhaps \nsomething a little more explicit than that. It was  a  typical \nthing, I was  just standing up for the kids but  I used to  get a \nrush of blood to the  head back then and  go off pretty hard. \nThey banned me  for six months. I appealed it and they gave \nme  twelve!’ \nBy coincidence, Dad also lost his  driver’s licence for \nspeeding at  around the  same time he was  banned from my \nrace meetings, so  Mum had to  drive us  to  every one, there \nand back, work on  the bike, the whole lot. It was  tough for her \nand  she  didn’t get much help from the  other parents at the \nmeetings. Sometimes we  could push the bike right up against \nthe fence so Dad, who would wait for us outside the pits, could \nstick his hands through the wire and work on  it. Other times \nwe  were completely on  our  own; just me,  Kelly and Mum. We \ncertainly found out who our  real friends were during this time. \nOn some weekends off from racing we went to motorcycling \ngymkhana events organised for country kids  not  far away in \nGlen Innes. There would be obstacles set  out  like  a row  of \npoles that you had to  weave in  and out  of, before turning \naround the  end one  and  coming back through as  fast  as  you \ncould. There was  one  called ‘Cat and Mouse’, where two riders \nwould start  off at opposite points on a circle and one  would \nhave to catch the other. Another event was  slow riding, where \nthey'd put a  couple of pieces of string out  and  the  person \nwho took the  longest time to  get from point A to  point B \nwould win. \nSo WON Liles FARE, SOI Sa fie eat \n\nCASIEY STONER \nIt was  a competition but it wasn’t highly competitive; it was \njust for fun, really. Of course, I didn’t see  it that way, though, \nand  I had  dirt  and  stones flying everywhere. I don’t think \nanyone expected the park to be shredded like it was. When I \nwas  on  my bike, if I wasn’t competing to  my maximum level \nthen I wasn’t having as  much fun. \nenjoyed racing so much that even when I was  at home riding \nL my own  I would set up different track configurations to \nchallenge myself. I’d find a rock here, a tree  there, a gatepost \nover there and  maybe move a branch and  that would be \nmy  track. It’s  something I still do to  this day, either with a \nmotocross bike or a dirt buggy. By this time  I had also started \nwatching the 500cc World Championship races on  television. \nLike most Australian kids into bikes, I’d ask  Mum and Dad \nto record the races because they were on  really late  at night, \nthen I'd  get up  in  the  morning and  watch them over and \nover. If I wasn’t on  my bike I was  pushing one  of those old \nvideotapes into  the  machine. Other kids get the  same way \nabout footy; they can  tell you  every player in their fsoumte \nteam and what happened in any particular game. I was  exactly \nthe  same about bikes. You could ask  me  about any  race, \nwho passed whom in what corner or  who won at  Mugello in \n\n1988 \nand \nwhy \nit \nwas \nso  \ninteresting, \nand \nI \ncould \ntell \nyou. \n?'d \nwatch \nthe \nchampions \nagain \nand \nagain \nthen \nI'd \ngo out \nto \nmy \nlittle \nhomemade \ntrack \nand \nre-create \nthe \nraces \non \nmy \nbike, \npretending \nI \nwas \nswapping \npositions \nwith \nMick \nDoohan, \nWayne \nRainey \nand \nKevin \nSchwantz. \nThey \nwere \nall \nmy \nheroes \nbut \nMick \nwas \neasily \nmy \nfavourite, \neven \nbefore \nhe \nstarted \nwinning. \nThere \nwere \nother \nAussies, \nsuch \nas \nWayne \nGardner \nand \nKevin \nMagee, \nbut \nit \nwas \nalways \nMick \nI \ncheered \nfor \nthe \nmost; \nthere \nwas \nsomething \nabout \nhis \ndetermination \nand \nhis \nnever-give-up \nattitude. \nEven though I was  still  very much in the  early stages of \nmy racing career I knew it was  what I wanted to do and Mum \nand  Dad were going to  back me  all the way. They'd already \nstarted planning our  route to  Grand Prix  and we’d discussed \nthe possibility of moving to Europe, where the age restrictions \nwere lower, so  that I could transfer from dirt-track to  road \nracing as  soon as  possible. It was  already clear that  I needed \nsome stiffer competition and  after racing a couple of times \ndown in  New South Wales, which had  been much tougher \nthan in  Queensland, we  decided that was  where we  needed \nto be. \nThere have been a  few  successful racers from the  Gold \nCoast, such as  Chris Vermeulen, Ant West and, of course, \nMick Doohan, but generally speaking the  majority of recent \nAustralian talent seems to have come from the Hunter Valley \nin New South Wales, particularly the areas around Kurri Kurri \nand Maitland, which are  mining towns. I’m not  sure why this \nS28 WNIT Ste INS) (led \n\nCASEY STONER \nis but I think it’s fair to say these places are  tougher to grow up \nin than the Gold Coast and the area’s tradition for hard racing \nseems to  have encouraged some real talent, including the \nlikes of Broc Parkes, Josh Brookes, Jamie and Daniel Stauffer \nand Chad Reed. Even Troy Bayliss and the Cudlin brothers, \nDamian and Alex, are  from Taree, not  too  far away from the \nHunter Valley region. \nAll of those guys, apart from Alex Cudlin, were older than \nme,  but there was  plenty of talent coming through in my age \ngroup, too: kids such as Hayden McBride, Jason Doyle, Daine \nStevens and  Brad Hellyer, who beat me  in my first  meeting \nafter we  moved to Deepwater. \nBrad’s father, Lyle Hellyer, recounts what happened at the \nfirst  race: ‘'d never seen Casey before but one  of my mates \nhad  told  me  about him. He’d said, “Hey, your boy is going \nto be racing Casey Stoner this year.” People thought he was \ngoing to come and clean up.  The  first time they raced was  at \nRaymond Terrace, but  Colin had  been barred from the  pits \nso  here’s poor Bronny changing the jetting and  all sorts of \nstuff. I can  still  see  Colin up  against the  fence telling her \nwhat to  do with Casey’s bikes. That was  the  only time Brad \nbeat  Casey seven out  of seven. We  had Jamie Stauffer’s old \ntwo-stroke 60cc bikes and they were rockets. I think that got \nthe Stoners thinking, because they'd not been racing anyone \nfast up in Queensland.’ \n\n\\ ’ Je’d wanted stiffer competition and we  got it in New \nSouth Wales; my  results proved that. But the  fact \nthat I didn’t have Dad to work on  the bikes took its toll.  Mum \ncouldn't match his  knowledge. In  the  early part of 1994 I \nhad a few wins  on  the 60cc but other than that the highlights \nwere a third place in my first  club meeting on  an  80cc bike \nup at Tamworth, and a single win on  the 80cc in the B-Grade \nat Hatcher’s. The year ended at the Australian Short Circuit \nChampionship in Albury on  the New South Wales-Victorian \nborder in  November, where I took the  50cc title but  didn’t \neven make the podium in the 60cc and 80cc classes. This was \ndisappointing but  also  taught me a lot. Mainly that  I didn’t \nwant to lose! \nThe  solution was  already in  the  pipeline. It had  been \nplanned for a while but just over a week after that meeting at \nAlbury we  were packing our  bags ready to move house again, \nthis  time another 500  kilometres further south to  Maitland, \nin the  heart of the  Hunter Valley. I was  looking forward to \nsome regular practice on  the circuits down there, ready to do \nwhatever was  necessary to get my racing up another gear, and \nfacing other up-and-coming riders regularly on  demanding \ntracks was  just what I needed. \nEven though things had become difficult with  Dad being \nbanned from the pits there was  never any question that I would \nSHIN 1 Se SIN A SS aie \n\nstop racing, and my parents continued to give their full support \nto me  and also to Kelly, who was  now cycling at a competitive \nlevel herself. It was  a juggle but they tried hard not to let either \nof us  down. Once he got his licence back, twice a week Dad \nwould meet Kelly after school and  drive her  from Maitland \nto  Sydney for her training. It would be past midnight when \nthey got back but  Dad  would still  be up for work early the \nnext morning. On a weekend there might be a cycling event \nin Sydney so  Dad and  Kelly would head off again and  Mum \nwould drive me  to a dirt-track meeting. \nMum and  Dad encouraged both Kelly and  me  to  follow \nour  passions and work hard to chase our  dreams. That might \nsound strange when you are talking about a seven-year-old but \nI don’t think you  are  ever too young to know that if you want \nsomething you have to oa it. \nThere was  one  saying Dad used to quote that I think sums \nup my family’s attitude to life:  “Aim for the stars and if you hit. \nthe moon youre doing pretty well.’ It’s true, you'll never know \nhow far you can  get if you don’t have a go! \n\nCHAPTER 83 \nSAWYERS GULLY \nSCHOOL FOR \nMOTORCYCLE RACERS \nwas  nine years old and already a great part of my life and \nhe family’s life was  focused on  racing. Once we’d moved \nto  Maitland we  practised whenever and wherever we  could, \nmainly on the dirt track and speedway over at Kurri Kurri and \nRaymond Terrace or  on  the  oil track at West Maitland. Oil \ntracks were basically compressed clay sprayed with second- \nhand oil and  steamrolled so  many times over  the years that \nthe surface was  black and hard, like bitumen. It was  slippery, \neven in the dry, but in the rain it was  like ice.  You  also had to \nrun  regulation tyres on  the  oil, which weren't as  aggressive \n37 \n\nGA SEY Ss LONER \nas  the knobblies we  ran  on a dirt track, so  the surface stayed \nmore consistent and you  could get into  long slides without \nhitting bumps and berms, which made them much more fun \nto ride. \nI had  been more used to  the  dry dust and  dirt  up  at \nHatcher's, which was  made up mainly of decomposed granite \nthat constantly needed wetting down. It was difficult to \nmaintain the track between races and it would slowly dry out \nduring the day, making it really slippery. You could go out and \ndo three races on  a dry surface and then they'd come out and \nwater the track before the next one,  turning it pretty much into \nclay. As it dried again you’d end up with completely different \nsurfaces around different parts of the  track, depending on \nwhere the  sun  was  shining on  it and where it was  shaded. I \nwould also  be riding different motorbikes in each race so  I \nlearnt to be totally adaptable; I had to ride to the conditions \nand the bike undemeath me. | \nLooking back, I think this is one  of the main reasons why \nAustralians with a background in dirt-track gain reputations \nas  ‘wet weather riders’ in  Europe; guys like  Ant  West and \nChris Vermeulen (both fellow Queenslanders) come to mind. \nWhenever the  track conditions are  inconsistent you'll see \nAnt  suddenly hit the front, while Chris got his only MotoGP \nwin in the wet  at Le Mans and he scored podiums in unusual \ncircumstances, like in the extreme heat at Laguna Seca or  at \nPhillip Island when we  had to change tyres midway through \nthe race. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, neither of them \n\nwere as successful on a consistent basis in ‘normal’ conditions. \nBroc Parkes was an  absolute legend on  the  dirt and, once \nagain, fantastic in the rain.  Tracks like  Hatcher's and similar \ndidn’t let you practise on  a consistent surface. \nMum and Dad used to stand at the side  for hours on  end \nwatching me  practise at  different tracks. They'd sometimes \nclock laps with a stopwatch as  I went round and round. Other \nparents couldn't see  the point in taking it so seriously but they \ndidn’t realise it was  what I wanted. I was  having fun. Working \nout how I could go faster was  how I got my kicks and I couldn't \nstop until I had taken a tenth or  two  of a second off my best \ntime on  any day. If another kid came out  onto the track with \nme  I would be  all  over them, practising passing them in \ndifferent ways and in different comers, but most of the time \nthey avoided riding with me  and I would be out there on  my \nown, racing the clock. \nDad tells of one  particular day at  the  West Maitland \njunior dirt-track that  really sticks in his  memory. “We  were \nmessing about with the  bike, setting it up  differently and \ntrying different tyre pressures like  you  would on  a practice \nday at a Grand Prix. The best lap Casey had ever done there \nwas  about 20.4 seconds or  something similar. This day he \nmanaged to get his time down to a 20.1 so  I promised him an \nice-cream on  the way home if he could crack the  20-second \nbarrier before we  left.  He came past five or  six times shaking \nhis head, he knew he hadn’t done it and he was  right, he was \nstuck on  20.01. I was amazed he could be SO sure of his  lap \nSEWN. ate oN Site \n\nCASEY - STONER \ntime because he didn’t have a timer on his bike. Then he came \naround on the next lap, crossed the line and nodded his head. I \nlooked down at my stopwatch and, sure  enough: 19.98. I could \nnever understand, and J still can’t, how he could measure the \ndifference to that degree around a little track like that. It was \ndirty, slippery, the bike was  moving around, there were a lot \nof factors. And to  split a couple of thousandths of a second? \nThat’s almost unimaginable.’ \nWhen you're riding a track you  get a  feel  for where the \nspeed is coming from and where you  are losing time. There \nmight be one  corner where you  are  losing a slight bit of grip \nand it’s not  coming together right, so  you work at it and work \nat it until it happens. As  soon as  it does you  know you  have \nfound that extra fraction of a  second you  were looking for. \nIt’s  all down to a rider having a  feeling for the  bike and  the \nconnection it has with the ground. Eventually you  get to the \npoint where you  can  find this  feeling within just a couple of \nlaps. Once you understand where your speed is coming from \nyou can  quickly work out where it is lacking and where you can \nimprove. So I would work on  that area  and keep working on it \nbecause I knew I couldn’t be faster anywhere else. There is no \nsuch thing as perfection but I would concentrate on improving \nmy weaker points, rather than my strong points. \nLater on  as  a MotoGP rider I didn’t even bother looking \nat my lap times because I knew that if the bike was  right the \nlap time would come, so  in the free practice sessions, my first \npriority was  always to work on the bike. Once I felt that I could \n\nget \nit \nto  \nbrake \nwhere \nI \nwanted \nit \nto  \nbrake, \nturn \nin \nwhere \nI \nwanted \nit \nto \nturn \nin \nand \nget \nthe \ndrive \nout  \nof \nthe \ncorner \nthat \nI \nneeded \nthen \nI \nknew \nthe \nlap \ntime \nwould \nbe \nfast.  \nFrom \nthere \nI \ncould \nmake \nsmall \nimprovements \nby \nintroducing \nlittle \nchanges \nto \nmy \nriding \ndepending \non \nthe \nconditions. \nOf \ncourse, \nit \ndidn’t \nalways \nwork \nout \nas \nplanned \nand \nwe \ncouldn't \nalways \nget \nthe \nbike \nas \nwe'd \nhave \nliked, \nbut \nthat’s \nracing. \nI usually performed my best at major meetings. In 1995 the \nNSW Long Track Titles were held at West Maitland, where \nmy hours of practice on  that track paid off and I managed to \nwin fourteen out of fifteen races and take the overall victory in \neach of the three categories I entered: Under 13 years 50cc, \nUnder 9 years 60cc  and Under 9 years 80cc. \nThe wins started to come more regularly after that; between \nApril and  November 1995 I won more than 200  races (heats \nand  finals included) to  take fifty-three overall category wins \nout of the sixty-five I entered, including four Australian Long \nTrack Titles at North Brisbane and three Australian Dirt Track \nTitles at Victor Harbor in South Australia. \nMum’s diary entry, 28-29/10/95 \nAustralian 50Occ Open | 1, 1, 1, 1,1,  1,1 Rode very \nDirt Track well \nChampionship) gace ages =a, 1a 4.1. 5: \n—  Victor 9-10 22 \nHarbor \n80cc age Lyte \n9-10 \nS WN ie steel SIN Eh SS: Gael \n\nCASEY <StoONER \nWe were doing so many miles in the van  going to races that \nwe  got used to it breaking down. A few times we  had to sleep \nin it on  the  side of the  road; Dad on  the  front seat, me  and \nKelly on the rear  seat and Mum lying on our tent and blankets \nacross my three bikes, in the back. It never was  a great sleep \nfor any of us. \naitland was  very different from the  Gold Coast and a \nM world away from Niangala. Most people in Maitland \nwere great but a few of the local kids were quite messed up, \nwith parents who maybe drank too much, and left them to do \nwhat they wanted. These kids formed pretty scary gangs at \nprimary school. I was  small and skinny so  I was  an  easy target \nfor them and they'd give me  a hard time. School became even \nless appealing to me  because I was  being picked on. \nThe bullying didn’t stop once I walked out  the  school \ngate. Sometimes they would chase me  all the way  home. I \nremember there was a bridge over a river that offered my only \nescape because I could climb underneath it and squeeze into \na narrow gap  on  top of some pipes, out  of their sight. They \nwere too  big to follow me  so  they'd be walking around above \nme,  waiting for me  to come out, but I was  pretty determined \nand I'd hang in there until they were gone. \n\nLuckily I had two  friends from dirt-track, Sam and  Zach, \nwho were twice my size  and the sons of a member of a local \nmotorbike club called the  Gladiators. The  club pretty much \nowned a whole street so  I used to  go round to  their house \nquite a  bit  and  hang out.  I remember we  formed our  own \nclub, called the  Kiddiators, and  I was  vice-president for  a \ntime. We were only kids  messing around but  Sam and Zach \nwere monsters at school, bigger than anyone else, and when it \nbecame known I was  friends with them the bullying stopped. \nI kind of had  ‘protection’. School life was  a whole lot better \nafter that but I still hated it. All my real friends were from dirt- \ntrack; they were the  only people I had  anything in common \nwith. \nThere wasn’t much free time at  the  races, not  for  me \nanyway, because I was  usually riding in three or four different \ncategories so  I only got a  few  short breaks. When I wasn’t \non  the bike my friends and  I used to hang out  and come up \nwith different things to  do.  After every meeting we'd find  a \nbig enough space and play “Tackle Bull Rush’. Basically you'd \nhave to try to run  from one  end of a field to the other without \ngetting tackled by the  couple of people trying to block your \nway. If you were tackled you became a defender as  well and \nhad  to try to  stop others. The winner was  the last person to \nmake it ‘home’ without being tackled. \nAll the kids at races got on pretty well most of the time  and \nprobably would have got along even  better if it wasn’t for one \nor another of the parents falling out and then telling their kids \nSL LYN a) espe SIN Ss fat et \n\nCASEY STONER \nwho they could and couldn’t play with. Some of the kids didn’t \nrace fairly, but they were few and far between. \nWhile we  were living in  Maitland I became good friends \nwith two  guys in particular, Brad Hellyer and Jason Doyle, \nespecially after one  of the  NSW Long Track Title races held \nin my dad’s home town of Tamworth. One of the locals went \ncrazy into  the corner off the start  and caused mayhem, there \nwere bikes and bodies everywhere. The impact tore ligaments \nin my shoulder (which would go on to cause me problems later \nin my career). I was  carried off to hospital along with four or \nfive other guys, including Brad, who had broken his ankle, and \nJason, who'd wrecked his back. \nThe next week I got an  invitation to Brad’s birthday party \nand his  dad, Lyle, will tell  you I was already determined I \nwas  going to  be  a  champion. Mum and  Dad made sure I \nwas \neating \nthe \nright \nthings. \n‘I \nremember \nwe \ngave \nout \nmeat \npies \nfor \nthe \nkids \nto \neat \nbut \nCasey \nsaid, \n“I’m \nnot \nallowed \nto \nhave \nthese.” \nI \ntold \nhim, \n“You’re \nat \nmy \nhouse \nnow, \nso \nyou \ncan \nhave \nsome \nice-cream \nas \nwell.” \nIt \nwasn’t \nto \nspite \nhim \nor \nhis \nparents, \nit’s \njust \nthat’s \nwhat \nkids \nare \nsupposed \nto \neat \nat \nbirthday parties!’ \nWe \nweren't \nused \nto \neating \nany \njunk \nfood. \nFor \nme  \nand \nKelly \nice-creams \nand \ncake \nwere \ntreats, \nnot \neveryday \nfood. \nThat's \nwhat \nour \nparents \nhad \ntaught \nus \nand \nthey \nwere \npretty \nstrict \nabout \nit. \nIt \nwas \ningrained \nin \nboth \nof \nus, \nespecially \nsince \nKelly \nwas  \nan  \nelite \nathlete \non  \nthe  \nstate \ncycling \nteam \nand \nwith \nthe \nAustralian Institute of Sport (AIS). \n\nBrad and  I liked the  same things and  that  was  definitely \nthe start of a strong friendship between us.  We  used to have \nfun mucking around at the local speedway or riding our  BMX \nbikes to  a  local radio-control car  track. When I eventually \nmade it into  Grand Prix he would often come down to Phillip \nIsland, sneak himself into the  paddock without a  pass and \ncome and  find  me  in my garage and  remind me  of the  one \ntime he beat me  seven out of seven back at Raymond Terrace. \nUnfortunately, as  the  years went by, it became more and \nmore difficult for us  to  stay in touch but it was  always good \nto  see  him  and he never once tried to take advantage of our \nfriendship, which I always appreciated. \nven  at the junior level things can  get quite heated during \nE a race. Because I was  starting to win a lot, people looked \nat me  differently. It wasn’t unusual for other riders to try to \nfind  unfair ways to  beat me.  Some guys would just be loose \nand  out  of control but  others would deliberately try to  stick \nme  in a tyre wall. The  classic overtaking manoeuvre in dirt- \ntrack is to go around the outside, get into some looser dirt that \nhas  a bit more grip and carry that extra speed. Very rarely, if \never, did I go up the inside. So sometimes when I went to go \naround guys they’d see  me  coming and try to squeeze me  out \nS LVN SSL GOIN eis feed \n\nGASEY “STONER \nto the tyre wall. I’m pretty sure  that in most cases it was  their \nparents who'd told  them what to  do but you  always had  to \nbe careful. I knew who I could trust and who I couldn’t and \nlearnt to  suss  out  a rider's body language. You’d get to know \nwhen they meant it. \nTwo  of the guys I never had a problem with were Hayden \nMcBride and  Daine Stevens. Hayden was  becoming one  of \nthe  toughest competitors I would ever  face  throughout my \ncareer, and  though Daine was  even smaller than me he was \nfearless, we  often used to  go side by side, locked together \nfor a whole lap. While I always felt I had the edge on  Daine, \nHayden was a totally different story. \nHayden might have had  really quick bikes but we  never \nunderestimated how good he was  either. Although we  didn’t \nhave the cash the  McBrides had, Dad was  a good mechanic \nso  it’s fair to say that  sometimes we  had the faster bike, but \nthe  racing was  still  always close. Normally Hayden’s bike \nwas  better set up from the start, so he could come out of the \ngate fast. We'd have to  spend a  couple of races sorting our \nbike  out  and then get going. At times my bike would break, \nso we'd have to borrow somebody else’s for a couple of races \nto  keep me  in the  hunt, then I'd get mine back and it’d be \ngame on  again. \nThis happened one  year at the nationals in North Brisbane \non \nthe \n80cc, \nwhen \nHayden \nwon \nthe \nfirst \nthree \nraces \nout \nof \na \ntotal  of seven, meaning I had to win  the last four to win  the \ntitle. \nHe’d \ncome \nout \nfull \nof \nconfidence \nbut \nI’d \nchase \nhim \ndown \n\nand just get quicker and quicker until the momentum turned \nagainst him in those national finals. I thrived on  the pressure \nand in the decisive final race I bolted from the gate and took \nthe title. \nDad recalls how this scenario played out a fair bit between \nthe two of us.  ‘It was  always nerve-racking when Casey lost the \nfirst three. I'd play around with the bikes and  say,  “I’ve done \nthis, ’ve  done that, what do you reckon? You  reckon you can \ndo it?”  And Casey would just say,  “Yeah, we'll be right.” I'd \nsay,  “Are you  sure?” and  he’d go,  “Yeah, no  worries.” It was \nincredible: every time, four in a row. Hayden’s father couldn't \nbelieve it because they thought they had Casey. It must have \ndriven them mad.’ \nI liked Hayden, he  was a  really nice guy. Eventually \nhe gave up racing bikes and went to  go-karts instead, which \nI always thought was  a  great shame. I heard he went on  to \nbecome an  Australian go-kart champion. I always believed \nthat Hayden would be fast at whatever he did. Under the right \n\"circumstances there is nothing he could have achieved that \nwould have surprised me. \nWhenever we  had a  break for  a  couple of months, like \nover  Christmas, I would be dying to get back racing and I’d \ncome flying out of the blocks. Dad called it giving me  ‘spells’, \nwhich is a term they use  in horse training, and now and again \nhe  used to  do it deliberately so  I wouldn’t get bored with \nracing, although it was also a good way to  ease the  financial \nstrain of keeping me  racing so  often. The start of 1996 was  a \nSLA eA Lee A Sed \n\nCASEY SOONER \nclassic example of that and we  won the ACT championship \nafter already taking the  NSW Small Track Titles at  West \nMaitland. \nMum’s diary entry, 9-70/3/96 \nAustralian | 50cc Open Rode well on  all \nCapital bikes, well within \nTerritory limits. \nState \nTitles - \nCanberra \n60cc age Chain came off and \n10-11 DNF, locked back wheel in \nfifth race. \no  make more money, Mum and Dad opened a lunch \nale. in  Maitland. This was  great for me  as  my school \nlunches improved heaps. Between my races, Kelly’s interests, \ntrying to earn money and looking after a family there wasn’t \na lot of time for much more. But  Mum and  Dad wouldn’t \nlet  that stop them and  always tried to  squeeze something \nelse  in if they could despite all that. After his  bust-up and \nsuspension down in Canberra things had settled down and \nDad decided if he wanted to change things in junior racing \nhe’d have to get involved in the decision-making. He became \n\nchairman of the junior commission at Motorcycling Australia, \nwhich didn’t pay any money but at least he could have a say \non  safety issues. ‘It was  a lot of work and I constantly had to \ndeal with people accusing me  of making decisions to favour \nCasey. I didn’t make a  single decision based on  favouring \nhim, I didn’t have to!  The only thing I did  was try to  get \nthe  minimum age  for  road racing lowered, but  I had a  lot \nof support for that from various people. I had  to  deal with \na  lot  of political nonsense. I remember we  had  this  series \nover three different clubs so  we  made all  these trophies, \nto  try to  save money. We  sanded them, lacquered them, \nsanded them and  lacquered them again. They weren't bad \nlittle trophies for the kids and they cost next to nothing, but \nwe'd bought the lacquer and the timber and stuff ourselves \nso  we  put in a bill for eighty dollars and they refused to pay \nit.  Motorcycling New South Wales were going to take Lyle \nHellyer to  court because he’d signed an  invoice on  behalf \nof the  NSW dirt-track committee and  they said  he  “didn’t \nhave the  authority”. Over an  eighty-dollar invoice! This is \nwhy motorcycling is so  backward in  Australia, the  people \nwho are  supposed to be organising it are  so petty that it stops \nanything moving forward.’ \nThere is no way Dad’s involvement in the committee helped \nme  win  races. It had  no  effect on  my  results whatsoever. \nWe  managed to win  pretty much every title we  went in  for \nthat season and after taking four Australian Dirt  Track Titles \n(Under 13  50cc, 60cc, 80cc and 80cc four-stroke) up  at \nSrl NE oe Seale SIN h a Sr ied \n\nGASEY\" ST NER \nHatcher’s without too  much difficulty, other than the heat, I \nthen had to produce some of the best racing of my career to \ncomplete a matching set  in the Australian Long Track finals \nat West Maitland. I won every race  on  the 50cc and took four \nout  of seven on  the 60cc even though I had to borrow a bike \nbecause mine blew up in practice. \nMy only problem was  with the  80cc. I was  getting bad \nstarts because the gearing wasn’t set up right and even though \nI could get the jump off the line  I would get passed quickly \nbecause my bike didn’t have the  drive to  get grip. In  dirt- - \ntrack, there are  only four lap races on  small tracks. In the first \nfinal I came from fourth last out of sixteen riders off the line \nto finish second, and in the second final I came from second \nlast up to third by the end of lap one. A lap or two  later I got \nthe lead and bolted. The  exact same thing happened in the \nthird final and even though I wasn’t able to progress further \nthan second place I took the  title comfortably because the \ntwo  other winners were different so  I had  the  best results \noverall. \nThe  only disappointing thing about that weekend was  the \n‘Dash for Cash’, which they sometimes ran  as  a bonus race at \nthe end of a weekend. Everybody puts twenty bucks in and the \nwinner takes it all. A whisper went round that I had signed up \nfor the 80cc race  so  everybody else went in the 60cc race  and \nI lined up against about six guys for only $120; the big money \nwas  in the other race! Whatever the prize, I guess I liked the \npressure —  especially in the Australian Championship. I could \n\nbe beaten in  state finals but  once we  got to  the  nationals I \nbarely lost a race. \nI mightn’t have been riding the  shiniest, newest bike but \nMum and  Dad tried to  make up  for that. Mum says: ‘We \nwould often turn up to race meetings, especially big ones like \nstate titles and Aussie titles, towing our  beaten-up little box \ntrailer with three bikes in it and  chairs hanging off the  side, \ntyres stacked wherever they could fit. Casey didn’t have new \nbikes, he never had new bikes, but we  would give them a little \nrefurbish before an Australian title, maybe he’d get a new lens \nin his goggles as well, and he used to love turning up like that \nand then going out  there and beating them. He  really got a \nkick out  of that.’ \nThe  other thing that really fired me  up was  the other kids \nsledging around the  paddock. It was  typical kids’ stuff. If I \nhadn’t raced somebody for six  months they would say  they \nwere going to  kick my  arse. Most of the  time I would try \nenough just to  win  but  if something like  that  happened I'd \nride  as  hard as  I possibly could to break them. At the risk of \nsounding too  cocky, I was  so  used to winning that sometimes \nit would take something like that to motivate me  and I’d ride \ntwice as  hard. \nAfter I turned eleven we  had another three-month ‘spell’ \nover the  Christmas of 1996, then I came out  strong in early \n1997, winning 103  out  of 104  heats and finals contested \nbetween the  start of February and  the  end  of April. I was \nconfident and most of the time riding well. \nSAN Sak SNe S Fira \n\nGENSEY -S TONER \nIn 1997 I managed to win  fifteen state titles in short-track, \nlong-track and dirt-track in New South Wales and Queensland \nas well as  four national dirt-track titles in Canberra before we \nheaded to  the long-track nationals at  Somersby on  the  New \nSouth Wales central coast to  attempt something that had \nnever been done before: five  national titles in  five  different \nclasses (Under 13 years 50cc, age 11—-Under 13 years 60cc, age \n11—Under 13 years 80ce, Under 16 years 80cc Big Wheel and \nUnder 16 years 80cc four-stroke). You had to be twelve to ride \nthe big wheel so because I was  born in October there was just \none  event that year when I qualified to do all five. It was  my \nchance. There were seven races in each class, some judged on \noverall results and some split into four heats and three-finals. \nMum’s diary entry, 8-9/11/97 \nTrack Class Placings | Overall Comments \nAustralian SOcGUIS | T, tal,  lei, 1 Rode brilliantly on \nLong Track el all bikes.

It still ranks as  one  of our  best \nachievements because it had never been done before and has \nnever been done since. \nLike all  my  races, Mum remembers it well: ‘I think, \nincluding practice, Casey rode forty-two times. Because the \nraces were only a couple of minutes long we  had  to take up \nthis  whole U section in the  pits. Colin would have the  next \nbike ready to go so  Casey could come in, I could grab the bike \nhe had just ridden from underneath him  and  he’d jump on \nthe other and head straight back to the start line for the next \nrace. This went on  for two  days! He was  actually asked to ride \nas  a passenger in the  sidecar that  won that day, too,  but we \ndecided against it.  Despite all that, on  our  way home Casey \nwanted us to pull over so he could ride in the bush. That’s how \nmuch he loved riding.’ \nI was always like this. As  soon as  we  got back from a race \nmeeting I'd pull the bikes off the trailer and ride them around \nthe yard. I was  supposed to be putting them away but  I just \nwanted to ride. Even though I had ridden a lot  of races that \nweekend, as  a  kid  you recover quickly so  by the  time we \nfinished our  trip home I was  ready to  get back on  the  bike \nand start riding again. \nSAE UN Det etree SNE pest elt \n\nCSASEY ca TteNea se \n’ Te were a long way from the country, or at least we  felt \nlike we  were, but we  still always liked having animals \naround us.  Sadly our  dog Midge had died  up at Deepwater, \nwhen she  caught the  disease Parvovirus. We  had  other pets \nover the years and in 1998 I had a couple of ferrets, Fez  and \nZef.  I used to take them to the old speedway and send them \ndown rabbit-holes trying to  chase out  rabbits, but  Fez was \nuseless. He  liked to  make himself comfortable down there \nand fall asleep so  I'd have to dig him out. \nI was  definitely enjoying my racing, but school was  proving \nto be a different matter, especially now that I had  moved to \nhigh school. My friends had gone to a different school which \nstuffed me  because I no  longer had  Sam and Zach watching \nmy back. I don’t have good memories of my first day there. I \ndidn’t know a single person. \nWe  were living at  a place called Sawyers Gully, several \nkilometres from Kurri Kurri near Maitland. Things at high \nschool weren't improving and I was  getting increasingly tense \nand sick. Mum and Dad took me  to  our  doctor, who said it \nwas an  absolutely genuine illness, so  they decided to  home- \nschool me.  The education inspector came around a couple of \ntimes a year to check my progress. The first time he came he \nasked me what I'd like to be and I told him: “Motorbike World \nChampion!’ Since I didn’t have any plans to be a brain surgeon, \n\nhe said to focus on  the basic stuff like reading, writing, maths, \ntechnology and science. Mum will tell you she couldn’t believe \nthe  change once I was  working one-on-one with her. ‘He \nimproved so  much and his  confidence soared, without the \npressure of being bullied every day.’ Dad agrees: ‘Casey was \nmuch happier with Bronwyn teaching him. We used to call it \nthe “Sawyers Gully School for Motorcycle Racers”. I was  the \nprincipal and Bronwyn was  the teacher! I helped with science \nand technology. Among other things, we'd strip down Casey's \nrace bikes and  I would teach him about the  mechanics. He \nlearnt quickly and was  very competent at rebuilding his bikes \nby the age of thirteen.’ \nDad continues: ‘Some days Bronwyn and  Casey would \ncome to work with  me  painting. Casey would rub  down and \npaint some of the  woodwork for  me  and  I paid him like  I \nwould pay anyone else, except the money went into his racing. \nIt was  a  team effort and  I believe that by Casey earning \nsome of the money, it gave him more motivation to succeed. \nNothing was  handed to him  on a platter.’ \nI don’t remember seeing any of the money I earned because \nit all went back into my racing, although I guess at the  time \nthat’s all I really cared about anyway. I didn’t know anything \nelse. Mum and Dad always said to me:  ‘If you put in the effort, \nwe ll put in the effort.’ It was  kind of a mantra and they were \ntrue  to their word, to the point that they couldn’t really say no \nbecause I was  always putting in the effort. Dad  couldn’t say, \n‘Tm sorry, we  can’t go there this  weekend,’ because we  had \nSAINI SAL SIN LEAS fia \n\nCASEY ST GONE FR \na deal.  I have carried this attitude throughout my career and I \nexpect everybody around me always to try their hardest because \nthat is what I do.  If I give my best then my  support team \nhas to as well, and I never give less than one  hundred per cent. \nWe never seemed to be out of work, but things were pretty \ntight while we  were living in  Sawyers Gully. Kelly had  left \nschool by then and was  working as  a journalist at  the  local \npaper, so  she  was living her  own life. My dad had started \nbudgeting more and  more money out  of the  family income, \nsaving up for the day that we would eventually move to Europe \nand chase the Grand Prix dream. Dad’s theory was  that if the \nmoney was  in the bank he would only end up spending it, so \nhe started withdrawing cash as  he earned it and burying it in \njars in the yard, where he knew he would not  touch it unless \nhe was  really desperate. You  have to think pretty hard about \nwhether you  really want money for  something before you \ndig it up. \nSaving money became something of an  addiction for him, \nalmost like gambling. The more he saved, the more he wanted _ \nto  save because he  could see  the  chips building up  on  the \ntable. If there was  a weekend when I wasn’t racing he’d work \nthose two  days and the money would go straight into a jar. Asa \nfamily we  were living on a very tight budget because we  were \nconcentrating entirely on  Saving. \nIn July 1998 I won  three titles at the Australian Long Track \nChampionship at Albury and  three more at  the  Australian \nDirt Track Championship in November, bringing my total to \n\nthirty-five \nnational \nand \nfifty \nstate \ntitles. \nWe  \nmanaged \nto \nkeep \nour  \nform \nthrough \nto \nthe  \nstart \nof \n1999, \nwinning \nan  \ninter-club \nmeeting \nat \nthe \nCentral \nCoast, \nmy \nfirst \non \na \n125, \nwith \nfour \nwins \nout \nof \nfive \nraces. \nThough \nI \nwas \nstill \nvery \nsmall \nthe \nbigger \nbike \nseemed \nto \nsuit \nme, \nso \nnow \nI \nwas just \nriding \nthe \n80cc \nand \nthe \n125cc. \nI \nwas \nonly \nentering \na \ncouple \nof \nclasses \nat \neach \nmeeting \nso \nwe \ncould \nfocus \nour \nefforts \nmore. \nSince we  had  achieved everything we  set  out  to  achieve \nin  dirt-track we  knew it was  time for  me  to  take the  next \nstep and switch my attention from the dirt to the tarmac. We \nbought a  Moriwaki MH80 road race bike from somebody \nat  the  Australian Junior Road Racing Association with the \nintention of entering the  Moriwaki 80cc series that summer, \nbut  because I was  still  only thirteen it was  difficult to  find \nanywhere to  practise. In  Australia it wasn’t actually legal \nfor any circuit to let me  ride  until I turned fourteen but we \nmanaged to find a guy at a go-kart track who was  willing to let \nus  do some laps. \nAfter that we  also managed to  get out  at  Morgan Park, \nWarwick, with Dad’s mate Terry Paviell, who had  agreed to \nhelp teach me  the  basics on  bitumen. Road racing required \ndifferent techniques to sliding around on the dirt and “Pav was \nvery generous with his time. A few years before he’d given me \na pair of Mick Doohan’s gloves and boots, which I wore on that \nfirst practice day with Pav on  the  Moriwaki. \nTerry is very modest about his  input: “The Stoners used \nto come along to local Queensland road race meetings I was \nSe LVN SOREL SN FS fie \n\nCASEY STONER \ncompeting in and Casey was  always studying everything very \nclosely. I recall him at around seven years of age,  sitting atop \na large fence-post by the track at Lakeside for hours. He was \nlearning more than anyone could imagine back then. As  I \nrecall the most verbal instruction I gave Casey was  on  body \nposition and weight distribution, but rather than teaching him \nnew  skills I merely translated information he already applied \nin his riding from the dirt  to  suit  the bitumen, which he did \nwith ease. It was  as  if he had been pre-programmed to be a \nroad racer, he was  extremely quick right from the get-go. He \nhad such a rapid rate of learning it was difficult to  structure \n_a program to  keep pace, but  I knew he didn’t need to  be \nlectured in a classroom situation with a whiteboard.’ \nThe  main thing Pav taught me  was  that you can  only ride \nwhat you can  see, which was something that stuck with me \nthroughout my career. I remember a couple of his favourite \nphrases: ‘If you’re not sliding you're not riding,’ and ‘If you're \non the grass you're on your arse!’ I found out the hard way that \nthe second phrase was  true but I actually enjoyed my first crash \non the Moriwaki. I lost the front and hit the deck. There were \nsparks flying everywhere, all this crunching, scraping and noise \naround me.  As it was  only a light front crash I got up with no \ninjuries but gained some experience. In later years they would \nbecome increasingly painful but that first small crash wasn’t bad. \nI hardly ever used to crash in dirt-track, maybe only once or \ntwice a year, so  this  was a relatively new  thing that  I would \nhave to get used to once I started riding road bikes. After that \n\nfirst ride, Pav told my dad I was  already riding above the level \nof the bike and that  he would borrow an  old  Honda RS125 \nfor us  to try. \nMum wasn’t there the first day I rode the Honda but Dad \nremembers it well: “That day the 125cc had very old slick tyres, \nit was  Casey’s first  time on  slicks. He  came around a tricky \ncorner and slid off. I went out and picked him up, dusted him \noff and  he got back on the  bike. Next lap, he came around \neven faster and  mastered the  corner. He  didn’t crash there \nagain.’ \nThe transition from dirt  to  road racing took none of my \nenthusiasm away; I just wanted to  get better and better. \nBut I was about to  hit  a  pretty big roadblock. Finally, in \nOctober 1999, I turned fourteen and we  were able to put in \nmy application for a road racing licence. The  application had \nto be signed by the Australian Junior Road Racing Association \n(AJRRA), which was  essentially a club made up of the parents \nof older kids  I had been racing my whole life. They knew me \nand knew I was  capable of riding a road bike, but they started \ncoming up with excuses for not processing the  application. \nThey'd say they hadn't had enough time, or not answer phone \ncalls, things like  that. We  could only assume it was  because \nthey didn’t want me  racing their kids  again and  it became \nreally frustrating, to the point that in the end my dad spoke to \na mate down in Wollongong who was  involved in Motocross. \nHe  had  all the  credentials needed to  sign my licence so  we \ndecided to do it that way. \nSL PWN ee SUN ES ed \n\nCASEY -S7; ONER \nEven though I now had my licence I still needed one  more \npiece of paperwork before I could actually race: I had to join \nthe  club. It was  a  stupid rule and, of course, there was  only \none  club, the  AJRRA, who clearly weren’t too  happy about \nus  taking up  road racing. It didn’t help that Dad had  had \ndisagreements with a few of their members from his days as \nchairman of the junior commission. We had no  alternative so \nwe  applied to join, sending off our  application with a cheque \nfor the joining fee of $50. \nWhile we  waited for an  official response to my application \nfrom the club it seemed to me  they were stitching us  up any \nway  they could. They did things like  organise a practice day \nthen they'd cancel it without telling us, but they'd ring around \nall the  other parents and  let them know. On  one  occasion \nwe  drove all the  way  from Maitland to  Sydney for practice \nand there was  nobody there. We just found other places and \ncontinued to  practise whenever and  wherever we  could, at \ndifferent go-kart tracks and on  private land. \nTerry recalls: ‘I just rode as  fast as  I could and Casey would \ntag on.  It was  so  much fun charging around, leaning on  each \nother \nand \nlaughing \nas \nwe \nwatched \nthe \nfront \nwheels \npattering \nat high speed. After a few sessions on  the  MH80 and RS125 \nI \ncould \nsee \nCasey \ngetting \nquicker \nand \nsmarter \nwith \neach \nlap. \nTran \nout \nof \ntricks \nto \nshow \nhim \nand \nsoon \nstruggled \nto \nkeep \nup \nwith \nthe \nlittle \nbugger. \nHis \npersonal \ncharacteristics \nwere \nalso \nextremely \nstrong \nand \napparent; \nhe \nwas \na \nhardened \nracer \nwho \nonly \ngave \nyou \nthe \nopportunity \nto \nlean \non \nhim \nonce. \nA \ntouch-up \n\nwas  a great motivator for Casey, whatever I dished up on-track \nto him would come back on  me  like a ton  of bricks before the \ncompletion of the  next lap. He just wanted to be the  fastest \nguy  on  the  track and  out  in  front. I was  always extremely \nconfident he had  more than enough motivation and  riding \nability to  succeed at the top level and  I also  had  confidence \nin  Colin and Bronwyn; dad a  great tuner and mum a great \nmotivator and  supporter. Together they were a  formidable \nteam.’ \nFinally, after a  few  months, we  got a  response from the \nAJRRA committee. It was  a letter addressed to Dad and signed \nby the  secretary of the club. Basically the three lines told  us \nthe application had been tabled at a committee meeting and \nmy application to join the AJRRA had been denied. \nThere was no  explanation, no  apology, no  nothing; just \nthe letter, the cheque and the photo (we still have all three). \nEffectively I had been banned from racing in  my  own \ncountry at  the  age  of fourteen for  absolutely no  reason. I \nwas devastated. I didn’t care about the  politics, whatever \nthey were. I just wanted to  race motorbikes and  I couldn't \nunderstand why I wasn’t being allowed to do that when I had \nthe  ability. Riding bikes was  all I had  ever done. It was  all I \nwanted to do.  I couldn’t understand it; it made no  sense. All \nwe  could put it down to was  jealousy and spite. Even if they \nhad issues with my dad, why take it out  on  a kid? \nWe'd been talking about moving to Europe in a couple of \nyears to  chase the  dream, but  only after a year or  two road \nSel SSA SN tes atc \n\nCASEY STONER \nracing in Australia first. Obviously that was  no  longer going \nto  be an  option so  the  moment we  received that  letter our \nplans changed. \nDad says: ‘Inevitably, these small-minded people did  us \nthe biggest favour. Seeing the  sheer anguish they put Casey \nthrough was just the motivation we  needed to take the plunge \nand  embark on  his  overseas career.’ It was  time for Dad to \nstart  digging up the backyard! \n\nCHAPTER 4 \nANARCHY IN  THE UK \nt was  a huge thing to  decide to  travel halfway across the \nfr... chasing a  dream. However, we  weren't the  first in \nour family to do it. My dad’s parents are  both English. They're \nwhat they used to  call “Ten Pound Poms’, which labelled \nimmigrants who'd arrived in Australia under a  scheme set \nup  after the  Second World War to  increase the  population \nand provide more workers. As part of the lure, the Australian \ngovernment helped with the  cost  of travelling so  that Brits \n(and others from Commonwealth countries) only had to pay \nten  pounds sterling to make the trip and their kids  travelled \nfor free, as  long as  they didn’t return within two  years. After \nthe bleakness of the war  years in England, a chance to  make \na better life sounded good. \n63 \n\nCASEY STOWE rR \nPop knew a bit about Australia already. He’d been stationed \nin Hong Kong during the war  and made friends with a bunch \nof Aussie guys who told him plenty of stories about what life \nwas  like ‘Down Under’, and he liked what he heard. In 1949, \nfour years after the war  ended, he and  Nan took the plunge \nand jumped on  a boat. My Uncle Peter was  born the following \nyear, Uncle Ron four years later and my  father, Colin, two \nyears after that. Australia was  a cheap country for day-to-day \nliving in the fifties and if you wanted to work extra hours then \nthere was  plenty of opportunity to  do so.  Pop set  up in the \nbuilding \ntrade \nand \ndid \nwell \nfor \nhimself, \nfar \nbetter \nthan \nhe \never \ncould \nhave \nback \nin \nEngland. \nHe \nwasn’t \nafraid \nof \nhard \nwork, \nand \nhe \npassed \nhis \nwork \nethic \non \nto \nmy \ndad, \nwho \nhas \npassed \nit \non \nto \nme. \nIt \nwas \ndrilled \ninto \nme \nfrom \na \nvery \nyoung \nage \nthat \nlife \nis \nwhat \nyou \nare \nprepared \nto \nmake \nof \nit \nand, \neven \nto \nthis \nday, \nthe \nopportunities \nare \nendless \nin \nAustralia. \nEndless, \nmaybe, \nuntil \nyou decide you want to be a professional motorcycle racer! \nThe  disappointment in receiving that rejected application \nto \njoin \nthe \nAJRRA \nsoon \nturned \nto \nanger \nand \nthen \nto \na \nsteely \ndetermination \nnot \nto \nlet \nit \nbeat \nus. \nI \nhad \na \ndrawing \non \nmy \nbedroom \nwall, \nnext \nto \nall \nthe \nmotorcycle \nposters, \nof \na \nfrog \ninside \nthe \nmouth \nof \na \npelican. \nAll \nyou \ncould \nsee \nof \nthe \nfrog \nwas \npart \nof \nits \nbody \nand \nits \nlegs \nhanging \nout \nof \nthe \nbeak. \nIts \nfront \nlegs \nwere \nwrapped \naround \nthe \nthroat \nof \nthe \npelican, \nchoking \nit \nand \nmaking \nsure \nthe \nbird \ncouldn’t \nswallow. \nThe \ncaption \nsaid: \nNEVER \nEVER \nGIVE \nUP \nI \nbelieved, \nand \nmy \nparents \nbelieved, \nthat \nI \nhad \nwhat \nit \ntook \nto \ncompete \nat \nan \nelite \nlevel \nif \nI \n\nNever ever give up! \nhad the chance. No one  was  going to make that happen except \nus,  SO just one generation on  from my grandparents taking that \nboat from Southampton to  Sydney, Mum, Dad and  I found \nourselves making the  return trip thanks to  Dad being able \nto  obtain British passports. Thankfully the  days of having to \nspend six weeks at sea were long gone and on 25 January 2000, \nwe  boarded a flight from Sydney to London via Kuala Lumpur \nand Abu Dhabi. I’d never been on  an  aeroplane before that. \nKelly stayed in Australia, she was  almost twenty-one and had | \nspent a great deal  of her  teen  years travelling around with \nus  while I competed. It was  hard for her to watch us  go and \nI know she  struggled with the decision a little. I understand \nthat, we  were travelling to the other side of the world. \nHaving left Sydney in the middle of summer, we  landed in \nLondon to a temperature of minus three degrees, which was \ndefinitely a shock to the  system. We  made our  way from the \nluggage carousel to our  hire car  and loaded our  cases, stuffed \nwith just our  clothes, a set of white Harley-Davidson leathers \nSVN a Sta SIN Nt SS Ped \n\nCASEY *S LONER \nTerry Pav had given me  and some light tools for Dad. Our first \nstop was  Worthing on  the  south coast to  spend a few nights \nwith Dad’s Uncle Frank and  Auntie Mary. While we  were \nthere we  bought an  old yellow LDV van  and a caravan, which \nwould be our  home. \nNext stop was  Southport, a small town on  the north-west \ncoast of England between Liverpool and Blackpool. Dad had \narranged to  meet a  guy  there by the  name of Ian  Newton, \nwhose number he’d found through a  link on  a  website \npromoting the  Aprilia Cup motorcycle youth series in Italy. \nAprilia is  an  Italian motorcycle company. Ian  was  running \na  similar championship in  the  UK, the  Aprilia Superteen \nChallenge for  12—18-year-olds, so  Dad had talked to  him \nwhile we  were planning the move and made arrangements to \nbuy a bike from him. We  travelled through the  night up the \nM1  motorway. It was  a 440-kilometre trip from Worthing to \nSouthport and we  had  made it about two-thirds of the way \nwhen we  pulled in for a rest  in a place called Nuneaton. \nOur  family had driven to race meetings all over Australia \nand it wasn’t unusual for us  to pull over in the middle of the \nnight to  sleep in the  car.  Dad had  no  idea that  in  England \nyou  can’t just pull up  at the  side  of the  road like  you  can  in \nAustralia. You can’t even stop overnight at the service stations; \nwe  tried but were kicked out by a parking attendant telling us \nwe  had to pay him to park there. We ended up driving around \na village looking for somewhere to  stop and this  guy flagged \nus  down, came over to  the  window and asked if we  were \n\ntravellers. We  said we  were, thinking, Well, we’re travelling \naround in a van, of course we’re travellers, not understanding \nthat ‘travellers’ meant gypsies! He  said  to  let him jump in \nand  he’d show us  how to  get to  his  uncle’s place, where we \ncould camp. It sounded promising but when we  got there \nthe  camp was  like  a scene straight from one  of my favourite \nmovies, Snatch, with Brad Pitt playing the gypsy fighter. This \nwas  the real thing: washing machines all over the place, dogs \nrunning around, clothes hanging up between trees and a few \nbonfires on  the  go.  Dad wasn’t bothered, saying, “We'll just \npull in and we'll be right!’ I’m  sure we  would have been, but \nthere was no  way Mum and  I wanted to  stop there, so  with \na  ‘thanks, but  no  thanks’ the  guy hopped out  and Dad kept \ndriving. Eventually we  came across a quiet industrial estate \nso we  took our  chances and found a hidden corner where we \ncould sleep for a few hours, then we  drove up to Ian Newton’s \nthe next day. \nIan, or Newt, as he was  nicknamed, turned out to be a good \nbloke. He remembers us pulling up at his place: “We’d spoken \non  the phone and Colin had sent a deposit over for the bike, \nbut coming all the way from Australia, to be honest, I wasn’t \nsure they were going to  turn up.  Next thing they pulled up \nat the workshop in this  tatty yellow van  with an  old caravan \nhanging off the back and I thought, Wow, this is proper rough \nand ready. I showed them the bike and they were just really \nexcited to get their hands on it. I asked Colin where they were \ngoing to be based and he said, “Well, I was  hoping you might \nS ONO a SS ee Se Ne SS PS \n\nGAS Yes TON ER \nhave a word with an Aprilia dealer somewhere in the Midlands \nso we  can  base ourselves there, maybe they'll give us  a corner \nof the  garage or  something.” I told him that might work in \nAustralia but over here space is tight and nobody is going to \njust give you  the  corner of a workshop. But  I had plenty of \nroom so  I told them they could set  up at my place until they \ngot sorted out.  I told  Colin they would need three things if \nthey were going to succeed over here: talent, luck and money. \nHe said, “The boy has the talent and hopefully we'll get some \nluck, but we  don’t have any  money.” Essentially they were \nprepared to put everything they had into  Casey’s racing and \nlive on  next to nothing.’ \nNewt not  only gave us  workshop space, he also found us  a \nsite  on  a farm not  far from his place in Southport, where we \ncould park the caravan. The weather wasn’t any warmer than \nLondon. It was  snowing and the heater in the caravan didn’t \nwork very well so  we  were freezing most of the time but we \nhad somewhere to live, a bike and had made a friend so things \nwere looking up —  sort  of! We'd arrived in England too  early \nfor the race season but that was  part of the plan. I’d still not \nhad  any  serious practice on  a road bike to  speak of, so  we'd \nwanted to get to the UK  as  soon as  possible and start testing. \nNow we  knew where we  were based the  next step was  for \nMum and Dad to find themselves a job. \nBecause we  had arrived in the  UK  earlier than we’d been \nplanning, we  had much less money than we’d have liked. \nMum \nand \nDad \nhad \nintended \nto \nsell \nour  \nhouse \nbut \nafter \na \nlot \n\nof thought they'd decidéd to keep it and rent  it out  to  Kelly. \nThen we  had a disaster. Not long before we  left, the  house \nburned down. Dad will  tell you  he’d been trying to  save so \nhard that he cut back on  everything: ‘I'd insured the house for \nless than the insurance company reckoned it was  worth, so we \nhad a big problem getting the money back. We got something, \nbut nowhere near its true value. Luckily, we  still had the land \nand another small place that we  had rented out  so we  were at \nleast able to hang onto that and retain some capital, which we \nknew we'd need at a later date.’ \nWe'd left Australia with a fair amount of money but it didn’t \ngo far. The exchange rate  at the time wasn’t good, about $3 to \n£1.  By the time we  bought the van, the caravan and the bike, \nthere wasn’t much left so we  had to live as  frugally as possible \nto stretch the money out.  We’d bought one-way tickets to get \nto the UK and the plan was  if things didn’t work out we  could \nsell the bike to get back home. \nI didn’t even want to think about that possibility so  it was \nimportant to  start testing as  soon as  we  could. We  took the \nbike down to  a  local track in  Wigan called Three Sisters, \nwhere for a fee of around £5 you  could pretty much ride  all \nday. Of course it was  still the middle of winter in England so \nI was  riding around in the  snow and sleet, trying to get used \nto the bike as  it slipped around underneath me  on  the frozen \nbitumen, but I loved the track and would have ridden there \nevery day if I could. We had a few more runs at Three Sisters \nbefore taking part in the official pre-season tests at Donington \nSLIN IT aie SN NAS Aa \n\nCASEY -SO NER \nPark and Mallory Park, where Newt introduced me to my first \nfriend in the UK, Chaz Davies. \nChaz was  the  favourite for the  Superteen championship. \nHe  says now: “There was  honestly just me  and  a  couple \nof others I thought were going to  be  quick. I didn’t know \nanything about Casey or  even that he was  going to be there, \nbut I remember at the Donington test  I found myself behind \nthis guy in white leathers thinking I definitely wasn’t catching \nhim quickly enough. I wasn’t happy because it was  the start of \nthe season and I realised there was  an  unexpected contender \nto deal with, \nI was  pleased with how things went during testing and in \nthe first race at Mallory I was  fast.  My riding style was  pretty \nunorthodox for a road racer but it seemed to work well there \nand I was  able to beat Chaz. I remember people being really \nshocked that I was  backing it in at the hairpin because nobody \nhad done that on  a Superteen bike before. It was  the only way \nI knew how to ride. I thought, That’s what you do, isn’t itP In \nthe second round at Brands Hatch I qualified on pole by more \nthan a second and lapped nineteen of thirty-two riders in the \nrace, finishing 10 seconds clear of Chaz to take my second win \nfrom as  many races. \nBy the time that first race  came around Mum had managed \nto get a job in one  of those roadside tea  and coffee vans in a \nvillage near Southport called Scarisbrick, and Dad had found \na part-time job at  Blacks motorcycle shop in  Southport. He \nwas  earning £40 a day but could only work three or  four days \n\na week because I had to gO racing, so  a lot of weeks he could \nearn £120 at the most. It cost us £150 in fuel just to drive down \nto Brands and back, so we were already dipping into what was \nleft of our  savings. \nWith baked beans at  9p a  tin  and  bread for  15p a  loaf \nwe  were eating enough beans on  toast to  last a lifetime. On \nvery rare  occasions we  would treat ourselves to a full English \nbreakfast with sausages, fried eggs and  all the  extras. A ‘full \nEnglish breakfast’ still  goes down as  one  of my  all-time \nfavourite meals. \nIn the Superteens there was  £250 available for a win, twice \nwhat Dad could earn in a week, so there was  a certain pressure \nfor me  to bring it home. \nI know Mum and  Dad didn’t want me  to  take that worry \non, but it was  impossible not to because they'd put so much of \ntheir finances into moving overseas for me.  Dad says: ‘It didn’t \nmatter if it didn’t work out, and we  tried to make sure Casey \nknew that. If it happened it happened, if it didn’t it didn’t. My \nview was, What's the worst that can  happen? I was  still young \nenough to come home and buy another house if I wanted to, \nor  get a  caravan and travel around Australia, finding work \nalong the way. That’s the way we  felt and that’s what we  told \nCasey but I know it was a big driving force for him, not  to let \nus  down. We all knew it but there was  nothing wé could do to \nchange it. It was  obvious.’ \nHaving this responsibility to put food on  the table is not  a \nnormal situation for a fourteen-year-old kid, but I tried not to \nSE PWN Stale So eS \n\nEASE Ys TONE rR \nthink about it and to do my own  thing. Once I was  on the track \nit never even crossed my mind. I had a job to do, which was \nto win  motorbike races, and  that was  the  most normal thing \nin the world to me. \nAfter the  success at  Mallory we  were approached by a \nguy from a company called Lloyd Lifestyle, one  of the  UK’s \nbiggest importers of motorcycling equipment, saying they \nwere interested in a sponsorship arrangement. When we  asked \nNewt about them he said we  should talk to them because they \nwere a good family company. Lloyds wanted me  to join their \nteam and become a third rider alongside Craig Jones and John \nLloyd, son  of the company owner, George Lloyd. They offered \nus  £5000 cash, a fortune to us  at the time, but Dad told them \nhe’d have to think about it. They couldn't believe it when we \ndidn’t jump at it. They then offered to pay our bills, entry fees \nand all sorts of stuff but again Dad said he wasn’t sure and that \nhe’d let them know. \nEventually, after the  third round at  Donington when I \nqualified second but crashed out  of the lead after a couple of \nlaps in half-wet-half-dry conditions, Lloyds came back with \na  fresh offer, whereby they would also employ Dad to  run \nthe team and do some delivery work for them. So in addition \nto the five  grand cash Dad also  had  a job, a team to  run  and \na van  to  drive, and  I had  a new set  of leathers and  a helmet \nfrom Lloyd’s own brand, OGK. When we  drove over to  the \ncompany headquarters in Penrith to pick up the gear I was  so \nexcited about my new leathers that I wore them in the van  all \n\nthe way back to  Southport and went straight round to Newt's \nhouse to show him. \nDad  was  proving to  be  a pretty hard negotiator and  he \ndidn’t cut much slack when it came to dealing with me,  either. \nEven though he said we  could go back to Australia at any point \nI was never under the  impression we  were in  England on \nholiday. Ever since I was  little he’d told  me  that if we  didn’t \ngo into  a race to win  then there was  no  point us  even being \nthere. Sometimes he’d mean that loosely because we  might \nhave a bike that was  only capable of tenth place, in which case \nfourth can  be better than a win. It’s a weird thing, but in racing \nyou  can  outperform the  guy who gets to  stand on  top of the \npodium without actually beating him. \nGoing to the UK changed things for all of us.  Dad could see \nI had the talent — we were up against some very good riders and \nI was  beating them —  so  what had at times been just a dream \nwas  looking more and  more like  a  real  possibility to  us.  We \nboth knew I had to take every opportunity and he encouraged \nme  to do just that.  At this  point things were getting serious. \nDad used to say, ‘If you want to become World Champion you \ncan’t be that much better than local competition,’ holding his \nfinger and  thumb an  inch apart. “You have to  be this  much \nbetter, he’d say, holding his arms wide open. \nDad confirms this feeling still today: ‘I know it’s a harsh way \nto look at things but that’s the difference between a champion \nand  the  rest.  Just look  at the  careers of Dani Pedrosa and \nJorge Lorenzo. Dani had Alberto Puig and Jorge had his old \nS LVN Seth, SINS SS lie \n\nGAS EY certo Nntee \nman, both of them hard as  nails. If you  want to  make it to \nthe  top I think it takes somebody with an  unforgiving view \non  life to help get you  there. So I said those things to Casey, \nparticularly when we went to the UK, because to keep moving \nup  a level he couldn't just be happy with winning a race. If \nhe wasn’t winning by a margin that represented his maximum \nperformance then he wasn’t showing people how much better \nhe was  than the rest.’ \nThere’s no denying that Dani, Jorge and I became successful \nwith that kind of upbringing and sometimes you probably do \nneed it.  As  far as  I’m  concerned Alberto was  nowhere near \nas  tough on  Dani as  my dad was  on  me  or Jorge’s dad was  on \nhim. That kind of intensity and expectation puts a lot of extra \npressure on a father-son relationship that isn’t always healthy. \nWe  definitely had our  moments and there were a few major \nblow-ups to come. But  at the time, rightly or  wrongly, it was \nproving to be a good system for us  and I was  eager to continue \nimpressing my dad and others with my performances on  the \ntrack. \nM y first race as  a Lloyds rider was  in the  fourth round \nat  Thruxton, where I qualified second to  my  new \nteammate Jonesy and missed out on the win  by 0.078 seconds \n\nto  a  guy  named Rob Butterworth. In  the  next round at \nSnetterton I qualified on  pole by more than a  second clear \nof Chaz and then beat him in a ten-lap race, which didn’t go \ndown well with him or  his  parents, and  some of that blew \nback on  Newt. \nNewt says: “To  the  other parents it was  starting to  look \ndodgy. I was  running the  championship but  I had  this  kid \nracing out of my workshop and he was  blowing the other kids \naway. You can’t imagine how much they bitched to me  about \nit, it was  horrendous. They were convinced I was  giving him \nspecial parts that their kids weren't getting. They kept making \nme  pull the  bike apart and  everything. The Davies were a \nlovely family but they were as  bad as  anybody. Chaz had been \n“Rookie of the Year” in 1999 and in fairness he would probably \nhave won the series easily in 2000 but for this Aussie kid, who \nhad arrived out  of nowhere. It was  hard for them to take.’ \nI qualified a second clear of Chaz again for the  next race \nat Oulton Park, only to crash while chasing him  for the lead, \nbut a first and a second in a double round at Cadwell Park in \nAugust meant that despite not  scoring in two  of the rounds I \nhad closed the gap at the top of the championship to twenty- \nfour points with four races remaining. That gap  shrank by \nanother ten  points thanks to  two  more wins at  Mallory and \nCadwell, where I won by 8 seconds in an  eight-lap race. \nNewt continues: ‘Casey was  beating them in  the  slow \ncomers; that’s where he really excelled, which is why he loved \nit so much at Three Sisters. Whereas other kids would just get \nSIN aa ONDA SS ie \n\nGAS 2Y Stoner \nthrough them because they were no  fun and you  can’t make \nup much time, Casey used to really focus on them. He'd slide \nin, get the bike turned and power out. At the  bottom of the \nmountain at  Cadwell he was  unbelievable. He  must have \nbeen three miles per  hour quicker through there. But  the \nmost impressive thing was  how fast he could be on  the  first \nlap. He  wasn’t doing lap records but  he’d be close to  them \nas  soon as  the  flag dropped and  that’s where he’d  win  the \nrace. He would just explode through the first few corners and \nyou'd think, How is he doing that? I guess it came from his \ndays in  dirt-track, when the  races only lasted three or  four \nlaps. Everybody knew that once he  got away they weren’t \ngoing to  catch him. Casey was  a laidback kid then but put a \ncrash helmet on  him and his eyes would glaze over. It sounds \nstupid but I’m  serious, he was  in a different world. His  focus \nwas  amazing. \nThe level of competition between Chaz and me, not  to \nmention the  increasing tension between our  parents, finally \nbegan to affect our  friendship. It was  a real shame because we \nhad become good friends and it was  great to have someone my \nown  age to hang out with. His family lived in a big old barn in \nthe  middle of the country on  the  English-Welsh border and \nthey'd invited us  down to  visit not  long after we  met. They \nhad  a great track at the  side  of their house where we  could \nrace  karts and minibikes and we  could go off into  the nearby \nforests to  shoot air rifles. That was  the closest I had been to \neverything I missed about Australia since we'd left. \n\nChaz knew how much I liked being at his place: ‘I guess \ncoming to  our  place was  a bit of a holiday for  Casey after \nliving in a caravan with his mum and dad for months on  end. \nHe was  such a country kid; there were some things I couldn't \nbelieve. I remember once we  were hiking out  in the  forest \nand he took a cup, scooped some water out oben old tractor \nrut  in the ground and knocked it back. I was  like, “What the \nhell  are  you  doing?” and he just said, “Well, it looks clean to \nme!” Stuff like that, you  don’t really see  but it’s  quite natural \nto  him. I'd never even met an  Australian before so  it was \npretty cool to  me.  But  his  determination stood out  straight \naway. It didn’t matter if we  were trying to  throw a  stone or \nplaying PlayStation, everything was a  competition. It sort \nof brought out  more competition in  me  as  well, because it \nwas a  case of surrendering or  at  least trying to  challenge \nhim! Unfortunately, when it came to  racing, he  was just \ntoo  fast  and  it got too  competitive between us.  We  ended \nup barely speaking to  each other for the  second half of that \nseason. \nOnce Chaz and I fell out, it turned into a bit  of a  lonely \nsummer, but Kelly had given me  a copy of Bryce Courtenay’s \nThe Power of One  so  I read a lot around this time. I’m  not  a \nhuge reader but I love that book. ‘First with your head, then \nwith your heart’ isn’t  a bad philosophy to live by. I also  read \nall the Harry Potter books as  they came out.  But I still spent \nmost of my time on  a bike. We  moved into a static caravan a \ncouple of kilometres away from Newt's place and I used to ride \nSUNT ears ee SVEN te) tet \n\nCASEY SaTaNer \nmy pushbike down the canal path to his and Myra’s house for \nmy breakfast, then spend the  day at his workshop or fishing \nin the canal from the back of a narrow boat owned by one  of \nhis friends. The lady next  door used to bake cakes and scones \nand  I’d go round and  pick up  some fresh ones to  take back \nhome to the caravan. \nIan  Newton remembers around that time we  got a  fax \nmachine and I wanted to test it out:  “Casey sent  a fax through \nto  the  office to  see  if it was  working, something along the \nlines of, “I’m going to be Aprilia Superteen Champion 2000”. \nI wrote back saying, “You can  talk the talk but  can  you walk \nthe walk?” He  sent  me a fax straight back that  simply read, \n“I'm going to  RUN the walk.” We  were only having a laugh \nbut it’s something that always stuck in my head because that’s \nexactly what he did!’ \nThings were going really well in the Superteens and Lloyds \nagreed to help us buy a 125 so we  could contest the final three \nrounds of the  British Championship. We  bought the  bike \nfrom Mark Hodgson, father of Neil Hodgson, who was  British \nSuperbike Champion at the time and would go on  to win  the \nWorld Superbikes a couple of years later. Mark was  actually \nrunning Leon Camier in the 125s but he also sold second-hand \nbikes and parts from his place in nearby Burnley, so  we  used \nto go over there and have a look through his bits  and pieces, \nmaybe buy a  few  things. He  had  the  nickname ‘Flask and \nSandwiches’ because he liked talking, so you knew that when \nyou went over to  his place you were going to  be there for a \n\nwhile! Mind you, it’s fair to say that my dad likes a chat too, so \nI’m  sure they were as  bad as  each other. \nJust like  we  had  done back in Australia we  rode pretty \nmuch any event we  could get into:  practice days, club  days — \nyou  name it, we  were there, either on  the  Superteen bike or \nthe 125.  On one  occasion we  went to Three Sisters and there \nwas  an inter-club ‘Celtic Challenge’ going on,  England versus \nIreland. After I'd been out on the track for a few laps one  of the \nIrish guys came over to where we  were working on  the bike. \n‘Jaysus, kid, you came past me  so fast I thought you were a \nfeckin’ rabbit!’ he said. “Are you Irish by any chance” \n‘No, I’m Australian,’ I replied. \n‘Hmm. But your grandmother was  Irish, wasn’t she?” \nI suddenly realised what he was  getting at. ‘Oh yeah! Good \nold Grandma was  Irish!’ I said. \nThat was  enough for him  and we  agreed I would ride  for \ntheir team. On  the  Saturday we  were doing pretty well, I \nwon all my races and the Irish boys held up their end. On the \nSunday morning we  turned up, ready to race again, but it was \npretty clear my new  teammates had  enjoyed a good night's \n‘craic’, as  they called it.  One of them hadn’t slept because \nthey'd set  his  mattress on  fire,  another had  blood pouring \ndown his face because he’d fallen down a hill.  Some of them \ntried to ride but most of them were in no  fit state, so they had \nto  send me  out  there to hold the whole thing together. I set \nthe outright circuit record that day and won  every race  apart \nfrom the last one, when I crashed because I was so exhausted. \nSON TS eek ASU ess edie \n\nCASEY -Sat CO Nee \nSomehow the scorers worked out that England won  but given \nhow many races we'd won, I wonder if they added it up right. \nNot long after that we  took the  125  over to  Northern \nIreland to a meeting at Kirkistown, organised by the father of \na racer named Marty Nutt, who had a travel agency over there \nand was  doing a lot of bike promotions. We told the organisers \nI was  fifteen, even though I was  only fourteen. We'd already \nlearnt at Three Sisters the  Irish are  a pretty laidback bunch! \nI was riding against Ian  Lougher, a  famous Irish road racer, \nand other guys from the  British Championship, and I was \nprobably a bit out  of my depth. We  had a lot of trouble with \nthe bike because it had a carbon-kevlar tank on  it and the jets \nkept blocking up with bits of fibre. I had a couple of crashes, \nknocked myself out  and  busted my  ankle up  but  got the \nchance to race  with some fast guys and started to understand \nwhere we  needed to improve. \ny first 125cc British Championship race was  at Mallory \nM Park on  17 September 2000. We qualified eighth, just \nbehind Leon Camier on  the outside of the second row, but I \ngot to the front on the first lap and ended up fighting all the way \nto the line with Christopher Martin and Stuart Easton, setting \nanew circuit record on the way to second place behind Martin. \n\nThe following weekend we  went down to  Brands Hatch \nwhere I qualified fourth in the dry, with Leon Haslam on pole. \nLeon was  already racing in the World Championship by then \nso  he was  a good measuring stick for us.  On  the  Sunday it \npoured with rain  and I had a problem with my visor steaming \nup but I still managed to  finish second to  Leon, which was  a \nbig boost because I felt that without the visor issue, we  could \nhave fought for the win. \nTwo weeks later we  headed back to  Donington for the \nfinal round of the  British Championship, which was  also  the \nfinal round of the  Aprilia Superteens. Chaz was  leading the \nSuperteens by nine points, meaning that  if I won he had  to \ntake second to  make sure of the title. I qualified on  pole on \nthe  Friday, with Chaz in  third, and I made an  early break \non  a  damp track with a  drying line. Chaz would normally \nhave been comfortable in second place but unfortunately for \nhim  he got tangled up with a rider taking his  chances in the \nmixed conditions and on  the very last lap he was  forced wide \nonto the wet  part of the  track. He  crashed, handing me  the \nchampionship by sixteen points. \nWatching a competitor crash out wasn’t how I liked to win \nbut  that  is motor racing and winning the  Aprilia Superteen \nChampionship was  a great day for me.  I also qualified on pole \nposition for the 125 race, which would take place the following \nday. On the  Sunday morning the sun  came out  and  I led for \nthe opening few laps in the dry but just didn’t have the pace \nto outrun Stuart Easton and he beat me  by just over  a second. \nSN TSA NEES Bled \n\nSASEY -STronNner \nAs  the  Aprilia Superteen Champion I was  invited to  the \nend-of-season awards dinner, which was  formal dress. I didn’t \nhave a suit  so  Lloyds hired one  for me.  Newt helped us  out _ \ntoo:  ‘I bought Casey a pair of dress shoes because he didn’t \nown  any.  I remember that year I used to open the back door \nin the morning to let the dogs out and most days Casey would \nbe  standing there, waiting to  come in  for  some breakfast. \nThe  first time I showed him where the cereal was  he started \nexamining the different boxes. It seemed a bit fussy to me  so \nI asked him what he was  doing —  he was  actually checking the \ndates, to  make sure he was eating the  oldest stuff first. Any \nother kid would have dived straight in without even thinking \nabout such a thing. That’s what he was like, though: polite, \nhumble, just a great little kid’ \ny performances in those last few British Championship \nM rounds had caught the  attention of a  few  people, \nincluding Mario Rubatto, who was actually working as  a \nchassis engineer for one  of the  other riders, Jason DiSalvo, \nand Mario had previously run  Grand Prix  teams with a lot of \nsuccess.

Dad was \nbehind the camera \nthis time. \n\nto a few key people in Europe and by coincidence Mario was \none  of the guys who'd taken a look at it. \nMario Rubatto: ‘I saw  Casey ride the  125  for  the  first \ntime in the  wet  at  Brands and  I was  blown away. He  was \nunbelievable, the  most talented rider I had  ever seen. You \ndidn’t need to be an  expert to know that you were looking at \nsomething very special. I immediately rang my wife and said, \n“Find the resumé of that Australian boy, see  if it is the same \none!” Of course it was, so I went to his father and told him that \nCasey stood no  chance of progressing if he stayed in Britain \nbecause they were only interested in promoting their own \nriders, but that I had a bike and a race truck back in Germany \nthat we  could take to the final couple of rounds of the Spanish \nChampionship if they wanted. All he had to do was  provide \nthe tyres and £5000 to cover the costs and I would supply the \nrest.  We made a deal right there and then.’ \nDad and  I liked Mario’s style and  knew this  was  a  big \nopportunity for us,  even if it had come a bit sooner than we \nexpected. Dad says, ‘Mario and I didn’t always see  eye to eye \non  everything, but he was a great help to us  and is still a good \n-  friend.’ \nThe British Championship was  pretty competitive, but the \nSpanish series was  the next  level up and had already proven \nto be a stepping stone to world level for a lot of riders. Most \npeople we  spoke to  thought it was too  soon for me, but we \ndecided to trust we were making the right decision and try our \nluck on  the European mainland. \nS.bLiIWwi dt: Sa asa S Pied \n\nEAS Eyres LONE \nLloyds agreed to pay the  travel costs, Dad  scraped some \nmoney together and the three of us  headed over to Germany \nto meet up with Mario, jumping into the back of his race truck \nto drive 1800 kilometres all the way down to Albacete in the \nsouth of Spain. The bike was a standard Honda RS125, like \nthe one  I’d been riding in the  UK, with a couple of bits  and \npieces bolted on it. The truck had a living area in the front and \nsome bunks in the back. Mario also brought along a mechanic \ncalled Hans. \nThings went well in  practice at  Albacete and  I quickly \ngot used to the  track, which had some of the  tight and  slow \ncorners I liked. The biggest problem was  choosing the tyres. \nDunlop did three kinds of rubber for the 125: “B’, ‘C’ and “D’. \n‘B’  was the  softest compound, which we  ran  in  the  British \nChampionship; ‘C’ was a medium compound; and  obviously \n‘D’ was  the hardest. We  were running the  ‘C’s  in practice at \nAlbacete but  Mario reckoned we’d have to use  the  ‘D’s  over \nrace distance so  he  made me  go out  and  test  them. I was \nlosing the front all over the place, I just couldn’t keep the bike \nupright and  I thought, There’s no  way I can  use  these things \nin the  race. So we  went with the  ‘C’s  and  even though they \nwent off pretty quickly I was going well, running in the  top \nfive when the organisers stopped the race  for a crash. \nPretty much everybody else went in and put new tyres on, \nbut of course we  didn’t have any spares because we  couldn't \nafford them. So I had to go back out  on  the same rubber, or \nwhat was  left of it. The white of the cord was  actually showing \n\nthrough and  I ended up dropping a  couple of places and \nfinishing fifth in a race  won by Toni Elias. Afterwards one  of \nthe other riders must have been complaining about his tyres \nbecause his  team manager dragged him  into  our  pit box to \nshow him  what I was  riding on.  He  shouted at  the  rider in \nSpanish, something like, “Now don’t bust my balls!’ \nIn the  next round at Jerez we  decided to test  out  the  ‘D’ \ncompound again since we  knew the  ‘C’s  had  no  chance of \nlasting a race  distance. It wasn’t until we  checked the pressure \nthat we  realised they had about 70 pounds in them, which \nmeant that  at  Albacete they'd basically been pumped up \nenough to pop them on  the rim  of the wheel but hadn’t been \n~  let down again. We had major engine problems in the race  and \nonly finished sixteenth. Afterwards I pushed the bike back to \nthe pits. It had so  little compression that I didn’t even notice \nit was in gear. \nThankfully I'd done enough in that first race at Albacete - \nto  catch the attention of  Alberto Puig, a  tough and \nuncompromising 500cc Grand Prix winner from Spain whom \nI'd watched race against Mick Doohan a couple of times on \ntelevision back in Australia. Alberto’s competitive career had \neffectively come to a premature end when he slid under the \nair fence and hit the barriers after a high-speed crash in turn \none  at Le Mans, badly breaking his leg. \nHe was  now dedicating his time to  finding fresh Spanish \ntalent on behalf of the national telecommunications company \nTelefénica Movistar and MotoGP’s television and commercial \nS LIVNI vedo SINUS Gre \n\nCASEY STONER \nrights holders, Dorna. After bringing some pretty special kids \nthrough the  Spanish Championship that  season (including \na  previously unknown young rider called Daniel Pedrosa) \nthey had decided to open the project up to riders from other \ncountries for the next campaign. \nIn the stern and abrupt style we  would soon  become very \nfamiliar with, Alberto limped over to my dad in the pit lane at \nAlbacete and simply said, “Who is this boy?” \n‘This is my son, Casey Stoner,’ Dad replied. \n‘Well, I want him to race for me  next year in the  Spanish \nChampionship,’ said Alberto. \nIt’s fair to say we  didn’t know much about Grand Prix racing \nat this point but one  thing we  did know was  that you don’t say \nno  to Alberto Puig. \n\nCHARTER S \nVIVA ESPANA \nfter just a year in the UK the idea of relocating to Spain \nLe daunting, but in a way it was  similar to the decision \nwe'd made during my dirt-track days, moving down from the \nGold Coast to the Hunter Valley area  where the competition \nwas  stronger. We  already had  an  agreement in  place with \nLloyds to contest the British Championship but we  knew the \nreal competition was  at the  Spanish Championship in terms \nof riders, bikes and  teams, plus the  majority of the  Spanish \ncircuits were on  the  Grand Prix calendar, so  it became our \nnumber-one priority. \nWith the way the calendar worked out we  figured I could \nride in  both championships but  we’d have to  miss three \nrounds of the  British Championship. We vere concerned \n87 \n\nCASEY SvyoONer \nthis would be an  issue for Lloyds, but luckily they were very \nunderstanding and supportive sponsors. In fact, they backed \nour  decision, helping us  financially so  we  could buy an  old \nmotorhome from Mario and keep it on the road for thousands \nof kilometres as  we  travelled backwards and  forwards from \nthe UK to  mainland Europe. They also helped pay for living \nexpenses. \nIt would have been almost impossible for Mum, Dad and \nme  to achieve what we  did without George and Cath Lloyd \nhelping us  and we  developed a great personal relationship \nwith the  Lloyd family. I really enjoyed spending time with \nGeorge, he had  a  great sense of humour, and  John became \na friend and a teammate. George passed away in September \n2012 and I was  very sad to hear of his death. I will always be \ngrateful for the  support he and  Cath gave us  in those early \ndays of my career. \nRelationships like this are  pretty rare  in the world of racing \nand for a kid like me,  spending all my time moving from one \nracetrack to another in a motorhome with my parents, it wasn't \neasy to make friends, especially with people my own age. Even \nback in Australia I never really hung around in big groups and \nI hadn't been to school for a couple of years because we  kept \nup the home-schooling so  when I did interact with people it \nwas  usually one  on  one. It was  the same in the UK  and to be \nhonest, sometimes I struggled to  fit in because I found the \nEnglish sense of humour a lot different from what I was  used \nto.  Everyone else seemed to be a bit more quick-witted than \n\nI \nwas  \nand \nif \nthe \njoke \nwas  \non \nme  \noften \nI \nwasn’t \ntoo  \nsure  \nhow \nto \ntake \nit. \nIt \ndefinitely \ntook \nme  \nsome \ntime  \nto \nget \nused \nto \ncertain \n_ \nthings. \nLuckily, as  well as  inviting me  over to  Spain, Alberto had \nalso \napproached \nChaz \nDavies \nand \nLeon \nCamier \nto \nform \npart \nof an  eight-man line-up supported by Telefénica Movistar \nand Dorna that also included a kid called Jascha Biisch from \nGermany, and Spanish riders Julian Simon, Joan Lascorz, Jordi \nTorres and David Salom. Chaz and I still weren't really back \non  the  best of terms but  being thrown together in  difficult \ncircumstances helped us  quickly patch up our  differences. \nIn the end Chaz and I felt the same way. Chaz says: ‘When \nwe  went to  Spain we  didn’t speak Spanish, we  didn’t know \nanyone and there was  me,  Leon and Casey. We  all depended \non each other a little bit. We travelled together and our parents \nshared rental cars, because obviously we  had  to  pay for that \nsort  of stuff ourselves, and we  had to make the best of it. We \nall had  different experiences of it.  Casey and  Julian Simon \nwere automatically selected to be the guys to compete for the \nchampionship, because they showed they were fast  straight \naway. But  I think it was  a good opportunity for all of us.’ \nAt the start we  were all given identical bikes but I was  1.5 \nseconds quicker than the other guys in the first test so they gave \nme  an updated air box and exhaust. Basically, if you showed the \npotential they gave you support to see what else you could do \nand whether you were capable of running at the front. Simon \nwas even smaller than Dani Pedrosa at the time so  he could \nS LINN SR oN AS rh a \n\nCASEY STONER \nalso make the bike look better than it was, especially in terms \nof power, so  he got a few extra bits  and pieces too.  I think I \nended up with a 1998 kit on my bike, although this was  in 2001 \nso  they were still a long way off Grand Prix  specs. Given my \nhistory of makeshift bikes I wasn’t complaining! \nOur first race  that year was  in the British Championship at \nDonington, where I managed to qualify on pole by 1.3 seconds \nfrom Leon and win  the race  by 5.8 seconds in front of a guy \nnamed Paul Robinson with Leon in third. As well as  the win, \nI got to meet former Grand Prix World Championship rider \nBarry Sheene that  weekend. Barry was  working as  a  racing \ncommentator and he interviewed me  for Australian television. \nBarry Sheene was a rider I looked up to, for his talent and his \nhonesty. When he was  riding, he was  known to speak out if he \nthought safety was  being compromised. I respected that. And \nhe was  fast, something I was  determined to be. \nTwo weeks later we  were at Silverstone, where I set a new \npole record by a second in qualifying and  then won a close \nrace  with Leon by half a second. I only managed to  qualify \nthird in the  third round at  Snetterton but we  got ourselves \nsorted out  for the  race. I took the  lead on  the  second lap \nand  went on  to  break the  circuit record, winning by more \nthan 20  seconds. After three races I had  three wins and  a \ntwenty-eight-point championship lead  over Robinson, with \nLeon another point behind. \nI’d wanted to use  the number 66 when I raced, but another \nrider had taken it. Number 66, or  166 if there had to be three \n\ndigits, had always been my number in dirt-track because Dad \nhad used number 6. I had run  66 in the Aprilia Superteens \nbut  it had  been taken in  the  British Championship so  I’d \nused 48, which is what I was given. For the  Spanish series \nAlberto had block-booked all the twenties for his riders and \nI was  given the number 27.  It was  the number I would keep \nfrom then on. \nThe  fourth round clashed with the  opening round of the \nSpanish Championship, so  instead of heading to Oulton Park \nin Cheshire, Leon, Chaz and I left for Jarama, Madrid. \nThe  eight of us  were all in  awe  of Alberto Puig. Chaz \nremembers how tough Alberto was: “Not tough to  deal with \nor to talk to, but the conversation began and ended with what \nwas  going on at the track and he runs a strict program there. In \nthe second round at Albacete, Camier got a bad start. “What \nhappened?” Alberto asked him, so  Leon said, “Somebody in \nfront of me  bogged it off the line  and I had to back off and I \nlost loads of ground ...” Alberto looked at him  and said “You \nmust hit  him!” So  it was like, okay, we’re here for  racing, \nwhatever it takes.’ \nI was  definitely only there for the racing and I think Alberto \nliked that. I started the  season with the  standard bike from \ntesting, with a  few  small upgrades, but  managed to  finish \nthird behind two Spanish kids -  Angel Rodriguez, who was \nalready scoring points in the World Championship by then, \nand  Héctor Faubel. After that we  stayed on  in Spain for the \nnext round back down at Albacete, where I managed to beat \nSLAW Pa SAL SNE AS fale \n\nCASEY \"STONER \nRodriguez for the win,  and then we  headed back to the  UK \nfor the British Championship. I went on to win the fifth round \nat Brands Hatch by almost 16 seconds after setting a new pole \nrecord in qualifying. \nBeating a  current Grand Prix  rider like  Rodriguez might \nhave attracted the attention of a few people but we  honestly \nnever looked at it like  that  or  started thinking about what a \nresult like that meant. I know it sounds strange, but for me  it \nwas  all about doing my best on  the day with the bike that was \nunderneath me,  nothing more than that. I never try to  look \ntoo far ahead or too much into the past. There is no point and \nit doesn’t interest me,  probably another reason why I resisted \nwriting a book for so  long! \nI managed to set  another pole record in the next round at \nThruxton but  we  were having a problem with the  bike and \nthe  air box kept filling up with fuel. After two-laps of warm- \nup on  the morning of the race  it spilled fuel all over the rear \ntyre and  I had  a huge high-side crash, literally snapping my \nbike into two  pieces. There was  no way we  could fix it in time ~ \nfor the race and Paul Robinson, who had finished third in the \nrace we  missed at Oulton, took third again to  cut  my lead to \neleven points. \nWe went back to Spain in mid-July for the Valencia race but \nthings didn’t go so well. It rained in practice and unfortunately \nthe  team didn’t have proper wet-track tyres. I crashed and \nhurt my hip. The rain  stopped and the track dried out for the \nrace, but the painkilling injections I'd been given to get me  on \n\nthe \nbike \nstarted \nto \nwear \noff \nand \nI \nwent \nfrom \nfirst \nbackwards \nthrough \nthe \nfield. \n: \nAlong with Rodriguez, Faubel and my teammate Julian \nSimon there was another rider at  the  front in  the  Spanish \nChampionship by the name of Jorge Lorenzo. I didn’t know \nmuch about him at the time, but he’d just turned fourteen so \nhe was  eighteen months younger than me  and clearly very fast. \nHe  finished third in that race at Valencia and then second in \nthe  next round at Albacete, where I struggled to  place sixth \nbecause of a chatter problem that was  so  bad it left me  with \nblisters on  my hand like you wouldn't believe. \nIn  between those two  races we  also took part in  three \nmore rounds of the  British Championship and won all three \nquite comfortably: at  Oulton Park by more than 6 seconds; \nat  Knockhill by 11  seconds; and at  Cadwell by 9 seconds. \nCadwell was  a particularly good weekend because we  set  a \nnew  lap record in qualifying and in the race  I was  2.4 seconds \nclear after the first lap. After four laps the gap was  6 seconds \nand I stretched it to 9 in front of Chaz (who took second place) \nby the finish. \nDad has a pretty good story from that weekend at Oulton. \n‘It was  wet  and  Casey completely lost  confidence. I don’t \nknow why and neither does he, still to this day. When it came \nto qualifying he said to me,  “Put the old fairings on,  Dad, I’m \neither going to  fix this  or  I’m  going to  crash.” He  went out \nand on his second lap he was  5 seconds clear of everybody else. \nHe  came straight back in and sat  the  rest of the  session out. \nS LIVNI? StH SNe hte S ire \n\nCASEY \"STONER \nBy the end he was  still on pole by 2.5 seconds. We put the new \nfairings back on  for the race.’ \nHaving achieved some stronger results, Leon had left the \nSpanish Championship to  concentrate on  the  British. He \nwas  now placing second in the  championship but  still  sixty \npoints behind me  with four races to go. The next  two  rounds \ncoincided with the Spanish Championship but I didn’t really \ncare about missing those races. My goal was  never to  be \nBritish Champion, or  Spanish Champion, or  even 125cc or \n250cc World Champion for that matter. My dream was  always \nto be 500cc World Champion because for me  it was  the only \ntitle that mattered. Whatever we  felt was  the next step towards \nachieving that was  the step we  took. Even though it was  still \na distant dream at this point, at least in my head, Dad would \nagain say,  ‘Aim for the  stars and  if you  hit the  moon you're \ndoing pretty well.’ \nIt was  important to keep testing ourselves against the best \npossible competition and we  got the opportunity to  step up \nanother level that  July with a wildcard entry for the  British \nGrand Prix. Unfortunately, as  they were still  only fourteen, \nChaz and Leon were too young to enter but I was  fifteen so  I \ncould. Alberto invited me  to ride for the Telef6nica Movistar \nteam as  a fourth rider with Dani Pedrosa, Joan Olivé and Toni \nElias, although I would have my standard bike and mechanics \nfrom the  Spanish Championship as  opposed to  the  factory \nHonda Grand Prix kit they were on.  We had massive chatter \nproblems we  couldn’t get rid of but in a wet  session I finished \n\nsecond, \nwhich \nfelt  \nreally \ngood. \nAnother \nproblem \nI \nhad  \nthat \nweekend \nwas  \nAlex \nDe \nAngelis \ncoming \npast \nme  \non \nthe \nstraight \nand  \nhitting \nmy \nfront \nbrake \nlever, \ntrying \nto  \ngive \nme \na \nscare. \n_ \nAlberto \nwas furious \nand \nI \ncan’t \nsay \nI \nwas \nhappy \nabout \nit, \neither. \nI \nfinally \nstruggled \nto \nseventeenth, \nwhich \nwasn’t \nwhat \nI'd \nhoped \nfor. \nHowever, \nI \na \nreally \ninterested \nin \nthe \noccasion \nitself \nor \nthe \nsignificance \nof \nriding \nin \nthe \nWorld \nChampionship \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime; \nfor \nme \nit \nwas \nalways \na \nstepping \nstone. \nI made up  for  that poor result back in  the  Spanish \nChampionship. After the  sixth placing at Albacete we  went \nback to  Jarama in  September for the  fifth round of seven, \nwhere I managed to take my second win. My bike had been \nupgraded during the summer break and I won  the race, beating \nFaubel and Rodriguez by about 15 seconds and breaking the 3 \nlap record by 1.8 seconds. The previous record had been set \nby Emilio Alzamora in  1999, the  year he was 125cc World \nChampion, and  to  break it was something special for  two \nreasons. First, Alzamora had  become one  of my favourite \nriders; even though he didn’t always have the best machinery, \nhe was  always there at the front, always fighting in every race, \nwhich was  something I really looked up to.  Secondly, the kit \nI was  riding on was  actually older than the bike he’d been on \nwhen he set the record two years before. \nThere wasn’t another race  in  Spain until late  November \nso  we  went back to  the  UK  with a  chance to  wrap up  the \nBritish Championship at Rockingham. Even though Leon had \nreduced my lead to ten points after winning the two  races I’'d \nSUVA Ge eS eRe SocIN I ied ea cd \n\nCASIEYseS7ONER \nmissed I was  still pleased to see  him again. By this time Leon, \nChaz and I had also become good friends with another racer in \nthe British paddock, Andy ‘Storka’ Walker. Our parents used \nto  call  the  four of us  the  ‘Brat Pack’ and  the  nickname has \nstuck to this day. Andy now  works as  Leon’s manager and we \ntry to get together pretty much every year either in Europe or \nAustralia with our wives and partners. It doesn’t matter where \nwe  are,  we  always have a good time together. \nWe'd been racking up a lot of kilometres driving back and \nforth from the UK and around Europe so we  couldn't believe \nit when, after a ten-hour drive, we  discovered a tiny kitten \nhiding out  on  top of the  suspension unit  of the  motorhome. \nI’m  not  sure how he’d survived the journey and  instead of \nnaming him Lucky we  decided on Flucky. I'll let you work that \none  out! It was  nice having a pet again. Fez and Zef were long \ngone and it made it a bit more homely having Flucky around. \nThe focus, though, was  always on  the next race. I qualified \nfastest in  mixed conditions on  the  Saturday at  Rockingham \nand it rained heavily on  the Sunday morning but by the time \nwe  lined up  on  the  grid —  me  on  pole, Leon second and \nChaz on  the  outside of the  front row  in  fourth —  the  track \nhad started to dry. I doubt any of us  were thinking about the \nchampionship at the time, we just wanted to beat each other. \nThe three of us  took off at the front and after the first lap we  © \nwere almost 2 seconds clear of the  rest  of the  pack. On  the \nsecond lap Leon crashed, meaning that all I had to do to win \nthe championship was  finish second. Of course, second place \n\ndidn’t \ninterest \nme  \nso  \nI \nbattled \nwith \nChaz, \nswapping \nplaces \non \nevery \nlap. \nWith four laps to go Chaz lost control and went down right \nin \nfront \nof \nme. \nI \nhad \nnowhere \nto \ngo \nbut \nstraight \nover \nthe \ntop \nof \nhis \nbike. \nThe \nrace \nwas \nover \nfor \nboth \nof \nus \nand \nrealistically \nmy championship chances also, as  Leon was  planning to race \nin \nthe \nfinal \nround \nat \nDonington \nwhile \nI \nwas \nflying \nback \nto \nAustralia \nfor \nmy \nsecond \nwildcard \nride \nwith \nAlberto, \nthis \ntime \nat Phillip Island. While we  were away Leon won the title  by \njust three points after a fourth-place finish in that last race  and \nI was really happy for him as  he was my mate. \nImost two  years after leaving Australia following the \nPee ais by the AJRRA I was  back in October 2001 \nto race a road bike for the first time in my home country, all \nthanks to the goodwill of a Spanish team. I know I said I don’t \nreally look forward or  back but  this  was  a big moment for \nMum, Dad and  me  because despite the best efforts of some \nto hinder my progression in racing, we  didn’t back down and \nthey hadn’t stopped us. \nOne of the most memorable moments of this trip back to \nAustralia was  the  chance to  meet one  of my all-time heroes, \nPeter Brock. Peter was  a motor-racing legend, one of Australia’s \nSy LUNG ae Sele SN SS ial ect \n\nCASEY STONER \nbest-known and most-loved V8 drivers. His achievements are \ntoo  many to  list here but he has  to  be considered the  most \nsuccessful driver in Australia’s motor-racing history. Peter \ncame up to me  in the pits to introduce himself and say hello \nand  ended up  spending heaps of time chatting to  me  and \nDad. It gave me  a real boost to have someone like  him  take \nan  interest in me  and give encouragement to a young bloke \njust starting out. \nAnother man who I didn’t know until this  trip, and who \nwould go on  to become a major force in our  lives, was  James \nStrong. At  the  time he  was Chief Executive of Qantas. \nJames had  started out  as  a  lawyer and  had  risen to  the  top \nof the Australian business world. He  made his mark in many \nsuccessful businesses but  as  successful and  connected as  he \nwas  he never judged anyone on  their job or  appearance. He \nwas  the most unpretentious, kind man and he would become \na  mentor and  adviser to  both me  and  Dad. He  guided Dad \non  many business decisions and  helped us  both deal with \nthe  complexities and  stresses that come with professional \nmotor racing and sponsorship deals. That race  at Phillip Island \ngave me  much more than just a competitive event, it helped \nintroduce me  to a lifelong friend. \n\nhe Phillip Island track is in a beautiful spot but  on  the \nples the layout wasn’t much fun because you were flat \nout  everywhere. The  key was  to have trust in the  middle of \nthe  corner, open the throttle and hope you were in the  right \nspot. Actually finding the right spot takes a bit of experience \nand  of course I had never been there before, unlike most of \nthe guys I would be racing. \nWe were on the back foot from the start of the weekend. The \nchatter problems we’d suffered at Donington were particularly \nbad in the long corners. Dad worked out that the wheels were \nthe  source of the  problem and  once we  changed them we \ndropped our  lap times by almost 2 seconds. Unfortunately, \nwe  only had  one  set  so  I had  to  qualify on  whatever was  on \nthe wheels at the time, finishing up nineteenth on  the grid. \nMy start wasn’t bad but I made a few mistakes in the early \nlaps, trying to  rush things too  much, and  even though I felt \nlike  I could have stayed with the  front group of nine or  ten \nriders a gap appeared and once it was  there I couldn’t close it \ndown. They never got too far ahead but it was  too late and my \nopportunity was  gone. I still ended up battling in the second \ngroup with some experienced guys I’d only seen on  TV, such \nas  Gino Borsoi and Nobby Ueda. \nThey were passing each other in every corner and it was \nsomething I wasn’t used to because in the Spanish and British \nchampionships I would be fighting one  or two guys maximum, \nbut  now  there was  a whole bunch of competitive guys on \ngood machinery ready to put up a fight. N obby’s and Gino’s \nSa hVNG WS ee IN SS fed \n\n100 \nGASEY \"STONER \nexperience showed in the end and they positioned themselves \nwell for the last lap, keeping me  behind them in twelfth place, \n17 seconds behind the winner, Youichi Ui. \nI know most people would think racing in my home Grand \nPrix  at fifteen years of age must have been a hugely exciting \nexperience for me  but that wasn’t the case. I had a job to do \nand there was a lot of pressure to get a result if I wanted to \nsecure a  ride  for 2002. There wasn’t really any time for me \nto enjoy myself because there was  so  much at stake and the \nsacrifices we had already made had become my biggest source \nof motivation. Living in  a  caravan on  the  north-west coast \nof England in the  middle of winter, 20,000 kilometres from \nhome was  hard enough, but  even harder was  the  prospect \nthat it could all be for nothing. I was  never there to be a part \nof the process or to enjoy the experience. I was  there to make \nsomething out of every opportunity because I was  never sure \nif it would be my last  one. That fear  of not  being offered a \nride  for the  following season was  a constant driving force in \nthose early days. \nNowadays I see too many kids coming through behaving too \nrelaxed, and too happy with what they have achieved already. I \ndon’t \nwant \nthem \nto \nbe \nmiserable \nbut \nthey \nhave \nto \nunderstand \nwhat's \nat \nstake. \nLike \nanybody \nelse \nin \nany \nother \njob \nyou’ve \ngot \nto be serious about it; you  can’t go out  and party every night \nand \nturn \nup \nfor \nwork \nand \nexpect \nto \ndo \nyour \njob \nright. \nIt \njust \ndoesn’t \nhappen. \nRacing \nis \nthe \nsame \nbut \nunfortunately \na \nlot \nof \nkids \nturn \nup,  \nthink \nthey \ncan  \nride \non  \ntalent \nalone \nand \nif \nit \n\nhappens \nit \nhappens. \nIf \nit \ndoesn’t \nthey \ngo \nhome \nwith \ntheir \ntail \nbetween \ntheir \nlegs \nand \nthey \nthink \nnothing \nmore \nof \nit. \nIt \ndoesn’t \nseem \nto \nmatter \nto \nthem. \nIt \nmattered \nto \nme! \nFrom a technical point of view one  of the  main areas in \nwhich I felt I was  lacking compared with the  European kids \nwas  trailing the front brakes into  the corners, which loads the \nfront tyre and gives better grip and stability. It’s  a technique \nthey were able to master from a much earlier stage than me \nbecause I came from dirt-track where you mainly use  the rear \nbrake, while they came through minibikes, where you use a lot \nof front. I had experimented with this as  a kid but I just wasn’t \nused to pushing the front tyre hard or  at an  angle and it took \nme  a long time to get good at it —  well into my MotoGP career. \nMy strength was  in  the  way I could adapt to  different \ncircumstances: different bikes, tracks, tyres and weather \nconditions, which was all thanks to  my background in  dirt- \ntrack. I had spent hundreds of hours riding every different kind \nof surface imaginable — dirt tracks, oil tracks, speedway and \nbitumen — feet up, feet down, knee down and sideways. Almost \nevery single minute of that  time had  been spent practising \n‘the right way’, as  Mum always insisted. In comparison with \nthe guys  I was  now  racing against I found myself equipped to \nride around problems in a way that they couldn't. I could take \na bike another kid couldn’t ride  and make it work. \nThe final round of the  Spanish Championship was  held \nat Jerez at the  end  of November. I was  sixteen. The  World \nChampionship had finished by then so  a bunch of the  Grand \nSell AE a eS Sa INI ts (alte) \n\n102 \nCASEY 2S]50N Ee \nPrix boys came down and entered, as well as Andrea Dovizioso, \nwho was  European Champion, but I bolted and won  by about \n15  seconds. Rodriguez had  already secured the  title in the \nprevious round at Valencia but my win gave me  second in the \nchampionship. \nIt was  good to prove to people like Alberto Puig that their \nfaith in  me  had  been worth it.  Alberto recalls: ‘He  came \nto  Spain and  he was super fast  initially, he was  just lacking \nexperience. We  gave him a good bike and put him on  a good \npackage there. In the end we  could not win the title because \nwe  had  some problems in some races but he was  the fastest \nrider out there, for sure. I remember after that year I went one \nday to Carmelo [Ezpeleta, CEO of Dorna] and said, “Listen, \nthis guy is super good in my opinion and after this year racing \nin  Spain with a  125cc Honda you  must, you  must, help him \nto go to  MotoGP.” \nFriends like Alberto were gold. It all comes back to the ‘we’ \nI refer to.  If 1 was  going to have any chance of becoming 500cc \nMotoGP Champion I needed help to get there. \n\nCoAr ren S \nTHE HARD ROAD \nhe next step in chasing the dream of racing in the 500cc \nWorld Championship was  a big jump. With Alberto’s \nhelp I was offered a  place in  Lucio Cecchinello’s newly \nformed 250cc team, riding a  semi-factory Aprilia, alongside \nDavid Checa, younger brother of the more well known Carlos. \nIt was a good ride but a big ask for a sixteen-year-old rookie \nto  race a  250cc two-stroke Grand Prix prototype only two \nyears after first road racing laps on  an  80cc Moriwaki around \na go-kart track. It was  definitely pushing my limits but I was \njust one  step away from the 500cc World Championship (by \nnow  rebranded as  MotoGP and  opened up  to  900cc four- \nstrokes) so I sure  wasn’t complaining. Most rookies make their \nentrance to world competition on  a 125cc, but we  didn’t have \n103 \n\n104 \nGABEY STeNee \nthat opportunity available so of course we were going to accept \nthe offer that meant I was  able to race. \nUnfortunately my  favourite number, 66,  was again \nalready taken, this time by the German rider Alex Hofmann, \nso  we  decided to  stick with my  number from the  Spanish \nChampionship, 27.  That same year in the  125cc class Joan \nOlivé would be running number 25 and Dani Pedrosa number \n26,  so  having the  number 27  on  the  front of my bike was a \nsubtle but nice way to  maintain my association with Alberto \nand his team of riders and show my respect for him. \nAlberto’s involvement didn’t stop at helping us  find a team \nand  it was  through him that we  also received an  offer of \nsponsorship from Nolan helmets. Of course we  already had \na relationship with Lloyds that was  very important to us  and \nthey had  wanted to  make the  step up  to  GPs together to \npromote the  OGK brand that  we’d been supporting in the \nBritish and Spanish Championships. We really didn’t want to \nleave Lloyds behind but the amount of travel we  had in front \nof us  meant that Dad couldn't really do other work anymore. \nWe  needed every penny we  could get and  Lloyds couldn't \nmatch the  offer from Nolan and  Nolan were prepared to \ntake a big risk on a rider they knew little about. It was  a hard \ndecision but one  we  had to make. \nLucio agreed to  cover costs for our  flights to  the  races \noutside Europe and  some other expenses, but we  still  had \nfuel, \ntolls \nand \nday-to-day \nliving \nto \npay \nfor \nso \nthe \ndeal \nwith \nNolan was  very important. It worked out at about €35,000 for \n\nthe season and with a little extra cash from gear-maker Spidi \nfor my leathers, which was paid to  Lucio first, it meant we \ncould just about cover our expenses for the year. Our existing \nmotorhome didn’t have the legs to cover the distances needed \nfor another year but thankfully Spidi offered to lend us  one  of \ntheirs, which had also seen plenty of miles but at least it had \na bit of life left in the engine (we hoped). \nWe'd spent the  European winter back in Australia. Mum \nand  Dad had  bought a  mobile home that  was  based in  a \ncaravan park near  Anna Bay, on  the mid-north coast of New \nSouth Wales, so  we  had  somewhere to  stay when we  came \nhome. It is a beautiful area  that has some really good fishing \nso was  a great place to unwind but getting organised for the \nnext  season was  always a challenge in a different time zone. \nIt meant many early-morning phone calls. In early 2002 Dad \nand  I flew back to  Europe to finalise our  arrangements and \ncomplete some pre-season testing on  the  250cc before we \njumped \non \na \nflight \nto \nJapan \nfor \nthe \nfirst \nrace \nof \nthe \nseason \nat \nSuzuka. \nWe \nmet \nup \nwith \nChaz \nDavies \nand \nhis \ndad, \nPete, \nat \na \nconnecting \nairport. \nChaz \nwas \nalso \nmaking \nhis \nGrand \nPrix \ndebut \nthat \nseason \nwith \none \nof \nthe \nsmaller \nItalian \nteams \nin \nthe \n125cc \nclass \nand \nI \nremember \nboarding \nthe \nplane \ntogether \nand \ncomparing \nour \nnew \nhelmet \ndesigns. \nWe \nwere \nboth \nlooking \nforward \nto \nthe \nweekend \nahead. \nArriving \nin \nJapan \nwas  \ndefinitely \na \nstrange \nexperience \nfor \na \ncountry \nkid \nlike \nme. \nIt \nwas \nvery \ndifferent \nfrom \nthe \nbeaches \naround \nAnna \nBay \nand \nthe \ncasual \nAustralian \nlifestyle \nwe  \nwere \n105 \nSLIAN VI Sel. ONIAS fie \n\n106 \nCASEY =SEON ER \nused to.  The  challenge of riding the  250  at  a  completely \nnew circuit didn’t scare me  but  it was definitely a  huge \nlearning curve. I qualified fifteenth, one  place ahead of \nmy  new teammate David Checa, which I wasn’t pleased \nwith. I expected better of myself. Up until this point I’d been \nmore often at the  front of whatever category I had  raced in \nand  so  I found it hard to  accept I wasn’t doing the  same in \nthe 250cc. \nThings got worse on  race  day when it absolutely poured \ndown with rain. As we  sat on  the start line, the standing water \non  the track continued to increase, which created an  instant \nwall  of spray that  I was  right in the  middle of as  we  headed \ntowards the  tight right-hander at  turn one. I could barely \nmake out  where I was going, let  alone how the  bike was \nfeeling, but after surviving the chaos of the first corner I tried \nto  find some space for myself on  the  run  down to  turn two, \na  tricky left-hander that  tightens into a  chicane. As  I lifted \nmy head up from behind the fairing and grabbed the brakes, \nsomeone moved across in front of me  and I clipped their back \nwheel and went down. It’s  a harsh reality that  in Grand Prix \nyou can  fly halfway around the world for a race  and it can  be \nall over within two  corners. \nMy second 250cc race  was  on  the other side  of the world \nin  South Africa and  it didn’t last  much longer. This time I \nqualified much better, lining up on  the outside of the second \nrow  in eighth place, only half a second off a front row  start. \nJust like  when I'd  made my wildcard appearance at  Phillip \n\nIsland, \nI \nknew \nI \nhad \nthe \nchance \nto \nrun \nwith \nthe \nfront \nguys \nand \nI \nwas  \ndetermined \nnot \nto \nlet \nthem \nget \naway \nat \nthe \nstart \nand \nthen \nspend \nall \nrace \nstruggling \nto \ncatch \nup. \nThis time I was  aggressive as  soon as  the lights went out. \nThe \nentire \nfront \nrow \nahead \nof \nme \nmoved \nto \nthe \nright \nto \ntake \na \nposition \non \nthe \noutside \nof \nthe \ntrack \nfor \nthe \nleft-hand \nsweep \ninto turn one  and  the  way  was  cleared for  me  to  hold my \nposition on  the inside, pass six guys and hit the apex in second \nplace, right on  the rear wheel of the championship favourite, \nMarco Melandri. \nI knew that Marco was  on  a hard tyre but  as  he pushed \nhis factory machine in the early stages I was  able to hang on, \nmatching him corner for corner until we  crossed the line at the \nend of the first lap with just over a tenth of a second between \nus.  Chasing hard behind us were a trio of experienced Italians \n—  former 125cc World Champion Roberto Locatelli, Roberto \nRolfo and  Franco Battaini. The  harder I chased Marco the \nmore I ran  wide and the more he edged ahead. By the end of \nthe second lap he had increased his advantage to half a second. \nI decided to  stop focusing on  Marco and  concentrate on \nusing my own  braking markers, which had worked well  for \nme  in qualifying. What I didn’t allow for was  that with a full \ntank of fuel the  bike weighed around ten  kilos more than \nit had done in  qualifying, so  all  my  reference points were \neffectively no good. It was  only a matter of time before things \nwent wrong. As I went through the fast left over a slight crest \nat turn three the bike became unsettled by a bump and as  I \n107 \nSL Lb Sa Saas leet \n\n108 \nCASEY “STONER \nbraked hard for the tight right-hander at turn four the  extra \nload on the front made the suspension bottom out, the jolting \nimpact causing the rear  wheel to lift slightly off the ground. \nWith the  bike already at an  angle the  rear moved to  one \nside, the rubber bit hard on  the tarmac as  it came back down \nand  drove even more force through the  flexing chassis and \nsuspension. When I grabbed the  brakes again, trying not  to \nplough straight into Melandri as he tipped into the  corner \nahead of me,  the rear tyre flicked from one  edge to the other \nand the bike loaded up and bucked before launching me  into \nthe air. It was  a big crash but I think it looked more spectacular \nthan what it was  and  at  least I knew why it had  happened. \nDespite how dramatic it looked, I only ended up with a scratch \non  my chin. \nCrashes only ever scare me  when I don’t understand what \nhappened. If I made a mistake and  I knew what it was  then \nI just made sure I didn’t do it again. I might have been a bit \nmore hesitant but I never let fear get the better of me.  I guess \nthat’s why I continued to take risks because even if something \nwasn't right with the bike I would still push it. To become a \nchampion you  have to.  Over the years this  approach meant \nthat I picked up  a few bruises but  I also  learnt a  lot about \nriding a bike when it wasn’t perfect. The biggest lesson I learnt \nwas  not to be proud and blame the machine. You have to look \nat yourself and if you make a mistake hold your hands up and \nadmit it, especially to  yourself. You  will  never improve as  a \nracer if you are  constantly blaming the bike. \n\nAfter \nthe  \nrace, \nwe  \nflew \nback \nto  \nBarcelona \nto  \nmeet \nMum, \nwho'd \narrived \nfrom \nAustralia, \nand  \npicked \nup  \nthe  \nnew \n(old) \nmotorhome, \nready \nfor \nthe \nstart \nof \nthe \nEuropean \nseason. \nI \nwas \nfeeling \na \nlittle \nfrustrated \nabout \nthe \nprevious \ncouple \nof \nraces \nbut \nhappy \nthat \nI \nhad \nlearnt \nsome \nvaluable \nlessons \nalready. \nSince \nwe \ndidn’t \nhave \na \npermanent \nhome \nin \nbetween \nraces \nAlberto \ngenerously \norganised \nwith \nhis \nfather \nfor \nus \nto \npark \nthe \nmotorhome \nat \nthe \nPuig \nfamily \nhome. \nThis \nwas \na \nbeautiful \nproperty \nwith \na \nlot \nof \nland \non \nthe \noutskirts \nof \na \ntown \ncalled \nCardedeu, \nnorth-east \nof \nBarcelona. \nAfter \nso \nmuch \ntravelling \nit \nis \nalways \nnice \nto \nhave \nsomewhere \nto \ngo \nwith \nsome \nroom \nto \nrelax. \nThe \nPuigs \nhad \na \nmotocross \nbike \nthat \nI \ncould \nuse \nand \nI \nquickly \nset \nup \nmy \nown \nlittle \ntrack \non \ntheir \nland. \n| \nAlberto Puig’s father is a very kind man. Not  only did he \nallow us to camp at his place, he also found us  an old car to buy \nso that we  could drive to the supermarket or take a day trip to \nthe beach. The small things like that really helped us  through \nand we'll always be extremely grateful to the Puig family, not \njust for the belief Alberto showed in me  as  a young rider but \nfor the whole family’s generosity away from the races. \nOur ‘new home was  a big American motorhome that Spidi \nhad previously used as  a service vehicle. With Mum, Dad and \nme  in there along with everything we  owned it felt pretty snug, \nlet me  tell you. It can  be a real challenge both travelling and \nliving in the confines of a motorhome. It is a small space with \nkitchen, dining, seating and sleeping all almost on  top of each \nother. During the European summer it would get incredibly \n109 \nSL LN) “Se SNES Fred \n\n110 \nCASEY STONER \nhot inside and  the  air-conditioning didn’t always work. One \nnight at Mugello in Italy it was  at least 35 degrees and it was \nlike  an  oven. When we  were travelling we  had to sleep with \nall the windows closed and  the home locked up tight so  we \ndidn’t get robbed. \nOne  night we  were stopped at  a  service station in  a big \narea  used as  an  overnight stop by caravans and motorhomes. \nThieves target places like  this  and  use  gas  to  make sure \neveryone inside is unconscious before they break in. The one \ntime it happened to  us  they couldn't get inside because we \nwere locked up like  Fort Knox. The owners of three other \nvans  parked near  us  weren't so  lucky. While they lost money \nand passports all we  had to deal with was  a bit of a headache \n(though Mum thought it was  the  best sleep she’d had  in \nages!) and a stolen battery-powered scooter from the enclosed \ntrailer. \nThe motorhome did  the job, most of the  time, but  not \nwithout a  few  dramas along the  way. The first  was  on  the \ntrip driving from Spain to  Italy for the  third round of the \nchampionship after a race at Jerez. \nDad remembers it well: ‘It’s  a bloody long way from Jerez \nto Mugello, over 2000 kilometres, with some pretty hairy roads \nalong the way. I was  coming down the side  of this  mountain \npass when the  electrics went. Suddenly I had  no  lights or \nbrakes. I didn’t even have gears because it was  automatic. In \nAustralia it wouldn’t have been a problem because all the big \nvehicles like that have air tanks and if the air supply stops the \n\nbrakes \nlock \nup.  \nThe \nAmerican \nsystem \nis \npower \nassisted, \nlike \na \ncar; \nif \nyou \ntry \nto \nroll \ndownhill \nwithout \nthe \nengine \nrunning \nand \nput \nthe \nbrakes \non \nyou \nget \nsomething \nbut \nit’s \nnot \nmuch. \nSo \nthere \nI \nwas, \nstanding \non \nthe \nbrakes, \narms \nwrapped \naround \nthe \nsteering \nwheel \nand \nshouting \nout \nto \npoor \nBronwyn \nand \nCasey, \nwho \nwere \nfast \nasleep. \nThey \ngot \nthe \nfright \nof \ntheir \nlives \nwhen \nthey \nwoke \nup. \nThankfully \nwe \ngot \nthe \nthing \nstopped \nbut \nit \nwas \nscary \nas \nhell.’ \nWe got it going again but it stopped again on the motorway. \nWe had to call the police to help us  tow it out of the way. \nDad stayed up  late  fixing it and  finally we  set  off again. \nHe  drove all night and  he had a lot of cans of Red Bull to \nkeep him  going. We  got to  Mugello in time for the Tuesday \nmorning test  but it rained and so  it was  cancelled. That was \ntypical of Grand Prix, it was  a hard slog just to give yourself a \nchance of racing. \nOur dramas on  the  road were nothing compared to  the \ntrouble I was  about to have on the track with the Aprilia. After \na  fairly good weekend at Jerez, where I finished sixth after \nqualifying seventh, I had back-to-back crashes at Le Mans and \nMugello and for the first time in my life doubt crept into my 3 \nmind. I had a really experienced crew chief, Massimo Biagini, \nwho'd worked with many top riders in the past and so when he \ntold me  what he thought I was  doing wrong I listened. \nI'd already worked out  that  I wasn’t like any rider Biagini \nhad worked with before. Perhaps because of my dirt-track \ndays, my skill  set was  different to European riders and I was \n111 \nSL PUN) SS SNES ile \n\nCASE yea One me \nvery  sensitive to what was  going on  with the  bike  beneath \nme.  For an  engineer, like Massimo, whose relationship with a \nmotorcycle is through a laptop computer, this can  be a difficult \nconcept to accept. Often the data would tell him one thing but \nI was  telling him  something else and sometimes people with \na mind for science tend to rely on  the numbers rather than a \nrider's instinct. \nBeing in a  team means trusting each other and  listening \nbut  that  is a two-way street as  far as  I am  concerned and  I \nbecame frustrated that Massimo didn’t seem to  listen to what \nI had  to  say.  The worst thing was  that often the  numbers \nweren't right and we’d go from one  race to  the  next with a \ncompletely different setting. I would come in saying the bike \nfelt completely unlike the previous week and Massimo would \nbe insisting it was  the same. \nNo  matter how strong my  self-belief was, as  a  rookie I \ncouldn’t help but question myself because someone with more \nexperience was  telling me  I was  wrong. Throughout my whole \ncareer I had been able  to adapt to pretty much anything but \nI couldn't get the hang of this bike. It put me  in a bad frame \nof mind, thinking I was  never going to  make it so  there was \nno  point in continuing. Coming into  Grand Prix I guess I had \nthis idea that everybody knew what they were doing. I had an \nexperienced chief mechanic so I assumed things were going to \nmove forward quickly for me.  For a lot of that season I blamed \nmyself that things weren’t turning out.  I couldn’t understand \nwhy I didn’t have speed, why I wasn’t comfortable on the bike. \n\nThe \nteam \nwere \nsupportive \nbut \nhaving \nmy \ninstincts \ndisregarded \ncaused \nme \nto \nquestion \nmy \nabilities \nand \ncould \nvery \nnearly \nhave \nruined \nmy \ncareer. \nDad \ncould \nsee  \nI \nwas  \nstruggling: \n‘The \nlast \nround \nof \nthe \nyear \nwas  \nat \nValencia \nand \nCasey \nhad \nanother \nterrible \nresult, \nfinishing \nthirteenth. \nBut  \non  \nthe  \nFriday \nmoming \nhe’d \nset  \na  \nnew \nlap \nrecord \nand \nwas \nheaps \nquicker \nthan \nMelandri. \nI \nknew \nI \nhad \nto \ndo \nsomething \nso \nI \nlaid \nout \nall \nthe \ntime \nsheets \nfrom \nevery \nsession \nthat \nseason \non \na \ntable. \nI \ngot \nCasey \nto \ncome \nover \nand \nsit \ndown \nand \ncount \neverything \nup. \nIt \nwas \nridiculous. \nAt \nthe \nmajority \nof \nraces \nhe’d \nfinished \nat \nleast \none \nsession \nin \nthe \ntop \ntwo \nor \nthree \n— \nall \naround \nthe \nworld, \nat \ncircuits \nhe had \nnever \nbeen \nto \nbefore. \nI \nsaid, \n“Mate, \njust \nkeep \ndoing \nwhat \nyou’re \ndoing \nand \none \nday \nthis \nis \nall \ngoing \nto \ntranslate \ninto \nwins. \nIt’s \njust \nexperience! \nYou're \ngoing \nto \nblow \nall \nof \nthese \nguys \ninto \nthe \nweeds.” \nHe \nwas \nready \nto \npack \nit \nall \nin \nright \nthere \nand \nthen. \nIt’s \nvery \nhard \nto \nget \na \nkid \nthrough \nthat, \nto \nkeep \ntheir \nmotivation \nup \nwhen \nthey're \nnot \ngetting \nresults. \nUnless \nthe \nkid \nbecomes \ncomplacent. \nThen \nit’s \neasy \nbecause \nthey \ndon’t \ncare. \nThey're \nhappy \njust \nswanning \naround \nthe \nGrand \nPrix \npaddock. \nKids \nlike \nthat \nlast \na \ncouple \nof \nyears \nand \nthen \nthey \ndisappear. \nI’ve \nseen \nthem \nall \ncome \nand \ngo, \nin \ntheir \nbig \nsunglasses, \nwith \ntheir \nspiky \nhair \nand \nall \nthe \ngear. \nThey \nmight \nbe thinking, \nWell \nI’m \nstruggling \nbut \nat \nleast \nI’m \nhere, \nI’m \na \nGrand \nPrix \nrider! \nThey \nmove \non \nand \nthe \nnext \ncrop \nof \nkids \ncome \nthrough \nand \nthe \nsame \nthing \nhappens \nagain. \nThen \nyou'll \nget \na \nspecial \nkid \nwho \ncomes \nthrough \nand \nhe'll \nstay.’ \n| \n113 \nSlt NW Saale SNL ES: Al a \n\n114 \nCASEY TS TONEr \nI wanted to be a stayer but for the first time I wasn’t sure \nI could. \no  matter how  bad  things were for me  that year, they \nN were even worse for Chaz. The  owner of the team he \nwas with hadn’t really wanted him from the  start, which set \nhim  up  in an  impossible situation. Chaz was  growing into  a \ntall kid and was  already at a disadvantage on  the smaller bike \nlet alone getting screwed over  by his team, which happened a \nlot because they didn’t want to ‘waste’ any of their resources \non  him. Even though we  tried to  support each other it was \ndifficult because we were both under pressure, a lot of it from \nthe people who had given us these opportunities and couldn't \nunderstand why we  didn’t seem to  be making the  most of \nthem. I think both of us  would have been able to  show our \npotential much sooner had we  been in fully supportive teams \nfrom the outset. \nChaz Davies: ‘It was  tough ...  I remember a lot of times \nColin looking around and saying to my dad, “It’s bloody hard \nhere, this place is hard!” But there were a lot more expletives \nthan that!  We did quite a lot together in those first few years \nbecause, as  I said before, it’s  not  cheap to  travel around the \nworld and you do what you can  to save  money. We ended up \n\nstaying together, travelling together quite a lot and sharing a \nlot of experiences. It was  a tough time but  I’ve  also  got a lot \nof good memories of being together with my dad, Colin and \nCasey back then.’ \nWe  did  have some great times, though others may not \nhave appreciated some of what we  got up to. At the European \ntracks everyone uses  motorised scooters to get around. At one \nparticular track we  could see  people parking their scooters \n-   outside the toilets so  Chaz and I decided to play a prank that \nwe'd picked up from a few of the older GP riders. While the \nscooter owners were inside Chaz and I gaffer-taped the horn \nbutton of their bikes so  the horn stayed on.  They'd come out \nof the amenities block, put the key in the ignition and start the \nengine. As  soon as  they did, the horn would start screeching \nso  they’d turn it off,  then try again. It would take them a \nwhile to work out  what was  going on.  We  were out  of sight, \nwatching. We thought it was  hilarious but it was  one  of those \njokes that you can  only play once or twice before word spread \nto watch out. \nThere were other fun  moments but  the  bottom line  was \nthat we  were there to  race. It was a  steep learning curve, \nmaybe too  steep, but  perhaps if it hadn’t been that way I \nwouldn't have had  the  opportunity to  get on  a competitive \n125cc in 2003. Despite all my problems with Massimo Biagini \nthat season, Lucio Cecchinello and I had a good relationship. \nHe was  always supportive throughout the season despite my \nresults not  being as  good as  I’d have liked and he  proved \n115 \nSL WN Saas SIN Ss eel \n\n116 \nCASE YS} @OMeER \nthis with an  offer to be his teammate in the smaller class for \nmy second year. He  confirmed we’d have a  different crew \nchief, Massimo Branchini, and a new data engineer, Cristian \nGabbarini, who by pure coincidence would later become \nmy crew chief at Ducati. Otherwise it was  largely the  same \nteam, including Chris Richardson, a mechanic from Northern \nIreland who I trusted a lot and who became a firm friend. \nCristian Gabbarini: ‘My job was  to  do data analysis with \nCasey in  125cc and analysis has  no  feelings, just numbers. \nThe numbers said from the  beginning he was really fast, he \nknows how to ride the bike really well, he knows where to put \nthe tyres, but he was a little bit lost. It was  his second year in \nGrand Prix but his first year in 125cc so it was  something new \nagain, but he was  really sure of himself. He had a steel heart. \nIf he believed in something he really pushed hard.’ \nThe last 125cc I had ridden was  a kit Honda in the Spanish \nChampionship so  the  Aprilia was  a  lot different and  it was \ndifficult to get used to at the start of the season after losing some \nof my confidence on  the 250cc. The  main positive was  that  I \ncould talk to my crew chief and he’d listen to what I had to say. \nHe was  gentle and quiet and very good to work with. Branchini \nspent a lot of time with me  and because of him  I started to \nlearn how to communicate properly with a team of mechanics. \nI learnt what they needed to  know in  terms of what was \nwrong with the  bike, where I needed it to  be  better. My \nability to do that all started from him. I think it was  mainly a \nconfidence thing and he listened to me  because he wanted to \n\nknow, whereas Massimo Biagini never wanted to know what I \nthought or didn’t care. It made such a difference being asked \nthe right questions and that got me  working in the right way. \nI was still  young, I needed to  learn and  he was the  perfect \nperson for me  to learn from. \nI also picked up a lot from Lucio, who took me  under his \nwing and helped me  out at many different circuits when I was \nstruggling. Because we  were on  the  same bike, Lucio would \ncome out  with me  for  a  few laps and  show me  around the \ntrack, so  I could understand where I was  losing time. He also \ntaught me  how to read telemetry (a data-gathering computer \nsystem that shows you where you are  fast or slow compared to \nother riders), which in turn helped me  to understand exactly \nwhat was  happening out  on  the  track. Things were looking \nup,  or  so  I thought. \nSE LYNG ae ee SN aS et \n\n\n\nCHAr TER 7 \nA DIFFERENT TRACK \n4 N Jith  the  help of Lucio and  Massimo Branchini any \ndoubts about my  ability that had  started to  niggle \nduring the previous season disappeared and I could definitely \nsee  I was making progress as  a  rider. We  still  had some \nsetbacks but  I was  now  mixing it regularly with a  talented \ngroup of riders at  the  front of the pack, including four guys \nwho would continue to be huge rivals for the rest of my career: \nDani Pedrosa, Jorge Lorenzo, Andrea Dovizioso and Marco \nSimoncelli. When you  look at  that list  of names it’s  pretty \namazing. The  five  of us  were in there together right the way \nthrough our  careers and if it wasn’t for Marco’s tragic death \nin  2011 we  would have almost certainly been the  top  five \nchampionship finishers in MotoGP in 2011 and 2012. In my \n119 \n\nCASEY STOQGNER \nopinion we  came through the toughest era  in modern times \nbecause we  were so  competitive. \nHector Barbera was  another strong young rider competing \nwith us,  as  were Alvaro Bautista and Alex De  Angelis, \nalthough for one  reason or  another they never managed to \nfulfil the potential they showed at the time. There were also \nexperienced guys like Stefano Perugini, Roberto Locatelli \nand  Steve Jenkner who also  made life hard on  the track that \nseason. \nThere was  some tough racing and  at  times I lost  out  in \nthe  frenzy of ten  guys going for the  same piece of track on \nthe final lap. Jorge Lorenzo, in particular, was  unpredictable \nto  ride against in  the  early days and  I wasn’t a  fan  of his \nback then. There was no  doubt he was fast  but, by his  own \nadmission, he was  extremely arrogant and a very cocky young \nkid.  He’d tell  you  himself he thought too  much of himself \nand his antics on  the bike were often verging on  dangerous. \nDe  Angelis, or  ‘Alex Dangerous’ as  Chaz and I used to  call \nhim, was another unpredictable rider, although his  tactics \nwere often more intentional. He’d already shown me  one  of \nthem at Donington. \nThe 2003 season started out  with a crash at  Suzuka but \nafter taking some points in the next three rounds, including a \nfourth place at Le  Mans, we  gradually established ourselves \nas  a podium threat and  in  the  fifth round of the  season at \nMugello I set  my first pole position, only to get taken out  in \nthe final lap of the race by Steve Jenkner. After crashing out \n\nof \nthe \nlead \ngroup \nagain \nat \nBarcelona \nI \nwas  \nchasing \nJenkner \nfor \nthe \nwin \nin \nwet \nconditions \nat \nAssen \nbut \nDovi’s \nbike \nmissed \na \ngear \nand \nI \nhit \nhis \nback \nwheel \nand \nended \nup \nin \nthe \ngravel \ntrap. \nI \nhad \nto \nlay \nthe \nbike \ndown \nbefore \nI \nhit \na \nwall. \n(That \ncrash \nwould \naffect \nmore \nthan \none  \nrace; \nthe \nback \ninjury \nI \nsustained \nwould \ngo \non \nto \nplague \nmy \ncareer.) \nIt \nwas \nfrustrating \nbecause \nI \nknew \nI \nhad \nthe \npotential \nto \nhave \nbeen \non \nthe \npodium \nin \neach \nof \nthose \nraces \nbut \nthe \nmost \nimportant \nthing \nwas \nthat \nwith \nBranchini’s \nhelp \nI \nwas \nable \nto \nunderstand \nthe \ncrashes \nand \nturn \nthose \nnegative \nexperiences \ninto \na \npositive \nby \nlearning \nfrom \nthem. \nAt \nSachsenring \nin \nGermany \nit \nall \nfinally \npaid \noff \nand \nI \nscored \nmy \nfirst \nGrand \nPrix \npodium \nwith \na \nsecond \nplace \nafter \nfighting \nfor \nthe \nwin \nuntil \nthe \nlast \ncorner \nwith \nPerugini \nand \nDe \nAngelis. \nI \nprobably \nhad \nthe \nspeed \nto \nwin \nthat \nrace \nbut \none \npart \nof \nthe \ntrack \nwas \nletting \nme \ndown. \nSachsenring \nis \na \ntight \ncircuit \nbut \nit \nhas \nsome \nfast \nsections \non \na \n125 \nand \nI \nwasn’t \nriding \nthem \nhard \nenough \n— \nI \nwas \ntoo \nnervous. \nAnyway, \nthe \nimportant \nthing \nwas \nthat \nwe \nachieved \na \npodium, \nwhich \nwas \na \nhuge \nrelief. \nThe \nfunniest \nmoment \nin \nall \nthat \nwas \nthe \nway \nMum \nreacted. \nShe’d \nbeen \nwatching \nthe \nrace \non \nthe \ncircuit \ntelevision \nfrom \nour \nmotorhome \n(you \ncould \ntap \ninto \nthe \nsignal \nand \nwatch \nall \nthe \naction \nthat \nwas \nbeing \nscreened \ninto \nthe \npit \nboxes). \nDuring \nthe \nlast \ntwo \nlaps \nshe \ncouldn’t \nstand \nthe \nsuspense \nso \nshe \nturned \nher \nback. \nChaz’s \nparents \nwere \nthere \nand \nshouted \nout, \n‘Casey’s \nsecond, \nhe’s \non \nthe \npodium.’ \nThat \nwas \nit, \nMum \ntook \noff \nin \nher \nheels \nand \nhad \nto \nrun \nacross \nthe \npaddock, \ndown \nsome \nstairs, \nthrough the  tunnel under the  track, back up  more stairs \n121 \nS NUL AL 2S els = SoS heliet \n\n122 \nCASEY Sv ONE A \n(discarding the heels because they were slowing her down), \nalong the  back of the  pit boxes, then defy a young security \nguard and try to fight her way to me  through the crowd at parc \nfermé, the secure area where the bikes are  parked post-race. \nShe wasn’t going to  miss my first podium win  in Grand Prix. \nIt had been a long time coming. \nThat good feeling didn’t last  long, unfortunately. In  the \nnext round at  Brno, in  the  Czech Republic, I was  trying a \nnew  experimental chassis for Aprilia (it used to buck so  hard \nwe  called it ‘Chainsaw’ after a famous Australian rodeo bull). \nId finished fourth fastest in the wet  in morning free practice \nand was  running second fastest after six laps of first qualifying \nin the dry when it spat me  off and I hurt myself pretty badly, \nbreaking my collarbone and scaphoid. \nA broken collarbone is a fairly common injury for a racer \nand not  too  serious because they normally heal okay, but the \nscaphoid is bad news, even though it is a tiny little bone, no \nbigger than a  cashew nut. First of all, it is in  an  extremely \nimportant part of the wrist, just below the thumb, where you \nneed a lot  of strength, stability and flexibility. Secondly, it \nhas limited blood circulation to it so  it is a bone that  doesn’t \nheal well and if it is not  fixed quickly and properly it will die. \nTogether with the doctors at the Clinica Mobile (the medical \nclinic that travels with every race) the team organised for us \nto head straight back to  San  Marino for surgery to staple the \nbone back together and my wrist was  fitted with a small cast. \nThe surgeons insisted the  operation had been a  success \n\nbut \nI \nshould \nhave \nknown \n‘something \nwasn't \nright \nbecause \nthe \npain \nafterwards \nwas  \nincredible. \nDad \nhad  \nto  \ngive \nme  \ndaily \ninjections \nof \npain \nrelief \nand  \nthe  \nwrist \nwas  \nbadly \nswollen. \nI \nhad \nthree \nweeks \nto \nrecuperate \nuntil \nthe \nnext \nrace  \nin \nPortugal \nand  \nafter \na \nfitness \ntest  \nthat  \nconsisted \nof \nme  \ndoing \npush-ups \nto \nprove \nI \ncould \nride, \nI \ngot \nout  \non  \nthe \ntrack \nwith \nnothing \nbut \nheavy \nstrapping \non \nthe \nwrist. \nThe collarbone had healed pretty well and the wrist didn’t \nactually hold me  back too  much on  the  bike. In  fact, I was \nthe  fastest rider on  track and sat  in provisional pole position - \nuntil the  engine seized on  me  during qualifying. Normally \nI’m  quick enough to  grab the  clutch before the  rear  wheel \nlocks up  but  because my wrist was  not  100  per  cent and \nstrapped up I couldn’t reach the lever fast enough. The  bike \nthrew me  over the top and my collarbone broke where it had \nbroken before. \nEven though everything still  wasn’t perfectly healed I \nmanaged to get on  the podium two weeks later in Brazil after \na good battle with Lorenzo and De Angelis. I’d tried to lead \non  a few occasions that season and got messed up at the end \nso in this race I took my time and felt I had positioned myself \nperfectly for the  last  lap. I knew I didn’t have the  speed to \nslipstream more than one  person down the long back straight \nthere so  I got myself into second place behind De  Angelis \nand lined him  up.  Unfortunately that  made a big hole in the \nair  for Jorge, who was riding well and  had a  massive power \nadvantage over us  on  the  straights. He  came past both of us \n123 \nSei SAS Na a Sie \n\n124 \nCASEY STONER \nand  I couldn’t get him back in  the  few  corners left. I had \ndone everything I could, so  to not  finish the job off was  really \ndisappointing. \nIt happened again in Japan in  a  race Dani Pedrosa was \nlooking sure Ms win  until he had a problem with his steering \ndamper, which opened it up to the  rest  of us.  I got in a fight \nwith Hector Barbera and I was  faster than him around most of \nthe track but couldn't make anything stick because he was  so \nlate on the brakes. I remember that weekend we were running \na new rear  brake disc  that  had been provided by one  of the \nteam’s sponsors. I like  to  use  a  lot of rear  brake and  during \nwarm-up at Motegi, my bike locked up. I thought it had seized \nbut what had actually happened was  that the disc had got too \nhot, warped and locked the rear wheel. \nThe following weekend we  went to  Malaysia and  I was \nhaving a  good race, coming from eighth on  the  first lap to \nchase Dani for the lead. After about six laps the engine seized \non \nme \ngoing \ninto \nturn \none \nand \nI \nimmediately \nthought, \nThat’s \nmy \nrace \nover. \nI \ngrabbed \nthe \nclutch \nand \nthen \nlet \nit \nout \nto \nsee \nif \nit \nwould \nkeep \ngoing, \nwhich \nluckily \nit \ndid. \nI'd \ndropped \nback \nto \nsixth \nplace \nand \nlost \ncontact \nwith \nthe \nlead \ngroup \nbut \nI \ndecided \nto \ncarry \non \nand \nlook \nout \nfor \nit \nhappening \nagain. \nThe \nbike \nstarted \nrunning \nfaster \nthan \nit \nhad \nall \nweekend, \nwhich \nis \nnormally \na \nsign \nthat \nthe \nengine \nis \nabout \nto \nblow \nup, \nso \nI \nquickly \ncaught \nright \nback \nup \nand \ngave \nmyself \na \ngreat \nchance \nof \nwinning \nthe \nrace. \nOnce \nI \nhad \nriders \nin \nfront \nof \nme \nI \ncouldn’t \nget \non  \nthe  \ngas \nwhere \nI \nwanted \nto  \nand \nhad \nto  \nbe \na \n\nbit \nmore \nsmooth. \nA \nlap \nor \ntwo \nlater \nI \nwas  \nopening \nthe \nthrottle \nnice \nand \ngently \nwhen \nit \nseized \nagain \nand \nthrew \nme  \nover \nthe \ntop. \nI \nbadly \nbruised \nmy \nhands \nand \nthe \nfingers \non  \nmy \nright \nhand \nwere \ncompletely \nblack. \nI \nhad \nto \nrace  \nat \nPhillip \nIsland \nthe \nnext \nweekend \nso \nI \nhad \nto \ntry \nand \nreduce \nthe \nswelling \nas  \nquickly \nas \npossible. \nDad \nhelped \nme \nhold \nmy \nhands \nin \nice \nwater \nstraight \nafter \nthe \ncrash. \nI \ndon’t \nthink \nI \nhave \never \nexperienced \npain \nlike \nthat. \nBut it \nworked! \nAustralia was  next and after qualifying on  the front row  in \nthe dry I was  leading for the first five laps in the wet, with me \nand  Stefano Perugini breaking clear of the  rest  of the  field. \nWith so  many long, fast  corners at  Phillip Island, throttle \ncontrol is key and  I assisted it by using the  rear  brake a lot. \nWe  were still  using the  disc  brake that  had  let me  down in \nMotegi and as  I went into Lukey Heights, the highest point of \nthe Phillip Island circuit at turn nine, the rear locked up and \ncame round on  me  like it had seized again. At first  I thought \nit was  my mistake and  I was  prepared to  cop  it but  as  soon \nas  I picked up the  bike and looked at the brake I realised it \nwasnt. \nAfter Phillip Island, we  went back to Europe for the final \nround of the season at Valencia with a new plan. I’d worked \nout  that spending every lap at the  front didn’t work, playing \ngames behind didn’t work for me  either and  sometimes I'd \nmissed out  on  the  opportunity to  attack. Because Valencia \nwasn't a big slipstreaming circuit we  decided we  had to be at \nthe  front on  the last lap and just try to finish it off.  I went to \n3 01 UN Td? Sree SN ep SG el \n\n126 \nCASEY STONER \nthe front on  the  second lap and even though Simoncelli ran \nwith us  for a while there was  only Hector Barbera who could \nconsistently keep my pace. He  and  I swapped places a  few \ntimes but I managed to make sure I was  in front for the final \nlap, covered our lines and braked extremely late to cancel out \nhis main strength. \nHector’s only option was  to  try and  come around the \noutside in the very last  comer, a long left-hander, but  there \nwas  no way he was  going to make the turn and he ran  off track, \nso  the win  looked certain to be mine. Then, just as  I got on \nthe  gas  to  come into  the  final  straight my spark plug broke \nand instead of revving to around 15,000rpm the engine maxed \nout  at  11,000rpm. On  a  125cc, which has  a very short power \nrange, that doesn’t feel  good. I kept expecting everybody to \nstart flying past me  before we  hit the  chequered flag. I was \ntucked in as  hard as  I could under the fairing, praying not  for \nthe win but that I would at least make it to the line! \nThankfully the  gap we  had built at the  front was  just big \nenough so  that  nobody could take advantage and  I was  able \nto  celebrate my  first  ever Grand Prix  win  at the  end  of my \nsecond full  season. Standing on  the podium, listening to  the \nAustralian national anthem for the first time since my last win \nin the Spanish Championship at Jerez in November 2001, was \na moment of pure relief. I was  happy that Dad, James Strong \nand  his wife, Jeanne-Claude, were there to  see  me  win but \nMum was  back home in Australia watching on  television. She \nimmediately called Dad and insisted he put me  on  the phone \n\nso  \nshe  \ncould \ncongratulate \nme  \ndespite \neveryone \nwanting \nme \nup \non \nthe \npodium. \nFinally, \nMotoGP \njournalist \nGavin \nEmmett, \nwho \nwas  \ncommentating \nthe \ntelevised \nrace  \nbroadcast \nsaid \nover \nthe \nair, \n‘Could \nsomeone \ntake \nthe \nphone \noff \nBronwyn!’ \nI \ndon’t \nthink \nMum \nwas  \nlistening \nto \nthe \nTV \nby \nthen \nbut \nI \neventually \nsaid \ngoodbye \nand \nmade \nit \nto \nthe \npresentation. \nStanding \nthere, \nI \nthought \nabout \neverything \nwe  \nhad \nbeen \nthrough, \nthe \nwork \nwe \nhad \nput \nin, \nthe  \nopportunities \nthat \nhad \npassed \nus  \nby; \nthe \nbad \nluck \nand \nthe \nmistakes. \nFinally, \nit \nhad \nall \nbeen \nworth \nit \nand \nwe \ncould \ngo \nback \nto \nAustralia \nat \nthe \nend \nof \nthat \nseason \nwith \nsome \ngood \noptions \non \nthe \ntable \nfor \n2004. \nFrom a  financial point of view we  were struggling again \nand \nthe \nonly \nmoney \nI \nhad \nbeen \nable \nto \nbring \nin \nduring \n2003 \nwas \nspent \non \ngetting \nus \nto \nthe \nnext \nrace. \nThankfully \nwe \nwere \ngiven \nsome \nhelp \nfrom \nunexpected \nsources, \none \nof \nwhich \nwas \nan \nAustralian \nbusinessman, \nRod \nLamb, \nand \nhis \nwife, \nCarolyn, \nwho \nwere \nbig \nMotoGP \nfans. \nThey'd \nbeen \ntravelling \naround \nEurope coming to some races and they approached us in Italy, \nsurprising \nus \nwith \nan \noffer \nof \na \nchunk \nof \nmoney \nto \nhelp \nus \nout. \nAfter \nspending \nthe \nweekend \nwith \nus \nthey'd \nseen \nhow \nwe \nwere \nliving and how hard and stressful it was  and they doubled their \noffer. It was incredibly generous and there was nothing in it. \nfor \nthem, \nthey \njust \nwanted \nto  \nhelp \nand  \nwe  \nwere \nextremely \ngrateful. They have stayed good friends of the whole family. \nAnother person who  helped us  out  massively was  James \nStrong. When it  came to  motorcycle racing James was \nprimarily \na  \nfan  \nbut  \nhe  \nalso \nbecame \ninvolved \nwith \nDorna, \n127 \nSN Ser See lie Se \n\n128 \nCASEY <STheaNerR \nMotoGP’s TV  and commercial rights holder, at  board level \nand, as  I mentioned earlier, over the  years he took a  direct \ninvolvement in my career, advising us on contract negotiations \nand  introducing us  to  important sponsors. On  one  occasion \nhe dipped into  his own  pocket to give us  some money which \nhelped us  to fly back to Australia during the off-season, when \nwe  really couldn't afford to.  I even had enough to buy my first \n(second-hand) ute, which I still  have to  this  day. But, above \nall, James was a  good friend and I was looking forward to \nspending more time with him in his new  role  as  chairman of \nV8 Supercars. Sadly, he became critically ill following routine \nsurgery in early 2013. His death shortly afterwards was  a huge \nblow, tome personally but also to Australian motorsport and \nbusiness in general and he will be greatly missed. \nWith James’s generous help we  were considering three \noffers for 2004: stay with Lucio on basically the same technical \nand financial package as  2003, move to the Scot Honda team \nto  replace Andrea Dovizioso on  what was  basically a factory \nHonda or  take a risk  and  sign for  KTM, a factory team but \nwith just one  year’s experience in  Grand Prix  and  no  results \nto speak of. Our first choice was  Scot Honda but it turned out \ntheir offer was  just a ploy to force Dovi into signing; I guess \nhe was  holding out  for more money or  something. We were \nhanging on,  waiting for them to draw the contracts up on  the \nassumption the  deal was  done but we  never heard anything \nback and  then Dovi signed. That’s the way of the  paddock, \nthere is a lot of business like that happening. } \n\nThankfully \nthe \noffer \nfrom \nKTM \nwas  \nstill \nopen, \nwhich \nwas  \na \ngood \nthing \nbecause \nMum \nand \nDad \nhad \nhad \nto \nsell \nthe \nhouse \nthey \nhad \nbeen \nrenting \nout \nin \nAustralia \njust \nso \nwe \ncould \nget \nback \nto \nEurope \nfor \nthe \nnew \nseason. \nWe \nwere \nnow \ncompletely \nout \nof \nany \nsavings \nand \nhad \nnothing \nto \nfall \nback \non. \nSigning \nwith \nKTM \nmeant \ndrawing \na \ndecent \nwage \nand, \nin \nsplitting \nfrom \nLucio, \nwe \nwould \nalso \nbe \nfree \nto \ndo \na \ndeal \ndirectly \nwith \nSpidi \nfor \nmy \nleathers. \nFor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nsince \nleaving \nAustralia \nwe \nthought \nwe \nwould \nactually \nbreak \neven. \nThat \nwas \na \nvery \nproud \nmoment \nfor \nus \nand \nwe \nhappily \nsigned. \nFrom a technical point of view it was  a risk to leave what \nwe \nknew \nwas \na \ngood \npackage, \neven \nthough \nit \nwas \nin \na \nprivate \nteam, \nto \ntake \na \nfactory \nride \non \nan \nunproven \nmachine. \nKTM \nhad \ncome \ninto \nthe \nchampionship \nthe \nprevious \nseason \nand \nsigned \ntwo \nWorld \nChampions \nwith \nArnaud \nVincent \nand \nRoberto \nLocatelli but their results hadn’t been so good. On the positive \nside we  would have an  entire factory behind us,  a very good \nengine tuner in  Harald Bartol and  the  opportunity to work \nwith an  experienced and  successful crew chief in Australian \nex-racer Warren Willing, who had won the 500cc title just four \nyears previously with Kenny Roberts Jr. \nThe KTM money also allowed us  to  buy a  twin-axle \nenclosed trailer, which we  got from Mario, and a car,  a white \nFiat Cinquecento that Chaz and  I christened ‘The Baked \nBean’ because it was  so  small we  could put it in the trailer and \ntow  it around Europe on  the  back of the  Spidi motorhome. \nDad built what he jokingly called fold-out bunk beds into the \n129 \n3 LVN Te) 2a iale Nhs Grea \n\n130 \nCASEY “STONER \ntrailer but in reality they were three bits of 6 x  2 pine sheets \nthat we  set  up each time  we  wanted to use  them. When we \narrived at a circuit we'd unload the car and convert it into extra \nsleeping quarters for me  and Chaz, whose parents would join \nmy mum and dad in the motorhome. \nThere was  no  air-conditioning or windows in the trailer so \nwe  slept with the doors wide open and a fan going at each end \nto circulate the air.  There was  always a smell of oil and petrol \ninside from carrying the Baked Bean around but after a Grand \nPrix weekend in the heat of the European summer with two \nteenage boys on  board, the air got pretty bad!  Gavin Emmett \nnicknamed the  trailer ‘the  hamster cage’ because it was  so \ncramped but really we  didn’t care. The only time it bothered \nus  was when, because it wasn’t a  proper motorhome, race \nofficials kept trying to  make us  park it outside the paddock, \nin one  of the car  parks where there was  no  power. When we \ndid have electricity we'd hook up the  PlayStation and  have \nsome fun. \nThat season we  were on  our  way from Barcelona up  to \nMugello when the axle  snapped on  the motorhome. We  had \nto  get towed from the  highway and  it ended up  costing us \n€3500 to  travel 5 kilometres. We  got to  a garage in  a small \ntown in Italy and started ringing around but nobody in Europe \nhad  an  axle  to  suit  it. We  could have had  one  flown in from \nAmerica but we  were due at Mugello, so in the end Dad said, \n‘Let’s weld it.’ The  Italian mechanics didn’t think that was  a \ngood idea and kept saying, ‘Impossible, impossible.’ Dad kept \n\nreplying, \n‘Possible, \npossible!’ \nWe \nwent \nto \nan \nengineering \nshop \nand \neven \nthey \nsaid \nyou \ncan’t \nweld \nan \naxle. \nIn \nthe \nend \nDad \ninsisted \nso \nmuch \nthey \nsaid \nthey'd \ndo \nit \nbut \nthat \nthey \ndidn’t \nagree \nwith \nit. \nHe \ngot \nthem \nto \nput \nthe \naxle \non \na \nlathe \nand \ntaper \nthe \ntwo \nbroken \nends \ndown \nto \nnothing. \nThen \nhe \nasked \nthem \nto \nput \nthe \ntwo \npoints \ntogether \nand \nweld \naround \nit, \nput \nit \nback \nin \nthe \nlathe \nand \nstraighten \nit. \nThey \nkept \nbuilding \nit \nup, \nlayer \nafter \nlayer, \nwelding \naround \nthe \njoint. \nThis \nwhole \nprocess \ntook \na \ncouple \nof \ndays \nso \nin \nthe \nmeantime \nLucio’s \nfather \ncame \ndown \nand \npicked \nus \nup \nand \ntowed \nthe \nhamster \ncage \nto \nthe \ncircuit. \nChaz \nand \nI \nslept \nin \nthat \nand \nour \nparents \ngot \na \nhotel. \nThe \nnext \nweek \nwe \npicked \nup \nthe \nmotorhome \nand \ndrove \nit \nback \nto \nBarcelona. \nWe \nwere \nthinking \nthe \nwhole \nway, \nI \nhope \nshe’s \ngoing \nto \nmake \nit. \nBut \nshe \nwas \ngood \nas \ngold \nafter \nthat, \nand \nis \nstill \ngoing \nto \nthis \nday! \nThankfully the bike seemed to be more reliable than the \nmotorhome \nand \nI \ntook \nmy \nsecond \npodium \nof \nthe \nseason \nthat \nweekend at Mugello with a second place behind Locatelli, after \ntaking third in the opening round in South Africa. We  had a \nreally fast engine from the start of the season and even though \nthe  frame wasn’t the  best I learnt to  ride around the  bike’s \nproblems. It must have been frustrating for Warren Willing, \nfhe crew chief, to have such a strong-minded young rider. My \nexperience was  starting to increase, and I was  needing fewer \nlaps to understand the bike. Warren was  a good guy and he’d \nlisten. At one  race  I pushed it but I got my way,  they tured \nthe bike upside down and I went 2 seconds quicker. \n131 \nS LAWL Te See SN SS et \n\n132 \nCASEY. STQ@NER \nI had my first real chance to win  in round six, at Assen, but \nI got screwed up by Jorge Lorenzo’s antics on  the  final  lap. \nThe  two  of us  were in a  scrap with Locatelli and  Dovizioso \nand  I was  the  strongest in the  last part of the  track so  I felt \nlike  I had  the  race under control. Lorenzo was  on  the  grass \nin  a  few  places, doing whatever he  felt  was  necessary to \nmake a pass, and  midway around the  final  lap as  we  tipped \ninto a flat-out left he came through and nearly wiped me  out, \ncosting me  a couple of positions and, to my mind, potentially \nthe win. \nIt was  typical of him at the time and I wasn’t too happy but \nat least I felt like we were starting to make some progress with \nthe bike, turning it into a genuine title contender. After another \npodium in Brazil we  went to  Germany trailing Dovizioso by \njust twenty-one points at the top of the championship. All we \nneeded was  that first win  to really break through and having \nscored my first podium at Sachsenring the previous year I was \nconfident this could be the one. Unfortunately, whilst setting \nthe pace in free  practice on  the  Saturday morning I crashed \nand broke my collarbone for a third time. \nWith only a week until the  next race at  Donington we \ndecided to sit it out  and came back at Brno after the summer \nbreak trailing Dovi by fifty-nine points at  the  top  of the \nchampionship but still with seven races to pull it back.

I wanted to  make more of my own decisions without \nhis input and our  relationship was  starting to suffer as  a result. \nIt is probably a normal part of growing up but it was  magnified \nbecause we  were working together, living together and  he \nwas  acting as  my  manager. As  far  as  I was  concerned he \nhadn’t raced in  a  long time and  had  never ridden Grand \nPrix so  really he had no  idea of what it took, which generated \na  lot  of friction between us.  I tried to  talk  to  him but  we \ncouldn’t discuss anything without getting angry at  each \nother. \n133 \nSRN Ih SALA SN SS fat \n\n134 \nCASEY: STOQNER \nIn the past we  might have disagreed over  things to do with \nthe  bike but that  would be about it.  I knew my place and  I \nrespected Mum and Dad’s decisions. But I was  growing older \nand like  any nineteen-year-old I was  forming my own ideas. \nThings reached a tipping point at  Phillip Island. There was \na lot of expectation on  me  after the win  in  Malaysia, a lot of \ndemands on  my time, we  were all under a bit of stress and \nno  one  reacted well. Things with Dad came to a head in the \nriders’ box  at  Phillip Island. We  ended up  scuffling, which \nwasn't pretty for anybody. \nEven with all that going on I still placed third in the race. \nIt was  a tough decision to tell my dad I wanted to do this on \nmy  own from then on.  I’d  already had  some conversations \nwith former racer Randy Mamola and a business colleague of \nhis, Bob Moore, who worked for a big American management \ncompany called WMG, and I’d decided that the best thing for \nmy career was  to go with them. \nDad told me  to  do what I wanted but  he wasn’t going \nanywhere until he’d checked out  the  management contract. \nHe  said,  ‘Once I’m  happy with the contract, you go for your \nlife.’ It annoyed me  that  he kept the  negotiation going for \nweeks, knocking back this and knocking back that to the point \nwhere they just said, “Yep, okay that’s fine.’ I didn’t know at the \ntime but he’d written a clause into the contract which allowed \nme  to walk away whenever I wanted. \nMum and Dad moved back to Australia to their farm called \nthe Shamrock, way out in the scrub about one  and a half hours \n\nfrom \nTamworth. \nI \ndidn’t \nsee  \nthem \nagain \nfor \na \nfew  \nmonths. \nThey \ngave \nme  \nwhat \nI \nwanted: \nspace. \nHaving \nspent \nalmost \nevery \nwaking \nhour \nwith \nmy \nparents \nfor \nthe \nprevious \nnineteen \nyears \nit \nwas  \na \nhuge \nchange \nfor \nme  \nto  \nfinally \nbe \non  \nmy \nown. \nI \nmoved \ninto \na \ntiny \napartment \nnear \nLucio \nin \nMonaco, \nwhich \nwould \nhelp \nme  \nsave \non \na \nlot \nof \ntravel \ncosts, \nand  \nfor \nthe  \nfirst \ntime \nin \nall \nthe \nyears \nI'd \nbeen \nracing \nI \nhad \nsome \nmoney \nin \nmy \npocket \nthat \nI \ncould \ndo \nwhat \nI \nwanted \nwith. \nIt \nwasn’t \nmuch, \nbut \nup \nto \nthat \npoint \nI \nhadn’t \nseen \na \nsingle \npenny \nof \nmy \nearnings \nand I \nsuppose \nI \nresented \nthat, \neven \nthough \nin \nreality \nit \nwas \nall \ngoing \nback \ninto \nmy \nracing. \nWorld Superbike Champion Troy Bayliss, a  fellow \nAustralian, was  living in Monaco at the same time and he was \nvery  kind  to  me.  I remember the  first  day I moved into  my \napartment and  the  power wasn’t due  to be connected for a \ncouple of days, so  Troy said I could go and stay with him and \nhis  family until I got myself sorted out.  He  did lots  of little \nthings for me  while I lived there, like lending me  a pushbike \nto get me started cycling, and it was  handy to have him around \nto call on  if I needed help. \nCareer-wise, we'd already done a deal  with Lucio to  go \nback with him for 2005 on a semi-factory 250cc Aprilia, which \nwas  similar to the bike I’'d ridden in 2002 but now  I had much \nmore experience and the benefit of hindsight to help me  do \nbetter. KTM also had  a 250cc project on  the go by then  but \nthey wanted me  to  stay on  the  125cc and  I was  ready to  go \nback to 250cc so  I was keen to move on. \n135 \nSLiN I) sae: SINR S iia \n\n136 \nCASS ey «STeoNese \nLike in  2002, we  were one  or  two  steps back from the \nfactory Aprilias but we  started off the season with some really \ngood results, including my  first 250cc wins in  China and \nPortugal, which gave me  the  championship lead. After that \nDani Pedrosa found his stride and won five of the next seven \nraces and pulled a heap of points on  us. \nNot everything was  perfect for us but we  came back strong \nwith a handful of podiums and a couple more wins in Malaysia \nand  Qatar to  give  ourselves an  outside chance of winning \nthe championship when we  went to Phillip Island with three \nrounds remaining. We knew that to keep our  chances alive we \nhad to win, second wasn’t good enough, so  after qualifying on \npole position I pushed hard from the  start. After three laps \nI had opened almost a second over  the rest  of the field but I \ngot a bit over-confident, tried to keep the bike tight to one  of \nthe corners and the rear stepped out, sending me  spinning to \nthe ground. I was  disappointed but it was  always going to be \nvery difficult to  challenge Dani on  a privateer Aprilia when \nhe was  on  a factory Honda. The ultimate aim is to be a factory \nrider with the full support of a factory team. But getting to that \npoint means working for it. To secure a ride you may only be \noffered a privateer team (who lease or  buy a factory bike but \ndon’t \nhave \nfurther \nsupport \nfor \nthe \nongoing \nadjustments \nto \na \nbike). \nThere \nare \ndifferent \nlevels \nof \nprivate \nteams, \ngood \nand \nbad. You want a good one! \nIt is tough when you know your rival is on a better package \nthan \nyou. \nSometimes \nyou \ncan't \nhelp \nlooking \nat  \nsomebody's \n\nbike \nwhen \nthey \nare  \ndoing \nwell \nand \nwonder \nif \nit \nreally \nis \nbetter, \nor \nif \nit’s \nyou \nthat \nneeds \nto \nimprove. \nBut  \nI \nnever \nwanted \nto \nbe \nthe \nperson \npointing \nat \nsomebody \nelse’s \nbike \ninstead \nof \nfocusing \non \nwhat \nI \nhad \nand \nover \nthe \nyears \nI \nthink \nthat \nwas  \nanother \nthing \nthat \nprobably \nhelped \nme \nto \nride \ndifficult \nbikes \nfast. \nI \nam \nalways \nproud \nto \nbe \non \nwhatever \nbike \nI’m \non \nand \neven \nif \nit’s \nnot \nthe \nfastest \nI \nlove \nwringing \nits \nneck \nto \npush \nit \nas \nhard \nas \nit \nwill \ngo. \nWhen \nyou \nwin \nand \nyou \nknow \nyour \nbike \nis \nnot \nthe \nbest \nit \nmeans \nsomething \nextra. \nIt’s  fair to  say that in 2005 I sometimes had to ride  above \nthe  bike’s comfort zone just to  keep up with Dani, whereas \nhe was  riding within his limits a lot of the time. It’s impossible \nto  know for sure but  I believe this  experience prepared me \nbetter for MotoGP and improved me  as a rider. With guys like \nJorge Lorenzo and Andrea Dovizioso out  there too, I had to \nride to my limit every weekend. There was  no  opportunity to \nrelax, no  easy wins to be had. Every one  of us had to take risks \nto win, but that’s what we  were all there to do. \nThe most important thing I had  to  learn was  to keep my \nemotions under control. In  racing it is important to  make \nlogical decisions rather than passionate ones. Some riders \nbecome too  aggressive when they let  emotion affect their \ndecision-making process and  as  soon as  you  do that you  are \nnot  in control anymore. Very rarely it happens to me  and if it \ndoes I try and fix it quickly. I had to learn to do the same thing \noff the track. There were times, like when we were negotiating \nthe  Scot Honda ride at the  start of 2004, when I felt like  ’'d \n137 \nSel DANY eS GaN PES ic \n\n138 \nCASEY (S7TONER \nbuilt a  connection with someone, got excited about riding \ntheir bike, only for them to pull the  rug out  from under me. \nI had  to learn not  to let those things affect me  but  over the \nyears the small let-downs and half-truths change you and you \ncan't help becoming more cynical. \nI was  definitely maturing, learning from my experiences \nand  at the  end  of that  year I had  a look at the  relationship \nwith Bob  and Randy. It hadn’t worked out  the way I thought \nit would. They had  tried to  advise me  on  everything from \ntraining to  psychology without me  wanting their input on \nthese things and yet they hadn’t brought us  a single sponsor \nand were trying to cut in on deals that we  already had.  I didn’t \nlike  that  at all. The  turning point was  when they wanted me \nto switch from Nolan to a different helmet company because \nthey offered more money. That wasn’t what I wanted. I had a \ngood relationship with Nolan and I felt I owed them because \nthey'd supported me  at the beginning of my career when no \none else would. Those loyalties mean nothing to a management \ncompany; they just want to  take their percentage. It was \na big lesson and  I decided to  end  our  relationship. I knew \nI couldn’t manage myself but  I wanted someone who’d \nrespect my opinions and  loyalties. I decided to  talk to  Dad \nabout it. We’d needed the space to change the way we worked \ntogether but once we  set boundaries we  both knew we  could \nmake it work. Dad stopped being part of my career other than \non  the management side from that point on. \nDad says now: “Most fathers and sons  have to work out how \n\nto \ninteract \nat \nvarious \nstages \nin \ntheir \nrelationship. \nI \nhad \nto \nlearn \nthat \nCasey \nwas  \ngrowing \nup \nand \nneeded \nto \nmake \nhis \nown  \nway \nand \nthat \nwas  \ncomplicated \nby \nbeing \nunder \nso  \nmuch \npressure \nand \nme  \ntrying \nto \nact \nas  \na \nfather \nand \nas  \na \nmanager. \nWe \nworked \nit \nout \nand \nwe  \nhave \nbeen \nworking \ntogether \never \nsince. \nven  \nthough \nI \ndidn’t \nmanage \nto  \nbring \nhome \nthe  \ntitle \nE; \nthat \nyear \nthe \nimportant \nthing \nwas \nthat \nI'd \nshown \nmy \nability \nand \npotential. \nWe \nhad \nthe \noption \nto \nstay \nwith \nLucio \nfor \nanother \nseason \nand \ntry \nagain \nin \n2006 \nbut \nsmaller \ncategory \ntitles \nwere \nnot \ngoing \nto \nget \nme \nwhere \nI \nwanted \nto \ngo. \nThe \nsmaller \nclasses \nare \na \nbig \ndeal \nin \nSpain \nand \nItaly \nand \ntheir \nformer \nWorld \nChampions \nare \nseen \nas \nlegends. \nBut \nin \nAmerica, \nAustralia \nand \nthe \nUK \nwe \ndon’t \ncare \nabout \nthem \nas \nmuch. \nIt’s \nall \nabout \nwinning \nthe \nbig \none. \nIt’s \nwhere \nthe \nhardest \nbikes \nto \nride \nare \nand \nthe \nbest \nriders \ncompete. \nThat is not  to  devalue the  achievements of my  rivals in \nthose smaller classes because I tried everything to win  those \nchampionships and they came out  on  top.  But  the  goal for \nme  was  always to win  in MotoGP and  I wanted to get there \nas  quickly as  possible, whatever the route. Lucio had similar \nambitions for  his  team and was trying to  get  something \n139 \nSLIWIT SAL ONIHSNd \n\n140 \nCASEY -S4-ON ER \nhappening with Yamaha, which was an  option we  were \nkeen on. \nDucati, who had a  contract with Bridgestone tyres, were \nalso  interested but  they cooled. We  didn’t just want to  go \nto  MotoGP, we  were aiming to  win a  championship. With \nValentino Rossi on  Michelins we  figured the  only way to \ncompete with him was  to make sure we were on  Michelins too. \nIf we  could get on  the same bike then so  much the better. In \nthe end we  reached an  agreement with Yamaha, which would \nsee  me  spend my  rookie season on a satellite bike (which \nmight be older than the prototypes of the factory riders) and \nthen move into the  factory team in  the  second year. It was \nthe perfect deal and I couldn’t wait to sign it and get started. \n\nSry ea as \nCRASH TEST DUMMY \nhe end  of the  2005 season could have had  the  Rolling \nlee song “You Can’t Always Get  What You Want’ as \nits  soundtrack. By then, in  my  mind I thought my  MotoGP \nfuture was  going to  be with Yamaha but  at  the  last  minute \nthey pulled back. I can’t tell you why exactly because nobody \never told me. \nDad will  tell you: “We got pretty close [to signing a deal]. \nLucio and I were negotiating for Yamaha to give us a bike or at \nleast a discount on  a bike. We thought it was  going to happen \nand then we  got down to the last meeting with the Japanese \nand they said no.  We were like, “What now?”’ \nJames Strong summed it up best: “Each new season has its \nbeginnings even before the end of the previous one. There is \n141 \n\n142 \nGASEY ST GNer \na frenzied period of preparations, with intense negotiations \nto  form teams, arrange sponsorships, testing and re-testing \nof new equipment, and modifications to  existing machines \nthroughout November, December, January and February, \ntrying out tyres for lap after lap, testing at different racetracks \naround the  world, with all riders and teams both new and \nexperienced trying to  find  the  right combinations, the  right \nset-ups for brakes, suspension, handling and performance.’ \nOnce the deal with Yamaha disappeared, we  had to come \nup with a new  direction. We knew we  couldn’t afford to lease \na Honda because it was  going to be too  expensive. Dad  and \nLucio didn’t have the  money or  the  sponsors to  make that \nhappen but  then Honda told  us  that  Sito  Pons was  keen to \ngive me a test. \nSito, a former 250cc champion, had been running a very \nsuccessful satellite Honda team for several years. They'd won \na bunch of races with riders like Alex Barros, Loris Capirossi, \nMakoto Tamada and  Max Biaggi. The timing was  perfect \nand it was  a good option for us  to ride  a competitive bike on \nMichelin tyres with an  established team, so it looked like I was \ngoing to get what I needed. Just a few days after the end of the \nseason at Valencia I was  back there to test with Sito. \nMuch like when I had  stepped up from the  125cc to the \n250cc the previous year, the  990cc V5 just felt right for me. \nEven though it was  a  much bigger bike it felt  lighter than \nthe 250cc, it was more agile and had more power. Of course \nit had been my dream to  ride the two-stroke NSR500cc like \n\nMick Doohan, which sadly would now never happen, but \nthe  RC211V was  still  an  incredible machine. It was  already \nin its fifth season of development and as  well as  winning two \nchampionships with Rossi in 2002 and 2003, a bunch of other \nguys had won races on  it: Barros, Tamada and Biaggi and the \nlikes of Sete Gibernau, Nicky Hayden, Tohru Ukawa and \nMarco Melandri. That told me  what a great bike it was. \nThat first  test  was  a lot of fun. I was  given some pretty \nordinary tyres by Michelin just so  I could get used to the bike \nbut  I ended up  fourth fastest, within six-tenths of a  second \nof Nicky Hayden, who had just finished his third season with \nthe factory team, and a tenth of a second quicker than Carlos \nCheca, who was  also testing for Sito. The guy from Michelin \nsaid that with those tyres I shouldn’t even have been within a \nsecond of the front guys so he promised to let me  try the same \ngrade of tyres that the other guys were using on the second day \nbut unfortunately it was  wet.  We had another good test a few \nweeks later at Sepang and I was  feeling confident that things \nwere going to  happen. As  soon as  that  first  test  at Valencia \nwas  over  Sito started talking contracts, and I think we'd even \nsigned, but unbeknown to  me  things were unravelling badly \nfor him behind the scenes. \nDad remembers: ‘It was  all dependent on  Sito  securing \nsponsorship from the Camel tobacco brand for another year. \nThat’s where the whole thing fell to bits  in the  end because \nhe couldn’t close the deal and guarantee the money to Honda, \nwho were hanging on and hanging on.  They had a certain date \n143 \nSW SS SN ied Sd \n\n144 \nGASEY .ST ONER \nthat they wouldn’t go past and  Sito  couldn’t get sponsorship \nlined up so  the whole thing fell through.’ \nAfter the  drama with Yamaha and  now this  with Sito  it \nseemed like every time we were making a move up everything \ncollapsed beneath us.  It was  hard not to get discouraged and \nthink it was  never going to  happen. But  there is  always a \nway if you  are  determined enough and back yourself. It did \nseem we  were right back where we'd started with Lucio. In \nNovember, Dad and  Lucio had  a meeting with Dorna CEO \nCarmelo Ezpeleta, who was  keen to see  me  in MotoGP, and \nhe told us  that  Dorna would guarantee the money to  Honda \non  Lucio’s behalf, giving us  the  breathing space we  needed \nto find a sponsor. \nWe  had  two  months until the  next test  at  Sepang and by \nJanuary it was  all sorted. In theory it was  a decent package. \nAs  a  satellite team we  would be a  couple of steps behind \nthe  factory Repsol Hondas, not  having the  same tyres or \nequipment, but  even though the  title  had been won  for the \nprevious couple of seasons by Yamaha we  still knew we  had a \ngreat bike. We  also  had  the  dominant tyre brand, Michelin, \nand  Lucio had  put  a  strong crew together. He  inherited \nsome of the  more experienced members of Sito’s team, \nincluding crew chief Ramon Forcada, who had worked with \nAlex Barros for  many years. Along with Chris Richardson, \nmy trusted mechanic from my  125cc and  250cc days, it was \na good team. \nDuring the off-season Dad worked hard to  get  some \n\nsponsors \nlined \nup.  \nHe  \nwent \nto  \nthe  \nMilan \nmotor \nshow \nfor \na \ncouple \nof \nmeetings, \none  \nof \nwhich \nwas  \nwith \nAlberto \nVergani, \nPresident \nof \nNolan \nhelmets. \nI \nwas  \nalready \ngrateful \nto \nAlberto \nfor \nthe \nsupport \nhe \nhad \nshown \nus \nwhen \nwe  \nfirst \nmoved \nto \nGrand \nPrix \nback \nin \n2002 \nand \nI'd \nhad \nthe \nopportunity \nto \npay \nhim \nback \na \ncouple \nof \nyears \nlater \nwhen \nwe  \nhad \nsome \nproblems \nwith \nour \nvisors \nsteaming \nup in \nthe \nrain. \nDani \nPedrosa \nsplit \nwith \nNolan \nover \nthe \nissue \nbut \nI \nvalued \nAlberto’s \nsupport \nand \nwe \nstayed, \nin \nspite \nof \nmore \nlucrative \noffers. \nI \nthink \nAlberto \nappreciated \nit. \nWhat \nhe \ndid \nnext \nseemed \nto \ntell \nme \njust \nthat. \nEven \nthough \nwe \nstill \nhad \na \nyear \nleft \non \nour \ncontract \nwith \nNolan \nas \na \n250cc \nrider, \nhe \ntore \nit \nup, \nliterally, \nin \nfront \nof \nDad’s \neyes. \n‘Casey \nis \na \nMotoGP \nrider \nnow, \nhe \nsaid, \nand \nhe \ndoubled \nthe \nmoney \non \nthe \nspot \nwithout \nany \nneed \nfor \nnegotiation. \nThat \nwas \na \nhuge \nthing \nand \nmade \nus \nrealise \nthat \nit \nwas \ntime \nfor \nus \nto \nstart \nmaking \nchanges \nin \nother \nareas. \nWe \ndidn’t \nstart \nmaking \ndemands, \nwe \nstarted \nchasing \nthe \nright \nsponsors, \nthe \nones \nwe \nwanted \nand, \nas \nNolan \nshowed, \nloyalty \npays \noff. \nAfter \nall \nthe \nyears \nof \nscrimping \nand \nsaving \nto \nchase \nthe \ndream \nof \nbecoming \na \nMotoGP \nrider, \nthe \nmoment \nlooked \nlike \nit \nwas \ngetting \ncloser. \nAs \npart \nof \nthe \nnegotiations \nwith \nLucio \nwe \ninsisted \non \ndealing \ndirectly \nwith \na \nprotective \nequipment \nsupplier. \nWe \ndid \na \ndeal \nwith \nAlpinestars, \nwhich \nwas \nthe \nstart \nof \nanother \nfantastic \nrelationship \nand \na \nsign \nthat \nthings \nwere \ndefinitely \nlooking \nup. \nWe  took delivery of the 2006 bike in time for the  test  at \nSepang and  did  something like  170  laps over three days, \nfinding a  base setting for  the  chassis and suspension.

I’d  soon find  out \nthat  ’'d damaged the  rotator cuff ligaments that  I'd torn in \nthat crash with Brad and  Jason back at  Tamworth when I \nwas  ten years old. \nThat was  it. I had to go back to Australia for surgery, ruling \nme  out  of the  remainder of the  pre-season. Some people \nmight have been happy to  leave a European winter to head \nhome to an  Australian summer but I wasn’t at all. It was  time \nand money I didn’t want to waste. But there was  one  positive, \nand it was  a big one! \nI was  going to  be  able to  spend some more time with \nAdriana Tuchyna, a girl I had been seeing for almost a year. \nWe'd first met  at Phillip Island back in 2003. Adriana came to \nask me  for an  autograph. It was  one  of those funny moments \nthat I’ll  never forget because Adriana was asking for  an \nautograph and  her  sister Dorothy and  the  people around \nwere egging her  on  so  she  asked me  to  sign her  stomach \ntoo.  I couldn’t say  no!  (Later, I would realise how out  of \ncharacter that was; Adri is a very modest person and would \nnever normally do something so  bold.) Then her sister came \nup to me  and we  started chatting. She told me  Adriana would \nreally like my mobile number and J asked for hers.

It was  six weeks \nbefore I was  allowed to train so  those weeks went by slowly. \nAdriana and I spoke often. \nWhen I headed back overseas professionally things \nweren't looking so  good. In those days there were no  limits \non  testing so  when I arrived in Europe for the first round of \nthe  season at Jerez I had missed nine days of testing; three \nin Malaysia, three in Barcelona and three at Jerez. It meant \neverybody was  way ahead of us  with their set-up and  we \nstruggled in  practice at  Jerez, especially when it came to \nadapting the bike to the softer qualifying tyres. We ended up \nfinishing way  back in  fifteenth place out  of nineteen riders \non  the grid. \nJames Strong puts it better than I can:  “A good start leading \nto  a  prominent position near the  front of the  field is very \nimportant. Being caught up in the back of the pack battling to \npass bike after bike, trying to  avoid being left too  far behind \nthe leaders is a big disadvantage. It saps  energy, often causes \nexcessive tyre wear, and slows even the fast riders as  they are \nforced to take calculated risks to make their way up towards \nthe leaders. \n‘So position on  the grid is important to being able to start \nefficiently and try to get away cleanly.

When we did eventually \nget a flight, for some bizarre reason the woman at the check- \nin put my tickets together with some guy who was  travelling \nin business class who I didn’t know. I didn’t worry too  much \nabout it then but when I went to transfer to our  connecting \nflight in  Dubai they wouldn’t let me  board the  plane until \nthis  guy turned up,  even though my name was on  the  list.  I \nwaited for everybody to  board and  of course the  guy  didn’t \nshow. He  must have taken an  earlier flight but I had no  way \nof knowing for sure. I was  furious! I had to go all the way out \nof the  terminal and  book another flight but  there wasn’t an \navailable seat  until the  next day. I didn’t have a  credit card \nback then so that made things a lot more difficult too.  I spent \n24 hours in Dubai airport and arrived in Doha 48 hours later \nthan planned, with only an  hour to spare before the first free \npractice was  due to start. \nI spoke to  Lucio when I landed and he said, ‘If your bags \ndon’t arrive within five  minutes just leave them.’ I arrived at \nthe track ten minutes before the session started, got changed, \ngot on  the  bike and  set  the  fastest time of the  session. I \nwas  four-tenths of a  second inside the  circuit record and \ntwo-tenths of a  second quicker than my closest challenger, \nwho was  Valentino Rossi. I ran  second fastest in the  second \nsession that afternoon, fastest in the  third free practice the \nnext morning and  then qualified on  pole position.

For  a few laps it was  like  a  125cc race, \nthe  four of us  constantly passing each other. I felt we  had  a \nfaster pace than the guys in front so with five laps to go I went \nto the front of the pack to take the lead and try to pull a gap. \nMarco was  able to  up his pace and  keep up.  It was  my first \nchance of a podium in  MotoGP so  I didn’t want to  risk  too \nmuch that race  and Marco was  able to risk more. There was  a \nlong back straight at Istanbul, which was  followed by a run  of \ntight corners to finish the lap. Whoever was  in front at the end \nof that back straight was  going to win  but I covered as  much \nas  I wanted to risk into  that tight corner. Maybe I could have \ncovered more but as  I’ve  said, I didn’t want to throw away my \nfirst chance of a podium and I didn’t care  about championship \npoints. Marco passed me  and went on  to win the race. \nI got back to pare fermé and considering it was  the team’s \nfirst podium I didn’t expect to  see  them disappointed I \ndidn’t win  the  race. The fact  that  it was  our  first  podium in \nMotoGP was  overlooked. If you watch that  same team now \nthey celebrate for  results nowhere near what we  achieved. \nI couldn’t help wishing they reacted more positively when \nI came second in only my third race. I guess they took that \nearly success for granted and  the  fact  that  they've only had \none  podium since then made them realise it isn’t easy to make \nit up there and they should celebrate those moments more. \nI finished fifth again in China, which was  another decent \nresult.

They would put me on a certain set of tyres for free \npractice and I would be happy as  anything, right on  the pace. \nThen on  race day they'd say,  “You can’t use  that tyre.’ They'd \ninsist on  us  using a different tyre and  then we'd find  out  on \nthe grid that Dani or  Nicky or somebody else was  on the tyre \nI was  planning to  race on.  Contractually we  were obliged to \nuse  whatever tyre they decided on. \nIt wasn’t like  it is now where each rider gets  an  identical \ntyre allocation to work with for the whole weekend. Back then \nit was  a free-for-all. You  gave your feedback to  Michelin and \nthey decided what tyre was  best for each session. We  had  a \nbunch to  work with in practice but  for the  race they made \nour  choice for us.  We  never knew what we  were getting but \nwe'd be running one  tyre number all weekend and then for \nthe race  it would have a different batch number. Half the time \nthe  front and  rear tyres didn’t even match up.  I'd go from \npractice, when everything was  working well, and then in the \nrace  Id tip into a corner and the front would fold. Sometimes \nthe rear  would offer too  much grip for the front. They had so \nmany different combinations of profile and compound at that \nstage. \nI kept pushing because I trusted them but  there were \nsome massive crashes which I thought were caused by the \ntyre combinations I was given at the last minute. The first big \none  was  at Mugello, a fast lowside after nine  laps when I was \n\nrunning \nin \nthird \nplace. \nThankfully \nit \nlooked \nworse \nthan \nit \nwas \nand \nthe  \nbike \nbore \nthe  \nbrunt \nof \nthe  \ndamage; \nI \nescaped \nwith \n| \na  \nsore \nneck. \nThe \nsame \nthing \nhappened \nin \nthe  \nnext \nround \nat \nCatalunya \nin \nSpain, \nwhen \nI \nmanaged \nto \nget \nthe \ntwo \nholeshots \n(first \nto \nthe \nfirst \ncorner) \nfrom \nthe \nthird \nrow \nof \nthe \ngrid \nafter \nthe \nrace \nwas \nstopped \nbecause \nof \na \npile-up \nin \nturn \none. \nExactly \nnine \nlaps \nafter \nthe \nrestart \nI \nsat \ncomfortably \nin \nsecond \nbehind \nRossi \nwhen \nthe \nfront \nfolded \nagain. \nDad will tell  you, ‘As  outsiders, we’d always watched \nGPs \nand \nheard \nabout \nthese \nso-called \ntyre \nwars \nbut \nwe \nnever \nunderstood \nhow \npolitical \nit \nall \nreally \nis. \nMichelin \ncould \ncontrol \nthe \nchampionship, \nand \ncould \npractically \ndecide \nwho \nwas \ngoing to  win.

Casey would go out  in the  race and  nearly \nalways it would be the front that folded on  him.’ \nDad was  right. I started feeling like a crash test dummy and \nas  the season progressed the situation got worse, to the point \nwhere I'd get angry and go off.  I got a reputation as a spoilt \nbrat. I am  not making excuses but I was  frustrated. Dad would \ncome over to Europe to try to settle things down but the fact \nwas I felt the tyres were causing me  to crash. My confidence \nalso took a hit and it took me  back to the doubts I had in my \n155 \nS.A A SSeS elie \n\n156 \nCASEY) Sai ONER \nfirst season of Grand Prix in 2002. I started to question myself \na lot. Was  it me  or  the bike? After a while I couldn’t be sure. \nIt was  my debut season in MotoGP and  I really didn’t know \nwhat I was  capable of.  I’'d proved I was  competitive but the \nrace  results weren't showing what I knew I could do. It started \nto  mess with my head and  unfortunately it seemed that  my \ncrew chief Ramon Forcada didn’t have a lot of faith in what I \nwas  capable of either. He knew there were problems with the \ntyres but  as  far as  he was  concerned that  was  just the  way \nit was. That’s probably why, when you look at  Alex Barros’s \ncareer as  an  example, he  was fighting to  win  races one \nweekend and  then struggling to  be  on  the  podium at  the \nnext. But  I never wanted to be a rider who tickles around in \ntenth place because he can’t get a feel for the front and doesn’t \nunderstand why. \nLike I had done my  whole life  I kept pushing and, of \ncourse, I kept crashing and I got  slammed for  it in  the \npaddock and in  the  press, earning myself the  nickname \n‘Rolling Stoner’, which really bugged me.  The pressure began \nto build as  people questioned my talent and Ramon started \nto suggest that I was  crashing because I wasn’t physically fit \nenough. I knew this  couldn’t be the only solution, and I still \ncouldn’t \nwork \nout \nwhy \nI \nkept \ncrashing. \nAs \na \nrookie \nI \nwasn’t \nto \nknow \nany \nbetter \nbut \npeople \naround \nme \nwith \nexperience \nshould have helped me  to understand the tyre issue. \nI would come in after a race  saying, ‘I didn’t do anything \nwrong, \nI \ndidn’t \nmake \na \nmistake. \nI \nwould \nknow \nif \nI \nhad.’ \nBut \nthey \n\n4 \nwould \nsay,  \n“Well, \nyou  \nmust \nhave \ndone \nbecause \nyou  \ncrashed.’ \nAll \nthe \nblame \nwent \nto \nme  \nand \nwith \neverybody \ntelling \nme  \nit \nwas \nmy \nfault, \nI \nstarted \nto \nbelieve \nit. \nRamon \nis \na \nvery \ngood \ncrew \nchief, \nextremely \nskilled \nat \nsetting \nup \na \nmotorcycle, \nbut \nI \nwish \nhe’d \nlistened \nto \nme \na \nlittle \nmore. \nProbably the  biggest thing I learnt from that  season and \nthe \none \nbefore \nwas \nnot \nto \ntrust \npeople \nwith \nmore \nexperience \npurely because of that  experience. It would prove to be one \nof \nthe \nmost \nimportant \nlessons \nof \nmy \ncareer. \nOften \nDad \nand \nI \nwould \nfind \nourselves \nlooking \nup \nto \npeople \nwho \nwe \nhad \nonly previously seen from the  outside and  we  viewed them \nas  having so  much knowledge of the  sport. I guess they \nliked that feeling and  didn’t need any  encouragement to \nmake us  feel  small and  insignificant. We  had  no  choice but \nto  trust them and  that could have ended my career before \nit had  even started. By the  end  of that season I realised \nthat nearly everyone has an  agenda and it isn’t  always for you \nto win. \nOn  the  morning of the  race at  Sachsenring, Germany, in \nround ten, I crashed again during warm-up. It was another \nlowside and it happened at  turn eleven, one of the  fastest \ncorners in the entire championship. When I got to my feet the \nmarshals asked me  how I was  but I didn’t answer immediately, \nI was  biting my lip because of the intense pain in my fingers, \nwhich had just been dragged across the gravel at 200km/h, and \nI was  too busy contemplating the fact I had just destroyed my \nbike with only a couple of hours to go before the race. \n157 \nS.LiWin SteAonisena \n\n158 \nCASEY STONER \nWith my  mind on  other things I wasn’t worried about \nmyself, just the  bike! When we  got to  the  medical centre \nfor a check-up the  marshals reported my condition and  said \nthat  the  fact  I hadn’t immediately responded to them was  a \nsure sign of concussion, as  was  the fact that my fingers were \nstinging. With the greatest respect to all the marshals around \nthe world who volunteer their time to help us  go racing, they \nare  not  qualified to make a call on  the medical condition of a \nrider. Yet, for some reason, the circuit doctors took their word \nfor it and declared me  unfit to race. \nI couldn’t believe they were making such a  drastic call \nwhen I didn’t even have so  much as  a scratch on  my helmet. \nEventually they said I could race  if I went to the hospital for a \nscan and it came back clear. To make that happen I had to be \nquick so  we  jumped in a helicopter and went and got a scan \ndone, \nwhich \nobviously \ncame \nback \nclear, \nbut \nby \nthe \ntime \nwe \ngot \nback \nto \nthe \ncircuit \nthe \nrace \nofficials \nhad \nalready \nconfirmed \nthe \nofficial \nstarting \ngrid \nwithout \nme \nbeing \nincluded. \nThat \nwas \nanother \nhuge \nlet-down \nfor \nme, \nand \nover \nthe \nyears \nI \nhave \nseen \nhuge \ninconsistencies \nin \nwho \nthey \nlet \nrace \nunder \ncertain \ncircumstances and who they don't. \nWas \nit \nall \npolitical \nthat \nseason? \nI \ncan’t \ntell \nyou  \nthat \nbut \noccasionally \nI \nthought \nso. \nI \nremember \nat \nPhillip \nIsland \nwe \nhad \na \nfew \nproblems \nwith \nthe \nbike \nbut \nwe \ngot \nit \nsorted \nin \nwarm-up \nand \nI \nset \nthe \nfastest \ntime \nof \nthe \nsession \n— \nwe \nwere \nflying. \nThen, \njust \nbefore \nthe \nstart \nof \nthe \nrace, \nHonda \nofficials \ntold \nus  \nwe  \ncouldn’t \nuse  \nthe  \ngearbox \nsetting \nwe  \nhad \nbecause \n\nsupposedly \nthe \nfuel \nwouldn’t \nmake \nit \nto \nthe \nend.  \nMaybe \nthey \nwere \nright \nbut \nto \nme  \nit \njust \nseemed \nlike \nHonda \ndidn’t \nlike \nthe: \nidea \nthat \nI \nmight \nbeat \ntheir \nfactory \nbikes. \nThere \nwere \nlots \nof \nthings \nhappening \nlike  \nthat, \none  \nafter \nthe  \nother, \nwhich \nmade \nme  \nrealise \njust \nhow \nlittle \ncontrol \na \nprivateer \nteam \nhas. \nThe \nonly \nthing \nthat \nstopped \nme  \nfrom \nwalking \naway \nfrom \nthe \nsport \nright \nthere \nand \nthen \nwas \nthe \nfact \nthat \nin \nthe \npenultimate \nround \nof \nthe \nseason \nat \nEstoril \nin \nPortugal \nwe \nsigned \na \ndeal \nwith \nDucati \nto \nride  \nfor \nthem \nin \n2007. \nFor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nin \nmy \nlife \nI \nwould \nbe \non \na \nfactory \nbike \nand, \nperhaps \nmore \nimportantly \nconsidering \nmy \nsuspicion \nthat  \ntyres \nwere \na \nbig \nfactor \nin  \nmy \nlack \nof \npodium \nperformances, \nwe'd \nbe \non  \nBridgestone \ntyres. \nWe  \nhad  \nknown \nabout \ntheir \ninterest \nfor \na \nwhile \nbut \nwe  \nhad \nalso \nbeen \nin \nnegotiations \nwith \nthe \nYamaha \nfactory. \nAround \nthe \nsame \ntime \nJames \nStrong \nwas \nattending \na \nFormula \n1 \nrace \nand \nhe \ngot \ntalking \nto \none \nof \nthe \nYamaha \nbosses, \nwho \ntold \nhim \nthat  \nI'd \nbeen \nmaking \ndemands \nfor \ncrazy \namounts \nof \nmoney. \nNone \nof \nthat \nwas \ntrue \nand \nJames, \nbeing \na \nvery \ngood \nfriend \nand \nsomeone \nwho \nhad \nhelped \nus \nwith \nadvice \nover \nthe \nyears, \ntold \nus \nwhat \nwas \ngoing \non. \nFrom what James passed on  it became really clear to  us \nthat \nsomebody \ninside \nYamaha \ndidn’t \nwant \nme \nthere \nand \nthey \nwere \nobviously \ndoing \nall \nthey \ncould \nto \nmake \nsure \nthe \ndeal \ndidn’t \nhappen. \nWe \ndidn’t \neven \nchallenge \nwhat \nthey \noffered \nus \nand \naccepted \ntheir \nfirst \nproposal \nwithout \nissue. \nThe \nonly \nthing \nwe \ninsisted \non \nwas \nthat \nwe \nwould \nbe \npart \nof \nthe \nsame \ngarage \nas \nValentino \nRossi \nand \nJeremy \nBurgess \nso \nthat \nwe \ncould \n159 \nSLIWNIT AHL ONIHSNMd \n\n160 \nGCASEY SS a N Ee \nlearn from them. It was  a factory team and we  wanted to be \nfully a part of it so  I didn’t think that was  an  unfair request. \nThis was  the  sticking point and even though we'd all agreed \nto the rest of the contract we  could not get agreement on  this \nsimple issue. \nWith Yamaha a no-go, the  only other option on  the  table \nwas to  stay with Lucio, on  the  same bike and deal as  2006. \nSo we  decided to  give Ducati a go.  To  have a  factory team \nshowing such faith in me  when I was  starting to lose  faith in \nmyself meant a hell of a lot. I wanted nothing more than to get \nsome podiums and maybe the victory that had eluded me  that \nyear in Turkey; to put every factory Honda and every factory \nYamaha behind me  just once and make them sorry that they \npassed me  up.  I didn’t think I could win  the  championship \nstraight away and  I told  Ducati this. But  that  didn’t mean I \nwasn't going to try. \nfter Adri and I had been together for a year I knew she \nee the  one  for  me.  I didn’t want to  waste any  more \ntime apart so  I discussed with a couple of my friends and my \ndad \nhow \nI \nfelt. \nThey \nall \nsaid \nthe \nsame \nthing: \n‘Mate, \nshe’s \na \ngreat girl.’ I think anybody who meets Adriana realises that \nshe’s \na \npretty \nspecial \nwoman. \nYes, \nshe’s \nbeautiful \nbut \nshe’s \nalso \n\nfo \ncaring, \ncalm \nand \nextremely \nclever, \nway \nmore \nthan \nme. \nShe \nalso \ndoesn’t \ntake \nany \ngrief \nfrom \nmy \nfriends \nlike \nLeon, \nStork \nor \nChaz, \nshe \njust \nfits \nstraight \nin \nand \ngives \nit \nback \nto \nthem. \nAdriana \nand \nI \nhad \ntalked \nabout \nthe \nfuture \nand \nI \nknew \nthat \nshe \nfelt \nas  \nstrongly \nabout \nour  \nrelationship \nas  \nI \ndid.  \nI \ndecided \nI \nwas  \ngoing \nto \npropose. \nThis \nis \nwhat \nwe  \nboth \nwanted \nbut \nwe \nhadn’t \nmade \nanything \nofficial \nor \ntold \nanybody \nso \nafter \nthe \nrace \nat \nMugello \nI \nflew \ndown \nto \nAdelaide \nto \nvisit \nher. \nI'd \nbought \na \nring \nfor \nAdri \na \nmonth \nearlier, \nwhile \nChaz \nwas \nvisiting \nme \nin  \nMonaco. \nHe’d \ncome \nwith \nme  \non  \na  \ndrive \nto  \nVentimiglia. \nTroy \nBayliss \nhad  \narranged \nfor \nme  \nto  \nmeet \nwith \na  \nfriend \nof \nhis \nwho \nwas  \na \njeweller \ndown \nthere. \nAfter \nasking \nher \nfather’s \npermission, \nAdriana’s \nmum \nhelped \nme  \norganise \na  \nlimousine \nto \npick \nus  \nup \nfrom \ntheir \nplace. \nAdriana \nhad \nno  \nidea \nwhat \nwas \n. \ngoing \nto  \nhappen, \nbut  \nmaybe \nshe  \nsuspected \nwhen \nthe  \nlimo \nturned \nup. \nI \nwanted \nto \ntake \nher \nto \ndinner \nat \na \nfancy \nrestaurant \nin \ntown, \nwhere \nI \nwas  \ngoing \nto  \ndo \nthe  \nfull \nproposal \nbut \nwhen \nAdris \nmum \nhad  \nmade \nthe  \nreservation \nfor \nme  \nthey \nfailed \nto \ntell \nher \nthat \npart \nof \nthe \nrestaurant \nwas  \nclosed \nfor \nrenovations. \nWhen \nwe  \narrived \nthey \nwent \nto  \nseat  \nus  \nnext \nto \ntheir \nbar \narea \nwith \npoker \nmachines \nin \nthe \nbackground. \nI \ndidn’t \nwant \nto \nask \nher \nthere \nso \nafter \ndinner \nwe \nwent \nfor \na \nwalk \nin \nthe \npark. \nAdriana \nsays \nnow: \n‘It \nwas \nreally \nsweet \nand \neven \nthough \nI \nwas  \nonly \nseventeen \nI \nhad  \nno  \nhesitation \nto  \nsay \nyes.  \nI \nknow \nit \nis \npretty \nunusual \nfor \nanyone \nour  \nage  \nto  \nget \nengaged \nbut \nI \ndon’t \nthink \nmy \nfriends \nwere \ntoo \nshocked \nwhen \nthey \nfound \nout \nthe \nnext \nday \nat \nschool. \nI \nknew \nI \nwanted \nto \nspend \nmy \nlife \nSLINIT SH ONIASMa \n\n162 \nCASEY cSitOnNeR \nwith Casey and Suioe as  I was  concerned there was  no  reason \nfor us  to wait any longer. Some people have dreams of going \nto  university, travelling or  partying but  my  dream was to \nmarry the person I love and have a family together. I feel very \nblessed that my dream has come true.’ \nnowing that my  future was  with Adri made me  want \n(eee than  ever  to  chase success. But just because my \nprivate life  was  looking great didn’t mean that my  racing \nsuddenly came together. That season finished with two  more \ncrashes in the last two  races at Estoril, when ironically I took \nout  the  guy  I would be replacing at  Ducati, Sete Gibernau, \nand Valencia, taking my total number of crashes that season \nto  fourteen. Apart from my fellow rookies Randy de Puniet \n(fourteen) and Dani Pedrosa (eight) no  other rider had more \nthan six crashes that season. Valentino Rossi had just three, the \nlast of which came at Valencia and cost him the championship. \nWhen I saw  it later on  television, it looked strangely familiar. \nThe  title  had  gone down to a final-race decider between \nValentino and  Nicky Hayden, with Valentino ahead by eight \npoints. Basically Nicky needed the  most unlikely possible \nscenario —  a Rossi crash —  to win  a championship that he had \nled for most of the  season until he was taken out  by Dani at \n\nEstoril. \nValentino \nwas  \nin \ngreat \nform \nthat \nweekend \nand  \nhad \nqualified \non \npole \nby \na \ncouple \nof \ntenths \nof \na \nsecond, \nwith \nNicky \nfifth \non  \nthe \ngrid, \nso \nit \nlooked \nlike \nit \nwas  \nValentino’s \nrace \nto \nlose. \nBut \nas  \nsoon \nas \nthe \nlights \nwent \nout \nValentino \nwas  \nin \ntrouble. \nI \nwas  \none  \nof \nsix \nriders \nto \npass \nhim  \non  \nthe \nfirst \nlap \nand \nif \nyou \nwatch \nthe  \nfootage \nyou  \ncan  \nsee  \nhow \nmuch \nhe  \nis \nstruggling \nto  \neven \nkeep \nup \nwith \nus.  \nHis  \nrear  \nand  \nfront \ntyres \nwere \njust \nnot  \nworking \ntogether \nand  \non  \nlap \nfive  \nthe  \nfront \ninexplicably \nfolded \nand  \nhe \nwent \ndown, \nright \nbehind \nme.  \nI \ncouldn’t \nhelp \nbut \nwonder \nhow \nhe \ncould \nbe \nhaving \nsuch \nproblems \nwith \nhis \ntyres. \nCould \nhe \nreally \nhave \nbeen \nstitched \nup? \nIt \nseemed \nso \nimprobable, \nbut \nI \nremember \nwatching \nthat \nrace \nback \nin \nthe \nmotorhome \nthat \nevening \nand \nthinking, \nWelcome \nto \nmy \nworld, \nmate. \n163 \nSLIWIT AHL IONIHNSNd \n\n\n\nSeale Tere sS \nDREAMS COME TRUE \nhings were changing and even though there was  so much \nale be excited about, the publicity demands of being in \na factory team were going to  take some getting used to.  Just \nlike when I was  a kid lined up for my first race at Hatcher's, \nit was  the  attention that  I struggled with. Racing is the  easy \npart, itis what I love; it’s the interviews, the dinners, strangers \nwanting to know private details that I find hard. Which I know \nall sounds a bit odd complaining about when you are writing a \nbook about your life, but I still struggle with that, too. \nAdri and  I had  planned our  wedding in her home town \nof Adelaide for 6 January 2007. Like most couples, we  were \nnervous, excited but most of all really happy. we  were getting \nmarried. Yes, some people thought us  too young but we  knew \n165 \n\n166 \nCASEY STONER \nwhat we wanted and weren't bothered by the opinions of others. \nWe  were looking forward to  our  honeymoon and  spending \ntime together without any other demands. That was  the plan, \nbut a few weeks before our wedding day Ducati told me  I had \nto be in Italy the week after the wedding to be ready for the \nofficial team launch in Madonna di Campiglio. We had to give \nup the idea of a honeymoon and get ready for that. \nOn the  day itself we  had  150  guests and  all eyes were on \nus.  Adriana looked incredibly beautiful as  she walked down \nthe aisle of St Peter’s Cathedral on her father’s arm. My cousin \nMark was  my best man and standing there at the front of the \nchurch I almost couldn't believe I was marrying the girl of my \ndreams. I wanted that day to be wonderful for Adriana’s sake, \nand  it was.  Somebody leaked the venue details to  the press \nand we  had photographers turning up and taking pictures, but \nwe  weren't going to let anything get us  down. It went so  fast \nand was  all a blur but at the end of it all we were husband and \nwife  so  I couldn't have been happier. \nThe next day we  had to be on a flight to Europe and before \nwe  even realised it we  were on  the plane. It was  a whirlwind \nand we  arrived in Italy to be met  by television cameras and \nphotographers following our  every move. Compared to \nprevious satellite teams, the  PR  side with Ducati was a lot \nmore organised and  controlled, so  even though there was a \nlot more work, in a way it was  more manageable. But  I was \nsuddenly under a lot of pressure to  do the  part of the job \nthat  I hated the  most. I was  now a factory rider, employed \n\nby \nprobably \nthe \nmost \nprestigious \nmotorcycle \nracing \nbrand \nin \nEurope, \nand \nthe \nItalians \nwanted \nto \nknow \neverything \nabout \nme \nand \nmy \nnew \ngorgeous \nwife. \nThe \nteam \nlaunch, \ncalled \n‘Wrooom’, \nis \nheld \nwith \nthe \nFerrari \nF1 \nTeam. \nTogether \nthe \ntwo \nracing \nteams \npretty \nmuch \ntake \nover \nan \nentire \nski \nresort \nin \nthe \nDolomite \nmountains, \nall \npaid \nfor \nby \nthe \nPhilip \nMorris \ntobacco \ncompany, \nwhich \nsponsors \nboth \nfactories’ \nracing \nactivities. \nIt \nis  \nan  \nextravagant \naffair \nwith \nno \nexpense \nspared \nand \nthe \nbill \nmust \nrun \ninto \nmillions \nof \ndollars. \nThe \nwhole \nthing \nlasts \na \nweek, \nwith \npress \nconferences \nin \nthe \nmorning \nfollowed \nby \none-to-one \ninterviews \nand \nthen \nsome \n‘spare \ntime’ \nin \nthe \nafternoon \nto \ngo \nskiing. \nIt’s \nan \nincredible \nevent \nand \nif \nI \nloved \nthe \nspotlight \nit \nwould \nbe \nheaven \nbut \nto \nhave \nmy \nevery \nmove \ncaptured \nby \nthe \ncameras, \neven \neating \ndinner \nin \nthe \nevening, \nfelt \nvery \nuncomfortable \nfor \nme. \nHaving \nall \nthat \nhappen \nwithin \nthe \nspace \nof \ntwo \nweeks \n— \nthe \nbuild-up \nto \nthe \nwedding, \nthe \nday \nitself, \nthe \nflight \nto \nEurope \nand \nthen \na \nweek \nunder \nthe \nspotlight \nas \na \nfactory \nMotoGP \nrider \n‘with \nthe \nbiggest \nsponsor \nin \nthe  \nchampionship \n—  \nwas  \na \nlot \nto \ntake. \nI \nam  \nafraid \nI \ndidn’t \nhandle \nit \nperfectly \nbecause \nit \nwas  \nso \nnew  \nto \nme  \nand \nit \nwasn’t \nfair \non  \nAdri \nthat \nthe \nearly \ndays \nof \nour \nmarriage \nwere \nput \nunder \nso  \nmuch \nstress. \nThe \nbright \nside \nwas \nwe  \nwere \nreally \ngood \nat \ntalking \nthings \nthrough \ntogether \nand \ngoing \nthrough \nthat \nexperience \nwithout \nAdri \nthere \nwould \nhave \nbeen \nso \nmuch \nharder. \nAnd \nlet’s \nbe \nhonest, \nthis \nwas  \npart \nof \nwhat \nI \nhad \nto \ndo \nto \nbe \na \nrider \nin \na \nfactory \nteam \nand \nhave \nthe \nbike, \ntyres \nand \nsupport \nto \n167 \nS LY Wel al Spee Sas iekhS Ad \n\n168 \nCASEY °S h0ON ER \nrace  well in MotoGP, which was  what I had always wanted to \ndo.  Hopefully my days of unsuitable tyres were over! Joining \na factory team might have meant joining a media circus but it \nalso meant full support at the racetrack and Ducati were keen \nto create an  environment where I was  happy. \nAt my first test in Valencia I noticed a few of my mechanics \ndidn’t seem too  thrilled to be working with me.  The  rumours \naround the paddock had labelled me a difficult rider to work \nwith, plus I was  branded as  a crasher. They hadn’t really met \nme  before but by the end of the first day all that had changed \nand we had the start of a very strong team. I’m thankful to Team \nPrincipal Livio Suppo, who put together a crew of hard-working, \nhighly motivated people, led by my new chief mechanic Cristian \nGabbarini. I wasn’t sure  about having Cristian as my crew chief \nat first as it was  a job he had never done before. Because I was \nrelatively inexperienced I felt I needed somebody with more \nexperience than me  but it turned out  to  be a great decision. \nWe were both like blank canvases ready for fresh ideas, so that \nwhen we  arrived at a new  track we  weren't fixed in our  ways \nabout how the bike was  supposed to be set up or ridden. \nCristian says: ‘Casey already knew Italians and the Italian \nstyle and he felt really, really good with us  from the beginning. \nWhen he wanted some quiet time, he came into the  garage \nand asked me  or  Gabriele, the  electronics guy, “May I sit \nhere a bit at your table or play with my laptop with you guys? \nBecause outside there are  too  many people.” It was  strange \nfor him but  he was like our  younger brother.

It probably \nmade me  more determined to  get things right. We  went to \nJerez at the end of December, just before the winter testing \nban kicked in, and it wasn’t much better. We  did some work \nwith the  engine to  smooth out  the  power delivery under \nacceleration and  I finished just a tenth of a  second behind \nLoris, who had won the  race there earlier in the year. Even \nthough we  had  a lot of problems to  solve I went home for \nChristmas feeling happy. Finally I had people who believed \nin my talent, who were listening to me  and reacting to what I \nwas  saying. When I saw that my feedback had a positive effect \non  the modifications made to the bike  it gave  me  even more \nbelief in myself and I started to trust my own  opinion again, \nsomething I had lost in the 2006 season. It was  nice  to know. \nWe made good progress in the first test of 2007 at Sepang, \nwhere I got a  real  taste of just how  good the  Bridgestone \ntyres were. The stability I was  getting from the  front was \nlike  nothing I had  ever  had  before and  I set  my best  lap of \nthe  three-day test  on  a rear  tyre  that  already had  full  race \ndistance on  it.  The  only thing that  held us  back was  that  I \nstarted getting cramps in my arms but  I wasn’t too  worried. \nI was  in the best shape of my life  after spending the winter \ntraining with Anthony Peden, a top level international track \ncyclist, and  the  cramps cleared up at the  next test  at Phillip \nIsland, which is where the  bike really came good. We  did \n\n154 laps in three days dens and both Loris and I were on  lap \nrecord pace. \nObviously the bike had its  strengths and weaknesses. We \ndidn’t \nhave \nthe \ngrunt \nthat \neverybody \nelse \nhad \nand \nit \ndidn’t \nwant \nto \ncome \nout \nof \nthe \ncorners, \nplus \nI \nthink \npeople \nrealise \nnow  that it didn’t handle all that well. What it did have was  a \nlot of power from the mid range and I took full advantage of \nthat when I could, as  was  the case down the front straight in \nQatar in the opening race  of the season. We'd had a good test \nthere the week before so we  knew we  had good potential and \nwe  confirmed it in qualifying, when I was  just 0.005 seconds \noff the pole position set by Valentino Rossi. \nThe  race  was  pretty much a  22-lap battle between the \ntwo  of us,  Valentino passing me  in the tight sections where I \ncouldn't get the bike turned and  me  getting him  back down \n_the straight, simply because I couldn't get close enough to \nhim  coming out  of the corners to do it anywhere else. Every \ntime he came past me  I had  to wring the bike’s neck just to \nstay close enough to him to get him back again on the straight. \nI knew that  if I didn’t do it every time then the  gap  would \nincrease through the rest of the lap and I would lose touch. We \ngradually wore him down and on  the last three laps he started \nto lose touch. I didn’t realise I had a gap so I kept pushing and \non  the very last lap I set my fastest time of the race. \nIt was  easy to  the  naked eye  to  differentiate the  straight \nline  speed advantage of the  Ducati over the Yamaha but the \naverage person can’t see  how badly a bike  is handling in the \nS WN La SSA SNES eel \n\n172 \nCASE Y*Sa TONER \ncorners, so  naturally there were fans and people in the media \nsaying, “Stoner could only pass him on  the  straight.’ I passed \nhim there because it was  the only place I could pass him, \nsimple as  that. \n(If you look at videos of Dani and me  you can  see  how \nwe  pick the bike up early and  drive it out  of the turn, which \nmakes the bike look faster because you  get more drive onto \nthe straight. People constantly talk about Dani having a top- \nspeed advantage because of his weight but it’s not that, it’s his \nriding style. It’s what Dani has always done and it’s one  of the \nskills I had to work on  throughout my career so  that  I could \nmatch him, or  try to be even better if possible. Some riders, \nand I’m talking about good riders, try to get on  the gas at the \nsame point as  Dani but they are  still on  the  side  of the tyre. \nThey don’t seem to grasp that you need to get the bike up on \nthe fat part of the tyre to get the drive. Or maybe they grasp \nit but they just can’t do it, I don’t know.) \nAt the time, people refused to believe that Valentino could \nbe beaten in a fair battle so  all the credit went to the Ducati’s \ntop \nspeed, \nrather \nthan \nthe \nhard \nwork \nwe \nhad \nput \ninto \ntesting \nas \na \nteam \nor \nour \nperformance \naround \nthe \nrest \nof \nthe \ncircuit \nthat \nwas \nrequired \nto \nstay \nwith \nYamaha \nthrough \nthe \nsections \nwhere \nit \nwas \nfar \nbetter \nsuited. \nIt \nwas \nfrustrating \nto \nus \nbut \nI \nwas \nhappy. \nMy \ncompetitive \nnature \nkicked \nin \nand \nI \nhoped \nI \nhad \nmade \nHonda \nand \nYamaha \nsorry \nthey'd \nnot \ngiven \nme \na \nchance. \nIf \nI \ndid \nthat, \nthen \none \nof \nmy \ngoals \nfor \nthe \nseason \nwas \nalready \nachieved. \nI \ngenuinely \nwasn’t \nexpecting \nto \nwin \nany \nmore \nraces. \n\nI \nguess \nValentino \ndidn’t \nthink \nI \nwould \nbe \na \nbig \nthreat \neither \nand \nhe \nwas  \nquick \nto \ncongratulate \nme  \nafter \nthat \none, \nall \nsmiles \nand \nhandshakes \nand \na \npolite, \n“Well \ndone, \nCasey.’ \nWe \nwent \nto \nthe \nnext \nrace \nat \nJerez, \nwhere \nLoris \nhad \nwon \nthe \nyear \nbefore \non \nthe \n990cc, \nbut \nthe \n800cc \njust \nsucked \nthere. \nIt \nwouldn't \nstop \nbucking \nand \nweaving \nand \nthe \ntyres \ndidn’t \nwork \neither. \nI \ngot \ncaught \nup \nin \na \nbattle \nwith \na \nfew \nguys \nin \nthe \nearly \nlaps, \nlost \nsome \npositions \nand \neven \nthough \nthe \nbike \nhandled \na \nlittle \nsweeter \nafter \nthe \ntyres \nwore \ndown \nit \nwas \nstill \nhard \nto \nride \nand \nour \npodium \nchance \nhad \ngone. \nNext \nup \nwere \nraces \nin \nTurkey \nand \nChina, \ntwo  \ncircuits \nwe’d \nonly \nvisited \na \ncouple \nof \ntimes \npreviously \nand \nwhere \nI’d \nwon \nin \nthe \n250cc \nclass. \nTracks \nthat \ndon’t \nsee  \nmuch \naction \ndon’t \nhave \na \nlot \nof \ngrip \nso  \nit \nis \nhard \nto  \nget \nconfident \nand  \nthe  \nEuropean \nguys \ntend \nto \nstruggle \nthere. \nTo \nme \nit \ndidn’t \nmatter \nthat \nthere \nwasn't \nmuch \ngrip \nand \nI \ndidn’t \nget \ntoo \nobsessed \nabout \nthe \nfact \nI \ndidn’t \nknow \nthe \ntrack. \nAs \nalways \nI \njust \nrode \nto \nwhat \nI \ncould \nsee \nand \nI \nwas \nalways \nextra \ncompetitive \nin \nthose \ncircumstances. \nI \nwon \nby \n6 \nseconds \nin \nTurkey \nand \n3 \nseconds \nin \nChina \nto \nopen \nup \na \nfifteen-point \nlead \nin \nthe \nchampionship \nover \nValentino. \nThat \nstarted \nto \nmake \npeople \nnotice \nus \nbut \nstill \nnot \nin \na \nhuge \nway. \nAs \nif \nthe \nyoung \nAussie \ncould \nkeep \nit \nup. \nWe picked up third in a really tricky wet  race at Le  Mans \nand \nthen \nsuffered \nour \nfirst \nbad \nresult \nin \nDucati’s \nhome \nGrand \nPrix \nat \nMugello. \nWe \nhad \na \nlot \nof \nrain \nduring \npractice, \ndidn’t \nget \nour \nbike \nset \nup \nfor \nthe \nrace \nand \nwe \nwere \nbeaten \nby \nAlex \nBarros \non  \nthe \nsatellite \nDucati. \nThat \nweekend \nwas  \na \nhuge \n173 \nSLIWNIA SsHLl OQNIHS ma \n\n174 \nCASEY STONER \nlearning curve for me  because it was  the first time I had seen \nmy team under real pressure.

It \nwas  nice that Weap (Anthony Peden) was  there too.  For all of \nus  it was  a mixture of emotions: excitement, elation, relief and \nexhaustion after the adrenaline washed away. \nBronwyn Stoner: ‘It was  an  extremely proud moment. I \nwas  just so  happy for Casey. I think I had a delayed reaction \nbecause it wasn’t until about half an  hour later, when Livio \nSuppo walked up to me  and gave me  a hug to celebrate, that \nI burst into tears.’ \nSLIWIT SHL ODNIHSMd \n\n182 \nCASEY STONER \nThere wasn’t much time to let it all soak in because there \nwere endless media appointments and  then as  soon as  they \nwere done we  had to quickly pack everything up, get back to \nthe hotel and  grab our  suitcases for the bus  to  Tokyo and  a \nflight home to Australia. My outstanding memory of that trip \nis that the bus took us  on  all these back roads and I got crook \nbecause I still  hadn’t had  anything in  my stomach after the \nrace. It was  a really weird journey home but by the time we \nlanded in Sydney everything started to  sink in.  It was  pretty \ncrazy to  think that  it was  only seven years since I'd left the \ncountry through that very same airport with my mum, dad and \na suitcase stuffed with a set of Terry Pav’s old leathers having \nnever raced a road bike. \nI spent the week after we  got back out  at the  Shamrock, \ncut  off from everything, spending a  bit  of time with my \nparents and  hanging out  with Chaz, Adriana and my friend \nChris Hillard from Alpinestars, who had been particularly \nsupportive that season. After that we  headed down to \nNewcastle for  a  few  days of golf and  sea  fishing before \ncatching a flight down to Melbourne to do some PR work for \nDorna and  the Australian Grand Prix  Corporation. Day by \nday after winning the World Championship, it started to sink \nin more and  more. We  had a signing session in  Federation \nSquare and there was  an incredible turnout of people queuing \nto  meet me  and  congratulate me.

With its long wheelbase the \nDucati was  well suited to the long, fast corners there and we \nalready had a good setting from the pre-season test. We  had \na couple of issues in practice and  I got held up in qualifying \nso  we  started from third place but  I made one  of my  best \never starts, had the  first corner to  myself and was able to \nconcentrate on  getting the tyres warmed up and ready to go. \nNicky pushed me  hard for a while but it was  just one  of those \ndays where everything was  happening right for me  and I had \na ball.  Winning at home was  exceptionally sweet. \nBeing up on the podium in front of all those Australian fans \nwas  just unbelievable, I’d never felt  anything like  it.  It was \nalso cool because my teammate Loris, who had been good to \nme  all season, was  up  there with me.  With him having won \nthe race in Japan, it was  an  incredible couple of weeks for the \nteam and for Ducati. \nBecoming MotoGP World Champion, winning my home \nGrand Prix and  marrying the  girl I loved weren't the  only \nthree dreams that  came true  in 2007. In the  space of twelve \nmonths there had been quite a big turnaround in our  financial \nsituation and  one  more win  that season, in  Malaysia, helped \ncontribute to  a bonus package that  amounted to  four  times \nmy basic wage for the season. \nI had  to  pinch myself at the  end  of that  season: could it \nget any better! At that point, I could quite happily see  myself \nspending the rest  of my career with Ducati.

It is easy  to  take  your eye  off the  ball \nwhile your competitors become more motivated to beat you. \nLooking back, we  should have put more effort into improving \nthe bike before the start of our World Championship defence \nin 2008. \nA lot  of things could have been done differently and \nincreasing the budget to help Filippo and the  team develop \nthe  bike was  the  main one. It didn’t happen. We  did a brief \ntest  with the  Desmosedici GP8 at Jerez at the  end  of 2007 \nand  I got a revised version in time for the  start of testing at \nSepang. They had changed a few small things on  the rear  end \nand  in  a  lot of ways it was  an  improvement but  it was  very \ndifficult to set  up, which had been our  biggest problem with \nthe GP7. We had huge issues finding a base setting, issues that \nwe  were unable to fix in time for the start of the season, and \nthe worst thing was  that there was  no  second option. The bike \nwe  got for the test was  the bike we  would have for the rest  of \nthe  season, other than the  odd new part or  engine mapping \nupgrade, which usually came too  late anyway. \nIt was  frustrating for me  that  Ducati had not  devoted the \ntime  or resources over  the winter to developing the bike and \nmaking \nsure \nit \nworked \nbefore \nthey \ngave \nit \nto \nus. \nThere \nwere \nlots \nof \nthings \nI \nasked \nto \nbe \nchanged, \nlike \naltering \nthe \nchassis \nstiffness \na \nlittle, \ntrying \nnew \ntriple \nclamps \nand \nproviding \nsome \ndifferent \nswingarm \noptions \ninstead \nof \njust \nthe  \none, \nbut \nthey \n\ndidn’t \nget \nthe \ndevelopment \ndone \nquickly \nenough \nand \nwe  \nsoon \nfell \nbehind \nour  \nrivals. \nIf \nwe  \ndidn’t \nget \nlucky \nand  \nnail  \nan  \nidea \nfirst \ntime \nthen \nit \ntook \nus  \ntoo  \nlong \nto \nreact \nand \nadapt. \nDucati \nis \na \nsmall \nfactory \nbut \nthat  \nshouldn’t \nbe \nan  \nexcuse. \nThey \ncould \nhave \nturned \nthese \nthings \naround \nif \nthey \nwanted \nto. \nYou \ncan \noutsource \nand \ndo \nall \nkinds \nof \nthings \nto \nspeed \nup \ndevelopment, \nbut \nit \nall \ncame \ndown \nto \na \nquestion \nof \nbudget. \nI \nget \nthat, \nbut \nthe \nsuccess \nof \n2007 \nshould \nhave \nbeen \na \nplatform \nto \nmake \nthings \neven \nbetter. \nThree \nyears \nlater \nDucati \nproved \nthey \ncould \ndo \nit, \nwhen \nthey \nproduced \nsomething \nlike \nten \ndifferent \nchassis \noptions \nin \none \nyear. \nYes, \nI \nam \ncomparing \nbecause \nI \nthink \nI \ngot \nfour \nin \nthe \nentire \nfour \nyears \nI \nwas \nthere \nand \nI \nam \nnot \nsure \nwhy \nI \ndidn’t \nget \nthe \nsame \ncommitment, \nespecially \nafter \nproving \nmy \nworth \nas \na \nrider \nand \nshowing \nthe \ninvestment \ncould \npay \noff. \nAs \na \nnewcomer \nto \nthe \nteam \nin \n2007 \nI \nhad \nbitten \nmy \ntongue \non \na \nlot \nof \nmatters \nand \nI \nwas \nmostly \nhappy \nwith \nwhatever \nI \nwas \ngiven \nbecause \nI \nwas \na \nfactory \nMotoGP \nrider \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime. \nI \nwas \nlearning \nand \ntaking \nit \nall \nin. \nBut \nnow \nI \nwas \nWorld \nChampion \nand \nthe \ngoalposts \nhad \nmoved. \nThey \nhad \nto. \nOne \nof \nthe \nlessons \nI’d \nlearnt \nwas \nthat \nI \nhad \nto \nhave \na \nsay \nand \nbe \nlistened \nto. \nIt \nis \nwhy \nI \nwas \nso \nhappy \nworking \nwith \nCristian \nthe \nprevious \nyear \nbecause \nwhen \nJ \ndid \nhave \nan \nopinion \nhe \nwanted \nto \nhear \nit. \nNow \nI \nbelieved \nwe \nneeded \nsignificant \nbacking \nto \nhelp \nus \nstay \non \ntop \nand \nchallenge \nthe \nfactory \nHondas \nand \nYamahas \nbut \nit \ndidn’t \ncome. \nThis \ntime \nI \ndidn’t \nbite \nmy \ntongue \nand I made my feelings known. \n189 \nS LIN Is ta Hele ONES ad \n\n190 \nCASEY osSsTONER \nThe lack of development with the  bike wasn’t the  only \nthing that disappointed me  at the start of that season. Marco \nMelandri had  come in as  my new teammate, which in itself \nwasn't a big problem because Marco is a nice enough guy, but \nhe had come in on a big contract, signed back in 2006 when he \nwas  seen as  one  of the hottest young properties in MotoGP. It \nmeant that even though I had won the championship in 2007, \nMarco still  came in  on  a higher wage than me.  That didn’t \nfeel fair.  Money isn’t  everything but in MotoGP terms it is a \nmeasure of worth and it was  unsettling that our victory didn’t \nseem to be appreciated by everyone at Ducati as  much as  I \nthought it would. \nThere were other positive things happening early in \n2008 that showed that people were taking notice of what \nwe'd achieved. Probably the  most surprising for me  was  my \nnomination as the NSW representative in the Young Australian \nof the Year Awards and even  more surprising was  the fact that \nI was  officially announced the Young Australian of the Year \nand presented the award by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd \nat an  Australia Day celebration in Canberra.

The situation \nwas  no  better for my teammate Melandri, who was  down in \nseventeenth and having a nightmare of a time trying to adapt \nto the bike after moving from Honda. To make matters worse, \none  of Dorna’s onboard camera’s wiring box came loose during \nthe race and was  swinging around my handlebars. The  cable \nwas  wrapping around the clutch lever and the box kept getting \njammed in the  steering column so  I couldn't turn fully into \nthe corners. I kept having to yank it out  of the way but I was \nworried that if I pulled it out  completely it might disconnect \nmy  electronics and  shut the  engine down. It destroyed our \nrace and  even though I received a written apology what we \nreally needed were the points. I finished sixth. \nOur troubles in the opening three rounds of 2008 coincided \nwith the  arrival of a new talent in the  top class of MotoGP. \nSpanish rider Jorge Lorenzo had made a fantastic start to his \nrookie season, qualifying on  pole in Qatar, where he finished \nsecond behind me,  and taking his first win in Portugal. At that \npoint he was  leading the championship, level on  points with \nDani Pedrosa. \nDespite my  first impressions of Jorge in  the  125ccs I \ngot  on  pretty well  with him  during our  days together in \n\nthe \n250cc \nclass \nbut \nafter \nwinning \nthe \nWorld \nChampionship \nin  \nthat \ncategory \ntwice \nhe  \nseemed \nto  \nme  \nto  \nhave \nbecome \narrogant \nbeyond \nbelief. \nI \nremember \nafter \nEstoril \nhe  \nsaid \nsomething \nto \nLivio \nlike, \n“What \nhappened \nto \nStoner? \nA \nproblem \nwith \nthe  \nhead?’ \nHe  \nseemed \nto  \nthink \nhe’d \nbroken \nme \nin \nthat \nrace \nand \nthat \nI \nwas \nweak \nminded. \nHe \nthought \nhis \nsuccess \nwas \nthe \nreason \nfor \nmy \npoor \nresults \nand \nclearly \nhad \nno \nidea \nabout \nthe \nproblems \nwe \nhad \nwith \nthe \ncamera, \nnot \nto \nmention \nthe \nbike. \nA \ncouple \nof \nweeks \nlater \nwe  \nwere \nin \nthe  \npre-event \npress \nconference \nin \nShanghai \nand \nJorge \nmade \na \nsmart \nremark \nlike, \n“Maybe \nthe  \nchampionship \nstarts \nnow \nfor  \nStoner.’ \nI \ncouldn’t \nbelieve \nit \nand \nI'd \nnever \nknown \nsuch \narrogance \nbefore. \nBut \nwhat \nJorge \ndidn’t \nrealise \nat \nthe \ntime \nwas \nthat \nhis \nconfidence, \ngenerated \nby \nhis \nimpressively \nfast \nadjustment \nto \nriding \na \nMotoGP \nbike, \nwas \na \nbig \nreason \nhe \nwas \nso \nquick \nin \nthose \nearly \nraces. \nConfidence \nis \nan \nincredibly \npowerful \ntool \nin \nelite \nlevel \nsport \nbut \nit \ncan \nalso \nbe \nvery \ndangerous, \nespecially \nin \nmotorcycle \nracing. \nHe \nhadn’t \nlearnt \nthat \nyet, \nbut \nhe \nwould. \nWhen a rider starts to  build confidence they push the \nlimits \nof \nthe \nbike \nfurther \nand \nfurther \nuntil \nthey \nfind \nspeed \nthey thought they never had, speed that other riders find it \nimpossible to live with.

In  the  split second that  he hit  the  ground and \nfractured both of his  ankles he also  shattered the  one  thing \nthat had taken him to the top of the championship. Once his \nconfidence was  gone he had nothing left to  fall back on  and \nhe couldn’t have copped any  more of a beating than he did \nthat season. He  had  crash after crash, bringing him back to \nearth so  hard that  he seemed to become scared of the bike. \nFor  a while his results were pretty ordinary, considering the \nequipment he was  on. \nIf there was  one  good thing to  come out  of that whole \nseason it was  that  Jorge seemed to  realise what he’d been \nlike  and  the  next time I had  much to  do with him he was \ncompletely different. Since then he has  become one  of the \nguys that I respect the  most out  of anybody in  the  entire \npaddock. We  had similar issues as  teenagers, and though \nwe  are  very different we  can  relate to  each other in lots  of \nways. I’ve  realised we  just deal with things differently; for \nexample Jorge’s defence mechanism is to be cocky, whereas I \nbecome more introverted and shut down, but we  both can  be \nmisinterpreted because of how we  appear. \nThe  thing I admire most about Jorge is that he admitted \n\n\n\nWNT o} \nIULON MAIDUY © \nHO. \nAfter finishing second to Jorge Lorenzc \nTRC \nRRM \nICOM \nRSS) \n(46) and Dani  Pedrosa (3) for the win \nnext time out at Phillip Island.

We  were able to take three wins in a row  at \nDonington, Assen and  Sachsenring, closing the gap between \nme  and Valentino —  who was  at the top of the championship \n—  to twenty points. \nWhile I wasn’t focused on  any rivalry that was  starting to \ndevelop between me  and Valentino Rossi, the same could not \nbe said for the fans. Around that time I became the target of \na lot of hatred, especially from Valentino’s many followers. \nThe first  signs of it began to  show in  2007 when I started \nbeating him. Mum used to get some nasty emails. \nSadly, she remembers it well. ‘All Casey’s fan mail used to \ncome to  our  computer and  I used to  read all these horrible \nemails. There weren't many of them but  the  ones we  did \nreceive were awful. I had to learn to ignore them; hit delete \nand forget it. Eventually you develop a thick skin because you \nhave to, for self-preservation.’ \nI hated that  my mother was  reading stuff like  this  but  it \ndidn’t bother me  personally most of the time. There was  one \nincident at Donington Park that has stuck in my mind though. \nAfter I won the race I was  waving to the crowd on  the cool- \ndown lap and I caught sight of a lady, who must have been in \nher sixties, giving me  the  “‘V’  sign —  and  it wasn’t for victory! \nI couldn't believe it.  I was  shocked because she  looked like \nsomeone’s grandma. I’m not  saying this about all British fans, \nnot  at all, but there is certainly a number of them who treat \nracing like  some kind of war  and  have to  have an  enemy in \ntheir sights. For so  many years Valentino had been their hero \n\nand  \nanybody \nwho \ncame \nalong \nto  \nchallenge \nhim  \nwas  \nthe \nbad \nguy, \nwhether \nit \nwas \nMax \nBiaggi, \nSete \nGibernau, \nJorge \nLorenzo \nor \nmyself. \nThere \nwas  \nan  \neven \nworse \nincident \na \nyear \nlater, \nagain \nat \nDonington, \nwhen \nI \nwas \nreally \nsick. \nI \nhad \nno \nstrength \nand \nlost \nthe  \nfront \nin  \neither \nCoppice \nor  \nMcLeans \ncorner, \nI \ncan’t \nremember \nwhich, \nand  \ncrashed \nduring \npractice. \nRiding \nback \nalong \nthe \nservice \nroad \non  \nthe \nback \nof \nthe \nscooter \nthat \npicked \nme \nup \nthere \nwere \npeople \nswearing \nand \nspitting \nat \nme, \na \ncouple \nof \nthem \neven \njumped \nin \nfront \nof \nus \ntrying \nto \nmake \nthe \nguy \nriding \nthe \nscooter \nlose \ncontrol \nand \ncrash. \nA day or  two earlier in  the  “Day of Champions’ auction, \nwhen \nall \nthe \nriders \ngo \nalong \nand \ndonate \nsigned \nmemorabilia \nin \norder \nto \nraise \nmoney \nfor \nthe \nRiders \nfor \nHealth \ncharity, \nI \nhad \nbeen \nbooed \nas \nI \nstepped \nonto \nthe \nstage. \nThat \ndidn’t \nfeel \ngreat, \nI \nhave \nto \ntell \nyou. \nAfter \nthat \nI \nrefused \nany \nphysical \nappearances \nat that event.

For me  to get that kind of reaction \nin a country where I had  spent so  much time and had a lot \nof friends, a country where my dad’s family came from, was \nparticularly hurtful. Maybe someone who  could put on  the \ncharm when they need it regardless of sincerity could have \nturned the  situation around but  I don’t have that  skill. I am \nwho I am  and  I can’t fake feeling good or  liking something \nI don't. \nThe  way  fans treated me  seemed to  get worse after the \nfamous battle between me  and Valentino in the next round at \nLaguna Seca, a race that will probably always be remembered \nfor Rossi’s pass on  me  in the  Corkscrew. Obviously I wasn't \nhappy about that particular move but there were other things \nthat happened that weren't caught on  camera. \nThe truth is that for a lot of the race  Valentino was  riding \nreally well. He  did  a  fantastic job. Our bike wasn’t very \nnimble and we  only had one  line  to ride  around that circuit \nand  he was  smart and  realised that. Nowadays he  knows \nit only too  well but  with the  Ducati you  don’t have many \noptions when it  comes to  getting it  around the  corner. \nValentino knew that by getting in  front of me  at  every \nopportunity he could make it very hard for me  to  get back \nin front of him. Whenever I did take the lead his only option \nwas  to hit back immediately to stop me  from getting away. A \nlot \nof \nit \nwas \nfair \nracing, \nhe \nwas \nout-braking \nme \non \nthe \ninside \nand  riding better than me  around a lot of the  track.

Laguna Seca was  one  of the occasions where he had to \nget \na \nresult. \nAfter \nwinning \nthree \nraces \nin \na \nrow \nI \nwas \non \na \nroll \nand \nwe \nhad \ncarried \nour \nform \nto \nAmerica. \nI \nwas \nfastest \nby \nmore \nthan \nhalf \na \nsecond \nin \nevery \nfree \npractice \nsession \nand \ncomfortably set pole ahead of Valentino, with a race pace that \nwas  a good second quicker than his. Riding what I considered \noverly aggressive was  the only way that he could win that day \nunless I crashed, so  that’s what he did. \nIt is  funny how many people use  that one  race as  an \nargument to  prove that Valentino had the better of me, \nS LVN iit Sia SN AS Bie \n\n200 \nCASEY eSmron ea \nregardless of the number of times I beat him before and after. \nBut I know that whole experience made me a lot stronger as a \nrider and as  a person. I gained a better understanding of how \nto deal with other riders when they push like that. From that \npoint on  maybe I didn’t always ride  as  gentlemanly as  I had \ndone in the past and I decided that if I saw  a space I was  going \nto take it. To the riders who showed respect I was  the same as \nalways but for those who didn’t show respect, I was  over being \nnice to them. That change in mindset definitely helped me  in \ncertain situations over the following seasons. \nIn the next round at Brno the bike was  working pretty well \nall weekend and  I qualified on  pole by over a  second in the \nwet but made a mistake on  the seventh lap of the race, lost the \nfront and  slipped off.  Looking at the  lap times I could have \nprobably still finished on  the podium if I got back on  the bike \nbut it wouldn't restart. The reason why pretty much summed \nup my season. After examining the bike back in the garage the \nteam showed me a rock, the  exact size  and half-moon shape \nto fit into the butterfly valves and jam them closed. There was \nprobably no  other rock in that gravel trap that  would have \ndone it. It was  just not  meant to happen. \nLots of people thought I crashed that day because Valentino \nhad got into  my head but that is not  the case and they were \nreading far too  much into  it. When I go out  to  race I try to \nwin, it’s as  simple as that. I’m not looking at the bigger picture, \nat the championship or  things that have gone on before with \nother riders.

We decided to keep going and wait \nuntil the end of the season. Maybe it wasn’t the right decision \nbut  I was there to  race and I was sure I could, even with a \nbuggered wrist. \nI had to have my wrist strapped up so  tightly for the  race \nat Misano, just to keep my thumb in position, that I couldn't \nuse  my fingers or  hand properly. It gave me  bad  arm  pump \n(basically your arms pump up full  of blood and  the  muscles \nswell and  block the  nerves, leading to  a  loss  of power and \ncontrol) but it was the  only way to  keep the  wrist from \ncollapsing under braking. Also, in certain positions on the bike \nthe nerves would get trapped by the floating bone and  send \na shooting pain up my arm. It held up pretty well in the race \nbut  unfortunately we’d made a  bad  decision with the  front \ntyre, putting a lap on  it in the morning warm-up to scrub it in. \nIt was a tactic we  had tried before with no  problem but this \ntime it didn’t feel right from the start and it let go after six laps. \nStill, we  came back to win  two  more races before the end \nof the season, including my home Grand Prix at Phillip Island, \nand  I finished the 2008 season as  runner-up to  Rossi on  280 \npoints, a new record for a rider not winning the championship. \nAt the end of the season Adri and I went back to Italy so  I \ncould have the bone graft at a specialist hospital in Modena. \nHere, the staple was  removed, along with a couple of pieces \nof \nfloating \nbone, \nand \nreplaced \nby \ntiny \nscrews. \nAfter \nthat \nwe \nheaded back to  Switzerland, where Adri and I had set  up \nhome, \nfor \nsome \nrest \nand \nrecuperation. \nThe \noperation \nmeant \nI \n\nwasn’t \nable \nto \ntrain \nproperly \nfor \nthe \nmajority \nof \nthe \noff-season \nbut \nI \nwas  \nstill \nfocused \non  \nmy \nfitness \nso \nwas  \ndoing \nwhat \nI \ncould \nto  \nmaintain \nthat. \nAt \nthe  \nstart \nof \nthe  \n2009 \nseason \nI \nwas \nthe  \n- \nfittest I’d ever been. \nThe \nGP9 \nwas  \nprobably \nthe  \nbest \nbike \nI \nhad  \nat  \nDucati. \nIt \nfeatured \na \ncarbon \nchassis \nthat \nwe’d \nfirst \ntried \nat \nthe \nBarcelona \ntest  \nin \n2008 \nand \nwe'd \nbegged \nto  \nhave \nit \nfor \nthe  \nsecond \nhalf \nof \nthe  \nseason. \nIt \nwould \nhave \ngiven \nus  \na  \nmuch \nbetter \nchance \nof \nchallenging \nfor \nthe  \nchampionship \nbut  \nthere \nwas  \nno  \nway \n_ \nwe  \nwere \ngetting \nit \nthat  \nseason. \nAt \nDucati \nwe  \nwould \nget \na \nlot \nof \nthings \nthat \nwe  \nasked \nfor \nbut \nunfortunately \nalways \nseveral \nmonths \ntoo \nlate, \nby \nwhich \ntime \nyou \nneeded \nthe \nnext \nthing \nand \nwould \nhave \nto \nwait \nanother \nsix \nto \neight \nmonths. \nWe \nhad \nsome \nteething \nproblems \nwith \nthe \nnew  \nbike \nat \nthe \nstart \nof \nthe \n2009 \nseason \nand \nit \nstill \nwasn’t \nthe \neasiest \nthing \nto \nset \nup \nby \nany \nmeans \nbut \nwe \nmanaged \nto \nget \nit \nmoving \nokay. \nAfter \nwinning \nthe \nopening \nrace \nin \nQatar \nwe \nhad \nan \nissue \nwith \nthe \nbrakes \nin \nJapan \nand \nsalvaged \nfourth. \nWe \ngot \na \npodium \nat \nJerez \nwhere \nthe \nbike \nnever, \never \nworked, \nand \nthen \nhad \na \nproblem \nwith \nthe \nsteering \ndamper \nat \nLe \nMans \nand \nfinished \nfifth. \nOn \npaper \nit \nwasn’t \nour \nbest \nstart \nto \na \nseason \nbut \nour \nrivals \nhad \ntheir \nproblems \ntoo \nand \na \nfirst \nwin \nfor \nus \nat \nMugello \nin \nround \nfive \nput \nus \nfour \npoints \nclear \nof \nLorenzo \nat \nthe \ntop \nof \nthe \nstandings. \nWe \nknew \nthat \nthis \nbike \nhad \nreal \npotential \nand \nwe \nstill \nhadn’t \ngot \nto \nthe \ntracks \nwhere \nwe \nusually \nexcel \nat, \nso \nwe \nwere \nfeeling \nconfident \nthat \nwe \nstood \na \nvery \nstrong \nchance \nof winning the championship back. \n203 \nSLAW) Se SING ed Sd \n\n204 \nCASEY- STONER \nThen something started to go wrong that I couldn't explain. \nAfter the  race at  Mugello I was  a lot more tired than I had \never  felt in a race. I was  surprised because I had been training \nwell with Anthony, so  I didn’t really understand it and just \nshrugged it off as  a  one-off. Then during warm-up on  the \nmorning of the  next race in  Barcelona I was  worn out  after \njust a few laps. I was  so  tired I went back to bed and slept for \ntwo  hours. \nThat afternoon was  when it really hit, exactly as  everybody \nsaw  on  the television. It didn’t come on  slowly, the fatigue hit \nme  with a big bang after about five  laps. One minute I was \nokay and then suddenly I had so  little strength that I was  just \nhanging on  to  the  bike by the  end of the  race, so  exhausted \nthat  I could barely get off it in parc fermé. I couldn’t walk or \ntalk, I just wanted to  throw up  and  almost collapsed on  the \npodium. \nI had seen doctors about some tiredness back in Australia \nin \n2006. \nThey \nsaid \nI \nhad \nchronic \nfatigue \nsyndrome, \nwhich \nthey \nput down to a combination of my diet and my busy schedule. \nBut \nthis \ntime \nit \nwas \nfar \nmore \nserious \nand \nit \nseemed \nthat \nno \nmatter \nwhat \nI \ntried \nto \ndo \nto \nmake \nmyself \nbetter \nI \nonly \ngot \nworse. \nI \nstarted \nhaving \nmore \nrecovery \ndrinks \nmade \nup \nof \nmilk \nand \nwhey \npowder \nand \nmy \ncondition \ncontinued \nto \ndeteriorate \neven \nmore \nrapidly. \nI \ndidn’t \nsuspect \nthat \nwhat \nI \nwas \ndoing \nto \nhelp was  causing even more problems. \nWe  battled on  and  I managed to  pick up  third at Assen, \nfourth \nat \nLaguna \nSeca \nand \nfourth \nat \nSachsenring \nbut \nby \n\nthe  end  of every race I was  struggling just to  stay upright. \nI couldn’t concentrate for  more than a  few  laps at  a  time \nand  I had become something I hate even more than losing: \nI'd become a  danger to  other riders. Nobody knew more \nthan me  that  things weren’t good but  the  tension started to \nbuild with Ducati as well. I'd seen every doctor and specialist \nthey had wanted me  to see,  in Europe and in the USA and I \nhad every test imaginable. I felt like a pin cushion but they all \ncame back saying it was  in my head or  that I had a hormone \nimbalance, which was  nonsense. There were lots  of theories \nbut  no  diagnosis and  nothing I tried made me  feel  better. \nDucati weren’t happy and  I could feel  that  but when they \nstarted making announcements about my condition without \nmy consent, that really disappointed me. \nThings reached a  head at  Donington Park, where there \nwas  some confusion on  the  grid over  tyre  choice because it \nhad started raining. The sensible option was  to go with slicks, \nwhich is what all the  other guys at the  front were running, \nand  then come in to  change if the  rain  got heavier. On  the \nother hand if the rain came quickly then it would be a massive \nadvantage to be on  wets from the  start. It was  a big gamble \nbut I insisted on  running wets. \nTo my team and to the outside world it looked like a crazy \ndecision but as  far as  I was  concerned I was  playing my last \ncard. I knew that  if it stayed dry I had  no  chance anyway \nbecause the  physical demands of riding the  bike  on  slicks \nare  so  much higher, I didn’t think I could make it to the end. \n205 \nS CON 2) patie SN) eS ac \n\n206 \nCASEY STONER \nMy only hope of staying in the championship was  to pray for \na  downpour, pick up  some points and try to  figure out  my \nproblem before the next race. \nBecause the  team were convinced that  everything was  in \nmy head they clearly weren't happy with my choice and they \nlet me  know about it. We had won a title together, I had been \nequal top in the championship after Barcelona and I'd given \neverything I had  for us  to  do that. Now I needed Ducati to \nstand by me  but I felt like they were giving up on  me  instead. \nThey started talking to me  about my training, telling me  what \nI \nneeded \nto \ndo \nto \nget \nmy \nfitness \nlevels \nback \nup, \nbut \nnone \nof \nthem \nhad \nany \nidea \nwhat \nI \nwas \ngoing \nthrough. \nI \ncould \nhave \nskipped training for two  years and  still  feel  stronger than I \ndid \nat \nthat \npoint. \nIt \nwas \nall \nridiculous. \nIt \nwas \nvery \nfrustrating \nbecause \nthere \nwas \nsomething \nphysically \nwrong \nwith \nme \nbut \nno \none \nknew \nwhat \nit \nwas, \nit \nwould \nhave \nbeen \ndisturbing \nif \nI \nwas  happy while all this was  going on. \nColin \nStoner: \n‘I \ncould \nsee  \nthe  \ndesperation \nin  \nCasey \nat \nDonington \nand  \nthe  \nprevious \nrounds. \nHe  \nwas \nvery \nill \nand, \nafter \nconsulting \nDr \nHalpin \nin \nAustralia, \nBronwyn \nand \nI \ntalked \nwith \nCasey \nand \nAdri \nand \nit \nwas \ndecided \nthe \nbest \nthing \nwas \nto \nbring \nCasey \nhome \nfor \nfurther \nmedical \ntests \nand \nrest. \nHe \nwould \nmiss \nBrno, \nIndianapolis \nand \nMisano \nbut \nhopefully \nit \nwould \nmean \nhe \ncould \nfind \nout  \nwhat \nwas  \nwrong \nand  \nget \ntreatment.’ \nThe \nnews \nof \nme  \nheading \nback \nto \nAustralia \ndidn’t \ngo \ndown \nwell \nand \nI \ngot \nan  \nemail \nfrom \nClaudio \nDomenicali, \nwho \nwas \n\nCEO \nof \nDucati \nCorse, \nbasically \nsaying, \n‘I \nhope \nyou \ndon’t \nexpect \nto \nget \npaid \nfor \nthis.’ \nFilippo \nPreziosi \nand \nLivio \nSuppo \nstayed \nloyal \nto  \nus  \nthe \nwhole \ntime \nand  \nso  \ndid  \nCarlo \nBonomi, \nwho \nwas  \npresident \nof \nthe  \ninvestment \ncompany \nthat \nowned \nDucati, \nbut \nunfortunately \nthe  \nsame \nwas  \nnot  \ntrue \nfor \nmost \nof \ntheir \nupper \nmanagement. \nIt \nwas \nextremely \ndisappointing \nnot \nto \nhave \nthe \nsupport \nof \nmy \nemployers \nduring \none  \nof \nthe \nmost \ndifficult \ntimes \nof \nmy \nlife. \nBut \nI \nknew \nthat \nif \nI \ndidn’t \nget \nto \nthe \nroot \nof \nmy \nproblem \nthen \nI \nwas \nfacing \nthe \nend \nof \nmy \ncareer, \nit \nwas \nas \nsimple \nas \nthat. \nI \nwent \nback \nto \nNewcastle \nto \nsee  \nDr \nNeil \nHalpin, \na \nspecialist \nsports \nphysician, \nwho \nhad \nbeen \nmy \ndoctor \nsince \n2006. \nNeil \nis \na \nfantastic \ndoctor \nbut \nalso \na \ngreat \nguy \nand \nsomebody \nwho \nalways \nmakes \nme \nfeel \nvery \nmuch \nat \nease. \nHe \nis \nalso \nthe \nofficial \ndoctor \nfor \nthe \nSydney \nRoosters \nand \nNewcastle \nKnights \nrugby \nleague \nteams \nso \nhe \nis \nused \nto \ndealing \nwith \nprofessional \nathletes \nand \nI \ntrusted \nhis \nopinion \nmore \nthan \nanybody \nelse’s. \nDr Halpin states now: “There had been accusations or the \nsuggestion \nthat \nit \nwas \na \npsychological \nmatter, \nthat \nCasey'd \nlost \ninterest \nin \nhis \nprofession, \nbut \nI \nsaw \nno \nevidence \nof \nthat \nwhatsoever. \nThere \nwas \na \nsuggestion \nalso \nof \ndepression \nbut \nI \nalways \nthink \nthat \nin \nsport, \nparticularly, \ndepression \nis \na \nchicken- \nand-egg \nproblem. \nIf \nyou \ncan’t \ndo \nyour \njob \nbecause \nyou \nare \nill \nand \nthe \npeople \nwho \nare \nsupposed \nto \ntrust \nyou \nlose \ntheir \nfaith \nin \nyou, \nit \nwould \nbe \nno \nsurprise \nthat \nyou \nmight \nbecome \ndepressed.

The media often turn to  former riders for  an \nopinion, which would be a  good thing if they stuck to  what \nthey know. Sadly, often their opinions are  outdated and they \ndon’t know the  half of it but  talk  endlessly as  if they do.  In \nthis case, Kevin Schwantz knew nothing about my  medical \ncondition and  shouldn't have commented on  something he \nknew nothing about. For somebody who has been through a \nlot of tough times himself with injuries and  such, you would \nthink he might understand. It was  disappointing but he wasn’t \nthe only one  who had something to say. \nEverybody had their own  opinions. A rider doesn’t go from \nbeing ultra-competitive for two  years and then just drop off \nthe  face of the  earth because it’s  ‘in  his  head’. It is absurd \nfor anybody to  even think that.

We arrived a week \nbefore the race in Portugal and I said to Adriana, “You know, \nbecause I got so sick after Darwin I never actually finished off \nthe  lactose test  properly.’ We  decided to  try it again, just to \nbe sure. As the week went on  and lactose started to leave my \nsystem I started to feel better. Because I hadn’t done anything \nto exert myself that week I wasn’t sure  if it was  working or not. \nIt wasn’t until the  Friday, when I got back on  the bike that I \nrealised there was  a massive difference. \nI struggled a bit with arm pump in the first free practice, \nwhich was  to be expected because I hadn’t been on  the bike \nfor two  months, but  otherwise I felt  good and  there was no \nhint \nof \nthe \nextreme \nexhaustion \nfrom \nthe \nlast \ntime \nI \nhad \nridden \nat \nDonington \nPark. \nI \nfinished \nfourth \nquickest, \n0.7 \nseconds \noff \nthe fastest time, and on  the  second day I got faster, finishing \nsecond \nin \nfree \npractice \nand \nthird \nin \nqualifying. \nOn \nthe \nSunday \nmorning \nI \nwas \nfastest \nin \nthe \nwarm-up, \ntwo-tenths \nof \na \nsecond \nquicker \nthan \nDani, \nbut \nstill \nI \ncouldn’t \nbe \nsure \nof \nmy \nexact \ncondition until we  had gone the full race distance. \nThere \nwas  \nno  \nbeating \nJorge \nthat \nday \nand  \nhe \ntook \noff \nat \nthe \nfront \nbut \nafter \nbattling \nwith \nDani \nfor \nthe \nfirst \nfew \nlaps \nI \ngot \nmyself \nup \nto \nsecond \nplace \nand \ncreated \na \n1.5-second \ngap. \nI \nkept \nhammering \nthe  \nlap \ntimes, \nwhich \nwere \nonly \naround \na \ntenth \nof \na \nsecond \nslower \nthan \nJorge, \nand  \nall \nthe \nwhile \nI \nwas \nexpecting \nto \ndie \nhalfway \nthrough \nthe \nrace \nbut \nit \nnever \ncame. \nI \nkept \nhammering \nthe  \nwhole \nrace, \nstayed \ncomfortably \nin \nfront \nof \nDani \nand \nbrought \nit \nhome \nin \nsecond \nplace. \nThat \nwas \n\na fantastic feeling, indeseribable really. From thinking that \nmy career could be over for good I now  had reason to believe \nthat  I could come back stronger and better than ever. I had \nsomething to prove, too. \nBefore going back to Australia for the next race at Phillip \nIsland we  decided to try lactose again, just to  confirm that it \ndefinitely was  the source of the problem. Within the next  day \nor two  I started losing my usual energy. In a way, this made us \nhappy because I could finally confirm what the problem was. \nAfter that it was  like a whole new  world. For ten  years it had \nseemed to me  that a lot of food tasted the same and I could go \na whole day without eating and not  be hungry. Once I knew \nwhat the problem was  and knew what to do everything started \nto smell and taste good. Even the amount I ate  doubled! \nAdriana could see  a huge difference almost straight away. \nAnd not just physically: ‘I love  cooking but any time I'd ever \nput anything on  the table for Casey in the past, even though \nhe was  always polite, I could tell he wasn’t enthusiastic about \nit.  I was like, “I just cooked that for you!” Now he  actually \nstarted to enjoy my cooking and that was  one  of the happiest \ndays of my life.’ \nFor  a while I didn’t go near lactose at  all but  then we \ndiscovered Lacteeze tablets and with them I can  pretty much \neat anything I want. Adri makes tacos, creamy pasta sauce with \nvegies and traditional Slovakian dishes like svieckova, which is \nbeef in a carrot sauce, and knedle bread. I could finally eat my \nfavourite dessert —  sticky date pudding with custard —  without \n213 \nS LVN SeiebeaNielS fia \n\n214 \nCASEY STONER \ngetting sick  afterwards. I was  always pretty skinny and  even \nthough I trained my backside off I never put any weight on. \nBut  now my body suddenly started filling out  and  I started \nto  actually put weight on  and  gain some body fat, which I'd \nnever had before. \nI know now  that there are  so  many people out  there with \nlactose intolerance who don’t even know it.

Both riders were extremely \nfast  but  I don’t think either approach did  them any  favours \nin the  long run. There has  to  be a happy medium. Anthony \nalways says, ‘Happy mind, fast body.’ You have to  train, \nthere is  no  way around it, but  you can’t become obsessed \nwith it.  If you  allow that to  happen then you  forget what’s \nimportant. N owadays riders are  getting overly obsessed with \ncycling. They focus so  much on being a cyclist that they forget \nabout their upper body. Having strong legs and cardiovascular \nfitness is important but  there is so  much more to  riding a \nbike than that. Generally my  training combines cycling \nwith circuit training, supersets, things like  that.

He is \nso honest, with himself and others, that for him it is impossible \nto make excuses. This is one  of his personality traits I admire \nthe most.’ \nThis honesty can  sometimes get me  in  trouble but  it is \none  of the  main reasons why I was  able to  ride  the  Ducati \ncompetitively when nobody else  could. Whatever was  wrong \nwith that bike, I didn’t let it defeat me.  If anything it actually \nmotivated me  even more to keep trying. If I made a mistake \nwhen the bike was  good and  ruined a weekend I didn’t look \nat anybody but  myself to blame. I got a lot of criticism over \nthe  years for being honest because I always felt  I could do \nbetter. Even if I won the  race, if I had  made mistakes it was \nimportant for me  to  admit them and  address them for next \ntime instead of congratulating myself for being the  best on \nthat particular day. \nThere were times when I would be 2 seconds a lap quicker \nthan any other Ducati on track but I never used that as a reason \nto  stop trying. I could have easily done that  and  everybody \nwould have forgiven me,  but  if anything it would make me \nthink that 2 seconds wasn’t enough —  I'd want to be 3 seconds \nfaster. That desire to constantly challenge myself when there \nwas  no  other challenge around, goes  right back to those first \ndays I ever  rode a dirt-bike with just myself or  my sister for \ncompany, this was  the foundation of every success I ever had. \nAfter that podium in Portugal we  picked up back-to-back \nwins at Phillip Island and  Sepang, meaning that I still had a \n217 \nSLI UN US) “Seb SING et Sele \n\n218 \nCASEY STONER \nmathematical chance of challenging Jorge for second in the \nchampionship going into the  final round at Valencia, which \nis amazing considering how much racing we  had missed that \nseason. Unfortunately that  chance disappeared before the \nrace  even started because of a faulty tyre warmer. Unbeknown \nto  me  or  the  team I had been sitting on  the  grid for twenty \nminutes with  a cold  tyre and I crashed on  the warm-up lap. \nIt wasn’t the ideal way to finish the season but it didn’t really \nmatter in the grand scheme of things. I was  back to competing \nand knew I could do better. \nThe most important thing was  that  we  had  salvaged my \ncareer and  I could now look forward to  trying to  win  the \nchampionship in 2010. One thing I was  clear about, though, \nwas  that I wanted to  win  it for myself and  for my team, but \nnot \nfor \nthe \ncompany. \nAfter \nthe \nway \nthey’d \nbehaved \nI \nhad \npretty \nmuch \ndecided \nthat \nI \nwas \nthrough \nwith \nDucati \nand \neven \nthough \nthey \nput \na \nnew \ncontract \nin \nfront \nof \nme, \nfor \n2011 \nand \n2012, \nit \nwas \ngoing \nto \ntake \na \nmuch \ngrander \ngesture \nto \nmake \nme  Stay. \nI told  them I wanted them to  show me  what I meant to \nthem. \n‘What \ndo \nyou \nmean?’ \nthey \nsaid. \n“That’s \nup \nto \nyou,’ \nI \ntold \nthem. \nI \ngave \nthem \nmonths \nto \ndo \nit \nand \nnothing \nhappened. \nIn \nthe \nend \nI \nhad \nto \nspell \nit \nout. \nI \nsaid, \n“Rip \nup \nmy \ncurrent \ncontract \nand \nshow \nme \nwhat \nI \nam \nworth \nto \nyou.’ \nThey \nwouldn’t \ndo \nit, \nand \nthat \ntold \nme \nall \nI \nneeded \nto \nknow. \nUp \nuntil \nthen \nthere \nwas \na \nchance \nthat \nI'd \nstay \nbut \nthat \neffectively \nmade \nmy \ndecision \neasy. \nI \ndecided \nto  \nfollow \nthe  \none \ndream \nI \nhad \nleft  \nin \nracing \n\nand go where I had always wanted to go.  I signed a contract \nfor the 2011 season with Honda in the  second round of the \n2010 season at Jerez. \nI should have expected it but  once that deal was  done \nDucati shut down development on  our  side  of the garage. It \nsucked because once again we  had started the year with a bike \nthat  wasn’t great. We  had  been forced to  run  a new 48mm \nOhlins front fork that everybody else was using, which was \nbetter over the bumps but because we  already had  a carbon \nfibre chassis it added to the  stiffness. We  ended up having a \nlot of front-end crashes, always in the middle of the corner. I \ncould load it up fine on  the way in but when you were in the \nmiddle of the  corner, controlling the  throttle, that’s when it \nwould go and there was  no  way to  feel  it or  get it back. We \ntried so  many different things to sort  it out but particularly at \nthe beginning of the season we just couldn't get to grips with it. \nI went down in Qatar and didn’t have a clue what happened, \nsame thing at  Le  Mans, and after five  rounds we  were still \nlooking for our  first podium. We’d gone back to 42mm forks \nin the  fourth round at  Mugello, which were a lot better but \nbecause we  had such a stiff chassis it didn’t want to work with \na soft fork either. We learnt a lot about setting the bike up and \neventually got it working with a very unique setting, which \nallowed us  to  get on  the  podium at Assen and  for the  next \nfour races after that. \nThe year dragged out and I didn’t think I was  going to get a \nwin but I was  never going to give up.

I knew that bike wasn’t capable of winning \nthat day but I was  going for it. \nI can  honestly say I was  pushing the limit on  every single \nlap, except for maybe the  last  two  when I had a slight gap. \nDovi was  right behind me  the whole way with Valentino not \nmuch further back and Jorge right behind him and the three \nof them didn’t let go.  I was  on  the  mat  every single lap but \nI managed not  to  make a  single mistake. I was  physically \ndestroyed at  the  end  because I had  put  so  much effort \nin and the next Ducati was  so  far back it wasn’t funny; about \n50 seconds behind me  in twelfth place. \nWe finished the season with one  more win at Phillip Island, \nmaking it just three for the season but each one  of them was \nparticularly sweet to  me  because we  knew we  had  done it \nagainst the  odds, on  a  bike that shouldn't really have been \nwinning. It has taken Valentino Rossi to go to Ducati and fail \nfor people to realise that maybe I was  better than what people \nfirst thought. \nDucati have tried to blame Filippo Preziosi, who designed \nthe Desmosedici, for their problems but that isn’t fair. I believe \nthat if we  had been given the right support at the right time \nwe  could have made a really great bike together. I know it isn’t \nhealthy to contemplate what might have been but sometimes \nyou  can’t help it.  It wouldn’t have taken much to  change \nthings in 2008 and if I’d had no  health problems in 2009 and \na good working relationship in 2010 we  could have feasibly \nwon one or  even three more championships for Ducati in  a \n221 \nSL PN eh eethHiee.

To hear that belief \nafter Ducati had doubted me  was a very welcome validation, \nespecially from a company as  big as  Honda.

\nbeing \npassed \nby \nhim \nat  \nthat \n\npoint of the race so  I gave him plenty of room but there was \nno  way he was  going to make the corner and sure  enough he \nlost the front, taking me  down with him. \nAfter eventually finishing fifth  in  a  race  won by Jorge, \nwith Dani second, Valentino came around to  our  garage to \n‘apologise’, although the fact he was  still wearing his helmet \ntells you how sincere the gesture was.  I made a comment that \nwas  picked up by the television cameras that, as he well knew, \nhad  followed him into our  garage: “Clearly your ambition \noutweighed your talent.’ \nI said it lightly but I meant it. Everybody had built Valentino \nup to be this great motor racing genius. They thought he was \nbetter than everybody else racing against him in the past and \nit gave him great confidence, which snowballed into further \nsuccess. Winning became a habit and he drew great strength \nfrom that. This is just my opinion but I genuinely feel that if \nhe had come through during a more difficult era,  like the one \nmyself, Dani, Jorge, Dovi and Simoncelli came through, he \nwouldn't have enjoyed the  same level of success early in his \ncareer and  he wouldn't have developed into  the  same rider \nas  a result. \nOf course after Jerez I took another hammering from the \npress, who accused me  of disrespecting a  great champion, \nbut  I stand firmly by my comment to  this  day. There was \nnever a truer word said. It doesn’t matter about Rossi’s past \nachievements or  seeming greatness, at that  moment in time \nhis ambition outweighed his talent, simple as that. That is why \n229 \nS'LIN Ts Sse SNA S alse \n\n230 \nCASE YS rONER \nhe crashed instead of making the pass. And of course I was \nangry, \nhe \nnot \nonly \ntook \nme \ndown \nwith \nhim, \nI \nalso \nlost \ntwenty- \nfive points to my strongest rival in a championship fight he was \nnever going to be a part of. \nIt is important to me  that people realise I always have a lot \nof \nrespect \nfor \nall \nof \nmy \ncompetitors, \nbut \nI \ncan’t \nsay \nthat \nabout \nValentino \nbecause \nI \nfeel \nhe \nshows \nnone \nin \nreturn. \nHe \nrarely \naccepts \nwhen \nhe \nhas \nbeen \nbeaten \nby \nthe \nbetter \nman \non \nthe \nday; \nif \nhe \ngets \nbeaten \nit’s \nbecause \nthe \nother \nrider’s \nbike \nis \nbetter. \nThe level of respect that Dani, Jorge and myself show for \neach \nother \nis \nsomething \nthat’s \nbeen \nmissing \nat \nthe \ntop \nlevel \nof \nthe \nsport \nfor \ntoo \nmany \nyears. \nThe \nfirst \ntime \nI \nbeat \nValentino \nin \nQatar \nhe \nrubbed \nme \non \nthe \nhead, \ncongratulated \nme \nand \nall \nthe \nrest \nof \nit. \nHe \nobviously \nthought \nthat \nwas \na \nfluke. \nAs \nsoon \nas \nI \nbecame \na \nfierce \ncompetitor \neverything \nwas \ndifferent \nbut \nit wasn’t me  who changed. \nI \nwarned \nFilippo \nPreziosi \nright \nat  \nthe  \nstart \nthat \nsigning \nValentino \nwas \na \nno-win \nsituation \nfor \nhim. \n‘If \nhe \nwins \nhe'll \nsay \nit’s \nbecause \nof \nhim, \nif \nhe \nloses \nhe \nwill \nblame \nyou \nand \nthe \nbike,’ \nI \ntold \nhim. \nSure \nenough \nhe \nlost \nand \nFilippo \nwas \nmoved \nsideways, \nwhich \nmakes \nme \nsad \nbecause \nI \nknow \nthere \nwas \nnothing \nfundamentally \nwrong \nwith \nthat \nbike. \nI \nthink \neverybody \nthought \nValentino \nand \nJeremy \nBurgess \n(JB) \nwere \ngoing \nto \ndevelop \nthe \nbike \nbecause \nthey \nhad \nthis \nreputation \nafter \nturning \nthe \nYamaha \naround. \nThey \npeddled \nthis \nnotion \nthat \nit \nwas \nnot \njust \nabout \nthem \ngoing \nfast \nbut \nabout \ndeveloping \na \nbike \nthat \neverybody \ncould \nride, \nwhich \nwas \na \nload \nof \nrubbish \n\nand  it was  proven so  in the  two  years they tried. Now they \nspeak badly about Ducati not  listening to  them and  seem \nto be echoing my words. In reality, Ducati did anything and \neverything they asked for. \nTo  me  it has  been a very sad episode in  Ducati’s history. \nNot  only did  it destroy their reputation, it also  destroyed \ntheir brand. Suddenly this stunning blood red that they were \nso  synonymous with, like Ferrari, was covered in  luminous \nyellow. It wasn’t good to  see  that  and I was  disappointed for \nthe friends I still had there, especially Filippo. Believe me,  by \nletting that man go Ducati have lost a genius. \nAs  strange as  this  sounds I genuinely wanted Ducati to \nsucceed, for all the people who work there and for the sake of \nthe championship, which needs as  many competitive factories \nrunning at the  front as  possible. However, I must admit that \nfrom a purely personal point of view it was  a sweet feeling to \nsee  Valentino and JB struggle because of what everybody had \nassumed about my development skills and  the  expectations \neveryone had  of them. JB is a  guy who I have tremendous \nrespect for because of what he  has  achieved in  his  career \nbut he said  some things that  disappointed me  at the  end  of \n2010, about the  Ducati’s problems being a  simple set-up \nissue. Somebody of his calibre should have known better than \nthat. He  was  disrespecting one  of their biggest competitors \nas  a  rider and  an  engineer and  had  not  given any  respect \nto  what we  had  been able to  achieve before they even \nworked with the  bike. When they got hold of the  bike and \n231 \nS LIN a abe SNe S Fid \n\n232 \nCASEY STONER \ncouldn’t get it working they had  the  cheek to try and blame \nit  on  me. I enjoyed watching Valentino struggle on  the \nDucati, as  he’d made it very clear that before that happened \nhe thought the  reason for  my  success was  the  bike. Even \nwhen that  bike wasn’t working I put it on  the  podium and \nthey were nowhere near it, unless a bunch of riders crashed \nor  it rained. \ns  far  as  my  championship was  concerned after Jerez \nae \nknew \nI \nhad \nto \nride \nwithout \nmaking \nany \nmistakes \nif \nI \nwas \ngoing \nto \nstand \na \nchance \nof \nchallenging \nfor \nthe \ntitle. \nI \nwas \nalready \ntwenty \npoints \nshy \nof \nJorge \nand \neleven \nbehind \nDani, \na \ngap \nthat \nextended \nto \ntwenty-four \nand \ntwenty \nafter \nthe \nnext \nround \nin \nPortgual. \nMy \nchances \nof \nchasing \nthem \nfor \nthe \nwin \nat \nEstoril \nwere \nruined \non \nthe \nfirst \nlap \nby \nMarco \nSimoncelli— \nwho \ncut \nme \noff \nin \nturn \none \nand \nthen \ncrashed \nright \nin \nfront \nof \nme \nin \nturn \nfour \n— \nas \nwell \nas \nmy \nold \nback \ninjury \nfrom \n2003, \nwhich \nflared \nup \nagain. \nAt \nsome \npoint \nduring \nthat \nrace \nI \nfelt \nmy \nback \ncompletely \nlock \nup \non \nme \nand \nI \ncouldn’t \nmove \nfor \nthree \nor \nfour \ncorners. \nI \nwas \nstruggling \nto \ndo \nanything \nand \ncould \nhardly \nbreathe \nso \nfor \na \nmoment \nI \nthought \nI \nwould \nhave \nto \npull \nin \nbut \nthankfully \nwithin \nhalf \na \nlap \nit \neased \nup \na \nlittle, \ngot \nbetter \nand \nwe  managed to finish in third place. \n\nNow in his second sedson, Simoncelli was  quickly emerging \nas \na \ngenuine \npodium \nthreat \nat \nthe \nfront \nof \nthe \npack \nbut \nhis \naggressive \nriding \nwas \nbecoming \na \nbit \ntoo \nmuch \nfor \nthe \nrest \nof \nus.  He was  a big guy and when he leaned on you it was  difficult \nto move him. After a race  with Marco you would both finish \nup with tyre marks all over your leathers. I was  one  of the \nones to speak my mind against him in the Safety Commission \nmeetings but I also pulled him to one  side on the way out and \nsaid, ‘Look, you are  going to be fast and I have loads of respect \nfor you but you just don’t need to ride in that way.’ \nI was concerned, especially because of the  support that \nMarco's tactics were getting amongst the  press and  the \nfans, which seemed to  overlook the  dangers we  were all \nfacing. People were being fed  the  impression that riders \nare  indestructible and  any level of contact is fair game. The \nmost shocking thing I heard on  the  matter came from the \nRace Director, Paul Butler, who said in  an  interview at  the \ntime that  motorcycle racing is a ‘contact sport’. What a load \nof rubbish. Boxing is a  contact sport, where fighters must \nhit each other in  order to  score points. Rugby is a contact \nsport, where guys tackle each other as  hard as  they can  in \norder to  recover possession of the ball. Motorcycle racing is \nNOT a contact sport. Sure, contact can  occasionally happen \nbut  it is not  necessary in order to win  and, as  a  rule, being \nknocked off a motorbike at 340km/h plus usually has far more \nserious consequences than being punched in the  face  by a \nguy wearing gloves.

After a brief battle with Jorge over  the first four laps \nof the  race  we  managed to  get into  a rhythm that we  knew \nhe wouldn't be  able  to  stick at  and  made a  gap  of around \n2 seconds that I was able to  control until the  last  few  laps, \nwhen Jorge finally backed off. \nBecause of his  injury Dani was  missing from that  race \nand again at  Silverstone, where we  arrived just seven points \nbehind Jorge at the top of the championship thanks to those \nback-to-back wins at Le Mans and Barcelona. Once again we \nmanaged to  set  the  pace in every session and  even though \nit poured down on  race  day we  were happy we  had  a good \nsetting for the wet.  I didn’t get the best  of starts and had to \nwait a couple of laps for the tyres to come up to temperature, \nlosing positions to Dovi and Jorge, but managed to get back to \nthe front despite all the spray from the standing water getting \nup inside my visor. \nI covered my lines for the first five laps or so  and once my \nvisor started to clear I was  able to set the times I was  looking \nfor and opened up a bit of a gap.  In the meantime Jorge was \ntrying to get past Dovi and chase me but unfortunately he lost \nthe rear  and had a big highside. It was  a tough and cold race \nbut we  held it together for the win, moving from seven points \nbehind Jorge to eighteen points ahead.

One \nthing about Jorge is that he hardly ever  makes a mistake so  it \nwas  a case  of working out where I was  stronger than him and \ntrying to take advantage. I had noticed on a couple of occasions \nthat he didn’t get the perfect drive out of the last turn  and lost \nhis momentum down the straight. I don’t know if his wheelie \ncontrol was  cutting in or he was backing offa little bit too much \nto keep the front down but it was  causing him to lose speed as \nwe  came towards the crest at turn one. \nThe scary thing about that part of the track is that you have \nno  idea where the crest is until you go over  it. You  are  short- \nshifting out  of a tight left-hander all the way up to fifth gear, \ntrying so hard to get the power to the track whilst keeping the \nfront down, and then suddenly everything gets light and starts \nsliding around underneath you  at  over 265km/h —  I always \nhad an  absolute ball going over  there. I had  my bike  geared \nlonger for that  particular section so  that  instead of hitting \nthe limiter when the bike went light I was  still getting drive. \nThat gave me a crucial opportunity to  make up ground on \nJorge every lap and after closing the gap from 0.9 seconds to \n0.2 seconds he gave me  another opportunity to get the run  on \nhim  in turn  one.  Instead of backing off and  slipping behind \nhim  I decided to carry my momentum and  squeeze around \nthe outside of him. \nIt looked dangerous on  television and even though there — \nwas  barely more space than the width of the white line to ride \n237 \nSLL A: eta SN Si \n\n238 \nCASEY STONER \naround \nhim \nand \na \nconcrete \nwall \njust \na \nfew \nmetres \nto \nmy \nright, \nI \nknew \nI \nhad \nthe \nmomentum \nto \nmake \nit \nthrough. \nAt  that point of the  race Jorge was  running in  the  low \n1 \nminute \n22 \nseconds, \nbut \nonce \nI \ngot \nin \nfront \nof \nhim \nI \ndropped \nthe \nhammer \nagain \nand \ndipped \nback \ninto \nthe \n1 \nminute \n21 \nseconds, \nopening \nup \neight-tenths \nof \na \nsecond \nper \nlap \nfor \nthe \nnext \nthree \nlaps \nand \neffectively \nkilling \nthe \nrace \noff. \nThat \nwas \na \ngreat \nwin \nfor \nus, \nto \ncome \nback \nfrom \nthe \nproblems \nwe'd \nhad \nin \npractice \nand \nfinish \nso \nstrongly \nwhen \nour \nrivals \nleast \nexpected \nit. \nI’m \nnot \nsure \nwhy \nthey \nwere \nso \nsurprised \nbecause \nit \nwasn't \nthe \nonly \ntime \nwe \nhad \nturned \nthings \naround \novernight \nand \nit \nwas \ndown \nto \nour \napproach \nto \npractice \nthat \nallowed \nus \nto do it. \nI \nfeel \nthat \nJorge, \nDani, \nValentino \nand \nmost \nof \nthe  \nother \nriders \nwork \nto \na \nmethodical \nsystem \nduring \npractice, \nstarting \nthe \nweekend \nby \ngradually \ngetting \nfaster \nand \nfaster, \nanalysing \nthe \ndata \nand \nmaking \na \nplan \nof \nwhere \nthey \nare \ngoing \nto \nget \non \nthe \nthrottle, \nwhere \nto \nbrake, \net \ncetera. \nFrom \nthere \nthey \ntry \nto \nbrake \na \nbit \nlater \nthe \nnext \ntime \nand \na \nbit \nlater \nagain, \ngetting \non \nthe \nthrottle \nearlier \nand \nstep \nby \nstep \ngetting \ncloser \nand \ncloser \nto \nthe \nedge. \nIt’s \na \nmethod \nof \nruling \nthings \nout \nand \ngradually \nfinding \nthe \nlimit. \nThe \nproblem \nis \nthat \nwhen \nthey \ndon’t \nget \nthe \nbike \nright \nthey \ncan’t \nfind \nthat \nlimit \nand \nthey \ncan’t \ngo \nfast. \nTo  \nme  \nit \nis \nvery \nsimple \nto  \nwork \nout  \nwhere \nthe  \nbraking \npoint \nis, \nwhere \nI \nwant \nthe \nbike \nto \ngo \nand \nwhat \nI \nwant \nit \nto \ndo. \nBecause \nI \nhave \nnever \nhad \na \nproblem \nlearning \ntracks, \nadapting \nto \ndifferent \nconditions \nor \nriding \na \nbike \nthat \nwasn’t \nset \nup \nright \n\nI \nwas  \noften \nquicker \nout’of \nthe \nbox \non  \na \nFriday \nmorning \nthan \nthe \nother \nguys. \nI \nwas  \nalways \non  \nthe \nedge \nof \ngrip \nand \nno  \ngrip, \nconstantly \ngoing \nover  \nthe \nlimit \nand \nbringing \nit \nback, \nlistening \nto \nwhat \nthe \nbike \nwas \ntelling \nme. \nIf \nit \nwasn’t \ndoing \nwhat \nI \nwanted \nstraight \naway \nI’d \ncome \nback \nin \nand \nchange \nit. \nIt’s \nhard \nto \nexplain \nhow \nI \ncould \ndo this \nexactly \nbut \nI \nhad \ndeveloped \na \nfeel \nfor \na \nbike \nand \nits \nrelationship \nto \nspeed \nduring \nmy \ncareer \nand \nit’s \nsomething \nI \ncould \npick \nup \nquickly. \nMy approach had its downfalls too because it wasn’t always \nthe best way to find the ideal set-up.

I \nlearnt to ride around the problems and change my technique \nto get the most out of the bike.

What's important is getting the bike right and then \nyou can  move on from there. We stuffed up a couple of times \nbut  so  has  everybody. Unfortunately my mistakes probably \nstood out  more because people could point to the fact we’d \nonly done short runs and  blame it on  that. Lorenzo, Dani \nand  Rossi have all dropped back in plenty of races because \nthey didn’t find  a set-up despite clocking up a hundred laps \nin practice. It has always been my way to focus more on what \nisn’t working and trying to fix it rather than improving what's \n239 \nS:.LILN 1 Sa SN a SS ed \n\n240 \nCASEY -STOaoNER \ngoing well and  more often than not  we  were pretty close to \nthe mark. \nThat weekend at Laguna I never did a run  longer than six \nlaps in practice, whilst Jorge was doing ten- and eleven-lap \nruns pretty much every time he was  out on track. People would \noften say things like, ‘Jorge is a robot, he can  keep turning out \nlap after lap in practice within a tenth.’ That's true  but if they \nare  not as fast as mine then it doesn’t matter if he can  do those \nlaps all day long. If I pull a second on  him  over the first  two \nlaps then he’s got to try and make that time up over the rest of \nthe race, and if he hasn’t shaken me  off by the last couple of \nlaps \nthere \nis \nevery \nchance \nI \ncan \npull \nsomething \nout \nof \nthe \nhat. \nOften I would play down my chances after qualifying and \nif \nwe \nweren't \ndoing \nwell \nI \ndeliberately \nmade \nit \nsound \nlike \nwe \nweren't \ngoing \nto \nbe \na \nthreat \nat \nall. \nMy \nrivals \nwould \ngo \ninto \na \nrace \nthinking \nthey \nhad \nus \ncovered \nbut \nwe’d \ncome \nout \non \nrace \nday \nwith \nsomething \nextra \nthey \nweren't \nexpecting, \nwhich \nhad \nto \nhave \nan \neffect \non \nthem \nmentally. \nIf \nthey \nthought \nwe \ncould \ndo \nthat \nwhen \nthings \nwere \ngoing \nbadly \nthen \nwhat \ndid \nthey \nthink \nwe  could do to them when we  were on  the pace? \nThat’s \nexactly \nwhat \nhappened \nin \nthe  \nnext \nround \nof \n2011 \nat \nBrno. \nDani \nhad \nlooked \nlike \nhe \nwas \ngoing \nto \nbe \nthe \nman \nall \nweekend \nbut \nthe  \nreality \nwas  \nthat  \nthe \nonly \ntime \nI \nfelt \nhe \nwas \nfaster \nthan \nus \nwas \nin \nthe \nmornings. \nEven \nthough \nhe \nstill \nwent \nquicker \nthan \nus \nin \nthe \nafternoon \nwe \nknew \nwe \nhad \nthe \npace \nin \nthe \nheat \nand \nI \nwas \nholding \nback \na \nlittle \nextra. \nI \nqualified \nthird \nbehind \nDani \nand \nJorge \nbut \ngot \nto \nthe \nfront \non \nthe \nthird \n\nlap \nof \nthe \nrace, \nat \nwhich‘point \nDani \ncrashed. \nThe \nconditions \nwere \na \nbit \nwarmer \nthan \nthey \nhad \nbeen \nthe \nprevious \nday, \nwith \ntrack \ntemperatures \nup \nby \n7°C, \nand \nit \nseemed \nthat \nJorge \nwas \nstruggling \nto \nadapt. \nIn \nthe \nend \nhe \ndropped \nback \nto \nfourth \nand \nI \nwon \nby \nover \n6 \nseconds \nfrom \nDovi, \ngiving \nus \na \n32-point \nlead \nat \nthe \ntop \nof \nthe \nchampionship. \nAdriana was with me at every race and having her there meant \na lot. We had settled into  married life well and finding out  she \nwas  pregnant with our  first child was  one  of the best moments \nof my life. We'd wanted to start  a family for a while and were at \nhome in Switzerland when Adri woke up early and did a test. \nAdriana: ‘It was  positive and I woke Casey up straightaway \nto tell him. We couldn’t have been happier. He was  so  excited \nhe cancelled training for the  day so  we  could celebrate and \nwe  had a look in a few baby stores in Lausanne.’ \nWe  waited for  a  few  months and  then announced the \npregnancy that weekend in  Brno at  the  pre-event press \nconference. \nAt this point everything was  looking up and in the middle \nof the  2011 season I was  able  to  buy the property where I \nhad first learnt to ride a motorbike. It had been my dream to \nown this  land since I was  a child so  it meant a lot.  To get to \nthis point was really something, considering only a few years \nbefore we’d been living on  hand-to-mouth deals in the 125cc \nand 250cc classes. \nI have lived in many, many places since I left Niangala as  a \nfour-year-old boy but as I have said, something about that place \n241 \nS LIN <Sifeieky SNES aid \n\n242 \nGCASEY STONER \nhad gripped me  and never let go. The road up there winds from \naround 300 metres above sea level up to over  1100 metres in just \n5 kilometres, so the difference in atmosphere is quite dramatic \nand the conditions can be really changeable. It can be 30°C and \nsunny for days on  end and then you wake up the next  day and \nits \n10°C \nand \nmisty. \nYou \ncan \nopen \nthe \ncurtains \none \nmorning \nin \nwinter and the whole place is covered in snow and when the \nthunderstorms \ncome \nin, \nas \nthey \nregularly \ndo, \nthe \nwhole \nhouse \nshakes and the windows rattle.

I struggled a bit with a neck injury I'd picked up in a \ncrash during practice earlier in the season at Assen but rode \nthrough it and then scored another win at Aragon. With three \nraces to go we  knew that victory in the next round at Motegi \nwould leave us  needing to  score just one  point more than \nJorge to wrap up the championship at Phillip Island, a dream \nscenario at my home track. \nI flew to Japan on  my own  because we  didn’t want to take \nany risks with Adri’s health or  the health of our  unborn baby. \nAfter the devastating March tsunami had damaged the nuclear \nplant in Fukushima there was  ongoing media reports about \nradiation leaks and  Motegi was  only about 100  kilometres \nfrom there. It was  strange not having Adriana at the race  but \non  track everything started perfectly. We took our  tenth pole \nposition of the  season with a  new lap record in  qualifying \nand  I managed to  pull a  second on  Dovi over the  opening \nthree laps of the race. Then on  the fourth lap, as  I came onto \nthe back straight my bike  started pumping, which shook the \nbrake pads out  from the  disc. As  I hit my braking point the \nlever immediately hit the bar as  there were no  brakes there. \nI pumped the brakes as  quickly as  I could to get them back \nand they returned so fast they almost put me  over the front of \nthe bike. By the time all that happened I'd missed my braking \npoint and I ran  wide and off the circuit. I managed to stay on \nand get the thing stopped before we  hit the wall at the end of \nthe gravel trap but our  chance to win was  gone. I came back \non  track in seventh place and managed to  ork my way back \n243 \nS LIN hah 2h Shite S By et \n\n244 \nCASEY  _SFONER \nup to third by the end but we  were disappointed because we \nknew we  had the bike to win  that day. \nNow I would have to outscore Jorge by ten points at Phillip \nIsland to win  the championship, which made it nothing more \nthan a  slim chance. Actually, that wasn’t such a  bad thing \nbecause it relieved the pressure a little bit. I didn’t think I could \nrealistically win  the  championship there so  all I was  focused \non  was  taking my fifth win  in a row  at Phillip ice that was \nthe only pressure I put on  myself. Since winning it for the first \ntime in 2007 the  expectation amongst the  fans  and the press \nhad risen every year. After I'd won it twice it was  like, ‘Can he \nmake \nit \na \nhat-trick?’ \nThen \nit \nwas \nfour \nand \nnow \nit \nwas \nfive. \nOf \ncourse \nthat’s \nwhat \nI \nwanted \nbut \nI \nknew \nMarco \nwas \nfast \naround \nthere, \nDani \nand \nDovi \ntoo, \nnot \nto \nmention \nJorge \nfighting \nto \nkeep \n_   his championship alive. \nOn the morning of the race  things suddenly turned around \nand \nI \nhad \nthe \nopportunity \nto \nwin \nthe \ntitle \nafter \nall, \nbut \nnot \nin \nthe \nway \nI \nexpected \nor \nwanted. \nComing \nout \nof \nthe \nfinal \nturn \nat \nthe \nend \nof \nwarm-up \nJorge \nlost \nthe \nrear \nand \nhad \na \nlow \nside, \ngot \nhis \nhand \ntrapped \nunder \nthe \nbike \nand \nlost \nthe \ntip \nof \nhis \nfinger. \nI \nimmediately \nwent \nto \nvisit \nhim \nin \nthe \ncircuit \nmedical \ncentre \nand \nhe \ntold \nme \nthat \nhe \nwasn’t \nfit \nto \nride \nand \nwished \nme \nluck \nfor \nthe \nrace. \nThat \nis \nthe \nsign \nof \na \ngood \nperson, \nand \nthe \nrespect \nI \ntalked \nabout \nearlier. \nI \nnever \nwanted \nsomething \nlike \nthis \nto \nhappen \nto \na \nrival, \nespecially \nsomeone \nI \nrespected \nso \nmuch, \nbut \nit \nwas \nmy \njob \nto \ngo \non \nand \ntry \nto \nwin \nthe \nchampionship. \nI \ngot \na  \ngood \nstart, \nopened \na  \ngap  \nand  \nfor \na \nwhile \nI \nwas \n\ncruising. It seemed like nothing could go wrong but then I \nran  into a wall of rain  at turn twelve and the rear stepped out, \nalmost causing me  to  go down. Suddenly there were people \ngoing down everywhere and it became a mission just to stay \nup and make it to the finish. I was  lucky, no  doubt about it, but \nwe  made the flag to secure my second World Championship \nand  Honda’s sixtieth Constructors’ Championship with my \nfifth  straight win  at Phillip Island —  at my home Grand Prix \nand all on  my twenty-sixth birthday! I don’t think I could ask \nfor much more than that. \nThat evening HRC organised a small private party for me \nand the team in Cowes, the main town on Phillip Island. It was \ngood for me  to see  the team celebrate and I felt really proud \nto have been able to come through and give them this. It was \na very special moment for me  but winning the championship \nhadn’t really sunk in yet. We  got back to the hotel room and \nI couldn’t get to sleep; I just lay there thinking about it. After \na few hours it was  like I was  suddenly struck by lightning and \nthat’s when it really sunk in, what I had achieved that day. \nUp to  that  season my whole career had been spent with \nItalian teams —  even KTM, which is an  Austrian factory but \nan  Italian team —  so  this was  my first  time working with the \nJapanese and I had loved every minute. First of all, they have \na very  high regard for respect, which they gave  to  me  and I \ngave back. They also  have a great sense of humour and  all \nthe  Japanese team members and  management had  quirky \ncharacters, so  I had  a  ball  with them. The nicest thing was \n245 \nSL) ANS “Sree SNA ES ie \n\n246 \nCASEY STONER \nthat  they made my wins feel  so  much more important than \nany other team I had been with. I could see  the happiness on \ntheir faces and they couldn’t have been more grateful to  me \nfor the part I had played in our joint success. \nI have to say that I feel there is a lack of respect in general \ntowards the Japanese in the paddock from the Europeans. I had \nheard so  many bad things about working for  Honda; that \nDucati is a family and HRC is a big, heartless corporation but \nthe truth is exactly the reverse. Everybody at Honda puts their \nheart and  soul  into  the bike and  they put themselves under \nmassive pressure to  get results, so  the  relief amongst them \nwhen we  won that championship was  huge. \nLooking back on  that incredible weekend at Phillip Island \nthere is one  other special memory that sticks out, which is \nthat I got to share the podium with Marco Simoncelli. Losing \nhim \na \nweek \nlater \nin \nsuch \ntragic \ncircumstances \nin \nMalaysia \nwas \na \ndevastating \nmoment \nfor \nanybody \ninvolved \nin \nour \nsport \nbut \nespecially \nfor \nhis \nfamily \nand \nhis \ngirlfriend, \nKate. \nMy \nheart \ngoes \nout to them every time I think about what happened. \nObviously I'd had my issues with Marco earlier that season, \nas \nmost \nof \nus \nhad, \nbut \nas \nthe \nyear \nhad \ngone \non \nhe \nhad \ndefinitely \ngrown \nand \nlearnt \na \nlot. \nIt’s \nfunny \nhow \nthe \nlittle \nthings \nstick \nin \nyour \nmind \nbut \nI \nremember \nbeing \nat \nMisano \nand \nI \nneeded \na \nhaircut. \nMarco \nand \nKate \nhad \ntheir \nmotorhome \nparked \nnext \nto \nours \nso \nwe \nended \nup \nspeaking \nto \nthem \na \nlittle \nbit \nand \nKate \norganised \nfor \na \nlocal \nhairdresser \nto \ncome \nonto \nthe \ntrack \nfor \nus.  \nKate \nis \na \nreally \nlovely \ngirl, \nand \nMarco \nwas  \na \nnice \nguy. \nHe \n\njust needed to calm down and by the end of the season he had \ndone that —  he was  riding really well, getting better results as \na consequence and  I was  not  scared to  ride  with him  like  I \nhad been at the start  of the season. He was  still making hard \npasses but there was  no contact and I had no complaints about \nhis style of riding anymore. \nIn a way, this  made Marco’s death even harder to take. He \nhad the talent to win races for sure  and in theory the switch back \nto  1000cc in 2012 would have favoured him because he was  a \nbigger guy. Who knows if he could have won  championships? If \nhe could have stepped it up another level again? It would have \nbeen entertaining to watch him try, that’s for sure. Tragically \nwe  will never know what his full potential could have been. \nMarco’s death shocked everyone but it seemed to me  that \nby the time  the 2012 season started up it had been forgotten \ntoo  quickly. The most fitting tribute to his memory shouldn't \nhave been a plaque by the side of the track where he lost his \nlife, but  a real  change in the way  riders respect each other \nand respect the  limits. Unfortunately, I don’t feel that this \nhappened. I have always been very aware of what can  happen \nin this sport, which is why I have always shown respect to my \nfellow racers. You  might not  like  the  person next to you  on \nthe grid but you have to be aware that if an  accident happens, \nanyone can  be hurt or killed. \nSometimes young riders are  so  desperate to win  that they \nforget what’s most important. They get built up so  much that \nthey start to  believe the  hype, they feel  invincible. Nobody \n24] \nS LWW i esate GouNiE Ne SS Aled \n\n248 \nGAS EY S47 a: NER \nis, especially in bike racing. And if a rider doesn’t care about \nhis own safety then it stands to reason he doesn’t care about \nanybody else’s either. Don’t get  me  wrong, MotoGP is  as \nsafe as  it has  ever been in terms of the  gravel traps, circuit \nlayouts and  rider equipment, but the fact  that  certain riders \nwere still  putting others at  risk  even after Marco’s death \nbothered me a lot. It seemed to  me  that  the race organisers \nstill wanted to  see  biff and  barge and  Marco’s death hadn’t \nchanged their perspective. Even the  Safety Commission, set \nup by the riders, seemed to have become less about safety and, \nfor a few members, more about guys trying to get their own \nway. As far as  I was  concerned we  were basically puppets in \na show and I wasn’t sure I wanted to be a part of it anymore. \nFor a few years I’d been feeling differently about the sport \nI loved. I'd thought I was  working with people who shared the \nsame passions and  goals as  I did but I’d come to realise that \nwasn't always the case. To be wholly focused on  the business \nof racing and have an  eye always on  the money wasn’t what I \nwas  about but more and  more I became aware that this was \nwhat mattered too  often to  others. Marco’s death wasn’t the \ncause of my disillusionment, but it did bring it all into sharp \nfocus for me.  My eyes were open to  the  negative aspects of \nMotoGP and I didn’t know how to change things. \nBefore the  2012 season started something far  more \nimportant \nthan \nracing \nmotorcycles \nhappened \nand, \nsuddenly, \na \ndecision \nthat \nI \nhad \nbeen \nconsidering \nfor \na \nlong \ntime \nbecame \nmore and more clear and certain in my mind. \n\nirate ert Ie \nGONE FISHING \nfter  so  many years focusing on  motor racing and  the \ndemands of competing as  a factory-contracted MotoGP \nrider, everyone told us  that things were about to  change \ndramatically for me  and  Adri when our  baby was  born. We \ncouldn’t wait but our  baby didn’t seem in a rush to  meet us. \nAdri had been due to give birth on  Sunday, 12 February 2012, \nbut  that day came and  went without anything happening. \nAfter a couple of days, which seemed to me  the longest wait \never and so  must have felt like weeks for Adri, the doctor told \nus  he wasn’t happy with progress. It was  worrying when he \nsaid that and we  ended up at the hospital. Finally at 10 pm on \nThursday 16 February our little girl, Alessandra Maria, arrived \ninto  the world, weighing in at 2.8 kilograms. \n249 \n\n290 \nCASEY “ST 2NER \nThankfully, after the  delay, everything went to  plan and \nthere was  no  real drama. I didn’t like seeing Adri in pain but \nI’ve never met a  tougher girl than her, she just deals with \neverything and, of course, Ally came out  just perfect. For \nme  it was  a  strange feeling because everybody tells  you  all \nthese emotions will  hit you  when you  become a parent so  I \nwas  waiting for it but it didn’t happen straight away. Adri and \nI took it in our  stride. Day by day though, the bond between \nus  and Ally has  become stronger and  stronger and  stronger. \nIt gets to the point where you don’t know how your heart can \nexpand much more but somehow it does. \nBecoming parents changed the shape of our life to a certain \ndegree but  it felt  very  natural to  us  both. I can  see  how  it \nwould be a shock to the system for people who like to go out \nand party all the time but that’s not  us  so  the  reality of how \nwe  live didn’t change that much at all; the biggest difference \nnow  is that we  really have a purpose. Even though travelling \nis a bit  more complicated, I can  pretty much do everything \nI was  doing before Ally was  born and  as  soon as  she  is old \nenough to  come fishing with me  I literally won't have to \nchange a thing! \nSeriously though, if anything, I think having a child gave \nus  both extra energy. Of course Adri has had times when she \nhas been tired and Ally has struggled with teething or things \nlike \nthis \nand \nkept \nus \nboth \nup \nbut \nyou \nbattle \nthrough. \nYou \nmay \nwake \nup \nat \nfive \nin \nthe \nmorning \nbecause \nshe’s \npatting \nyou \non \nthe \nface but I can’t think of a better way to wake up than that -  I \n\ndon’t \ncare  \nwhat \ntime \nit’is! \nNowadays \nevery \nsingle \ndecision \nI \nmake \nis \ndone \nwith \nAlly \nand \nAdri \nat \nthe \nforefront \nof \nmy \nmind. \nBut  in 2012 I was still  racing, it is what I do, so  we  kept \ntravelling. Ally was  born in  between the  two  annual pre- \nseason tests at  Sepang which, unlike Ally’s birth, were beset \nby problems. The  new  RC213V was  fantastic but  I couldn’t \neven ride it on  the first day of the test because of my old back \ninjury, which flared up again when I was  warming up.  I must \nhave been stretching for a good twenty minutes and then all \nof a sudden my back just locked up on  me.  I couldn’t move \nor  do anything —  I had to call someone to come and help me \nmove into a position that was  less painful. We lost another day \nat the second test because of an engine failure on one  of Dani’s \nbikes, which the engineers wanted to fully check out  before \nthey allowed either of us  back out. \nOne of the major factors that affected our preparation was \nthe last-minute additional bike weight change —  implemented \nby Dorna. We  had  to  incorporate this  onto our  bike, which \nHonda had spent a fortune on  designing in the winter. Making \nthose changes disrupted and upset the balance. We spent a lot \nof time trying to move this additional weight around but it really \nwas  a problem. The other big factor we were dealing with was \nthe new specification of tyres provided by Bridgestone. They'd \ncome up with an  innovative compound designed to improve \nwarm-up time in  response to  a  bunch of guys crashing on \ncold tyres during 2011. The feedback from pretty much every \nother factory about the new rubber was  good but for whatever \n251 \nSTUN Shek Sane Sire \n\n252 \nCASEY STONER \nreason on the Honda it gave us unbelievable chatter. We tried \neverything to  solve it, shortening the  wheelbase, changing \nthe chassis stiffness and moving the weight around to try and \nreduce the frequency but nothing worked. \nIt was  a crazy situation because we  shouldn’t have had to \nchange the bike at all just for the sake of making it suit a specific \ntyre but this was  one  of the side  effects of the championship \nswitching to a single supplier back in 2008. Bridgestone had \nwon the  contract, which you may think I would have been \nhappy about given my history with Michelin, but the truth was \nquite the opposite. Clearly there was  a need for regulation but \nto me  competition amongst the tyre brands is just as important \nas  having different motorcycle factories and  different riders \non  the grid. Having a mix of tyre brands had thrown up some \nof the  most exciting and  memorable races in the  history of \nthe \nchampionship, \nsuch \nas \nSimon \nCrafar’s \nwin \non \nDunlops \nat \nDonington \nPark \nin \n1998 \nor \nwhen \nMakoto \nTamada \nwon \na \nbunch \nof \nraces \nwith \nBridgestone \nin \n2004. \nAs \nfar \nas \nI \nam \nconcemed \nif \nyou’re \ngoing \nto \ngive \npeople \nthe \nsame \ntyres, \nwhy \nnot just give everybody the same engine too? \nThere was  another big change to  MotoGP at the  start of \n2012 \nthat \nreally \nupset \nme, \nas \na \npurist \nand \na \nfan \nof \nGrand \nPrix \nracing, \nwhich \nwas \nthe \nintroduction \nof \n‘Claiming \nRule \nTeams’ \n(CRT). \nCRT \n(so \ncalled \nbecause \nthe \nteams \n‘claim’ \nownership \nof \nthe \nbikes \ninstead \nof \nleasing \nthem \nfrom \nthe \nfactories) \nis \nbasically \nan \nexcuse \nto \nlet \nnon-prototype \nbikes \nonto \nthe \ngrid \njust \nto  \nfill \nup  \nspaces. \nIt \nalso  \nhas  \nthe  \neffect \nof \ntaking \nHonda, \n\nDucati and Yamaha’s power away from them and giving control \nover the championship to Carmelo Ezpeleta, just like Bernie \nEcclestone has in Formula 1. The difference is that Formula 1 \ncars are  still prototypes, incredible machines, but these new \nCRT bikes are  completely going against what MotoGP is \nabout. There already exists another World Championship for \nthat kind of class. \nThe way the rules are going, with the standardisation of the \nremaining prototypes, in a couple of years’ time everybody \nwill  effectively be on  a CRT bike and that  is not  for me.  My \ndream was  to be 500cc World Champion, not the CRT World \nChampion and  it angered me  that  the  ‘winning’ CRT rider \nat each race in 2012 would get to join the top three finishers \nin parc fermé at  the  end  of the  race. That exclusive area is \nsupposed to  be  a  privilege for  the  podium guys only, the \nrealisation of a dream and the reward for a lot of sacrifice and \nhard work. I know it’s  tough for those guys  who  haven't got \nthe opportunity to ride a factory bike but I’m afraid that’s life. \nI was  there once too. \nI’m  pretty sure Carmelo would never have taken such \ndrastic measures if they'd left the rules alone when MotoGP \nfirst changed to 990cc four-strokes back in 2002. The goalposts \nhave been moved pretty much every season since then but the \ndecision to go to 800cc in 2007 was  particularly ludicrous. It \ndidn’t make any sense from a technical perspective because \nnobody builds 800cc road bikes and it was  far more dangerous \nfor the riders.

Complex systems like  anti-wheelie and  traction \ncontrol not  only take  the fun out  of riding the bikes but the \nresearch and  development requires massive investment, not \nto  mention the  extra staff each team needs to manage them \nat the track. \nAll  of these things were playing on  my  mind when the \nseason started in  Qatar, where I was  effectively only racing \nagainst ten  other Grand Prix  bikes even though there were \nsupposedly twenty-one on  the  grid. I finished third in that \nrace  despite arm  pump problems and managed to win at Jerez \nbut again had arm  pump issues and was  still having problems \nwith the new  tyres so  I didn’t enjoy a single lap of either of \nthose races. Honda knew that  I wasn’t enjoying myself and \nI told  them as  much when we  opened discussions about a \nnew  contract for 2013. As always I was  completely open and \nhonest with them and I made it clear that I was  thinking about \nwalking away from the sport altogether. \nIn  the  end  they came up with an  incredible proposal: a \none-year contract that would have pretty much doubled my \nearnings. It was  a crazy offer and it was  extremely tempting. \nMoney had never been the lure for me but things had changed \nand  I thought about what it could do for Ally and, if we  are \nlucky enough, any  children we  might have in the  future. It \nwould mean that they would be financially secure for the rest \nof their lives. Adriana was fantastic; she  kept assuring me \nthat our  children would be fine, that we  were already in the \nfortunate position of not having to worry about money as long \n259 \nSLIWNt) “Sa  SeNen.

I still couldn’t make up my \nmind but I didn’t think I could turn my back on  the financial \nfreedom it would bring us.  I was  going to  accept. I figured \nthat the competitive side of my nature would provide enough \nmotivation for me  to keep going for another year but it meant \nfor the first time in my life I would race purely for the money, \nsomething I said I would never do. \nI hinted to the team that I was  ready to sign but the more \nI thought about it the less  certain I was. Deep down I knew \nall the reasons why I felt that way kept overpowering the lure \nof financial gain. \nIn the week leading up to  the  race at  Estoril a  story was \npublished in a Spanish magazine declaring that I was  planning \nto  retire, which I denied in  the  pre-event press conference \nin \nPortugal. \nI \nwas \nas \nhonest \nwith \nthe \npress \nas \nI \nhad \nbeen \nwith \nHonda \nbecause \nthe \ntruth \nwas \nthat \nI \nstill \nhadn’t \nmade \na \ndecision. \nIt \nis \nhard \nnot \nto \nbelieve \ninformation \nwas \nleaked, \nin \nthe \nhope \nit \nwould \nput \npressure \non \nme \nto \nsign. \nI \nknow \nit \nwasn’t \nNakamoto-san. I trust him and it’s not his style, but ’'m pretty \nsure someone was  talking. \nStill, \nas  \nI \nhad \ndone \nso  \nmany \ntimes \nduring \nmy \ncareer, \nI \nput \nall \nthat \nmedia \nattention \nto \none \nside \nfor \nthe \nrace \nand \nat \nEstoril \nI \nproduced \none \nof \nthe \nbest \nperformances \nof \nmy \ncareer, \nright \nup \nthere \nwith \nMotegi \n2010 \nand \nLaguna \nSeca \n2011, \nto \nbeat \nJorge \nat \none \nof \nhis \nfavourite \ntracks. \nIt \nwas \na \nsimilar \nrace \nto \nMotegi, \nin \nthat \nI \ngot \nmyself \nto \nthe \nfront \nearly \nin \nthe \nrace \nand \n\njust hung on.  The difference this time was  that even though \nI was  struggling a  little with arm  pump at  the  end  of the \nrace  I knew I had something in reserve if Jorge stepped up \nthe pace. \nThat win completed a full house of victories at every track \nI had  ever raced at in  MotoGP and  immediately afterwards \nI started to  feel  more convinced that  it was  the  right time \nto  announce my  retirement. I continued to  think long and \nhard about it for the  rest  of that week and  on  the  Monday \nbefore the next  race  at Le  Mans I finally made my mind up. \nAdri knew straight away and  I called Mum and  Dad then \nimmediately sat  down at  my computer, sent  Nakamoto-san \nan  email and that was  it. \nAs  soon as  that  decision was  made I wanted to announce \nit quickly, for  myself and  for the  team. If I had  kept them \nhanging on  until the  end  of the  season and  then walked, it \nwouldn’t have been fair because they would have had  less \ntime  to work on  new  sponsorship deals and on  choosing their \nnew rider. From my perspective it was  important for me  to \ntell  people so  they understood my  reasons and  knew that \nI was  retiring on  my own  terms — not  because of injury, lack \nof form or whatever. Coming on the back of those consecutive \nwins at Jerez and  Estoril, the  timing could not  have been \nbetter. \nOn  arrival at Le  Mans I called Rhys Edwards, who looks \nafter the team’s communications and all my interactions with \nthe media, and asked him to come to my motorhome. ‘You’re \n2517 \nS EVN tt sa ie SNM Sf \n\n258 \nGCASEY =S,0NER \ngoing to retire today, aren't you?’ he asked. I nodded. We sat \nand spoke for about an hour about the best way to explain that \nI was  making the announcement early in the season out of my \nrespect for Honda. Rhys spoke to  Livio and  Nakamoto-san \nand we  decided to make the announcement at Dorna’s regular \npre-event press conference that afternoon, which I was  invited \nto already as  the current championship leader. \nWe  arranged with Dorna’s media staff for me  to say a few \nwords before the  usual questions to  myself and  the  other \nriders. As what seemed like a thousand flashbulbs went off in \nmy \nface \nI \nannounced \nthat \nthis \nseason \nwould \nbe \nmy \nlast, \nthat \nthere \nwere \nchanges \nhappening \nin \nthe \nsport \nthat \nI \nwasn’t \nhappy \nwith \nand \nthat \nI \nwould \nbe \nfinishing \nat \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \nyear \nto \npursue different things in my life.  After that  I went straight \nback \nto \nour \nmotorhome \nand \nit \nfelt \na \nlittle \nstrange, \nbut \nat \nthe \nsame time it was  a huge relief. I have never felt like I’d made \nthe wrong choice, it sat well with me  immediately. \nShuhei Nakamoto: ‘Casey's unbelievable performance since \nthe \nbeginning \nof \nhis \ntwo \nyears \nwith \nus \nwas \na \ngreat \nmotivation \nfor \nall \nHonda \nRepsol \nstaff, \nwho \nworked \neven \nharder \nto \nprovide \nhim \nthe \nbest \nbike \npossible. \nHe \nhas \nnot \nthe \neasiest \ncharacter \nin \nthe \nworld \nbut \nhe \nis \nvery \nhonest \nand \nI \nam \nsure \nhe \nnever \nlied \nto me.’ \nMany \nin \nthe \npress \nlabelled \nme \na \nliar \nfor \ndenying \ntheir \nearlier \nstory. \nIt \nwas \ndisappointing, \nbecause \nI \nhad \nbeen \nfrank \nwith \nthem \nall \nalong \nbut \ndespite \nmy \nbest \nintentions \nthis  \napproach \nalways \nseemed \nto \nend \nup \nearning \nme \na \nbad \nrap. \nOther \npeople \n\nprefer to play games and  make up  stories but  to  me  it has \nalways been plain and  simple: say it straight so  people will \nunderstand what you mean. It took me  a while to learn that no \nmatter \nhow \nstraight \nyou \nsay \nit \nthere \nare \npeople \nin \nthe \nmedia \nwho are  only too happy to twist your words according to their \nagenda. \nOnce it was  done it was  a huge weight off my shoulders \nand I felt I could concentrate solely on  my racing again. We \nstill had fifteen races left and I desperately wanted to win the \nchampionship for  Honda, for the  team and  for  myself. My \ncommitment was  never in doubt because apart from anything \nelse  I was  still very  much focused on  improving myself as  a \nrider. Even though I wouldn’t say I had a particular weak spot \nthere was  still  room for improvement in every aspect of my \nriding and that desire to fine tune it had never faded. \nThe other thing we  had  to  try to  master was  this  chatter \nissue, which we  continued to ride around pretty much every \nweekend. There was  the odd race  when it wasn’t an  issue but \nwe  weren't able to capitalise, such as  Germany. For whatever \nreason the chatter wasn’t so bad in left-hand corners and with \nSachsenring being an  anti-clockwise track Dani and  I were \nable to completely dominate. We were miles out  in front on \nthe last lap and I felt I had plenty of speed to pass Dani on the \nlast corner so  I went wide on  the second to last corner to line \nhim up and get a better exit.  Unfortunately I tucked the front. \nIt was  frustrating when Dani beat us  because he was \nmy teammate but  I didn’t feel  any jealousy towards him. \n259 \n3 LNA sh sere Suan SS \n\n260 \nCASEY «S77 ON ER \nIt annoyed me that he’d got the bike working when we  couldn't \nbut it was  the same for him when it was  the other way around. \nSome days he beat us  but to be honest I always felt like I had \nthe measure of him  over the course of a season. I think over \nthe years the only teammate I didn’t have the measure of was \nDavid Checa in  my first  year in 250cc and  back then I was \nstill learning. I never felt threatened by a teammate because \nI have never had one  that I felt was  consistently quicker than \nme  and throughout my career our biggest competition always \ncame from outside the  garage. Still, I have great respect for \nDani, our partnership was a fruitful one  and I think we worked \nreally well together to help Honda build their best ever bike \nin the RC213V. \nDani had  started using a  new chassis from the  Mugello \ntest a few weeks earlier but to me  it was  no  better so  I’d stuck \nwith the  old one. The  feel was  slightly different and  I think \nDani preferred it just a little bit, but I didn’t believe either of \nus  could go any quicker with it and it didn’t solve the chatter \nproblem. To  a  lot of people it seemed the  new chassis had \nturned \nDani's \nseason \naround \nbut \nif \nyou \nlook \nat \nthe \nresults \nhe \ndidn’t \nstart \nwinning \nregularly \nuntil \nIndianapolis, \nwhich \nalso \nhappened \nto \nbe \nthe \nweekend \nthat \nmy \nchampionship \nended. \nWe'd \nhad \na \nfew \nproblems \nwith \nthe \nelectronics \non \nthe \nFriday \nat \nIndy \nand \nalso \nhad \na \nstone \nget \ncaught \nin \nthe \nchain, \nwhich \ncost \nus  \ntrack \ntime, \nbut \nI \nset \nthe \npace \non  \nSaturday \nmorning \nand \nI \nreally \nfelt \nwe  \nhad \nthe \nspeed \nto \ndominate \nthe \nrace. \nDespite \nall \nour  \nproblems \nthat \nseason \nwe  \nhad \nstill \ngone \nthere \nwith \na \n\npossibility \nof \nwinning \nthe \nchampionship, \nthanks \nto  \nfurther \nwins \nat \nAssen \nand  \nLaguna, \nthat \nleft \nus  \nonly \nthirty-two \npoints \nbehind \nJorge \nwith \neight \nraces \nstill \nto \ngo. \nEverything \nchanged \nwithin \na \nsplit \nsecond \non \nthe \nfourth \nlap \nof \nqualifying, \nwhen \nthe \nrear \nstepped \nout \non \nthe \nexit \nof \nthe \nleft-hand \nturn \nthirteen \nand \nlaunched \nme \nover \nthe \nfront \nof \nthe \nbike \nat \naround \n150km/h. \nThe \nfirst \nthing \nto \ntouch \nthe \nground \nwas  \nthe \ntoe  \nof \nmy \nboot \nand \nthe \nimpact \nripped \nmy \nfoot \naround. \nImagine \ndriving \nalong \nin \nyour \ncar \nat \nthat \nspeed \nand \nsticking \nyour \nfoot \nout \nof \nthe \ndoor \n— \nthat’s \npretty \nmuch \nwhat \nit \nwas \nlike. \nI \ncame \ndown \nheavily \non \nmy \nfront, \nslid \nfor \naround \n50 \nmetres \nalong \nthe \ntarmac \nbefore \nrolling \nacross \nthe \ngrass \nand \neventually \ncoming \nto \na \nstop \nin \nthe \ngravel. \nI \nlooked \ndown \nat \nmy \nfoot, \nwhich \nwas \nfacing \nsideways, \nand \nI \nremember \nthinking, \nThis \nisn’t \ngood! \nThen, \nas \nI \nmoved \nmy \nweight \nonto \nmy \nother \nleg, \nI \nfelt \na \npop \nin \nmy \nankle \nand \nthere \nwas \na \nloud \ncrack. \nThe \npain \nwas \nunreal, \nso \nbad \nthat \nI \nhonestly \nthought \nmy \ntibia \nhad \ncome \nout \nthrough \nthe \nside \nof \nmy \nleg. \nBut \nit \nwas \nactually \nthe \nsound \nof \nthe \njoint \ngoing \nback \ninto \nthe \nsocket. \nI went for scans at a hospital in downtown Indianapolis, \nwhere the  doctors told  me  that  they'd never seen bone that \nbadly bruised before without it being broken in half —  it was \nso  bad  that  there was  bruising to  the  actual bone marrow. \nWe  emailed the  American doctor's notes to  Dr  Neil Halpin \nin  Australia along with a  photograph of the  ankle, which \nhad  ballooned to  double its  normal size, and  I had  a  short \nconversation on  the phone with him. Dr Halpin told me  that \n261 \nSLIWNIT Shel ONIN Sma \n\n262 \nCASEY STONER \nhe couldn’t make a full assessment without seeing the original \nscan documents, a process that would take several days, but \nhis advice was  that I shouldn't race. \nSeveral days was  too  long for me  and we  had to make our \ndecision the next  morning. Even though I was  in a lot of pain \nI decided to  take some painkillers and  get on  with it.  The \nankle was  so  swollen that Alpinestars helped customise a boot \ntwo  sizes larger than my normal ones to  fit me  for the  race. \nThankfully my qualifying time after those three laps was  still \ngood enough for sixth on  the grid, which gave us  a chance of \nfighting \nfor \nsome \ndecent \npoints, \nbut \nafter \na \nrough \nstart \nwe \nended up back in eighth on  the first lap and had to fight back. \nI was  doing that and just as  I was  closing in on  the top four \nBen Spies had  an  engine failure and  I found myself in the \nmiddle \nof \nthe \nsmoke, \nunsure \nwhere \nI \nwas \ngoing \nand \nwhat \nI \nmight \nhit \nand \nI \nlost \na \ncouple \nof \npositions \nagain. \nWe \nfought \nback \nup \nto \nthird \nplace \nand \nI \nwas \nhanging \non \nwith \nseven \nlaps \nleft \nbut \nthe \npainkillers \nhad \ngradually \nworn \noff. \nI \nwas \ncompensating \nfor \nmy \ninjury \nwith \nthe \nother \nside \nof \nmy \nbody \nand \nit \ntook \na \ntoll. \nI \nsimply \nhad \nno \nenergy \nleft. \nIt \nwas \nfrustrating \nto \nhave \nto \ngive \nup \nthe \nfinal \npodium \nposition \nto \nDovizioso \nbut \nat \nleast \nwe \nknew \nwe \nhad \ndone \neverything \nwe \ncould \nand \ntaken \nsome \npoints, \nwhich we  hoped would keep us  in the championship. \nDr  \nHalpin \nprobably \nwasn’t \ntoo  \nsurprised \nwhen \nhe \nlearnt \nI \nwas  \ngoing \nto  \nrace: \n‘Even \nthough \nI \nhadn’t \nseen \nthe  \nscans \nproperly \nyet \nI \ncould \nsee  \nthere \nwas  \na \ndefinite \nrisk \nof \nvascular \nproblems, \nsuch \nas \na \nblood \nclot, \nwhich \nis \nwhy \nmy \nadvice \nwas  \nnot \n\nto race. I have had to push an  ankle joint back in for a rugby \nplayer before and there was a lot of screaming. Casey’s courage \nis quite extraordinary and I think because he is physically so \nlittle you  don’t expect it.  He has an  extraordinarily high pain \nthreshold. I have been a  professional rugby league doctor \nat the  Sydney Roosters and  the  Newcastle Knights for over \nthirty years. I’ve  treated four broken necks, a cardiac arrest, \nruptured spleens, all sorts, but Casey is as  tough as  anybody \nI have ever met. To get back up with those injuries and race \nagain the  next day is one  of the  toughest things I’ve  seen in \nsport, up there with Andrew Johns playing in the 1997 Rugby \nLeague Grand Final with a broken rib and partly collapsed \nlung. It is also  one  of the  most unwise things I’ve  ever seen \ntoo!  But  ultimately as  a doctor all you  can  do is give advice. \nThe decision is up to the patient.’ \nBlocking pain out  is something my mum taught me  to do \nwhen I was  very  small. Her  method was  quite unusual but \nit worked: she  used to  tickle me.  It was  something she  had \nlearnt as a little girl from being constantly tickled by her older \nsiblings. Eventually she  realised that  through the  power of \nmind over matter she  could block it out  and  not  react. She \nlater applied the  same theory to  physical pain and  through \ntickling me  taught me  how. Even though I am  clearly not \nimmune to pain I am  able  to put it to one  side when I really \nhave to. \nAfter the race  we  sent  the original scans back to Australia \nby courier so  that Dr  Halpin could properly analyse them \n263 \nS LPNS ssc SNA Sita \n\n264 \nCASEY STONER \nbut it was  an  anxious wait for the results. The  next race was \nthe  following weekend in the  Czech Republic so  we  had no \nalternative but  to travel from the  USA to  Europe and  hope \nfor the  best. To  be honest, having already raced at  Indy, I \nfully expected to  be  competing again at  Brno but  the  day \nbefore free practice was  due to start the news came through: \nI needed immediate surgery and would have to miss the next \nthree races at least, maybe even the rest  of the season. Either \nway, our  championship was  over. \nDr Neil Halpin: “Casey flew to the Czech Republic and I \nthought, You’re crazy, you're not  going to  make it! I studied \nthe  plates and  I could see  he had  five  fractures inside his \nankle. He  had a  10-millimetre fracture to  the  talus bone, \nwhich is the  ball  of the  ankle joint, a  fracture at the  bottom \nend  of the  tibia and  torn multiple ligaments including the \ndeltoid ligament, which is the main ligament complex on  the \ninside of the  ankle. Thankfully Casey decided to  follow my \nadvice and flew back to Australia to  have surgery. I saw  him \non  27 August and we  did  an  arthroscopic procedure on  the \nthirtieth.’ \nId had  to  wait three days for the  operation after seeing \nDr \nHalpin \nbecause \nthey \nneeded \nthe \nswelling \nto \ngo \ndown \nfirst, \notherwise \nI \nwould \nhave \nhad \nthe \nsurgery \nimmediately. \nThe \nperiod \nafter \nthe \nsurgery \nwas \nfrustrating \nbut \nthere \nwas \nnothing \nI \ncould \ndo \nabout \nit. \nKnowing \nthat \nI \nhad \nno \nchance \nto \nretire \nas \nWorld \nChampion \nI \nstarted \nfocusing \non \nmy \nrecovery \nfor \nPhillip \nIsland, \nwhich \nwas  \ntwo  \nmonths \naway. \nWinning \nthere \n\nfor the sixth time in a row would at least be a nice way to sign \noff from my career and give myself some kind  of closure on \neverything that  had  happened that  year. I spent six  weeks \nrecovering. (While I was having trouble walking, Ally was \nmastering getting around in a walker. She would occasionally \nlaunch herself at  me  and  bash into  my  ankle on  the  way. \nProbably not the best way to give the ankle a rest but I wasn’t \nabout to  stop  her!) We  were able  to  come back as  planned \nfor the Japanese round at Motegi, which along with the next \nround at Sepang would give me  a chance to get a feel for the \nbike and test  my fitness before my home Grand Prix.  I hadn't \ntrained in months and could still barely walk on  my ankle but \njust like when I came back from illness in 2009 I didn’t believe — \nit was  going to be a problem. I knew that my body would pull \nthrough if I needed it. \nWe  managed fifth place in  Japan, where I struggled to \nget the bike  fully leaned over  because I couldn’t get my foot \nout  of the way. Sepang was  less physically demanding, firstly \nbecause there aren’t so  many slow  comers that  I needed to \npick the bike up from and also because it rained on  race  day. \nThere was  more of a risk of crashing, of course, which would \nhave been a complete disaster but we  stuck it out and got our \nreward with a podium. That set us  up nicely for Phillip Island. \nThis was  a big race that  meant a lot.  As  always Adri was \nthere, she  gave me  a  kiss  on  the  front of my  crash helmet \nbefore heading back to the garage as  the rest  of the grid was \ncleared. \n265 \nSLINIA SH OMNI Ss fad \n\n266 \nCASEY “STONER \nAs  soon as  the  lights went out  I released the  clutch but  I \nwas a split second too  late and Lorenzo and Dani both made \nthe jump and edged ahead of me  on  the inside. \nThe  key to the start is not  to be overly committed. If you \nare  committed to  one  line  then you  are  going to  cue people \nup and that’s no  good for them or  you  so,  especially over the \nlast  few years of my career, I have learnt to  go into the  first \nturn of the race  with caution. I have always prided myself on \nthe fact that  I have never taken another rider out in any part \nof the race, apart from Sete Gibernau at Estoril in 2006. But \nI have never gone punching in and knocked somebody off the \ntrack. I'll even apologise if I get too  close. \nWe were safely tucked into third position ahead of the two \nsatellite Yamahas of Cal  Crutchlow and  Andrea Dovizioso \nas  we  came into the  long left-hander at  turn two, Doohan \nCorner. \nTurn three at Phillip Island is a fast downhill left-hander, \nalmost flat  out  in  fifth gear, and  it is probably my favourite \ncorner in the world. Unbelievably, it is now also named after \nme.  There was  a ceremony the Thursday before the race  and I \nwas  given a commemorative plate with twenty-seven diamonds \nin \nit, \nto \nmatch \nmy \nracing \nnumber, \nwhich \nwas \nsomething \nquite \nspecial. \nIt \nis \na \ngreat \nprivilege \nand \npretty \ncool \nto \nhave \na \ncorner \nnamed \nafter \nyou, \nbut \nespecially \nso \nbecause \napparently \nI \nride \nthis corner differently to anybody else. \nI can  particularly remember my  qualifying lap here in \n2011. \nWith \nnew  \ntyres \nand \nloads \nof \ngrip \nI \nwent \ninto \ntum  \nthree \n\nand shut off for the least amount of time I ever  have and then \ngot straight back on  the  throttle. The  data  showed I was  at \n262kmm/h and the slowest point of the corner was  258km/h. It \nwas  damn quick but  I was  completely sideways and  had  my \nfront wheel halfway across the kerb. That day I got it as  good \nas  I ever have but every time I go through this corner it gives \nme  a great rush and  really gets the blood flowing. This time \nwas  no  different. \nDani Pedrosa needed to win this race  to have any realistic \nchance of keeping his title hopes alive. He was  fighting hard, \nattacking from the front, and he got the best of Jorge at turn \nfour, Honda Comer — a tight right-hand hairpin —  to take the \nlead, forcing Jorge to sit up. \nI knew I had  the  pace to  win  so  I wasn’t worried about \nbeing in  third on  the  first  lap. I knew I could afford to  be \npatient, hold back and pick my moment. We  were making \nground on  almost every corner and  as  we  came around the \nlong sweeping left-hand turn eleven to  complete the  lap I \ndrove up  the  inside of Jorge coming out  of the  last  corner. \nDani was  immediately ahead of me  as we  tipped into  Doohan \nCorner for the second time, peeled around turn two  and then \nslid into Stoner Corner. (It still sounds weird to call it that.) \nWhen Dani turned into turn four, he ran  a little wide and \nas  the  circuit was  deteriorating out  wider when he tried to \nget back for the  apex he lost the front on  the rough tarmac, \nspinning him across the bitumen and ending his championship. \nI felt for him —  it’s a small mistake that’s very easy to make but \n267 \n3 LD ies Sida GaN Sor ae \n\n268 \nCASEY STONER \nthe bottom line was  I now  had clear track ahead of me.  Jorge \nknew that  second place was  enough for him  to wrap up the \ntitle  and  even though he was  desperate to  celebrate with a \nwin  I knew he wouldn't take as  many risks. All  I had  to  do \nwas  stick to  my pace, stay focused and  make the most of the \nopportunity. \nI always used to enjoy riding my Ducati at Phillip Island, \nit is one  of the  best tracks in the world for that  bike. It had \nquite a long wheelbase so it was  stable in the long fast comers. \nIt would move a little but  it had  a  stability that  the  Honda \ndoesn’t have, it can  get a little nervous and twitchy if the \nset-up isn’t right so  we  have really had  to  work hard to  get \ncomfortable with it. But once we  found what we were looking \nfor it became a lot easier. \nI had just twenty-five laps of the track left to go riding the \nfastest motorcycle ever built. \nAfter twelve laps I had  a  4-second advantage over Jorge \nbut I let it drop slightly, allowing him to close the gap before \npushing to  open it up  again, purely for  the  sake of giving \nmyself an  extra point of focus. You  only have to  lose your \nconcentration for a split second before you end up like  Dani \ndid in turn  four. The  only thing I allow to  distract me  is the \ncrowd. \nThere \nwere \nAustralian \nflags \neverywhere \nand \nI \nwanted \nto \nsoak \nup \nthis \nunique \nmoment \nin \nmy \nlife. \nThe \nfinal \ntwo \nlaps \nwere \nthe \nbest. \nI \nknew \nthe \nrace \nwas \nwrapped \nup \nand \nI \ndidn’t \nhave \nto \nlook \nafter \nthe \ntyres \nanymore. \nI \nspun \nthe \nrear \ntyre \neven \nmore \nthan \nI \nneeded \nto \nthrough \nturn  \nthree \nand \nenjoyed \nthe \ncorner. \n\nAfter twenty-seven laps —  the perfect number —  I came out \nof \nturn \ntwelve \nfor \nthe \nfinal \ntime \nand \nsaw \nthe \nchequered \nflag \nbeing prepared. It’s  a familiar moment of relief and joy but \nthat day it held extra significance. Winning at Phillip Island for \nthe sixth time was  the perfect way to finish my MotoGP career. \nThe celebrations after the  race were awesome and \neverywhere I turned someone wanted to  congratulate me \nor  shake my hand. Adri, Ally, Mum, Dad and  lots  of friends \nwere there to share it all with me  and that made it even more \nspecial. It was  a  great way  to  say goodbye to  the  sport and \ncelebrate all we’d achieved. \nWhile putting this  book together Livio sent  this  message \nto be included: “Working with Casey has been something very \nspecial. He  has, as  a person, all the  quality values (honesty, \nlove of family, respect for the people he works with) and as  a \nrider, he is simply “the fastest man on earth”, by far. His talent \nis unbelievable. There are  some moments in his career that I \nwill never forget. His  first test  at Qatar, under artificial lights \nwas  so  much faster than the others that I thought he’d found \na short cut.’ \nEarning the  respect of people like  Livio and  the  team \nmeans a  lot to  me  and  the  friendships I’ve  made through \nracing have given me  and my family so  much more than  I'd \never  dreamed of. I was  leaving at the right time  but stepping \naway from competition did  mean people I'd spent so  much \ntime  with wouldn’t be part of my day-to-day life any longer. \nSaying goodbye is always hard. . \n269 \nS LIN ti aSueliss SN el See \n\n270 \nCASES y-a1 oe NES \nAfter the emotional few days at Phillip Island we  finished \nthe  2012 Championship with another podium in  mixed \nconditions at Valencia, a race I wanted to win  purely to  end \nup with the same number of wins for the season as  Dani and \nJorge. Considering the races we’d missed, it’s pretty incredible \nthat we  could have done that. Obviously the  year didn’t \nwork out  how we'd hoped and I was happy for Jorge, who \nfully deserved his  championship, but  without the  chatter \nproblems early in the year and  the  ankle injury I know that \nDani and  I could have dominated that season even more, \nwithout a doubt. \nlearnt a lot in those last two  years of my MotoGP career, \n(pee myself, my  priorities and my  life in  general. \nThroughout my career, racing was always my sole focus and \nI thought I had to do it all on  my own. Id seen other riders \nwith heaps of people around them —  a  personal assistant, \npublic relations person, etc.  —  but  I never felt like  I needed \nthat. I was  wrong. When I started working with Honda press \nofficer Rhys Edwards, he helped show me  that I didn’t have \nto be so  serious about it all, or take it all on  my shoulders. He \nknows perfectly where the line is and when you can  get away \nwith light-hearted fun  and when it’s  time to  be all business. \n\nI \nlike \nRhys’s \npitinedos \nhe  \nalways \nhas  \na \njoke \nhandy \nand  \ncan \ndefuse \nan \nawkward \nsituation \n(or \noccasionally \ncause \none!) \nwhen \nneeded. \nWith \nRhys \nand  \nmy  \nclose \nfriend \nChris \nHillard \nfrom \nAlpinestars \naround \nI \nstarted \nto \nenjoy \nmyself \nat \nthe \ntrack \na \nlot \nmore. \nAdri \nand \nAlly \nwere \nalso \na \nbig \npart \nof \nme \ngetting \nmy \nhead \naway \nfrom \nbikes. \nIt \nis \nhealthy \nto \nhave \nother \ninterests \nand \nit \nhad \nan \nadded \nbenefit \ntoo, \nbecause \nI \nwas \nbuilding \nup \nmy \nphysical \nand \npsychological \nreserves \nwithout \neven \nrealising \nit. \nUp \nuntil \nthe \nlast \nfew \nyears \nI'd \npushed \nso \nhard \nall \nthe \ntime \nthat \nmy \ntank \nwas \nalways \non \nthe \nred \nline, \nso \nas \nsoon \nas \nillness \nor \nanything \nstressful \nhappened \nI \nwas \ninstantly \neating \ninto \nmy \nreserves. \nIt \nis \nprobably \nnot \nsurprising \nthat \neventually \nI \nfelt \nbunt \nout. \nIt \nwasn't \nuntil \nI \nhad \nachieved \nmy \ngoals \nin \nthe \nsport \nthat \nI \nfelt \nI \ncould \nstart \nto \nenjoy \nother \nthings \nin \nlife. \nIneeded \nto \nget \naway \nand \nrelax \na \nlittle, \nand \nthat’s \nsomething \nI \nam  \nmaking \na \nconscious \neffort \nto \ndo \nnow  \nthat  \nI \nam  \nstarting \nmy \nnext \nadventure. \nI’ve \nlearnt \nit’s \nreally \nimportant \nto \nkeep \na \nbalance \nin \nyour \nlife \nand \nmake \nsure  \nyou \ndon’t \nmake \nthe \nhighs \ntoo \nhigh \nand \nthe \nlows \ntoo \nlow. \nWhatever \nchallenges \nI \ntake  \non  \nnow  \nI \nam  \nstill  \ndriven \nby \nthe  \nsame \nquest \nto \nimprove \n—  \nI \ncan’t \nchange \nwho  \nI \nam.  \nAs  \na \npersonality \ntrait  \nthis  \nis \nboth \na \ngood \nthing \nand  \na  \nbad  \nthing. \nI \nlike \nthat \npart \nof \nme  \nbut \nit \nwould \nbe \nnice  \nto \nnot  \nbe \nlike \nthat \nsometimes, \nto \nenjoy \nsomething \nwithout \nbeing \nobsessed \nwith \ngetting \nbetter \nat \nit.  \nI \nam  \nsure  \nyou  \ncan \ngo \nthrough \nlife  \na \nlot \nhappier \nif \nyou  \ndon’t \nanalyse \neverything. \nFor  \nthe  \ntime \nbeing \n271 \nSLIWNI)T SHALL ONIN Sha \n\n272 \nGCASEY STONER \nI can’t see  myself changing, though, and that is why I was  so \nquick to set myself new  goals. \nPeople say I am  going to  miss MotoGP and that  one  day \nI'll come back but  I’m  not  sure. At the  moment I think not. \nBikes are  still my passion but now I can  ride for pure pleasure. \nThere are  so  many other things I want to  do.  I am  enjoying \nlearning the  intricacies of V8s  and  not  really worried about \nresults, though my competitive side always wants more. I want \nto  improve my skiing and  snowboarding to  the point where \nI can  heli-ski anywhere in  the  world. Something like  that \nwould have been too dangerous for me to try while I was  racing \nbikes for fear of injury, but now I can  have a go. My other big \npassion, besides my  family, is fishing, which is something I \nhave done ever since I was  a  toddler catching trout in the \ncreek up  at  Niangala. I’ve always loved it and  whenever \nI was  home I would try my luck, even though I didn’t really \nknow what I was doing. Now it has  turned into a  whole \ndifferent thing. \nIt was  in  2008 that  I finally had  a bit of time to  actually \ngo on a holiday and pursue a hobby that interested me,  so  I \nwent up north catching barramundi with my cousin Mark and \nLeon Camier and guided by Jason Wilhelm. I remember we \nstruggled a lot because the  conditions weren’t good but we \nkept trying, doing long days and just learning and learning. \nAt  the  beginning of 2011 I was introduced to  Paul \nWorsteling, who many people in Australia will  know as  the \nfishing expert and host of the  television program IFISH. \n\nA mutual friend put  e in  touch and  Paul invited me  out \nto  Western Australia to  fish with him and film a  few \nepisodes for his show. I was  throwing up for most of the trip \nbecause I'd been bitten by a white tip spider and the bite had \nbecome infected. I had  to  go on  antibiotics, which worked \nagainst my  seasickness tablets and  made me  twice as  sick \nas  I get normally. It was  a  rough trip but  the  fishing was \ninsane, plus Paul was  really easy to be around and a very funny \nbloke. \nAdri and  I have become good friends with Paul and  his \nwife Cristy. They came over to Valencia for my final MotoGP \nrace. Now I’ve retired I'd like to film more fishing shows with \nhim  and learn as  much as  I can  about all the different kinds \nof fishing around Australia. The  thing I like  most about the \nsport is the  unpredictability. Some days you  can  fish  all day \nand not catch a single thing and you'll be scratching your head \nwondering why and  then the  next  day you  can’t keep them \noff your line. Again it’s a sport that appeals to my competitive \nside, of constantly wanting to improve, and  I know fishing is \nsomething I will be able to enjoy for the rest  of my life. \nI certainly don’t plan to return to motorcycle racing at this \npoint but Id still really like to help find some fresh Australian \ntalent if I can.  I might turn up at a few dirt-track meetings and \nhave a look if there are  any quick kids  out  there but believe \nme,  more than looking for natural talent I'll be looking for \nattitude, because without it they are  going nowhere, with  or \nwithout support. \n273 \nS LVN 1 fa SN NS Biel \n\n274 \nCASEY 2S ON Ee \nWe  have a couple of kids showing promise in the  World \nChampionship at  the  moment but  for  some reason they \nseem to  be  challenging for the  podium one  weekend and \nstruggling for points the  next. How do you  explain that? It \nhas to be a motivational thing. People complain about a lack \nof opportunities out there but that’s never been any different. \nTeams survive on  riders bringing in money but they still have \nto get results and if somebody special comes along they'll find \na space for them. I’d be happy to help if I find the  right kid. \nI don’t think we  could ever have achieved what we  did if it \nwasn't for people extending a hand here or  there; guys like \nTerry Pav, Ian  Newton, Paul Feeney, George Lloyd, Alberto \nPuig, Lucio Cecchinello and James Strong. \nLooking back at the end of my motorcycling career I feel \na  mixture of emotions. I won two  World Championships, \ntravelled the world, met great people and  because of motor \nracing met my wife. I have a  beautiful home, my health, a \nprecious daughter, a  great family and I don’t have to  work \nagain if I don’t want to. What more can  I ask for than that? \nI know I said earlier I don’t believe in luck and  it’s  true, \nI have worked hard to  get to  this  point but  I can  still  say  I \nam  a very lucky man. I hope that in sharing my story I might \ninspire others to  follow their dream and  push the  limits of \nwhat they can  do.  If I had any advice to pass  on  it is to trust \nyour instincts, do it your way and never, ever, ever give up. \nWho knows where you may end up! \n\nCASEY STONES \nSrATISTics \nDATE  \nGRAND \nPAIX \nRESULT \nMILESTONE \nJuly \nGreat \nBritain/ \nAeA \nGrand \nPrix \ndebut \nas \na \nwildcard \n2001 Donington/1 25cc rider at the  age  of fifteen \nOctober Australia/Phillip 12 Finishes in the  points in second \n2001 Island/125cc GP appearance and the first at \nhome Grand Prix \nMay Spain/Jerez/250cc 6 Finishes sixth in third start as  a \n2002 full-time Grand Prix  rider in the \n290cc class —  the youngest-ever \nrider to finish in the top six in the \nintermediate class of GP racing \nJuly Germany/ 2 Second place finish at Germany \n2003 Sachsenring/125cc GP —  making Casey the youngest \nAustralian rider to finish on  a GP \npodium.

It was  as  if he had been pre-programmed to be a \nroad racer, he was  extremely quick right from the get-go. He \nhad such a rapid rate of learning it was difficult to  structure \n_a program to  keep pace, but  I knew he didn’t need to  be \nlectured in a classroom situation with a whiteboard.’ \nThe  main thing Pav taught me  was  that you can  only ride \nwhat you can  see, which was something that stuck with me \nthroughout my career. I remember a couple of his favourite \nphrases: ‘If you’re not sliding you're not riding,’ and ‘If you're \non the grass you're on your arse!’ I found out the hard way that \nthe second phrase was  true but I actually enjoyed my first crash \non the Moriwaki.

We \nboth knew I had to take every opportunity and he encouraged \nme  to do just that.

The stability I was  getting from the  front was \nlike  nothing I had  ever  had  before and  I set  my best  lap of \nthe  three-day test  on  a rear  tyre  that  already had  full  race \ndistance on  it.  The  only thing that  held us  back was  that  I \nstarted getting cramps in my arms but  I wasn’t too  worried. \nI was  in the best shape of my life  after spending the winter \ntraining with Anthony Peden, a top level international track \ncyclist, and  the  cramps cleared up at the  next test  at Phillip \nIsland, which is where the  bike really came good. We  did"

We'd had a good test \nthere the week before so we  knew we  had good potential and \nwe  confirmed it in qualifying, when I was  just 0.005 seconds \noff the pole position set by Valentino Rossi. \nThe  race  was  pretty much a  22-lap battle between the \ntwo  of us,  Valentino passing me  in the tight sections where I \ncouldn't get the bike turned and  me  getting him  back down \n_the straight, simply because I couldn't get close enough to \nhim  coming out  of the corners to do it anywhere else. Every \ntime he came past me  I had  to wring the bike’s neck just to \nstay close enough to him to get him back again on the straight. \nI knew that  if I didn’t do it every time then the  gap  would \nincrease through the rest of the lap and I would lose touch. We \ngradually wore him down and on  the last three laps he started \nto lose touch. I didn’t realise I had a gap so I kept pushing and \non  the very last lap I set my fastest time of the race. \nIt was  easy to  the  naked eye  to  differentiate the  straight \nline  speed advantage of the  Ducati over the Yamaha but the \naverage person can’t see  how badly a bike  is handling in the \nS WN La SSA SNES eel"

You  are  short- \nshifting out  of a tight left-hander all the way up to fifth gear, \ntrying so hard to get the power to the track whilst keeping the \nfront down, and then suddenly everything gets light and starts \nsliding around underneath you  at  over 265km/h —  I always \nhad an  absolute ball going over  there.

Don’t get  me  wrong, MotoGP is  as \nsafe as  it has  ever been in terms of the  gravel traps, circuit \nlayouts and  rider equipment, but the fact  that  certain riders \nwere still  putting others at  risk  even after Marco’s death \nbothered me a lot.

Even the  Safety Commission, set \nup by the riders, seemed to have become less about safety and, \nfor a few members, more about guys trying to get their own \nway. As far as  I was  concerned we  were basically puppets in \na show and I wasn’t sure I wanted to be a part of it anymore. \nFor a few years I’d been feeling differently about the sport \nI loved. I'd thought I was  working with people who shared the \nsame passions and  goals as  I did but I’d come to realise that \nwasn't always the case.

Marco’s death wasn’t the \ncause of my disillusionment, but it did bring it all into sharp \nfocus for me.

I have a  beautiful home, my health, a \nprecious daughter, a  great family and I don’t have to  work \nagain if I don’t want to. What more can  I ask for than that? \nI know I said earlier I don’t believe in luck and  it’s  true, \nI have worked hard to  get to  this  point but  I can  still  say  I \nam  a very lucky man. I hope that in sharing my story I might \ninspire others to  follow their dream and  push the  limits of \nwhat they can  do.  If I had any advice to pass  on  it is to trust \nyour instincts, do it your way and never, ever, ever give up. \nWho knows where you may end up!"
