  "content": "Long Live MotorcycLe racing\nFor the past 90 years, motorcycle racing has been an integral part of the history of BMW Motorrad.  \nWhether on or off the road, in an attempt to set a new speed record, riding solo or with a sidecar,  \nBMW Motorrad and motorcycling racing are inextricably linked.\nMotorsports\n108\n\nSUCCESS RIGHT FROM THE START\nBack in the 1920s, the best way to gain \npublicity for a new motorcycle, particu-\nlarly for a new brand name, was to \nachieve success in sporting events. It was \nninety years ago, in 1923, that Max Friz \nrode his R 32 (even though the model had \nnot yet actually been launched) in the \n“Race through Bavaria‘s Mountains”, a \nreliability test organised by the Munich \nAutomobile Club, without incurring a \n single penalty point. What better way of \ndemonstrating BMW Motorrad‘s concept \nof “tested in sport, proven in series”? \nThe young engineer Rudolf Schleicher \nwas also well aware of this. Once he had \ncompleted the final detailed engineering \nfor the R 32, his mind returned to the rac-\ning career that he had commenced not \nlong beforehand. And so, on February 2, \n1924, he went on to clock the best time of \nthe day at the Mittenwalder Steig moun-\ntain race, at once becoming the Bavarian \nMotor Works‘ very first winner of a racing \nevent, and writing BMW history as a \nresult, \n➊\n.\nOn May 18, 1924, three BMW works \nriders lined up at the Stuttgart Solitude \nwith their R 37s plus OHV cylinder head \nconstructed by Rudolf Schleicher, and \nwon the event across three classes. This \nachievement was followed by further vic-\ntories in several prestigious national races \nin Germany, including the first master \ntitle, which was awarded to Franz Bieber, \nalso riding an R 37; this established BMW \nDIPL-ING.

In the following \nyears, the German motorcycle racing \nscene would be dominated by works and \nprivate riders using motorcycles from \nMunich.\nVICTORIES AT THE SIXDAYS AND \nTHE TARGA FLORIO\nA further victory came in 1925, with the \nGerman 250-cc class championship, \nwhich BMW claimed with an R 39. On an \ninternational level, the remarkable flat-\ntwin Boxer, with its unusual shaft drive to \nthe rear wheel, caused a sensation at the \nsix-day race in Buxton, England in 1926, \nwhen Rudolf Schleicher won the gold \nmedal. The commentators in the British \npress were full of praise for the BMW, \ncalling it the motorcycle with the “most \nadvanced” construction; BMW was now \nmaking a name for itself internationally. \nMeanwhile, victories by Paul Köppen and \nErnst Henne at the Sicilian Targa Florio \nwere also turning heads over in Italy. By \n1929, BMW Motorrad had won the pres-\ntigious 500-cc class title several times \nrunning.\nIn 1933, the BMW team won the \nnations ranking in the international six-\nday race at Llandrindod Wells in Wales, \non two R 16 solo bikes and an R 16 bike \nand sidecar, the first such win for Ger-\nmany. It defended its title again the fol-\nlowing year, also with R 16 bikes, fol-\nlowed by a further victory in 1935 at the \nSixdays, this time with 500-cc compressor \nmodels.\nWORLD SPEED RECORD WITH \nSUPERCHARGER\nThe idea of participating in world record \ncontests came from Ernst Henne, and fit-\ntingly, he was the one in the saddle in the \ncontest for the absolute world speed \nrecord for motorcycles. It was in 1929 that \nhe set a new world record of 216.75 km/h \nwith a 750-cc BMW on the Ingolstädter \nLandstrasse near Munich; this was but the \nfirst round of a long series of attempts at \nsetting new levels of top performance. He \nwent to achieve another 75 world-best \nperformances, culminating in a phenome-\nnal 279.5 km/h on November 28, 1937, \nwhich he achieved with a streamlined, \nsupercharged 500-cc BMW, \n➋\n. The record \nhe set was to remain in place for the next \n14 years, an achievement that would seal \nBMW’s reputation as a motorcycle manu-\nfacturer of international standing. \nIt was thanks to the enhanced perform-\nance brought about by supercharging that \nstandard-production OHV racing engines \ncould achieve racing and world record \nsuccesses. Moreover, the complex racing \nengines constructed by Rudolf Schleicher \nhad two overhead camshafts on each side \nof the cylinder, driven by an upright shaft, \nplus compressor. This meant that from \n1935 onwards, it was finally possible to \ngive the leading British and Italian com-\npetitors a fair run for their money. After \nGrand Prix victories in 1936 and 1937, \nGeorg “Schorsch” Meier won the Euro-\npean championship title in 1938, riding a \nsupercharged BMW racing motorcycle, \n➌\n. \nThis was the first year in which the Euro-\npean road championship was held over \nan entire season, similar to international \ncontests nowadays. Previously, the title \ncould only be bestowed following victory \nin the European Grand Prix.\nSCHORSCH MEIER MAKES  \nTT HISTORY\nWith the new member of the BMW Team, \nthe former off-road rider Schorsch Meier, \nthe supercharged BMW was virtually \nunbeatable. He was the one to find a way \nof making optimum use of the engine‘s \ngreat potential combined with the low \nvehicle weight, culminating in victory in \nthe Senior TT on the Isle of Man in 1939, \nthe greatest racing success that BMW \nMotorrad had achieved up to that point. \nIn second place was Meier‘s team mate, \nJock West, \n➍\n. Even then, the TT was \nregarded as the biggest challenge in \nmotorcycle racing and Meier was the first \nnon-British entrant to win the premiere \nclass.\nSUCCESSFUL START INTO THE \nPOST-WAR PERIOD\nIn the first years after the Second World \nWar, Germany was excluded from taking \npart in any international sporting events, \nincluding motor racing. For this reason, \nracing events were restricted to national \nterrain. In 1947, a year before the first \npost-war BMW motorcycle left the pro-\nduction lines, BMW took another oppor-\ntunity to raise its brand profile through its \nracing performance, when Schorsch Meier \n➊\n Rudolf Schleicher went down in history as the first ever winner of a racing \nevent for the Bavarian Motor Works\n➋\n Ernst Henne with his 500-cc BMW that he took to 279.503 km/h on the \nmotorway near Frankfurt on November 28, 1937\nMOTORSPORTS\n110\n\neased his way to victory in the German \nchampionship. The BMW works rider fol-\nlowed this success with further victories \nin 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1953.\nTHE GOLDEN AGE OF THE RS   \nENGINE WITH DOHC AND VERTICAL \nSHAFTS\nThis was the time in which hundreds of \nthousands of people got to see both \nSchorsch Meier and Walter Zeller ride \ntheir BMW RS racers to victory. The BMW \nRS racing Boxers with vertical shafts and \ntwo overhead camshafts per cylinder \nturned in an unparalleled string of victo-\nries, even in the sidecar class. In 1954, \nWilhelm Noll and Fritz Cron achieved the \nfirst world championship title with the \nBMW RS combination, \n➎\n, in the sidecar \nclass. Between 1954 and 1974, BMW rac-\ning combinations would win a total of 19 \nrider classifications and 20 manufacturer‘s \nchampionships. Klaus Enders took the \nworld championship no less than six \ntimes.\nFOCUS ON OFF-ROAD RACING  \nIN THE 1960S\nAfter the withdrawal of the works riders \nfrom the road-racing solo classes, Munich \nwas free to focus on its off-road activity. \nOne advantage was that it allowed BMW \nto continually develop and improve its \nmotorcycles, with Sebastian Nachtmann, \nManfred Sensburg and Herbert Schek the \nmost well-known riders. Of these, Schek \nwent on to perform his own develop-\nments, aiming towards an optimum off-\nroad BMW, which would eventually \nbecome the BMW GS 800, the predeces-\nsor of the R 80 G/S.\nON SUPERBIKE TERRAIN  \nWITH THE R 90 S\nThe American journalist Bob Braverman \nfirst coined the term “superbike” in “Cycle \nGuide Magazine” in 1969. He was talking \nabout the new, large-engine motorcycles of \n➌ \n Georg “Schorsch” Meier performing a jump in his supercharged BMW\n➍\n Jock West at the Tourist Trophy (Senior TT) 1939\n➎\n Noll and Cron with \na BMW 500-cc RS \ncombination crossing \nthrough a town on \nthe Isle of Man \n(1955)\n111October 2013    90 Years BMW Motorrad\n\n750 cc and above that were gaining in \npopularity at that time. Only a short time \nlater, the “Levi’s Superbike Series” was \nheld in Australia, followed in 1976 by the \nfirst season of the US Superbike Champi-\nonship in the USA, in which BMW Motor-\nrad was also involved, together with the \nteam from the American importer, Butler \n& Smith, \n➏\n. The later founder of the \nSuperbike World Championship, Steve \nMcLaughlin, along with Reg Pridmore, \nanother American, were signed as riders \nof the meanwhile 1000 cc BMW R 90 S. \nWhile McLaughlin was victorious in the \nseason‘s prestigious first event, the 200-\nmile Daytona race, Pridmore was able to \nclaim the title of the first US superbike \nchampion at the end of the season.\nIn the late 1970s, ongoing world records \nwere gaining attention, and in the years \n1977 and 1980, BMW Motorrad joined in \nwith the recently launched R 100 RS, the \nfirst series-production motorcycle in the \nworld to be developed in a wind tunnel. \nBut for its shortened suspension travel \nand lack of lower body panels, it was \nlargely a standard-production motorcycle, \nand it was soon put to good use compet-\ning in the world record events held in the \nItalian town of Nardo, \n➐\n, taking part in \nraces over 10, 100 and 1000 km as well as \none, six, twelve and 24 hours. Also taking \npart: Helmut Dähne. \nFROM VICTORY TO VICTORY WITH \nTHE BMW GS \nFour years later, the subject of motor racing \nwas to gain a considerable push at BMW \nMotorrad, with Rolf Witthöft winning the \nEuropean Offroad Championship, riding an \noff-road 800-cc BMW, \n➑\n. With perfect tim-\ning, the series version of this enduro bike – \nthe R 80 G/S with the BMW Monolever sin-\ngle-sided swing arm on the rear wheel – \nwas launched to the general public in \nautumn of that year. This motorcycle not \nonly established the new touring or large \nenduro segment, but also went on to win \nfurther prestigious sporting titles for BMW \nMotorrad over the following years.\nRight from the start, BMW off-road \nmotorcycles took part in the Paris-Dakar \nrally through the West African country of \nSenegal. In 1981, the Boxer finally asserted \nitself thanks to its robust and reliable air-\nflow cooling, ease of maintenance, and \nshaft drive. The French desert specialist, \nHubert Auriol, won the motorcycle classifi-\ncation, and repeated his success in 1983. \nThe 1000-cc two-cylinder maintained its \nclose similarity to standard-production \nmodels, claiming victories in 1984 and \n1985 when the former Belgian world Moto \nCross champion, Gaston Rahier, upped and \nleft the competition, \n➒\n. In 1992, the later \ncar-racing driver, Jutta Kleinschmidt, cele-\nbrated her victory in the women’s classi-\nfication at the Cape Town rally, riding a \nBMW R 100 GS after 12,700 km.\nDESERT RALLY TRIUMPHS \nIn 1999, no less than four BMW works \nriders lined up at the start of the Paris-\nDakar in Granada, riding the 55-kW \n(75 hp) rally version of the BMW F 650. \nEighteen days and 9022 kilometres later, \nthe event was won by Richard Sainct from \nSaint-Affrique, France. In 2000, the rally \nwas routed from Dakar to Cairo in Egypt, \nand BMW entered four specially devel-\noped F 650 RR bikes, plus, in a surprise \n➏\n Poster “BMW: 1976 Superbike Champion in the USA”\n➐\n Near-series production BMW R 100 RS at the 24-hours world \nrecord attempts in Nardo, Italy on October 29 and 30, 1977\nMOTORSPORTS\n112\n\nmove, two R 900 RR models – the newly \ndesigned rally version of the four-valve \nBoxer. After its debut appearance with \nJimmy Lewis at the handlebars, it \nachieved third place, which together with \nthe triple performance of the F 650 RR \nriders, resulted in a four-times victory for \nBMW Motorrad, \n❿\n. Richard Sainct \nrepeated his previous year‘s success, \nOscar Gallardo came in second, and Jean \nBrucy finished in fourth place. In addi-\ntion, Andrea Mayer took the women’s title \nin the Paris-Dakar for the third time in a \nrow, also riding an F 650 RR.\nThe resounding success of the one-cyl-\ninder motorcycle in 2000 was accompa-\nnied by the launch of the new F 650 GS to \nmark the moment the winners crossed the \nfinish line in Cairo. It lent a whole new \ndimension to the launch of the F 650 GS \ntwo months later, which retained the \nformer model‘s road performance and \nadded improved off-road capability.\nVICTORIOUS ONE-CYLINDER MOTOR-\nCYCLES BASED ON THE F 650\nThe Chrysalis team from the English city \nof Southampton made several headlines \nwith their one-cylinder, aluminium bridge-\nframe F 650. In 1997, 1998 und 1999, \nrider Dave Morris won the one-cylinder \nclass of the TT on the Isle of Man with a \n59 kW (80 hp) motorcycle weighing only \n134 kg. Only three years previously, in \n1995, the German PAMI team created a \nvery similar design for Herbert Enzinger, \nwhich weighed no more than 115 kg and \nhad a power output of 63 kW (85 hp). \nEnzinger not only won that year‘s Ger-\nman Supermono championship but also \ncelebrated a formidable third-place finish \nin the Daytona Speedweek. \nTHE BMW MOTORRAD BOXERCUP\nThe idea of a race series with identical \nBMW R 1100 S motorcycles was born in \nFrance. After two seasons in France and \nBelgium, the BoxerCup was organised as \nan international event for the first time in \n2001. Over seven heats held during the \nracing weekends of the motorcycle \nGrands-Prix and long-distance world \nchampionships, 30 riders from all over \nEurope competed with each other for the \nbrand trophy, riding near-series produc-\ntion BMW R 1100 S bikes. The already \nexciting heats were made even more \nthrilling by the presence of a number of \n➑\n Rolf Witthöft on a special stage with \nthe works GS\n➒ \n Gaston Rahier at the \nParis-Dakar rally in 1984\n113October 2013    90 Years BMW Motorrad\n\nguest participants. On one occasion, \nformer 500-cc Grand-Prix star, Randy \nMamola took to the handlebars, originally \nsigned as the ambassador of the BMW \nMotorrad BoxerCup, thrilling onlookers \nwith his spectacular riding style. The \n winner in 2001 and 2002 was Stephane \nMertens from Belgium. In 2003, the BMW \nMotorrad BoxerCup was held in the USA \nfor the first time, as a guest event at the \ntraditional season opener at the 200-mile \nDaytona meeting.\nEntrants in the 2005 season of the \nestablished BMW Motorrad brand cup \nlined up at the start with a completely \nnew BMW motorcycle: the BMW K 1200 \nR. The BMW Motorrad BoxerCup had \nnow grown into the BMW Motorrad \n PowerCup. The most powerful naked bike \nin the world, with 120 kW (163 hp), was \nresponsible for the extreme dynamism \nand excitement that characterised this rac-\ning season, thanks to its extreme perform-\nance potential, high-revving four-cylinder \nengine and characteristic appearance.\nSUCCESSFUL WORLD ENDURO \nCHAMPIONSHIP WITH THE G 450 X\nIn 2007, BMW presented its G 450 X, the \nfirst pure-blooded sport enduro for the \nattractive 450-cc class. Its crowning \nachievement came when Juha Salminen \nfrom Finland took the runner-up title in \nthe 2009 world championship in the E2 \nclass of the World Enduro Championship \n(WEC). After moving from the BMW \nMotorrad Motorsport team to the Husq-\nvarna brand, which was also part of \nBMW Motorrad, he succeeded in winning \nthe world championship in the E class  \nin 2011. \nIn 2007, the BMW Motorrad Motorsport \nEndurance team made its debut appear-\nance with the new HP2 Sport, the first \nseries-production Boxer with DOHC, at \nthe 24 Hours at Le Mans, exactly fifty \nyears after Walter Zeller‘s last works \nappearance in 1957. The riders Markus \nBarth, Thomas Hinterreiter and Rico Pen-\nzkofer finished in sixteenth place in the \noverall rankings and as winners in the \nopen class. The BMW Motorrad team won \nfour of the five world championship heats \nin the open class, easily gaining the title \nin this category.\nWORKS TEAM IN THE SUPERBIKE \nWORLD CHAMPIONSHIP\nIn 2008, exactly twenty years after the \nSuperbike World Championship was first \nestablished, BMW Motorrad announced \nits participation in this near-series world \nchampionship event, \n⓫\n. Just before the \nend of the year, the BMW Motorrad Mot-\norsport headquarters were inaugurated in \nStephanskirchen. The BMW S 1000 RR \nrequired for the homologation had not yet \nofficially been launched, but its four-cyl-\ninder engine was presented to the invited \nguests nevertheless.\nBarely three months later, the BMW \nMotorrad motorsport team debuted at the \nseason opener on the Australian Phillip \nIsland, with the two works riders, Troy \nCorser and Ruben Xaus. The second \nsuperbike world champion and local hero \n❿\n 2000: the victorious BMW Motorrad Team \nGauloise, from left to right:  \nMayer, Lewis, Sainct, Gallardo, Brucy\nMOTORSPORTS\n114\n\nTroy Corser came in eighth on his favour-\nite route around the Tasmanian Sea, with \na sensational result of 1:32.726 minutes at \nan average speed of 172.573 km/h, which \nalso earned him the fastest lap time. A \nmade-to-measure starter event for the \nyoung team.\nFIRST PODIUM SUCCESSES IN THE \nSUPERBIKE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP\nIn 2010, Troy Corser earned his team its \nfirst successes, finishing twice in third \nplace in Misano and Monza, and assum-\ning the eleventh position in the final rank-\ning. Ayrton Badovini riding an S 1000 RR \nwon nine of the ten heats in the Super-\nstock 1000 FIM Cup, finishing in second \nplace once. Then there were the eight \npole positions and six fastest laps. This \nsuperior championship victory underlined \nthe sheer potential and clout of the series-\nnear S 1000 RR extremely convincingly. \nEven in its first year, the BMW Motorrad S \n1000 RR achieved second position in the \nbrand ranking at the IDM Superbike con-\ntest in the International German Motorcy-\ncle Championship.\nIn 2011, Leon Haslam from the UK, son \nof the former 500-cc Grand Prix star Ron \nHaslam, otherwise known as “Rocket \nRon”, was signed up for the Superbike \nWorld Championship. Alongside Troy \nCorser, he made efficient use of the poten-\ntial at his disposal, taking his S 1000 RR \nonto the podium no less than three times, \nand finishing in a very satisfying fifth \nplace in the world championship rank-\nings. At the same time, the BMW Motor-\nrad France 99 team came in second in the \nFIM Endurance World Championship, \nwith an S 1000 RR. In the IDM, Michael \nRanseder made it as far as runner-up, \nwinning the manufacturer‘s competition \nfor BMW Motorrad.\nTHE S 1000 RR IN THE  \nWINNING LANE\nIn the 2012 season, the BMW Motorrad \nMotorsport Team signed the 30-year-old \nItalian, Marco Melandri. The 250-cc world \nchampion in 2002 and Superbike runner \nup in 2011 finally brought in the victories \nthat the RR deserved. The Italian secured \na total of six racing victories – more than \nany other rider in that season. However, \nthere were several unfortunate falls that \ncost him a number of decisive points, \nwith the result that Melandri only came in \nthird in the final placements. This also \nmeant that BMW Motorrad just missed \nthe title of constructor champion.\nThe Superstock 1000 FIM Cup, on the \nother hand, ended with optimum results \nfor BMW Motorrad and the S 1000 RR, \nwon by Sylvain Barrier. The good average \nperformance on international level was \nenhanced by the second place in the final \nranking attained by the BMW Motorrad \nFrance 99 team in the FIM Endurance \nWorld Championship. The IDM was noth-\ning short of perfect. The 29-year-old \nFrenchman, Nigon Erwan, became the \nsuperbike champion, an achievement \nenhanced by the superior victory in the \nmanufacturer‘s championship, finishing \nwith 644 points, 403 points ahead of the \nsecond-placed Far Eastern entrant.\nAfter an abstinence of more than thirty \nyears, BMW Motorrad returned to the \nWorld Sidecar Championship in 2012. Jörg \nSteinhausen, son of the two-times world \nsidecar champion, Rolf Steinhausen (in \n1975 and 1976), piloted the racing combi-\nnation in the BMW motorsport colours, \nwith the S 1000 RR engine and together \nwith partner Grégory Cluze. The two \nended the comeback season as runners \nup in the competition.\n⓫\n Superbike World Championship, Monza, Italy in May 2009\n115October 2013    90 Years BMW Motorrad",

Of these, Schek \nwent on to perform his own develop-\nments, aiming towards an optimum off-\nroad BMW, which would eventually \nbecome the BMW GS 800, the predeces-\nsor of the R 80 G/S.\nON SUPERBIKE TERRAIN  \nWITH THE R 90 S\nThe American journalist Bob Braverman \nfirst coined the term “superbike” in “Cycle \nGuide Magazine” in 1969.

Only a short time \nlater, the “Levi’s Superbike Series” was \nheld in Australia, followed in 1976 by the \nfirst season of the US Superbike Champi-\nonship in the USA, in which BMW Motor-\nrad was also involved, together with the \nteam from the American importer, Butler \n& Smith, \n➏\n. The later founder of the \nSuperbike World Championship, Steve \nMcLaughlin, along with Reg Pridmore, \nanother American, were signed as riders \nof the meanwhile 1000 cc BMW R 90 S. \nWhile McLaughlin was victorious in the \nseason‘s prestigious first event, the 200-\nmile Daytona race, Pridmore was able to \nclaim the title of the first US superbike \nchampion at the end of the season.\nIn the late 1970s, ongoing world records \nwere gaining attention, and in the years \n1977 and 1980, BMW Motorrad joined in \nwith the recently launched R 100 RS, the \nfirst series-production motorcycle in the \nworld to be developed in a wind tunnel. \nBut for its shortened suspension travel \nand lack of lower body panels, it was \nlargely a standard-production motorcycle, \nand it was soon put to good use compet-\ning in the world record events held in the \nItalian town of Nardo, \n➐\n, taking part in \nraces over 10, 100 and 1000 km as well as \none, six, twelve and 24 hours. Also taking \npart: Helmut Dähne. \nFROM VICTORY TO VICTORY WITH \nTHE BMW GS \nFour years later, the subject of motor racing \nwas to gain a considerable push at BMW \nMotorrad, with Rolf Witthöft winning the \nEuropean Offroad Championship, riding an \noff-road 800-cc BMW, \n➑\n. With perfect tim-\ning, the series version of this enduro bike – \nthe R 80 G/S with the BMW Monolever sin-\ngle-sided swing arm on the rear wheel – \nwas launched to the general public in \nautumn of that year. This motorcycle not \nonly established the new touring or large \nenduro segment, but also went on to win \nfurther prestigious sporting titles for BMW \nMotorrad over the following years.\nRight from the start, BMW off-road \nmotorcycles took part in the Paris-Dakar \nrally through the West African country of \nSenegal. In 1981, the Boxer finally asserted \nitself thanks to its robust and reliable air-\nflow cooling, ease of maintenance, and \nshaft drive. The French desert specialist, \nHubert Auriol, won the motorcycle classifi-\ncation, and repeated his success in 1983. \nThe 1000-cc two-cylinder maintained its \nclose similarity to standard-production \nmodels, claiming victories in 1984 and \n1985 when the former Belgian world Moto \nCross champion, Gaston Rahier, upped and \nleft the competition, \n➒\n. In 1992, the later \ncar-racing driver, Jutta Kleinschmidt, cele-\nbrated her victory in the women’s classi-\nfication at the Cape Town rally, riding a \nBMW R 100 GS after 12,700 km.\nDESERT RALLY TRIUMPHS \nIn 1999, no less than four BMW works \nriders lined up at the start of the Paris-\nDakar in Granada, riding the 55-kW \n(75 hp) rally version of the BMW F 650. \nEighteen days and 9022 kilometres later, \nthe event was won by Richard Sainct from \nSaint-Affrique, France.

In addi-\ntion, Andrea Mayer took the women’s title \nin the Paris-Dakar for the third time in a \nrow, also riding an F 650 RR.\nThe resounding success of the one-cyl-\ninder motorcycle in 2000 was accompa-\nnied by the launch of the new F 650 GS to \nmark the moment the winners crossed the \nfinish line in Cairo.

In 1997, 1998 und 1999, \nrider Dave Morris won the one-cylinder \nclass of the TT on the Isle of Man with a \n59 kW (80 hp) motorcycle weighing only \n134 kg.

After two seasons in France and \nBelgium, the BoxerCup was organised as \nan international event for the first time in \n2001. Over seven heats held during the \nracing weekends of the motorcycle \nGrands-Prix and long-distance world \nchampionships, 30 riders from all over \nEurope competed with each other for the \nbrand trophy, riding near-series produc-\ntion BMW R 1100 S bikes.

A \nmade-to-measure starter event for the \nyoung team.\nFIRST PODIUM SUCCESSES IN THE \nSUPERBIKE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP\nIn 2010, Troy Corser earned his team its \nfirst successes, finishing twice in third \nplace in Misano and Monza, and assum-\ning the eleventh position in the final rank-\ning. Ayrton Badovini riding an S 1000 RR \nwon nine of the ten heats in the Super-\nstock 1000 FIM Cup, finishing in second \nplace once. Then there were the eight \npole positions and six fastest laps. This \nsuperior championship victory underlined \nthe sheer potential and clout of the series-\nnear S 1000 RR extremely convincingly. \nEven in its first year, the BMW Motorrad S \n1000 RR achieved second position in the \nbrand ranking at the IDM Superbike con-\ntest in the International German Motorcy-\ncle Championship.\nIn 2011, Leon Haslam from the UK, son \nof the former 500-cc Grand Prix star Ron \nHaslam, otherwise known as “Rocket \nRon”, was signed up for the Superbike \nWorld Championship. Alongside Troy \nCorser, he made efficient use of the poten-\ntial at his disposal, taking his S 1000 RR \nonto the podium no less than three times, \nand finishing in a very satisfying fifth \nplace in the world championship rank-\nings. At the same time, the BMW Motor-\nrad France 99 team came in second in the \nFIM Endurance World Championship, \nwith an S 1000 RR. In the IDM, Michael \nRanseder made it as far as runner-up, \nwinning the manufacturer‘s competition \nfor BMW Motorrad.\nTHE S 1000 RR IN THE  \nWINNING LANE\nIn the 2012 season, the BMW Motorrad \nMotorsport Team signed the 30-year-old \nItalian, Marco Melandri. The 250-cc world \nchampion in 2002 and Superbike runner \nup in 2011 finally brought in the victories \nthat the RR deserved. The Italian secured \na total of six racing victories – more than \nany other rider in that season. However, \nthere were several unfortunate falls that \ncost him a number of decisive points, \nwith the result that Melandri only came in \nthird in the final placements. This also \nmeant that BMW Motorrad just missed \nthe title of constructor champion.\nThe Superstock 1000 FIM Cup, on the \nother hand, ended with optimum results \nfor BMW Motorrad and the S 1000 RR, \nwon by Sylvain Barrier. The good average \nperformance on international level was \nenhanced by the second place in the final \nranking attained by the BMW Motorrad \nFrance 99 team in the FIM Endurance \nWorld Championship. The IDM was noth-\ning short of perfect. The 29-year-old \nFrenchman, Nigon Erwan, became the \nsuperbike champion, an achievement \nenhanced by the superior victory in the \nmanufacturer‘s championship, finishing \nwith 644 points, 403 points ahead of the \nsecond-placed Far Eastern entrant.\nAfter an abstinence of more than thirty \nyears, BMW Motorrad returned to the \nWorld Sidecar Championship in 2012. Jörg \nSteinhausen, son of the two-times world \nsidecar champion, Rolf Steinhausen (in \n1975 and 1976), piloted the racing combi-\nnation in the BMW motorsport colours, \nwith the S 1000 RR engine and together \nwith partner Grégory Cluze.
