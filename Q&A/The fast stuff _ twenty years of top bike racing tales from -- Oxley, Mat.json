Riding motorcycles (even now, at much more sensible speeds) \nis one  of the  big joys of my  life  —  I would never want to live  without that \nfeeling —  and I’ve  always got a huge kick out  of watching other people ride \nbikes fast. Motorcycle racers are  fascinating people, they live  their lives at \nsome kind of extreme, which makes them fascinating people to  talk to, \nmostly, anyway. \nThat’s what this book is really about —  it is a  collection of stories and \ninterviews that live and breathe on  the words of the sport’s towering greats, \nlike Wayne Rainey recalling his  pre-race psych-up routine: ‘I’d  be dancing \naround my  motorhome, kicking my  leathers, or  I’d  sit  there, focusing on \nthe feeling of being excited and wanting to spit nails and rip the handlebars \noff the  bike’. That’s what I love about motorcycle racing, it’s  not  just the \nbikes and the  speed, it’s  the  gladiatorial heroes and the  nutters who'll do \njust about anything to win. It is a violent, vicious sport, but at these extremes \nyou  can  easily discern the  difference between the  good guys and the  bad \nguys. Like Orwell said, it’s war, without the  shooting. \nThe pages of this book are  filled with the words of incredible people like \nRainey: my  thanks to all of them for allowing me  to take up their time. \nMat Oxley \nLondon, Spring 2008 \nMy thanks to Arie Blokland, Adil Jal Darukhanawala, Mark Forsyth, Mark \nGraham, Mark Hughes and Darryl Reach of Haynes, Magnus Johansson, \nMick Matheson, Rupert Paul, Marc Potter, Steve Rose, Matthias Schréter, \nMichael Scott, Tum Thompson, John Ulrich, John Westlake, Hugo Wilson, \nKen Wootton, Gunther Wiesinger and all  the  other editors who’ve been \nkind or  foolish enough to publish my crazed rants. \n\nCHAPTER 1 \nOUT THERE WITH THE \nBIG BOYS \nAugust 1989 \nWhat’s it  like racing with Rainey, Schwantz, Doohan and \nGardner? I got to  find out in the 1989 Suzuka Eight Hours, the \nmost hyped race in the world \nThe weather is typical of  Japan in July —  so  steamy hot the air you breathe \nfeels second hand and rivulets of sweat run  down every part of your body. \nI shouldn't care though —  I am  lying on  a couch with two girls draping \nnicely chilled towels across my  legs and torso. I have an  ice-cold drink \nin one hand and a bow] of sliced orange and banana within reach of the \nother. A  Japanese doctor massages my body and an  electric fan blows a \ncooling draught on  my  face, rustling the  leaves of the  nearby palms. \nHeaven surely couldn’t be  a much more delightful experience —  but  the \npleasure of this visit through the  pearly gates is tainted by the knowledge \nthat I soon have to return to  the  fiery torment of hell. \nHell in  this case is  the Suzuka racetrack, designed back in  1962 by \nsome fiendish Japanese, obviously intent on  giving racers sleepless \nnights well into the  next millennium. \nThe circuit is  tough enough in  itself but it’s  the viscous Japanese \nsummer which makes the Suzuka Eight Hours bike racing’s Dante’s \nInferno. As  you get deeper into the race, the ogres of  physical and \nmental exhaustion grow like monsters before you and devils dance \naround, \nlaughing \nhideously \nat \nthe \nsight \nof \na \nmere \nmortal \nventuring \nso \nfar into their terrible territory. \nThe \nexhaustion \nmay \nnot \nbe  \ntangible \nbut \nthe \ndevils \ncertainly \nare  \n— \nthey \nare \ndressed \nin  \ncolourful \nsuits, \nmounted \non  \nevil \n145 \nhorsepower \nmotorcycles \nand \ntheir \nnames \nare \nRainey, \nSchwantz, \nGardner, \nDoohan, \nSarron, \nMagee \nand \nKocinski. \nThey \nfly \npast, \ntaunting \nyou \nwith \ndaredevil \ndeeds \nthat \nwould \nmean \ninevitable \ndisaster \nif \nyou \nwere \nfoolish \nenough \nto \nattempt \nto emulate \nthem. \n\n10 THE FAST STUFF \nSharing the  track with these men is indeed like moving through a \ndoor into another world where the  laws of physics mean more to  some \npeople than others. You can no  longer smugly announce ‘I  could do \nthat’ and walk away from the  spectator area safe in  the  knowledge \nthat, if someone put  a  million dollars in your hands and sat  you on  a \nfactory race bike, you could cut  the  same lap time as  these guys. \nI can only watch through my  visor in wonder as  Mick Doohan slips \nby me  into Suzuka’s first gear hairpin aboard his  RVF750, lays the bike \non  its  side until both tyres must surely exceed their traction limit, \ncracks open the  throttle as  he  progressively moves his  body weight to \nGea ty the front of the machine and lays a streak of scorched \nue rubber on  the  tarmac. The thick black arc  curves \n‘I’m still close outward towards the kerb and continues unfalteringly \nenough to see  what’s through the  shift to second for another 20 yards until \nhappening as Doohan hits third, then the  tyre hooks up  and the \nDoohan’s rear tyre RVF’s power finds another way of  showing itself — \nbreaks traction, this the front wheel jumps two feet in  the air  before \ntime at very high slamming back down onto the  deck, just in time for \nlean, and lays Doohan to  snatch fourth and lay  the  bike into the \nanother wild trail next, fast  right-hander. \nof rubber’ Since the hairpin Doohan has been climbing a \nLe \nRIE \nshallow \nrise \nbut \nafter \nthe \nbrow \nhalfway \nthrough \nthe \nfast right, the  track drops away. I’m  still close enough \nto  see  what’s happening as  his rear tyre again breaks traction, this time \nat  very high lean, and lays another wild trail of  rubber, thicker and \ndarker than the  hundreds of others already etched on  the  tarmac. As \nthe rear  tyre gets more and more out of line Doohan turns the handlebars \nonto opposite lock to control the  slide, shifts into fifth and lifts the bike \nmomentarily before laying the  RVF into the  next, even faster right that \nleads into Suzuka’s famous Spoon Curve. \nI’m \ngiven \nsimilar \nexhibitions \nof \nwhat \nit \ntakes \nto \nbe \na \nsuperhero \non \na \nmillion \ndollar \nfactory \ncontract \nby \nthe \nother \nstars. \nI \ndon’t \nemulate \nthem, \nI \ncan \nhardly \nlearn \nfrom \nthem \n— \nall \nI \nknow \nis \nthat \nthey \nare \ngoing \na \nlot \nfaster \nand \nI \nknow \nthat \nif \nI \ntry \nto \ngo \nas \nfast \n— \nI'll \ncrash. \nThat’s \nwhy \nthey’re rich boys and I’m  not. \nBut \nfor \none \nweek \nI’m \na \nfactory \nrider \n— \nwell, \nalmost. \nI’ve \ngot \njust \nabout \neverything \nI \nneed: \na \nmega-trick \nRC30 \nprepared \nby \nHonda’s \nHamamatsu \nboffins \n(including \nforks \nmachined \nfrom \nsolid), \nflash \nleathers \ncreated \n\nOUT THERE WITH THE BIG BOYS al \nspecifically for  this race and emblazoned with the  logo of our  sponsors \nKawai Steel (motorway bridge builders), a  pit bristling with Japanese \nmechanics, a PR man, a doctor, two  assistants and  even three bikini-clad \ngirlies who are  trained to  smile for  the  cameras, presumably to  save me \nthe  effort of doing so. \nMy team-mate in this expensive lark is French bike journalist turned \nTV commentator, Gilbert Roy. We’re both part-time racers pretending to \nbe pros in what is arguably the world’s most important race. I hear that \nthe  team’s budget for  the  race is £80,000. And I know there’s room for \n60  bikes on  the  grid. Fifteen of  those will be  full factory bikes from \nHonda, Kawasaki, Suzuki and Yamaha, the  rest will be  semi-factory \nmissiles and massively-funded privateer teams piloted by pros imported \nfrom Down Under, Europe and the  USA. Names like Graeme Crosby, \nCarl Fogarty, Rob McElnea, Paul Lewis, Hervé Moineau, Malcolm \nCampbell litter the  programme. The pressure is on. \nThere’s already an  air of growing tension when we  arrive at  Suzuka six \ndays before the  race with five days of practice scheduled (that’s how \nseriously people take this race —  at  GPs you get three days). Right away I \nam  anxious to pick up any  tips from the  stars who fill  Suzuka’s in-house \nhotel and restaurants. On  the first night I dine with Wayne Gardner \nbut all  he  wants to  talk about is  his  new 1700 horsepower motor \nyacht. Practice starts next morning, so  I’m a little surprised when he \norders the  biggest beer in the  house. If this is how the  pros do it, then I \nbetter have one too. I discover too  late that Gardner is  not practising \nuntil Wednesday. \nNext morning the  pits are  already swarming with Japanese factory \nstaff, with inscrutable race bosses keeping an  inscrutable eye  on  their \nteams. By race day there will be 250,000 fans here and that’s why winning \nthe  Eight Hours comes a  close second to  a  500 world title in  the  Big \nFour’s \nsales \nbattle. \nThe \nhype \nin \nthe \nSuzuka \npit \nlane \neasily \nmatches \nthe \nintensity \nof \nracing \non \nthe \ntrack. \nEach \nteam \nhas \nits \nown \n‘Race \nQueen’, \nand \neach \npit \nincludes \nits \nown \nprefabricated \nrider \nand \nhospitality \nlounge \nwhich \nvary \nfrom \nthe \nsimple \nto \nthe \nexotic \n— \nours \nis \nvery \nmuch \nthe \nlatter \nwith \npalm \ntrees \nand \na \nneat \nlittle \nbar, \nwhere \njournalists \ncan \nhave \na \ndrink \nwhile \nwatching Gilbert and I go through hell. \nQualifying \nbegins \nand \nwe  \nknow \nwe're \ngoing \nto \nhave \nto \ncut  \nsomething \nlike \na \n2 \nminute \n24 \nsecond \nlap \nto \nqualify. \nRainey \n(teamed \nwith \nMagee \non \na \nYamaha \nYZF750 \nGenesis), \nGardner \n(with \nDoohan \non \na \nHonda \n\n12 THE FAST STUFF \nRVF750), Schwantz (with Doug Polen on  a Yoshimura GSX-R750) and \nCo  are  expected to  battle for  pole at  around 2m 1é6s  on  their factory \nrocket ships. \nIn untimed practice I kick off with 2m 28s laps, which I whittle down \nto a 2 26.  Over the next two days I have a further two 45-minute timed \nsessions to  slice off at least another two seconds, or  suffer humiliation \nat  the  hands of the  stars who I have to  interview at  every GP  in  my \nposition as  GP reporter for Motor Cycle News. The trouble is that it’s  three \nmonths since I last sat  on  a  race bike. That’s enough time to  lose the \nconfidence you  need to  flick into turns and slide out  of them. Not only \nthat, it’s  not  easy setting up a race bike when you do it so  infrequently. \nIt’s  like  speaking a foreign language a few times a year —  you forget the \nvocabulary you need to make things work. \nIn  the  first timed session I manage a 24.371 —  which might just get \nus  on  the  grid. I come across Rob McElnea scrubbing in  a  new set  of \ntyres on  his RC30. I  follow him, hoping for  a  tow —  a  trick that \nriders employ to  great effect in GP  qualifying. He  signals me  to  tuck in \nbehind him but he’s doing 21s and I can’t hack it.  He  drags a  few \nhundred yards on  me  in a lap, snatches a look at  me  over his  shoulder \nand I can almost see  his  mocking grin behind the blackout visor. I \npit  again with ten minutes qualifying and get a  fresh soft rear \nMichelin radial. \nThis time I have to  get a fast lap in.  I try to  give chase to  Dominique \nSarron on  a factory RVF but halfway through the lap that I feel  is going \nto  be The One, the  RC30 springs a water leak, forcing me  into the  pits. \nI have to wait until my  final Saturday session to  get us  on  the  grid. \nAt dinner Rainey asks me  how things are  going —  and he’s managing \nnot  to  be  too  patronising. I tell  him I’ve gone two seconds faster every \ntime I’ve  been out  and I feel I can  go  quicker. ‘Hey, I can  go  faster,’ he \nsays. ‘You sound like a  real racer, I'll  have to  come over and interview \nyou guys sometime,’ he  grins. ‘Anyway, just get  into the  low 20s  and \nyou'll be  okay.’ Rainey manages to  make ‘low 20s’ sound so  easy, and \nlying in bed  thinking my way round Suzuka’s 18 corners I reckon I can \nmake \na \n2m \n22s \nlap \non \nSaturday. \nBut \nI \nhaven't \ntaken \nJapan’s \nfreaky \nclimate into account —  when I wake up  there is a  typhoon outside. The \nrain \nis \nlashing \ndown. \nI \ndon’t \neven \nbother \ngoing \nout \nbut \nI \ngive \nup \nall \nthought \nof \nslashing \nmy \nwrists \nwhen \nthe \nfinal \ngrid \nsheet \narrives \n— \nwe're \n57th on  the  grid —  five short of disaster. \n\nOUT THERE WITH THE BIG BOYS 13 \nRace day dawns a little sunnier but a few clouds keep the temperature \ndown to  a  ‘cool’ 30  degrees. Normally Suzuka can be  35  degrees with \nstifling 85  per  cent humidity. \nThe hype fuels the  tension as  the 11.30am start approaches. I was \nfaster than Gilbert in practice so  I’m  doing the  Le Mans start. And from \nwhere I stand it’s  a long, long way to the front of the Le Mans-style grid \nwhere Doohan stands on  pole. After a  few mouthfuls of  electrolyte \n‘energy drink I line up  for  the  sprint. My mouth is parched, my  heart \nracing and my legs nervy like jelly as  Suzuka’s electronic grandstand info \nboard flashes up ‘GO!’ I make a good getaway but within two  seconds all \nhell breaks loose. Two bikes collide in the getaway melee, I swerve wildly \nto  avoid the  exploding debris and I can’t believe it when another bike \nalongside me  ploughs into the  wreckage. The last  I see, the  rider is two \nyards in the  air hanging on  to his motorcycle —  upside down. \nIncredibly the  marshals have cleared the  mess by the  end of the  first \nlap and the  Eight Hours isn’t going to  be  stopped. The next lap brings \nmore crashes as  the  banzai locals get carried away with the  occasion. I \nsoon discover that riders who had qualified in front of me  can’t keep up \nat  that kind of pace for  more than a  few laps. I’m steadily making up \nplaces. \nBut after five laps or  so  the  heat is getting to  me  already, sweat from \nmy forehead is splashing like rain on  the inside of my visor and stinging \nmy  eyes, I begin to  wish I could crash and get  it all  over with. A few \nlaps later the  heat begins to  take its  toll  on  the  tyres too. Another rash \nof crashes proves that some riders haven't prepared themselves for this \n— \nit’s \nso \nhot \nand \nslippery \nat \nSuzuka \nthat \nyou \nhave \nto \nslide \nthe \nrear \ntyre \nto  keep going at  a  decent pace. \nMy \nonly \nworry \nis \ngetting \nin \nthe \nway \nof \nDoohan \nand \nhis  \nfellow \nGP \nstars \nwhen \nthey \nlap \nme \n— \nand \nmy \npet \nnightmare \nis \nbringing \ndown \nRainey, \ncurrently \nlocked \nin \na \nduel \nwith \nEddie \nLawson \nfor \nthe  \n500 \ncrown. \nI \ncan  \nsee \nthe \nheadlines \n— \n‘RAINEY \nBREAKS \nLEG \nAND \nRUINS \nWORLD \nTITLE \nCHANCE \nIN \nJOURNALIST \nSMASH’. \nSo \nI \ntake \na \nfew \nglances \nover \nmy \nshoulder \nas \nthe \nsession \ndraws \non. \nDoohan \nis \nway \nahead \nwhen \nhe \neffortlessly \nswoops \nby \nme \nfollowed \nby \nRainey. \nKocinski \ncomes \npast \nat \nthe \nrapid \nTurn \nOne, \npuffs \nof \nsmoke \ncoming \noff \nhis \nright \nknee \nscraper \nas \nhe \nchases \nthe \nleaders. \nBy  \nthe  \nend \nof  \nthe  \nfirst \nhour \nwe're \nup  \nto  \n24th. \nThe \nbike \nis  \nflying, \nrevving \nhungrily \nto  \n13,000rpm \nand \nhandling \nwell \nthrough \nSuzuka’s \n\n14 THE FAsT STUFF \ntwists. There were no  less than 28  RC30s on  the  60  bike grid —  that’s \nnearly 50 per cent of the bikes and adequate proof that the RC is as  near \nas  any  normal human being can  get to  a  factory motorcycle. \nIn between sessions I am  given the full treatment by the  team doctor. \nI’ve  got wrist problems so  he gives me  acupuncture. Every hour off the \nbike —  while Gilbert is out  there doing his  bit —  is spent on  a bed being \nmassaged and rehydrating. There’s even a  canister of oxygen on  hand \nif  I need it. And the  two girl assistants who help me  dress and undress \ngive me  a new pair of socks for every session. \nDoohan is  receiving similar treatment in  the  next door pit  but he \ndoesn’t look as  knackered as  I feel —  he  doesn’t get  new socks either. \nThe awesome pace begins to  tell  at  the  front of the  pack. Doohan and \nGardner are  stretching their lead but Doohan collides with a backmarker \nand goes to  hospital with a  badly mangled hand, putting fellow RVF \npilots Dominique Sarron and Alex Vieira into the  lead. \nDespite the massage and acupuncture, I feel  more drained each time \nI get  on  the  bike and I can’t maintain my  early pace. Joker Schwantz \ncomes past me  on  the  back straight, wildly waving both legs at  me. In \nthe  next session he  powers underneath me  out of a  fast left-hander, \nshaking his  head mockingly. Earlier I  had passed him pushing his \nYoshimura GSX-R after he’d run out of  fuel and I begin to  wish I’d \nslowed right down and had a  good laugh at  his  predicament. \nRainey and Kocinski’s teams go out  too  —  after five  hours we’re 16th, \none place out  of championship points. In the  later hours of the race the \ntemperature cools but  my wrists weaken. My last two sessions are  not \nenjoyable at  all but we’re 12th at  the  flag as  darkness falls. The relief of \nthe  finish is both breathtaking and frightening —  the  last  lap is lit by a \nmassive, booming firework display and as  we  arrive back at  the  finish \nthe  track is invaded by the  frenzied crowd. We  just get  the  bike back \ninto the  pits when we're engulfed by the  seething masses who snatch \nwhatever they can  as  a  Suzuka souvenir —  I feel they’d be quite happy \nto  have one of my  arms, or  legs. \nThe \nteam \ncelebrations \nbegin \nwith \nhuge \nbottles \nof \nMoét \n& \nChandon. \nWe  \nall \nshake \nhands, \nMr  \nKawai \nbeams, \nthe  \ntwo \ngirl \nassistants \nburst \ninto \ntears. \nNext \nmorning \nwe  \npick \nup  \n£1000 \nprize \nmoney \neach. \nMy \nhead \nhurts \nand \nevery \nbit  \nof \nmy  \nbody \naches \nbut \nI \ncould \nget  \nused \nto  \nbeing \na \npro \nracer. \n\nCHAPTER 2 \nRIDING THE NSR WAS \nLIKE DEATH... \nNovember 1989 \n‘,..every time you flicked into a  turn you didn’t know if you \nwere going to  make it out’. That’s what Eddie Lawson said of \nthe evil sonofabitch Honda NSR500 with which he miraculously \nwon the 1989 500 crown. So  what was I going to  make of the \nthing at  a chilly Suzuka, just a few weeks after he’d secured the \ntitle and hightailed it back to Yamaha? I’ve ridden a lot of Honda \nGP bikes, from Ron Haslam’s 1983 NS500 triple to Mick Doohan’s \nawesome 1992 big bang NSR to  Valentino Rossi’s last-of-the- \nline 2001 NSR but Lawson’s ’89  bike stands out as  the most \nterrifying thing I’ve ever ridden in my life. Pure malevolence on \ntwo wheels \nMondai nai, as  they say in Japan: no  problem. It is, after all, only another \nmotorcycle. No  reason why I shouldn’t ride the  bitch to  the  limit, flick \nthe  ‘bars and stick it into the  turn, jump on  the  throttle and steer it \nwith the  wheelspin. \nThis is  a  psychological battle. I’m trying very, very hard to  work \nmyself into a state of mental superiority over Eddie Lawson’s Rothmans \nHonda NSR500 which looks plain evil  standing there in pit lane, waiting \nto  do  terrible things to  me. \nAnd \nif \nthe  \nNSR \nlooks \nhorribly \nmenacing, \nit \nsounds \neven \nworse. \nWhen \nthe \nHRC \nmechanics \nbump \nthe \nbeast \ninto \nlife \nin \nSuzuka’s \npit \nlane \nits \nstrident \nrmrrinnnng, \nrrrrrinnnng \nunleashes \na \nflood \nof \nadrenalin \ninto \nmy \nveins. \nMy \nlegs \nturn \nto  \njelly, \nI’m \nnot  \nwinning \nthe  \nbattle. \nIt’s  \nNovember, \nit’s \ndamned \ncold \nand \nblood \nruns \nthickly \nthrough \nmy \nveins; \npain \nis \nalso \nmore \npainful \nwhen \nit’s \ncold \nand \nfat \nslick \ntyres \ndon’t \nwarm \nup \nso \nwell \neither. \nBut \nI’ve \ncome \na \nlong \nway \nfor \nthis. \nI’ve \nbought \nmy \nown \nair \nticket, \nspent \n12 \nhours \non \na \nJumbo \nnext \nto \na \ncouple \nof \nprofessional \nballroom \ndancers, \ncome \nwithin \none \nmolecule \nof \noxygen \nof \nsuffocation \non \nthe \n\n16 THE FAST STUFF \nTokyo subway, remortgaged my  flat  for  a  seat on  the  bullet train and \nwatched my  dinner being cooked alive in front of my very eyes. \nThe motorcycle is not  going to be a problem. \nLawson’s NSR is not  only evil, it is also deceitful. Dawdling out  of the \nSuzuka pit lane the  motor crackles though its  carbon-fibre cans and \nsounds pretty harmless. It  drives from nowhere, making a  tuned \nRD350LC seem unrideable. Thirteen corners later I hit  Suzuka’s back \nstraight, which curves gently left  and uphill over a \nrise, and I let  the  NSR do  its  very worst for  the  first \n‘The front wheel time. \nhardly makes Revs rise in a  remorseless rush, I’m shifting gears \ncontact with the faster than I’ve ever shifted gears before, the  motor \ntarmac all the way shrieking out more than 160 utterly intimidating \ndown the  190mph horsepower at  12,500rpm. The acceleration freezes \nback straight’ my  brain and paralyses my  senses which struggle to \naoe cope with the  speed at  which the  scenery turns to  a \nblur. The front wheel hardly makes contact with the \ntarmac all  the  way down the 190mph back straight, skimming from \nripple to ripple and grabbing left, right, left, right with a scary violence. \nThe 115  kilo NSR makes an  early Suzuki GSX-R feel mighty stable. The \nonly way to keep the thing going straight is to lock my arms around the \npetrol tank and hold on  for grim life, just like  the death-cheating heroes \nof  the 1970s on  the Daytona banking. Surely Lawson didn’: ride his \nNSR like this all year? \nIndeed he  did not. After a  frankly worrying (nope, make that \nterrifying) first few  laps, I pull into the pits ashen faced and feeling my \nrespect for  Lawson raised to  new heights. I mime a  nasty tankslapper \nto  the  waiting HRC mechanics who descend upon their pride and joy, \nturning the  handlebars from side to  side and chatting furiously. They \nsoon find the  problem —  they’d set  the  steering damper on  minimum. \nThanks guys. With a  cheery laugh they wind the  damper up  to  its  21st \nand last click (FULL!!) and usher me  out of  the pits once more. I’m \nbeginning to wonder if this is their idea of a joke. \nIf you've ever ridden a  motorcycle with almost solid steering you'll \nknow what it’s  like  —  in slow corners you  just topple over —  and I have \nvisions of myself crashing at  Suzuka’s dead-stop chicane. Incredibly, \nLawson rode the  bike like this for  much of his  championship-winning \nseason, fighting to  get  the thing into turns at  more normal racing \n\nRIDING THE NSR WAS LIKE DEATH... WH \nspeeds. The NSR does indeed require serious physical input to overcome \nthe  chassis’ inadequacies. Lawson and his  pit-lane guru Erv  Kanemoto \nused 12  different chassis during ’89  as  they tried to  tame the  NSR but \nthe  bike still goes where it wants to,  rather than where you aim it.  At \nthe end of  Suzuka’s main straight all  it  wants to  do  is  keep going \nstraight, and the only way I can  get it to take the  third-gear left-hander \nis by wrenching hard on  the  handlebars to  overcome the  gyro-effect. \nEven so,  I never manage to hit  the  apex. God only knows how Lawson \nraced the  bike, let alone won the world title on  the  thing. \nTwo weeks before I scared myself on  the  NSR I had ridden Kevin \nSchwantz’s 1989 Pepsi Suzuki RGV500 in the  less exotic surroundings \nof Snetterton, Norfolk. The RGV consumes the  straights with almost as \nmuch voracity as  the  Honda, melting the  scenery, dragging the horizon \ntowards you at jet-like speed. \nThere’s no  doubt that the  Honda has  more power —  Lawson needed all \nthe top speed he  could get to  compensate for  the bike’s nightmare \nhandling —  but  the  NSR engine isn’t the vicious beast that racing legend \nwould have us  believe. The theory goes that the Suzuki has smooth, \ncontrolled power, while the  Honda is the  tyre-shredding sonofabitch. In \nfact the  Honda has  the  smoother power curve, even if it runs out  of puff \n500rpm sooner than the  13,000rpm RGV. Both motors have gaping wide \npowerbands and are  much more tractable than you'd believe possible. \nBut the  RGV’s power curve is much steeper, so  much so  that it tries to \nloop the loop in the first three gears, which is why Schwantz must resort \nto  his  rodeo riding stunts when he gets on  the  throttle, moving his  body \nweight as  far forward as  it'll go,  so  he doesn’t have to turn off the throttle \nto keep the  front under control. The NSR wheelies for sure, but  its flatter \npower curve means the  front lifts  more controllably. \nIf you watched Lawson take on  Schwantz and Wayne Rainey during \nthe \n1989 \nseason \nyou'll \nknow \nthat \nit \nwas \nalways \na \nproblem \nfor \nLawson \nto \nput \nthe \nNSR \nwhere \nhe \nwanted \nit. \nWhile \nRainey’s \nYamaha \nand \nin \nparticular \nSchwantz’s \nSuzuki \nproved \nnimble \nenough \nto \nhog \nthe \ntight, \nfast \nline, \nLawson \nhad \nto \nuse \nevery \nbit \nof \nthe \ntrack \nto \nstay \nin \nthe \nhunt. \nHe \nhad \nto \nuse \nhis \nbody \nin \na \ndifferent \nway \nto \nsubdue \nthe \nNSR, \nhanging \nhis \ntorso \nas \nfar \noff \nthe \ninside \nas \nhe \ncould \nto \ndrag \nthe \nbike \nthrough \nthe  turns. \nThe \nNSR’s \nbehaviour \nis \na  \npuzzle \nbecause \nthe  \ntextbooks \ndictate \nthat \nits \nchassis \ndimensions \nshould \nmake \nit \nturn \nbetter \nthan \nthe \nSuzuki. \n\n18 THE FAST STUFF \nThe NSR has steeper steering geometry, a  shorter wheelbase and a \nsmaller front wheel (Lawson ran a  16-inch Michelin front through \nmuch of  the  season, while Schwantz stuck with the  older and more \npopular 17 inch). \nAt  Snetterton the Suzuki mostly did  what it was told through the \ncorners. Just  a spark of mental input was enough to flick the bike on  its \nside, at  the  very most it needed just a  tickle of the  handlebars to  get it \nthrough the  faster curves on  precisely the  line you’d intended. But the \nSuzuki's light-headedness became hard work on  the gas. Schwantz \nmay be happy exiting a turn cranked over with the front tyre lifting and \nthe  rear spinning, but  I wasn’t about to  go there. \nAdapting one’s brains to  the way these 500s shrink wide open \nracetracks into slender ribbons of tarmac isn’t a rapid process. Neither \nis  reprogramming one’s brain to  their stopping power. The Suzuki's \ncarbon AP  Lockheeds explode so  violently into action when you grab a \nhandful that it’s  hard just staying on  board. The Honda’s Nissins aren’t \nso  dramatic but you still need to  lock your arms to  maintain control \nduring braking. \nAt  Suzuka I managed three outings on  the NSR, about 40 minutes on \nthe  bike, before I was a  physical wreck: my  wrists and arm muscles \nached from braking and turning, my  leg muscles ached from shifting \nmy body around the bike and my brain ached from total mental \noverload. No  doubt about it, Lawson is no  normal human being. \n\nGHAPTER 3 \nAN AUDIENCE WITH \nKING TED \nFebruary 1990 \nThis interview, conducted shortly before the start of the 1990 \nGP  season, doesn’t reveal much about Eddie Lawson but in not \ndoing so  it reveals quite a  lot. Eddie’s dryness, his  taciturnity, \nhis distaste for wasting time doing interviews with hapless \njournalists are all here in bucket loads. \nLawson had only recently stunned the world with his  second \nshock team transfer in  as  many winters -  after winning his \nthird 500 crown with Ago’s Marlboro Yamaha outfit in  1988, \nhe  defected to  Rothmans Honda (prompting some fans to  call \nhim ‘The Anti-Christ’), won the 1989 title against all  the \nodds and then returned to  Marlboro Yamaha, then under \nnew management with King Kenny Roberts. Honda lost \nLawson at the end of ’89 for the same reason they lost Valentino \nRossi a  decade and a  half later —  they treated him like just \nany other employee -  and because the NSR was a  motorcycle \nracer’s nightmare. \nLawson is  a  highly intelligent man, so  you need to  read \nbetween the lines to  find out what he  really thinks. When he \nsays that adapting to  the Yamaha after a  sometimes terrifying \nbut \nultimately \nsuccessful \nseason \naboard \nthe \nfiery \nNSR500 \nis \nstraightforward, \n‘it’s \neasy \nto \ngo \nback \nthis \nway’, \nhe’s \nreally \ntelling \nyou \nwhat \na \nnightmare \nhe \nhad \ngetting \nused \nto \nthe \nNSR500 \na year earlier. \nAnd \nI \nlike \nthe \nway \nhis  \nanswers \nare  \nso  \nclipped, \nso  \ndisinterested, \nthen \nwhen \nI \ntickle \nhis \nego \nby \nasking \nhim \nabout \ngetting \nout- \nbraked \nby \nthe \nup-and-coming \nJohn \nKocinski, \nhe \nrevs \nup \nfor \nhis \nlongest \nanswer \nof \nthe \nwhole \ninterview. \nRacers \nare \nfunny \npeople \nand \nLawson \nwas \nfunny \nas  \nhell \n—  \nhe \nused \nto \nreally \ntake \nthe \npiss \nout \nof \nus \njournalists \n- \nhe \n\n20 THE FAST STUFF \nloved winding us  up  and wasting our time. He liked racing \nmotorcycles, he  hated talking to  journalists. And who could \nblame him for  that? \nStanding in  the  Marlboro Team Roberts truck at  Jerez, Eddie Lawson \npops a  couple of  small white pills into his  mouth and sweeps them \ndown his  throat with a gulp of water. \n‘Hey, Eddie, are  you on  drugs?’ I ask  idly. \n‘Nope, they’re aspirin. I gotta headache. It  must be  looking at  you \njournalist guys all day.’ \nLawson names the  interview as  the  thing he most hates about being \na  four-times world champion. A  Honda calendar, recently printed to \ncelebrate his  1989 title success aboard its  NSR500, quotes him thus: \n‘I’m not  looking for fame but  for  self-satisfaction.’ \nThis man does not need praise and glory to  motivate him. \nHis  motivation to  win, to  be  the  best, year after year, comes wholly \nfrom inside. \nWhen Lawson talks his  words are  as  dry as  dust. And the  man is a \nmaster of ultra-understatement. \nHow does it feel to be back on  Yamaha’s YZR500, which has already taken you \nto three world titles? \nPretty familiar, it’s  real easy to  ride and I already feel comfortable. I’m \nnot  having trouble adapting -—  it’s  easy to  go  back this way. \nAfter one  day here at Jerez, you've already lapped faster than you  did last year on \nthe Honda. \nYeah, but  if Kevin [Schwantz] was here we’d be doing 1m  47s. I never \nget cocky, I know what happens when you do. \nHow’s the YZR’s straight-line speed? \nThat’s come up,  the engine feels better than in ’88,  much better. I don’t \nknow, it might be a little weaker than the  Honda. \nYou  started last season injured, you should be at full fitness this year. \nI \nhope, \nyou \nknow \nthat’s \nwhat \nI \nthought \nlast \nyear. \nThen \na \nweek \nbefore \nthe  first GP you get  hurt... \n\nAN  AUDIENCE WITH KING TED Dl \nLast \nyear \nErv  \nKanemoto \nhelped \nyou \nto  \nthe  \ntitle, \nthis  \nyear \nhe’s \nworking \nwith \nWayne \nGardner. \nWill \nthat \nmake \nGardner \na \nbigger \nthreat? \nErv’s \ngoing \nto \nbe \na \nbig \nhelp \nto \nhim, \nthat’s \nfor \nsure. \nWayne’ll \nstill \ngo \nwell, \nbe \na \nbig \nthreat. \nThe \nonly \nproblem \nis \nthat \nGardner \nhas \nto \nrace \nWayne \nRainey, \nKevin \nSchwantz \nand \nEddie \nLawson \n- \nit’s \npretty \ntough \nodds \nagainst \nthree \nguys \nlike \nthat. \nWhat threat will Schwantz pose —  has he put the crashing behind him? \nIt  all  depends on  how he  goes under pressure if  he’s leading the \nchampionship, we’ll have to wait and see. \nWhen you joined Honda you  said ‘I’ve always wanted to  race  for Honda’. So \nwhat motivated your move out of there? \nRiding for  Honda! \nOne year was  enough? \nYeah. \nWhat was  the problem? \nWe  just couldn’t come to  terms. Their offer was far  below what the \nother teams had offered. They wanted me  to do four-stroke testing and \ndo  the  Suzuka Eight Hours and this and that and the  other. You know, \nthere was no  way of even discussing the  contract, so  there was nothing \nI could do.  I wanted to  stay with Erv but no  way could I stay with \nHonda with what they were offering. \nSo, as world champion you  wouldn't race for less than what you  knew riders like \nRainey were getting? \nNo, it was a  question of what the market was offering. I had Suzuki \nand the Marlboro team offering me far, far more than Honda, and \nRothmans seemed to  show no  interest at  all, And so,  shoot, if basically \nyou're not  wanted, it’s  time to  go. \nHave you  always wanted to race for Kenny Roberts? \nYeah. I have wanted to do that for a long time. But  this  way it’s  worked \nout \nreally \nnice, \ncos \nI’m \nback \nwith \nMarlboro \nand \nI \nnever \nhad \na \nproblem \nwith Marlboro. \n\n22 THE FAST STUFF \nHow’s it going to be racing for the title with Rainey as a team-mate? You  usually \ntry to distance yourself from your main rivals. \nNot  really. I think you have to race these guys no  matter where they are \nat,  what they are  riding or  anything else, so  it  makes no  difference \nwhat team or  anything else. You know, I know I have to  race Wayne \nRainey and I have to race Kevin Schwantz and possibly Wayne Gardner \nif he  comes back and maybe Kevin Magee if he’s on  the  gas. I mean, \nyou have to race these guys whether they’re your team-mate or  not. \nThe arrival of John Kocinski in your team must be pretty exciting. Will you  be a \nteacher to him? \nI don’t think there’s anything we  can teach him. You know, if he  has \ncompetitive equipment, he'll do his own thing and he'll be \ncompetitive. \nHow did you feel at last year’s [1989] Spa GP when he outbraked you and passed \nyou  in the wet? \nYeah, he rode really well and I think if I’d been on  a Yamaha, on  Dunlop \nrain tyres and had nothing to  lose whatsoever, I think I could have \ngone pretty fast too. But  no  one seemed to bring that \nweceear   me age encarta up.  You know, I was on  a  bike that was a little bit \n‘I wouldn't go  to hard to  ride in  the  wet and maybe I didn’t pick the \nCagiva and try to right tyres and I had everything to lose if I went fast, \nwin on  a  Cagiva’ so  there was no  reason to chase him down at  all.  But \nen he  rode really well and he’s capable of riding a  500 \nreally well. But where was he  in  the  dry? Nobody \nseemed to  mention that. I  think he  is  capable of  winning world \nchampionships. He  will. But he’s not  God and we  shouldn’t build him \nup  to be  that because it'll  only hurt him. \nWould you  say you  don't race for fame but for self-satisfaction? \nSure; yeah, that’s where I’m  at.  I’m  not  looking to be famous, that’s for \nsure. \nWhen you  were talking with Suzuki, did the idea  of winning three world titles on \nthree different bikes appeal? \nAll  I wanted to  do was be on  a team that works well for me  —  that’s all \nI thought about —  I wouldn’t go  to  Cagiva and try to  win on  a  Cagiva. \n\nAN  AUDIENCE WITH KING TED 23 \nTo me  the  Suzuki deal was interesting cos  they wanted me  so  badly and \nthat was nice. But it’s  not  where I wanted to  go.  It’s  nice when people \nwant you, you feel good about doing a job for  them. It’s  like Marlboro \nand Kenny. When I went to  them and asked them about it, they were \ninterested, they wanted to  do it. Where I was at,  no  one seemed to  be \ninterested so  it was time to  go. \nEpilogue: Lawson did  indeed go  to  Cagiva and not  only did  he  try  to \nwin on  the Italian V4, he  did  win, taking victory at  the  damp 1992 \nHungaroring. He  retired at the end of that year. As he walked out  of the \npaddock for  the last time, Schwantz shouted after him ‘Good riddance \nand don’t come back’. They weren’t great mates in those days but  time \nhas  healed old  wounds. \n\nCHAPTER 4 \nYEN AND THE ART OF \nMOTORCYCLE DESTRUCTION \nAugust 1990 \nAnd this is  when motorcycle racing goes wrong. If  our 1989 \nSuzuka Eight Hours ride had been a  good weekend for  a  couple \nof wannabe racers, the 1990 event was an  unmitigated disaster \nThe final qualifying session for  the 1990 Suzuka Eight Hours: ninety \nthousand spectators have come to  watch this because they fully \nunderstand it’s  time for banzai tactics, death or  glory, that kind of stuff. \nSo far we’re two seconds off the  pace, and two seconds in roadracing \nis an  age, an  epoch. Which is why the  red  mist has  already descended \nby  the time I  climb aboard our Honda-prepped Honda RC30 and \naccelerate down pit lane. I should know that the  mist (which prompts \nthe belief that a  quick burst of  heroism is  enough to  overcome \nincompetence and conjure up  the  magical lap  time we  need to  get  to \nthe  grid) will inevitably lead to  disaster. And I am  not  wrong. \nAlready bathed in sweat, I decide lap four is going to be the  first lap \nI really go  for  it. Top gear down the  straight and I’ve got  a bit  of a  tow \noff one  of the factory Yoshimura Suzuki GSX-Rs. Ahead lies  the  slightly \ndaunting Turn One. In the  Suzuka circuit guide, this corner is described \nthus: ‘One of the  typical points for  riders to  overtake others, gives you \na  great chance to  see  a hot  battles.’ (sic) \nI’ve already decided my  battle isn’t hot  enough through Turn One. \nIt’s  already fourth gear, 90mph plus, and it’s  already pretty scary. The \napproach is  downhill, off-camber, with ripples and bumps at  the \napex. \nI \nnearly \ncrashed \nthere \nthe \nday \nbefore, \nbut \nas \nthe \nJapanese \nsay: \n‘Necessary faster’. \nI \nbrake \na  \nfew \nmillimetres \nlater \nthan \nusual, \nshift \nback \na  \ncouple \nof \ngears \nand \nhave \nto  \nhold \nthe  \nfront \nbrake \na \nlittle \ndeeper \nthan \nusual \ninto \nthe \ncorner. \nIt’s all \nhappening \nso \nfast \nbut \nI \ncan already \nfeel \nthe \nfront \nend \ngetting \npretty \nwashy \non \nthe bumps \nas \nI lay \nthe \nbike \ninto \nthe \ncorner. \nI \n\nYEN AND THE ART OF  MOTORCYCLE DESTRUCTION DS) \nneed to  get  off  the  brake quick but, if my  memory serves me  correctly, \nmy  fingers unfurl from the  lever a little too  fast. The forks rebound \nfrom full compression too  rapidly, taking too  much weight off the  front \ntyre, which loses grip and tucks under. \nLife moves in  Fast Forward mode but I’m picking up  every little \ndetail as  I realise This Is  A Crash. The sickening front tyre slide ends \nwith the  bike on  its  side. The hellish noise of  the \nmurderously over-revving engine and expensive \ncarbon-fibre scraping against tarmac fill  my  helmet \nas  I am thrown forward onto the track. I’m spun \naround so  I’m sliding backwards, helmet first, lying \non  my front, limbs akimbo to scrub off some speed as \nI skip and bounce through the  gravel trap towards \nthe  barriers. My main worry is where the  bike is —  I \ndon’t want 150  kilos of Honda to  land on  top of me. \nI catch a  glimpse of the  RC  out  the  corner of my \n‘My RC30 is 20 feet \nin the air, what's left \nof its bodywork \nexploding off the \nmain structure, like \na fighter plane being \nblown out  of the sky \nby anti-aircraft fire’ \nright eye. It’s  about 20  feet in the  air and what’s left \nof its  bodywork is exploding off  the  main structure. \nIn that instant it appears rather like a fighter plane being blown out  of \nthe  sky by anti-aircraft fire. \nI plough through the  gravel, finally coming to  rest amid a  cloud of \nchoking, boiling dust which subsides to  reveal the RC  naked and \ncontorted. I hobble over to  the  wreck. The forks are  so  bent the  front \nwheel is stuffed through the lower radiator. The rear subframe does not \nexist anymore. The remains of  the seat and fairing lie  scattered all \naround. The damage is not  yet  complete though: flames leap out  from \nbeneath the  fuel tank, blackening the  paintwork and commencing the \nfinal work of destruction. \nA bunch of jabbering, helmeted marshals arrive on  the  scene, their \nvoices \nrising \nseveral \noctaves \nwhen \nthey \nsee \nthe \nfire. \nExtinguishers \nattack \nthe \nblaze \nand \nwithin \nseconds \nthe \nbike \nhas \nonce \nagain \ndisappeared \nfrom view in a  cloud of fire-quenching white powder. \nThis \nis \nwhat \nhappens \nwhen \na  \nhobby \nracer \ntries \nto  \nget  \nup  \nthere \nwith \nthe \nprofessionals. \nThe \nqualifying \npace \nat \nthe  \nEight \nHours \nis \nlunatic. \nUp-and-coming \nGP \nyoungster \nMick \nDoohan \nand \nfour-time \n500 \nworld \nchampion \nEddie \nLawson \nclash \nin \nthe \nbattle \nfor \nthe \nmuch-prized \npole \nposition, \nwhich \nin \nJapan \ncarries \nalmost \nas \nmuch \nkudos \nas \nrace \nvictory, \nbecause \npole \nis \nall \n\n26 THE FAST STUFF \nabout ultimate speed. Doohan, aboard the amazing Honda RVF750, \nwins the encounter at 2 minutes 13.427 seconds, just one  hundredth of \na second ahead of Lawson’s Yamaha YZF750. Doohan’s pole time is just \ntwo seconds off his  best 500  GP  time at  the  track. British GP  star Niall \nMackenzie qualifies 36th fastest at 2m  19.664s, endurance world champ \nThierry Crine is  51st fastest at  2m  21.210s and 1990 Assen Formula \nOne victor Kees Doorakkers is seeded onto the rear of the grid, by virtue \nof the  championship points he  scored at  Le  Mans. \nThe Eight Hours is what you might call  pretty competitive. The race \nis like an  out-of-control steam train running even faster downhill while \nteam managers throw great heaps of money at  it, encouraged all  the \nwhile by Japan’s booming economy, which is  also spiralling out of \ncontrol, soon to  go into full-on meltdown. Most national race teams in \nEurope could race for a whole year on  what a good private team throws \ninto the  Eight Hours. And then there are  the  factories —  19  full  factory \nbikes line up  at  the  start of the  race and half the  remainder of the  65 \nbike grid are  semi-factory machines. \nDespite my  high-speed accident we  just make it into the  race, but \nwe're right at  the  back of the  grid with Doorakkers. Our bike has  been \nmiraculously reincarnated overnight by our Japanese mechanics who \nawait the  start bleary eyed but  bursting with pride at  their work. \nI’m  grateful that my  team-mate Gilbert Roy is taking the  Le  Mans \nstart because I know he’s going to crash the bike again. Five laps during \nthe pre-race morning warm-up convinced me that the frame, the \nswingarm or  both are  bent. The team assures me  that they are  perfectly \nstraight, but  sure enough, six  laps into the  race Gilbert goes down in a \nbig  way. I pray he  will leave the  wreck languishing in  the dirt. But \nminutes later I hear our  very sick motorcycle rumble into the pits. Curse \nhim. The mechanics throw it back together and send me  out  again. I do \ntwo laps and return to  the  pits. \n‘Look guys,’ I say, ‘The bike is  fucked.’ They suggest adjusting the \nsuspension. Great idea. Gilbert does another couple of laps and isn’t \nimpressed. \nThey \nadjust \nthe \nsuspension \nagain. \n‘Look, \nthe \nframe’s \nbent, \nthe  bikes unrideable,’ I repeat. \n‘Ah, \nbut  \nMr  \nKawai, \nyour \nsponsor, \nis \nvery \nimportant \nman,’ \nthe  \nteam \nboss \nreplies. \nThe \ninference \nis \nthat \nMr \nKawai \n(who, \nand \nI \njest \nnot, \nbuilds \nmotorway \nbridges \nfor \na \nliving) \nhas \nploughed \na \nlot \nof \nmoney \ninto \nthis \nventure \nand \nwhile \nthe \nbike \nmight \nbe \nbent, \nI \nam \nexpected \nto \ngo \nout \nand \n\nYEN AND THE ART OF  MOTORCYCLE DESTRUCTION PRY \nride it until I, too, crash. Then if the bike is really broken, or  if I have a \nbroken leg, we  can  retire from the  race with honour. \nI may be a wretched coward, but  today I prefer dishonour to pain. I \ninsist we  retire. Chief mechanic Chichan-San bursts into floods of tears. \nAs  is the  Japanese custom he is taking all the  blame on  his  shoulders. \nGilbert and I offer Chichan our  ripped-up leathers to placate him —  as  a \nrider’s second skin, a racing suit holds mythical value in Japan. \nI  metamorphose from racer to  race watcher and swell spectator \nattendance from 159,999 to  160,000 (310,000 over three days). It’s \naround 40 degrees and 80 per cent humidity and reclining by an  air-con \nunit in  the  pits I consider the  insanity of  sitting on  top  of a  red-hot \nmotorcycle in  such conditions. No  doubt about it, they’re all mad. \nAbout the  time we  retire, Wayne Gardner crashes the  leading RVF \nhe’s sharing with Doohan, which hands the lead to  Lawson and \nTadahiko Taira. Gardner gets back into the race and is riding like a man \npossessed as  he closes the  gap on  the  YZF. \nHonda pours crazy amounts of money into the Eight Hours. It means \nalmost as  much to  the  factory as  winning the  500  world title and since \nthey have no  chance of doing that this year, the  1990 Eight Hours has \nbecome a desperate crusade in which the money and resources involved \nmean nothing so  long as  victory is secured. Cash is of little consequence \nto  the  other teams too. The sponsorship yen come from all quarters to \nencourage the Japanese to consume yet more consumables: Cup Noodle \nsnacks, Nescafe coffee, Kawai Steel girders, Tech 21  men’s hair mousse, \nPentax cameras, Swatch watches, Seed department stores. You name it, \nthey’re flogging it. \nGardner is burning rubber out  of just about every turn and the  RVF \nis \ntaking \nup \nto \na \nsecond \nout \nof \nthe \nYZF \neach \nlap, \nso \nHonda \nreckons \nthey'll \nbe \nahead \nas \ndarkness \nfalls \nand \nthe \nchequered \nflag \ncomes \nout. \nBut \nin \ntheir \neagerness \nto \nsave \ntime, \nthe \nHonda \ncrew \nmess \nup \na \nfuel \nstop \nand \njust \nbefore \nhalfway, \nthe \nRVF \nruns \ndry \naround \nthe \nback \nof \nthe \ntrack \nand \nall \nthe \nzillions \nof \nyen \nthrown \ninto \nthe \nRVF \nmean \nutterly \nnothing. \nLate \nthat \nnight, \nin  \nSuzuka’s \nnotorious \nLog \nCabin, \nthe \nriders’ \nbar, \nveteran \ncomic, \nTT, \nDaytona \nand \nEight \nHours \nwinner \nGraeme \nCrosby \npresents \nGardner \nwith \na \nbottle \nof \nbeer \nlabelled, \n‘Honda \nGasoline \n— \none \nlitre: \n10 \nmillion \nYen.’ \nThat’s \nhow \nmuch \nprize \nmoney \nGardner \nlost. \nAnd \nthat’s \nhow \nmuch \nLawson \nwon. \nThe \nreigning \n500 \nworld \nchampion \nhates \nracing \nfour-strokes \nand \nhe  \nwould \nmuch \nrather \nhave \nbeen \nback \n\n28 THE FAST STUFF \nhome on  the  Colorado river in  between the  French and British GPs \nthan racing in a  sauna on  the  other side of the  world. Rumour had it \nthat Yamaha paid King Ed  $200,000 to  help them beat Honda. In  the \nevent, whatever they paid him was worth it. \nLawson was his  usual mysterious self at  Suzuka. Rarely seen, he \nwould materialise out  of the  ether just before it was his  turn to  take \nover from Taira. Obviously unused to  the  concept of endurance racing, \nhe  began the last stint wearing a  black visor on  his Shoei helmet \n(equipped with battery-powered neon Shoei logos!) but  as  dusk turned \nto  darkness he didn’t seem to mind too  much. \nRight after his  most gruelling race ever, Lawson was bound for  the \nBritish GP at Donington where he met his recently retired father who’d \nflown in from California for a rare GP  visit. \n‘Hi  son,’ his  father said. \n‘Hi  dad,’ Lawson replied. \n‘What you been up  to  son?’ \n‘I was racing in Japan last week.’ \n‘How'd you get on  son?’ \n‘Oh, I won the  race dad.’ \n‘Well done son.’ \n\nCHAPTER 5 \nON \nA \nWING \nAND \nA \nPRAYER \n— \nRIDING \nSECRETS \nOF  \nTHE \nGODS \nJanuary 199] \nThe late 1980s and early 1990s were a  new age in  GP  racing, \nwhen technological advances turned 500s from motorcycles \ninto missiles. Speaking with Kevin Schwantz, Wayne Rainey \nand Mick Doohan after 1990 -  the year of the highside -  revealed \nthe violently acrobatic riding techniques employed by  this \nlegendary breed of new rocket jockey \nA cloudy, depressing day at  Misano is enlivened by the  arrival of Mick \nDoohan, his  Rothmans Honda singing through the  down changes into \nthe  tight, first gear Cattolica left-hander. \nBody hunched apparently awkwardly over the  front of the  machine, \nhunting for front tyre grip, Doohan slams the NSR onto its side so violently \nthat he will surely crash. But  the  bike is only cranked over for an  instant \nbefore the Australian wrenches it upright and turns on  the  throttle. \nIn  first gear the  rear Michelin immediately breaks traction. The revs \nrise wildly as  the rear end cocks at least 20 degrees to  the right, the rear \ntyre etching a  black mark right out  to the kerb. The tyre keeps spinning, \nthe  revs remain skyward as  Doohan shifts up  a  gear with the  rear end \nstill well out  of line. \nYet  all  this time the  front wheel is pointing dead ahead and the  bike \nis  driving hard towards the next, faster left. Doohan eases off  the \nthrottle just enough to  bring the  Honda approximately into line before \nhe  keels her  over once again. Out of that curve Doohan grabs another \ngear and the  warbling exhaust note signals that the  rear tyre is  still \nscrabbling for grip as  he  shifts up  again and takes aim at  the  daunting, \nsixth-gear left  that leads onto Misano’s back straight. \nRear-wheel steering is nothing new. The craft has  been around in GP \nracing \nfor \na \ndecade \nor \nmore, \nbut \nevery \nyear \nits \nexecution \nbecomes \nmore \nconspicuous and more incredible to  witness. \n\n30 THE FAST STUFF \nEach season, the  true 500 elite (you can count them on  your hands \nwith fingers to spare) develop their skills further as machine development \nallows them to  achieve things which a year ago, or  even a  month ago, \nwould have been impossible. It is the rider who is able to use  his  riding \ntalent and physical strength to harness each step forward in GP technology \nwho ultimately wins the  day. Those who don’t keep rolling on  that \nlearning curve get left way behind to fill the lower placings. \nThe art  of  controlling a  170 horsepower 500 two-stroke V4  entails \nsuperhuman powers of co-ordination and the ability to analyse machine \nbehaviour minutely through each millisecond at  speeds of  up  to \n190mph. It also requires immense physical strength to resist the  forces \nimposed by modern tyres and chassis. \nThis fact is strangely neglected by just about everyone except the riders \nand a growing coterie of paddock quacks. Old-timers who censure today’s \nsuperstars for  failing to  emulate the  three-GPs-in-a-day performance of \nMike Hailwood and other old-school racing legends are  blind to  the \nadvances of science. In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, g-force was  something \nonly jet fighter pilots worried about. It’s  different these days. \nAnd yet  the  New Age stars talk of  their craft with mind-boggling \nmatter-of-factness: scrubbing the  front tyre sideways to  supplement \nbraking power, deftly controlling the  crucial rear-wheel slide with foot \npressure and throttle opening, steering the  bike by body positioning \nand weighting of the  footrests. All  this has  become just another part of \ntheir workaday racing lives. \nSimply staying on  a 500  is a major feat. Leading brake manufacturers \nAP  Lockheed calculate that riders hit about 1.5g during heavy braking, \nwhich means the  weight of rider and machine is amplified one and a \nhalf times. Thus.a rider has  to work against 300  kilos or  thereabouts as \nhe hurtles towards a corner. \nAt  this point the  rear wheel is probably off  the  ground, such is  the \nweight transfer during braking, and the  combined weight of rider and \nmachine is  thrown onto the  front wheel and the  rider’s wrists. The \ntendency for anyone unused to  such vicious forces is to be thrown over \nthe  handlebars. I know this because it happened to  me  while testing \nDoohan’s NSR. A  few laps and my  arms could no  longer resist the \nbraking g-forces, so  they folded while I was braking into a fast right- \nhander and I ended up  flopping over the ‘bars and headbutting the \nfront number plate. Not nice. \n\nON A WING AND A  PRAYER —  RIDING SECRETS OF  THE GODS 31 \nThe 500 stars are  able to  brake so  violently because they are  brave, \nstrong and skilful enough to take advantage of the extraordinary power \nof carbon brakes and the  immense grip of the  latest slick tyres, which \ndon’t lock or  skid during braking. \nNow the problem is  simply holding on  —  not easy when all  four \nfingers are require to  haul on  the front brake lever. It’s a  happy \ncoincidence that the leverage required to induce that level of deceleration \nhas  decreased as  stopping power has  increased. Most riders brake with \ntwo fingers, some only use a single finger, allowing the rest of the hand \nto  concentrate on  holding on. \nThe roadracer’s version of tennis elbow and other physical peculiarities \nare  the  downside of this progress. Tendonitis (constriction of the  nerve \ntissues caused by overdevelopment of the  arm muscles, leading to loss \nof feeling in  the  hands) is  a common paddock malady. Check out  the \nstars’ wrist scars for evidence of corrective surgery. \nAnd the  sport’s latest demands are  creating a  new breed of racing \nmutant. When Doohan clenches his  right hand, as  if to  grip his  NSR’s \nhandlebar, a gruesome lump of muscle protrudes from the underside of \nhis  forearm. The overdeveloped tissue is nicknamed a ‘throttle bump’ \nand is the  result of resisting 1.5g while simultaneously juggling brake \nlever, throttle and handlebar pressure. \nThe throttle bump won't be the  end of GP  rider evolution. And while \nthe  arm and thigh muscles do the  greatest share of the work, the rider’s \nwhole body is  at  fever pitch during a race, fighting the  negative forces \nand \nworking \nto \ntake \nadvantage \nof \nthe \npositive \nforces. \nGP \nracing \nproduces \nthe \nkind \nof \nheart \nbpms \nand \nbreath \nrates \nexperienced \nby \nOlympic \nathletes. \nWhich \nis \nwhy \ntoday’s \nGP \nstars \nare \na \n(relatively) \nclean-living \nbunch \nwhose \ndaily \nroutine \nis \nbuilt \naround \ntheir \nphysical \ntraining \nprogrammes. \nEnough \nof  \nthe  \nmedical \nthesis. \nTo  \nexamine \nthe  \ndetails \nof  \nGP  \nriding \ntechnique \nwe \nwill \nassume \na \nrider \nis \nattacking \na \ngenerously \nproportioned \n180-degree \nright. \nHe’s \nheavy \non \nthe \nfront \nbrake, \nwhile \nhis \nright \nfoot \nstrokes \nthe \nrear \nbrake \nlever. \nBut \nwith \nthe \nrear \ntyre \nlikely \nto \nbe \nan \ninch \nor \ntwo \nin \nthe \nair, \nthere’s \nno \nbraking \npower \nto \nbe \ngained \nthere, \nso \nit’s \nall \nabout \ncontrol, \nas \nWayne \nRainey \nsays: \n‘On \na \n500 \nyou've \ngot \nno \nengine \nbraking. \nWhen \nyou \nbackshift \nit’s \nlike \nthe \nchain’s \ncome \noff, \nso \nI \njust \nuse \nthe \nrear \nbrake \nto \nsettle \nthe \nsuspension \nand \nto \nstop \nthe \nrear \nend \nfrom \ngoing \ncrazy.’ \nAs  \nthe \nmachine \napproaches \nthe \ncorner, \nthe \ncomplications \nreally \nbegin. \nThe \nlion’s \nshare \nof \nthe \nbraking \nis \ndone \nin \na \nstraight \nline \nbut \nthe \n\n32 THE FAST STUFF \ntime comes when the rider must set  in motion the  chain of events that \nwill take him through the  corner. His eyes are  already lining up  the \nentry point as  he begins to ease off the front brake and apply handlebar \nand footrest pressure to  steer the  bike. \nAlthough the  tarmac takes a  smooth U-turn onto the  next straight, \nrider and machine don’t describe such a  graceful arc. That style may \nhave been the only way round a corner in the days of slippy tyres, dodgy \nsuspension and bendy frames, but modern GP machines permit a faster, \nmore aggressive route through the  turn. \nThe object is  to  minimise the time the machine is  cranked over, \nbecause in  that situation neither brake nor throttle can be  applied. \nNowadays the  rider keeps the  bike relatively upright deeper into the \ncorner, accomplishing the  actual turning in an  instant and then firing \nthe bike out  on  the  throttle. In effect he describes a ‘V’  line through the \nturn, not the classic and graceful ‘U’  of olden times. \nGetting the turning over and done with as  rapidly as  possible \ndemands violent measures. The rider doesn’t just lean the bike into the \ncorner —  he  knocks the machine onto its  side, applying aggressive \ncounter-steer by pushing heavily on  the  right handlebar to  turn the \nfront wheel to  the  left  and drop the  machine to  the  right. Body weight \nand feet inputs also play their part, the  pilot’s backside shifting to  the \nright and his  extra weighting of  the right footrest help to  pull the \nmachine over. The transition from upright to  full  lean is accomplished \nin  such a  dramatically short time that it  seems certain that the  rider \nwon't be able to  arrest the  descent before it’s  too  late. \nOf course, this time he  does avert disaster, and yet  as  the  bike leans \ndeep into the  corner the rider is  still fingering the front brake lever, \nscrubbing off excess speed as  the disc pads gently bite on  the decelerating \nrotors. From now on,  applying any more brake really can spell disaster, \nfor  the  average rider at  least, because this is where Mr  Average and the \nelite go  their different ways. Instead these elite riders happily induce \nfront-tyre slides, either with a touch more brake, a tweak on  the  ‘bars or \na  fraction more lean angle. The tyre then begins to  slide and scrubs off \nthe  speed which couldn’t be  safely lost  with a  more drastic pull on  the \nbrake. This is indeed treading the fine line between glory and disaster. \nRainey \nexplains \nhow \nit \nworks: \n‘I  \nusually \nonly \nscrub \nthe  \nfront \ntyre \nwhen \nI \nget \ninto \na  \nturn \ntoo  \nhot  \nbut  \nthis \nis \nhow \nit \ngoes: \nyou're \nin \nfourth \ngear \nand \njetting \ndown \nto  \nthis \nU-turn. \nYou \nbrake \nand \nflick \nit \nin.  \nYou \ncan \n\nON \nA \nWING \nAND \nA  \nPRAYER \n—  \nRIDING \nSECRETS \nOF  \nTHE \nGODS \n33 \nfeel \nthe  \nbrake \nand \nthen \nyou \npick \nup  \nthe  \nfeel \nof \nthe  \ntyre \nand \nit \nstarts \nmoving \na \nlittle \nbit. \nJust \nfrom \nracing \nso \nlong \nI \nknow \nwhat \nit’s \ngoing \nto \ndo \nmost \nof \nthe \ntime, \nso \nI \ncan \nadjust \nthe \npressure \non \nthe \nhandlebars \nand \nknow \nhow \nhard \nI \ncan \ndrive \nit \ninto \nthe \npavement. \nYou \njust \nlay \nit \nover \na \nlittle \nbit \nmore, \nit \nslides \nand \nscrubs \noff \nthat \nmuch \nmore \nspeed.’ \nEasy \nenough, \nbut \nhow \ndoes \nRainey \nprevent \nthe  \nslide \ntranslating \ninto \na \ncrash \nwhen \nhe \nhas \nonly \nmilliseconds \nto \nreact \nto \nthe  \nsignals \nof \nimpending \ndoom? \n‘That's \nthe \ntricky \npart! \nI’m \nusing \neverything. \nI \nuse \nthe \nrear \nbrake, \nI’m \nusing \nmy \nknee \nand \nI’m \nusing \na \nlot \nof \nupper \nbody \nweight \nto \nkeep \nmy \nweight \nat \na certain \nangle \nto \nthe \nbike.’ \nRainey and most of his  peers learned the  complex \nand \nrisky \nart  \nof \nscrubbing \nthe  \nfront \ntyre \naboard \nmore \n‘When \nthe \nfront \nforgiving \nfour-strokes. \nThe \nnatural \nengine \nbraking \nand \nslides \nit’s \nkind \nof \nlike \nextra \nweight \nof \na \n‘diesel’ \n(the \nGP \nracer’s \nmocking \nterm \n“OH!” \nand \nyou \ndig \nfor \na \nfour-stroke) \nmake \nit \neasier \nfor \nriders \nto \ncontrol \nin \nyour \nknee \nand \nit’s \njust \nhow \nmuch \ninput \nthey \nput \ninto \nthe \nfront \ntyre. \nOna \na \nbit \nof \na \nmoment’ \n500  they have to rely partly on  delicate dabs of the rear \nbrake to  shift weight off  the  front tyre, though this \ntechnique is  only possible in  left-handers because the  rear brake lever \nisn’t accessible when the bike is cranked over through right-handers. \nDoohan, who speaks disarmingly about his riding technique (‘Really \nI don’t know what I’m doing!’), employs the  front-end slide technique \nto  a monster extent on  heavier, lazier four-strokes. And yet because he \nserved his  novice years on  two-stroke proddie bikes he doesn’t like the \nfeel of engine braking, so  when he  races Honda’s RVF in  the  Suzuka \nEight Hours he enters corners with the  clutch disengaged! \n‘On a  four-stroke I can slide the  rear even before the  apex and I can \nslide the  front good too,’ says Doohan. ‘At  the Suzuka Eight Hours I \nhad the  front skidding in the  second part of the  Spoon Curve. I’d come \naround the  next lap and see  the  black line I’d  just laid. I couldn’t do \nthat on  the  500. On  the  500  you're only really washing a bit of speed off \nwith the  front. You don’t slide it like the  rear. It’s  more just to  slow the \nthing up,  when it does slide it’s  kind of like  “OH!” and you kinda dig in \nyour knee and it’s  a  bit  of  a moment.’ \nWith the bike into the corner and turned, the  rider is thinking of one \nthing and one thing only from now on  ~  getting on  the  throttle as  soon \nas  possible. Increasing corner exit speed is THE most important aspect \nof racecraft because you retain the  speed advantage all  the  way down \n\n34 THE FAST STUFF \nthe  next straight, hence the  hurry to  get  the  turning done to  allow \nmore time and space for playing with the  throttle. \nThe turning point is  the slowest stage during cornering but mid- \ncorner speeds saw a significant increase in  1990. Before then tyres had \nprovided the predictability to  ride the bike deep into the turn and \nsideways on  the  exit, but  they hadn’t given enough side grip to  allow \nriders to  maintain real corner speed. That changed with Michelin’s \n1990 front and rear radial slicks, but  there was a sting in  the  tail  for \nriders who tried to  abuse the  extra grip they discovered at  maximum \nlean. No  doubt about it,  1990 was the  year of the  highside —  Doohan, \nSchwantz, Wayne Gardner and Niall Mackenzie all  discovering the \nterrifying, bone-crunching up-and-over flip. \n‘Suddenly we  all  found we  had a  lot  more grip when banked over, \nmore grip from all parts of the  tyre,’ says Mackenzie, Schwantz’s Lucky \nStrike Suzuki team-mate during 1990. ‘At  the point where they used to \nslide they kept on  gripping and some riders were giving it more and \nmore throttle at bigger and bigger leans angles until eventually they got \nspat off.’ \nIt was some time before riders had realised that you abused the extra \ngrip at your peril, and by then the  500  GP injury list had grown critically \nlong, to the point where the  sport seriously discussed banning 500s and \nreplacing them with 375cc two-strokes or  600cc four-strokes. \nThe 1990 world champion, Rainey, came within an  ace of  falling \nvictim too, smashing several fairing screens at early GPs, as  he wrestled \nto  control the  early stages of a highside. \n‘The bikes have been throwing everybody off because now you’re at \nmaximum lean angle with so  much grip that when it does step out  it \nthrows you a  long way,’ says Rainey. ‘That’s what I try and stay away \nfrom \nin \nthe \nmiddle \nof \nthe \ncorner \nwhen \nyou've \ngot \nmax \npressure \non \nthe \ntyres. I always try  to  hold it there. It feels so  good that you think you \ncan get  on  the  gas  but  the  consequences are  terrible. I always hold it, \nhold it, pick it up,  turn it and then nail it.’ \nThe \nincreased \ngrip \n—  \neven \nonce \nhe \nhad \nlearned \nits \nlimitations \n—  \nwasn’t \nwholly \ngood \nnews \nfor  \nex-250 \nrider \nMackenzie, \nwhose \nbiggest \ntalents \nare  \ncorner-entry \nspeed \nand \nmid-corner \nspeed. \nWith \nhis \nex-dirt-tracking, \nrear-wheel-steering \nrivals \nfinding \nnew \nconfidence \nin  \nthe  \nlatest \nradial \nfront \nslicks, \nMackenzie \nfound \nhis \nsuperiority \nin \nthe \nearly \npart \nof \ncorners \nundermined. \nNevertheless \nhis \nhigh \ncorner-speed \nstyle \nworked \nwell \nat \n\nON \nA \nWING \nAND \nA  \nPRAYER \n—  \nRIDING \nSECRETS \nOF  \nTHE \nGODS \n35 \nsome \ntracks, \nlike \nYugoslavia’s \nsinuous \nRijeka \ncircuit, \nwhere \nhis  \nfluid \nprogress \nhad \nhim \nlapping \nwithin \na \ntenth \nof \nSchwantz’s \nbest. \nThe \nart  \nof \nrear-wheel \nsteering \n—  \nborn \nof \nnecessity \non  \nthe  \nslick \ndirt \ntracks \nof \nthe \nUS \nnational \ncircuit \n—  \nis \nthe  \nshowpiece \nof \n500  \nGP \nracing. \nThe \ntheory \nand \nreality \nof \nthe \nform \nare \nsimple \nenough, \nit \nis \nthe \nexercising \nof \nthe \nart  \nwhich \nonly \nthe  \nfew \ncan  \nmuster, \nespecially \nin \nlow-gear \ncorners. \nOur rider is now safely through the  transient mid-corner stage and \naims \nto \ncomplete \nthe \nlast \npart \nof \nthe \nturning \nroutine \nliterally \nby \nspinning \nthe back of the machine around. This action will tighten his corner-exit \nline and give him more room than he  would otherwise have had to \nunleash as  much power as  possible as  soon as  possible. \nRainey again: ‘There’s a certain point where you see  the inside of the \ntrack, you can see  the  outside of the  track and you know you are  not \ngoing to make the corner, so  you give it more throttle. You just need the \nbike to  turn a little bit and as  soon as  it’s  spinning it turns just enough \nto where you can  pick the  bike up  and then you nail it off the  corner.’ \nThis squirt of wheelspin which initiates the  final turning phase is \nbarely visible; the  turning is  all  over and done with by the  time the \nrider completes his  acceleration out  of  the  corner with a  spectacular \nbroad-slide. ‘Where you really see  us  sliding around coming out, that’s \nmostly power-wise,’ continues Rainey. ‘Usually the  turning is all  done \nright when it first spins, we’re doing that only to  help turn the  bike.’ \nDoohan is probably the  most spectacular and sustained of the  rear- \nwheel steerers. Although a  newcomer to  500s, the  Aussie reckons the \nHonda gives him no  other choice (Doohan sometimes uses lower-than- \nusual gearbox ratios to encourage the bike to wheelspin to aid  turning). \n‘It’s partly the way the power comes in,’ he explains. ‘But at the moment \nit’s  also one of the  only ways I can steer the  bike, especially in  faster \ncorners. If it’s  not spinning, it’s  not turning. On  the  Yamaha you don’t \nhave to  do  that. But I’ve noticed that whenever I’m sideways on  the \nHonda, Schwantz is sideways on  the  Suzuki, but  my  suspension seems \nto work better in the  slide than his.’ \nRainey reckons to  have between 8000 and 10,000 rpm on  the  rev- \ncounter when he first begins to work the  twistgrip. At  those revs —  with \nmore than 3000rpm still to  go  —  the 500 is  already producing plenty \nenough power and torque to  spin the rear tyre with only the  most \ndelicate \nincrease \nin \nthrottle \nopening. \nA \nfraction \ntoo \nmuch \nthrottle \nand \nthe \nrear \ntyre \nwill \nspin \nout, \nmost \nlikely \ncausing \na \nhighside \ncrash. \n\n36 THE FAST STUFF \nThe art  therefore is  to  get the rear tyre spinning just enough to \nexecute the turn, and then maintain forward drive as  the  tyre struggles \nto  hook up. Doohan once again: ‘I’m just feeding the throttle in, \nwinding it back and forth, trying not  to put down too  much or  too  little. \nI just keep it spinning until it gets to a point where it’s  not  making any \nmore power and then I shift gears. I’d  rather have it doing that than \nlifting the  front and shaking its head.’ \nThrottle control isn’t enough on  its  own to  do  this and riders play a \ntreacherous and delicate juggling act, weighting the footrests and \nshifting body weight to  increase or  decrease rear tyre grip as  required. \nSometimes the  rider will find too  much grip and he  can loosen the \nrear tyre’s hold on  the  tarmac by  shifting his  body weight forward, \naway from the  tyre contact patch. As  ever he  relies on  phenomenally \nrapid reactions to  check any sudden loss of grip before the  point of no \nreturn is reached. And just as  the  rider uses his  inside knee as  a lean- \nangle sensor, his  outer foot plays a  crucial part as  an  early warning \nsystem and can then provide the  extra grip required to  avert disaster. \nBy  forcing down on  the upper, outside footrest the rider obtains \nexceptional feel for  rear tyre grip. Weighting the footrest further \nincreases grip by  counteracting the tyre’s tendency to  sideslip and \ncrucially helps move the  machine upright where the  tyre contact patch \nis larger, once again offering more grip and predictability. \nRainey believes he  couldn’t make a  corner at  GP  speed if he merely \nsat  on  the  bike without pushing down —  hard. ‘You'd actually fall  off. \nYou've got  to push down on  the  bike to  get your seating right so  when \nyou're on  the  throttle it’s  all hooked up  together. Going through a right \nyou're using your right side to  feel  for traction and your left  to  give you \ntraction. You can feel the  grip more and you can control the  bike a  lot \nbetter by forcing down on  the  ‘peg when the  rear steps out.’ \nSchwantz, less of a  dirt tracker than his  American contemporaries, \nacquired his  footrest-weighting techniques from another two-wheel \ndiscipline. ‘I learned a lot about how to keep traction from riding trials. \nYou lean out  of a  corner on a trials bike to  keep the  tyre biting. On  a \nroadracer, \nif \nyou \nkeep \nyour \nweight \non \nthe \noutside \n’peg \nas \nyou \nthrow \nthe \nbike \ninto \na \ncorner \nyou \nstand \nmuch \nless \nchance \nof \nhaving \nthe \nrear \nend \nstep \nout. \nThen \nyou \ngo \nover \nthe \nseat \nand \nhang \noff \nthe \ninside, \nbut \nyou \nstill \nkeep \na \nlot \nof \nweight \non \nthat \noutside \n‘peg \nand \nyou \nput \nsome \nmore \non \nif \nthe  tyre starts really sliding.’ \n\nON \nA \nWING \nAND \nA \nPRAYER \n—  \nRIDING \nSECRETS \nOF  \nTHE \nGODS \noT \nAs  \nthe \nrider \nbegins \nhis \ncorner \nexit \nhe \nworks \nto \nlift \nthe \nbike \nupright \nas \nsoon \nas  \npossible \nto \nget \non  \nto  \nthe  \nfatter, \ngrippier \npart \nof \nthe  \nrear \ntyre, \nso \nhe \ntakes \na \nstraight \ntrajectory, \nrather \nthan \na \ncurved \ntrajectory \nto \ncomplete \nthe \ncorner. \nSchwantz \nis \nthe \nmaster \nof \nwrenching \nthe \nbike \nupright \nonto \nthe \nfatter \npart \nof  \nthe \nrear \ntyre, \njumping \non  \nthe \ngas \nand \npulling \nthe \ntightest, \nquickest \nline out \nof \na \ncorner. \nIt is \nthis ability \nthat \nhas \noften \ngiven \nhim \na \ncrushing \nadvantage \nover \nhis rivals, \nwho \ntalk \njealously \nof \nthe \nSuzuki \nRGV’s \ncapabilities. \nBut \nwhile \nthe \nRGV \nmay \nbe a \nnimble \nmachine, \nSchwantz’s \nteam-mate \nMackenzie \nbelieves \nthat \nthe \nTexan’s \nphysique \n— his \nlong, \ngangly \nlegs \nin \nparticular \n— is \na \ncrucial \nfactor \nin \nthe \nSchwantz/ \nRGV \ncombination. \n‘Kevin's got a unique style —  it’s  the way his  body is,’  says Mackenzie. \n‘His legs are  so  long that when the rear breaks away he can  pick the bike \nup so  quickly because he’s already on  it. I’m right off the  side of the bike, \nso  it takes much longer for me  to  get back on  it and control the  slide.’ \nAs  body weight is  transferred back to  the  centre of  the  machine, \nlifting the  bike still further, the  rider heaves himself forward over the \nfront. Today’s 500s wheelie out  of most corners and lift  the  front even \nwhen the rider still needs the front tyre’s grip while arcing out  of turns. \nSo the turn will almost certainly be completed with the bike hard against \nthe kerb, front wheel off the  tarmac, the rider still using body weight to \nsteer (with the  front wheel airborne he  doesn’t have a lot  of choice) as \nthe  rear tyre continues to  lay down its  tell-tale smear of hot  rubber. \nEven down the  straight the  rider is working to  use  every trick he can \nmuster to get to the next corner as  quickly as  possible. Especially exiting \nfaster corners he  may try  to  keep the  bike cranked over longer than \nnecessary. This keeps the  bike on  the  smaller diameter section of the \nrear tyre, thus lowering the  final gearing ratio and thus increasing rpm \nand power. \nOf  course, not all  corners are straightforward U-bends. Modern \nracetracks are  infested by chicanes, which demand a  complex cocktail \nof all kinds of riding techniques. The purpose of these tight esses is to \nkeep speeds at  safe levels, invariably at  corners made unsafe by the \nspeed \nof \nmodern \ncars \nand \nbikes. \nIn \ngeneral, \nriders \ndon’t \nlike \nchicanes, \nespecially \nthe \nreally \nslow \nkinks, \nbecause \nthey \nbreak \nup \nthe \nflow \nof \na \nracetrack \nand \ndemand \na \nless \ngung-ho, \nmore \nconfined \napproach. \n‘In  \nchicanes \nyou're \nbasically \ndoing \neverything \nexcept \nrear-wheel \n\n38 THE FAST STUFF \nsteering,’ says Rainey. ‘It’s kinda like jumping your body around the \nbike and counter-steering —  you go  right if you flick the  ‘bars left, and \nyou go left if you flick the  “bars right.’ \nChicanes require massive amounts of counter-steer as  a rider heaves \nthe  bike from full  lean on  one side down to  full  lean on  the  other in a \nfraction of a  second. But  only a certain amount of this can  be directed \nthrough the  handlebars because the  front end will only take so  much \ninput before the  ‘bars turn towards full  lock, and the  rider crashes. \nFootrest weighting, throttle control and movement of body weight \nagain play a vital role here. The rider enters the  first part of the chicane \npretty much how he enters a normal corner, but  at the very moment he \nachieves maximum lean the bike is forced upright and laid down in the \nother direction. The change of attitude is achieved far quicker than in a \nnormal turn, and this is where rider strength and stamina really tell. \n‘You don’t realise you use  your feet so  much until you hurt one of \nthem,’ affirms Doohan. ‘Even if I just get  one of my  feet in the  wrong \nposition when I’m  on  the  bike it really messes me  about and it’s  easy \nfor that foot to just flick off the  ‘peg.’ \nTo  initiate the change of  direction, the rider stands hard on  the \noutside footrest to force the bike upright, also using the peg to lever his \nbody weight up  and over to  the  other side. At  the  same time he  also \nuses counter-steering to help flip the bike in the other direction. And as \nhe  lifts the  bike in  the  middle of  the  chicane he  gives the  throttle a \ngentle tweak which raises the front end to  assist the up-and-over \nmotion. If the  front wheel lifts a few inches off the  tarmac at this point \nyou may see  evidence of counter-steer —  the airborne wheel momentarily \npointing one  way as  the bike steers the  other. \nThe forces transmitted through the footrests is  more difficult to \nascertain —  until you check out  the  soles of a  GP  rider’s boots —  which \ninvariably feature great holes gouged out by the footrests. Some top \nriders ruin a pair of boots in a  single GP weekend. \nEach season, physical strength becomes more crucial in  the  bid  for \n500 GP glory. Today’s 500 riders are serious athletes, constantly \ndeveloping their physique and technique to  fit  the ever-growing \ndemands of a  two-stroke V4  on  big, fat  slicks. And as  the  technicians \ndiscover ways for the machines to accelerate faster, brake harder, corner \ndeeper and grip better, those riders have to keep working their arses off \nto  keep up —  or jump off the  rollercoaster. \n\nCHAPTER 6 \nHISeavOUNG GODAOR \nDARK STAR? \nJune 1992 \nA lot  of bike racers are strange people, but John Kocinski was \none of the biggest weirdos I ever found in the paddock. He drove \nteam boss King Kenny Roberts half round the twist with his \nbizarre antics, which did make him the most fascinating of \nsubjects for  shit-stirring journalists \nThey say  genius and madness are  near allies but  what is  John Kocinski \nall  about? From his  lucky holey racing underpants to  his  maverick \nracing lines, Kocinski is   aman out  on  his own. His  mentor and spiritual \nfather King Kenny Roberts is sometimes moved to wonder whether his \nprotégé does indeed come from this planet. ‘He’s on  Moonsville,’ the \nliving legend was once moved to  Say. \nBe this as  it may, human beings don’t get to be extra special by being \nextra normal. Kocinski certainly isn’t quite normal but  is he  good guy \nor  bad guy, madman or  genius? \nWhatever, JK is the new life force in 500 GP racing, the freckly 23-year- \nold who wasn’t afraid to bust into 1991’s exclusive 500  GP winners’ club \n—  apart from Wayne Rainey, Mick Doohan and Kevin Schwantz, Kocinski \nwas the  only man to win a  500  GP  in the  summer of ’91. \nHis  ebullient disrespect for his  elders has  won him an  army of young \nfans who delight in  youth triumphing over experience —  you see \nmore Shoei Kocinski replicas on  the  roads of  Europe than any other \n‘wannabe’ lid. \nBut  \nthe \nMarlboro \nTeam \nRoberts \npilot’s \nbrash \nyoung \nstyle \nhas  \nalso \nwon \nhim \nenemies. \nKocinski’s \nolder \nrivals \ndon’t \nlike \ngetting \nbeaten \nby \nraw \nyouth \nand \nhis \nmaiden \n500 \nvictory \nat \nShah \nAlam \nin \nSeptember \n‘91 \nbit \ndeep \ninto \nvanquished \nAussies \nDoohan \nand \nGardner. \nThe \nRothmans \nHonda \npair \nfound \nthe \nAmerican’s \nvictory \neuphoria \ntoo \nmuch \nto \nbear, \nso \nthey \ntook \nhim \naside \nand \ntold \nhim \nto \ncool \nit \nin \nthe \npost-race \npress \nconference. \n\n40 THE FAST STUFF \nKocinski has  had to  get  used to  ruffling feathers since he  made his \nfirst appearance on  the  GP  circuit in  1988. Then just 20  years old  he \nturned up at  Suzuka and battled bravely for the lead with 250 stalwarts \nSito Pons, Toni Mang and Jacques Cornu. From that initiation Kocinski \nhas  shown fear for no  one. \nTwo years later he was a  GP  full-timer, destroying the  cosy world of \n250 grands prix as  he  whipped Europe’s best on  what was usually a \nbelow-par motorcycle. The 1990 season firmly established the  Kocinski \nenigma. The Midwest American, who at  17  left his \nparents back home in cotton-picking Arkansas to live \n‘I don’t ever give up close to  Roberts in  California, was like none of his \n—  Ill be sliding that rivals. He  seemed a  bit  of a  recluse but maybe this \ncocksucker like was natural for  an  all-American boy, living in  a \nyou've never seen’ strange land for the  first time. \nHis rivals mistook his  self-imposed isolation for \nsnobbishness, but  Kocinski simply preferred to  keep \nhimself to himself. ‘I just don’t rap with them,’ he said at the  time. ‘I’m \nnot  gonna say why. It’s  private and no  one  knows except me.  The people \nwho know me, know me, and the  people who don’t, don’t.’ \nWhen Kocinski wasn’t in his  motorhome (the same model as  1987 \n500 champ Wayne Gardner’s but a  crucial few centimetres longer) he \nwas either firing shots at  the  opposition or  getting fired at himself. The \nverbal warfare raged this way and that like a gangland shootout. \nHis  250  Honda rival, Helmut Bradl: ‘Kocinski has  a brain the  size  of a \npea...’ Kocinski: ‘If you ain’t American you ain’t shit...’ Another of his \nHonda rivals, Carlos Cardus: ‘The only thing educated about Kocinski is \nhis asshole...’ Kocinski: ‘Honda riders are  a bunch of crybabies...’ \nOf course, Kocinski got  the  last  laugh when he won the  title. And he \ncouldn’t resist getting in the  final word: ‘Bradl said I had a brain the  size \nof a pea. I think that’s funny. But  I kicked his  ass  every week —  I mean I \nreally laugh. Maybe it’d  be a different story if he was beating me.’ \nIn  1991 the  tone changed when Kocinski graduated to  500s with Team \nRoberts. He was no  longer the new boy in town, he’d learned the ways of \nthe continental circus and now he was racing against the men he'd always \nwanted to  race against. The 250 world title had just been a  minor \ndiversion. \nBut  the first half of his debut 500  season suggested that ambition may \nfinally have got  the  better of him. He  crashed out  of three races as  he \n\nJK: YOUNG GOD OR  DARK STAR? 4) \ntried \nto \nride \nhis \nYZR500 \nfaster \nthan \nit \nwanted \nto \ngo. \n‘I \ncan’t \neven \nget \nclose \nto the \nspeed \nI \nwant \nthrough \nthe \ncorners,’ \nhe \nsaid \nmidseason. \n‘Try and \nride \nit \nfast \nand \nit \ngoes \nYEEEAAKKK \n-— \nright \nout \ninto \nthe \nsand \ntrap.’ \nBut though he whinges and moans when things aren’t going right, \nit’s only because he wants perfection so  he can  do his  best. And if he’s \nhard on  others, he’s even harder on  himself. \nLater in 1991 Kocinski began to get what he needed from his motorcycle \nand he  was transformed —  once again the  excitable kid  with the  cute \nsmile. ‘My team think I’m going fast around that first corner,’ he grinned \nat  Donington. ‘Man, I could ride my bicycle faster around that corner.’ \nAs  his  confidence grew on  the  500, the  talk got  taller. ‘I don’t ever \ngive up.  I'll be sliding that cocksucker like you've never seen, but to ride \nas  fast as  I want to ride it’s  going to take a mean motherfucker to hang \non  to  that thing for a full  race.’ \nKocinski has always been a  man of  extremes. His motorhome is \nundoubtedly the cleanest in the paddock because Kocinski suffers from \nOCD. Ask Wayne Rainey where his  team-mate is and the  champ jokes: \n‘Try down at  the  dry cleaners!’ \nYou will never see  Kocinski line up on  the  grid blemished by a single \nmicrodot of dirt. He  spends hours meticulously cleaning his riding gear, \nfolding his  T-shirts with miraculous precision, picking the  lint out  of \nhis  socks, fussing over his kit like a street-riding kid bursting with pride \nover his  first-ever set  of leathers. \nIt’s  the  same back home on  King Kenny’s ranch —  his  motocrosser is \nalways spotless —  so  Roberts and Rainey never miss an  opportunity to \nbury the  kid  in dirt when they’re off-road training together. Kocinski’s \nschooling with Roberts was never easy. The triple world champion \ngave Little John a  hard time, all  the  time —  a  tough upbringing for  a \ntough world. \nLike many youngsters, his  conversation is  liberally scattered with \nexpletives \nand \nlike \nany \ntwentysomething, \nprimed \nwith \ntestosterone \nand \nready \nto \ngo, \nKocinski \nloves \ntalking \nabout \ngirls. \nHe \nlikes \ntalking \nto \nthem \ntoo \n— \na \npretty \nfemale \nwalking \nthrough \nthe \npaddock \nis \nabout \nthe \nonly \nthing \nthat'll \ndistract \nhim \nfrom \nhis \nwork. \nShame \nthat \nhis \nchat-up \nlines are  like  car  crashes. \nIn  \nsome \nways \nthe \nkid \nis  \njust \nmisunderstood, \nand \nhis  \nconstant \ncompanion, \nsports \npsychiatrist \nEd  \nConboy \n(that’s \ngot \nto  \nbe  \na  \njoke \nshrink’s \nname, \nsurely?) \nwould \nagree. \nConboy \nwas \nsigned \nup \nby \nRoberts \n\n42 THE FAST STUFF \nto transform Kocinski from volatile genius into a full-time GP-winning \nmachine. But the  long-term therapy session ended when Conboy fell \nout with the team’s physio Dean Miller [see Zen and the Heart of Motorcycle \nRacing, page 214]. \nGet  Kocinski on  a good day and he’ll chat and joke for ages. Get  him \non  a  bad day and he  won’t even know you. The unlucky people who \nmeet him at  the  wrong moment will go  away convinced he’s arrogant \nand pigheaded. And they wouldn’t be totally wrong. \nThere’s no  doubt Kocinski has a  few issues but what really screws \nhim up —  and this is the  case with a  fair  number of racers —  is his  total \nand utter commitment to  being the  fastest racer on  earth. He  allows \nnothing to  get in the  way of his  lofty ambitions, so  if you try chatting \nto  him while gear ratios and steering geometry are occupying his \nthoughts, bad  luck, dude. \nLife is never dull when JK   is around —  either in  the  paddock or  out \non  the  racetrack —  because he  doesn’t give a  toss how many people he \nrankles. In  little more than two seasons Kocinski has generated more \ncolumn inches than most riders do  in  half their careers. Now he  is \npoised to  achieve the  success he’s dreamed of ever since his  hero King \nKenny was 500 world champion. And like always, Kocinski’s not  taking \nprisoners. As  he says: ‘I ain’t afraid of nobody.’ \nEpilogue: Kocinski and Roberts split at  the  end of  1992. King didn’t \nneed him, thinking he still had  a good few seasons left in Wayne Rainey. \nAfter that JK couldn’t even get a job with another 500  team and ended \nup joining Suzuki’s 250  outfit which sacked him halfway through ’93 \nfor  deliberately over-revving his  RGV. So  Cagiva snapped him up,  the \nItalians lavishing love and attention on  the  kid, who won two GPs on \nthe  blood-red V4s. When the  Cagiva team folded at  the  end of 1994 JK \ntook a  year out, then came back in World Superbikes, first for  Ducati, \nthen Castrol Honda, with whom he  won the title in  1997. After a \ntroubled return to  500s in  1998 and 1999 he faded into retirement. Last \ntime I saw  him he was  testing Yamaha’s M1  four-stroke in 2001, boasting \nabout \nhis \nhand-crafted \nBentley \nAzure \nMulliner. \nAt \n£170,000, \nit \nsounds \nlike \nJK \nis \nstill \nhaving \nthe \nlast \nlaugh. \nHope \nhe’s \nfound \nhappiness. \n\nCHAPTER 7 \nWAYNE AND KEVIN: ‘THERE’S A \nBIG EGO THING BETWEEN US’ \nJuly 1993 \nThe Rainey versus Schwantz rivalry was bubbling towards \nboiling point when the pair sat down to discuss their astonishing \ncareer-long rivalry in  the summer of 2003, just months before \nRainey’s career-ending accident \nThey’ve been at  it for  over six  years now. From Daytona’s ‘salad bowl’ \nbanking all  the  way to  Donington’s lawn-edged curves, Wayne Rainey \nand Kevin Schwantz have duked it out, no  quarter asked, and never \nany given. \nBetween them the Californian and  the Texan have dominated the GP \nscene since the  late 1980s, winning more races than everyone else put \ntogether, stealing the  headlines and entertaining millions with some \nunforgettable do-or-die battles. So  far  they have won 23  500  GPs each. \nRainey has come through it  with the most world championships, \ntaking three crowns on  the trot  and earning the nickname ‘Mr  Perfect’ for \nhis  unerringly consistent displays of  controlled aggression. Meanwhile \nSchwantz has  been the  crowd pleaser, building an  unenviable reputation \nas  a win-or-crash merchant. But  he’s lived and  learned. \nThe real beginnings of their rivalry go back to  Daytona, March 1987, \nthe start of a  season-long fight for  the  US  Superbike title. The results \nread like a  trailer for  their GP  contests —  Rainey won the crown, \nSchwantz won more races and twice fell  while leading. \nIn  those days Schwantz was the  mercurially talented up-and-comer, \nplucked from obscurity by Yoshimura Suzuki, while Rainey was  the deadly \nskilled, established star  with a US  Superbike title (with Kawasaki in  1983) \nand \na \nfull \n250 \nGP \nseason \n(with \nTeam \nRoberts \nin \n’84) \nalready \nbehind \nhim. \n‘T \ndidn’t \neven \nknow \nwho \nhe \nwas,’ \nsays \nRainey \nof \nthose \nearly \ndays. \n‘He \nhad \nthis \nbig \nthing \nto \nprove \n— \nto \nbeat \nWayne \nRainey, \nand \nI \nwasn’t \ngoing \nto \nlet \nthat \nhappen. \nWe \nwere \nlike \nkids \nwho \nhated \neach \nother \nat \nschool.’ \n\n44 THE FAST STUFF \nIronically their most vicious duels were acted out  when they were \nteam-mates. ‘It  was the  ’87  Transatlantic Match races, and we  were \npretty close to  knocking each other down a  few times,’ remembers \nSchwantz of  their Honda VFR versus Suzuki GSX-R brawls which \nastonished the  British crowds. ‘I  don’t think we’ve ever raced each \nother quite so  bad since.’ \nMost GP  spectators would disagree, for when the  pair were snapped \nup  for full-time 500  GP  duties in  1988 —  Schwantz by Pepsi Suzuki and \nRainey by  Team Roberts Yamaha —  they took their bitter rivalry \nworldwide. Since then they’ve bumped and barged their way around \nthe GP  circuits, dazzling fans with their skill, bravery and total trust for \neach other. Few other GP  racers have got  so  close, so  often, without \nending up  in a big heap. \n‘When we  first got to GPs the big thing was who could win a GP first, \nwho could be  the fastest. There was a  big ego thing between us,’ \nsays Schwantz, who went out and won the  opening race of  the  ’88 \nseason, riding the woefully underpowered Suzuki with a  recently \nbroken wrist. \n‘I was really pissed off about that, but  I beat him on  points that year,’ \ndeclares Rainey, who’s finished ahead of Schwantz in each of their five \nGP  seasons. ‘Kevin thought he  was going to  smoke us  after that first \nwin, but  I was more consistent. I guess I go about it a different way.’ \nConsistency indeed. Since that first GP  Schwantz has  crashed out  of \n1]  races. The super-aggressive but  always precisely controlled Rainey \nhas fallen down just three times, two of  those while chasing Mick \nDoohan’s exceptionally good big-bang Honda NSR in  1992. \n‘Kevin always used to  ride balls out  even if he didn’t have a  chance, \nhe’d be out  of the  saddle more,’ explains Rainey, who has  scored 24 per \ncent more points since they started GPs. ‘He'd hit  the  ground whereas \nI'd  ride for  a  position. I sometimes wondered if he  liked crashing. I \nknow I don’t.’ \nRainey hasn’t won any more GPs than his constant opponent but the \nsecret of  the  triple champ’s success is  going for  safe points when he \ncan’t win. ‘Fifth’s okay for  me, so  long as  he’s sixth! Kevin’s the  guy \nI’m \nalways \nlooking \nat \nbeating. \nWe \nkinda \ngauge \nourselves \noff \neach \nother. \nI hate getting beat by him more than anyone else.’ \nSchwantz \nhas  \nmanaged \na \nbest \nof \nsecond \noverall \nonly \nonce \n(in \n1990), \nbut \nthe \nbig \nzero \non \nhis world \ntitle \nscore \nisn’t \nall his \nown \nfault. \n\nWAYNE AND KEVIN: ‘THERE’S A BIG  EGO THING BETWEEN US’ 45 \n‘Wayne is just consistent,’ he  says. ‘A  lot  of that is himself, but  he \ngets a  lot  of  it  from his  team —  he’s always had a real strong team \nbehind him. In the past I’ve  had a bike that works good at three or  four \ntracks. The Suzuki always used to  be  on  the  edge, you had to  ride it \nrisky if you  wanted to win.’ \nAs well as  their different approaches to winning titles, Rainey (who’s \nthree years Schwantz’s senior at  32)  believes there’s a  big contrast in \ntheir riding styles. \n‘Kevin is really, really good on  the  brakes. He’s got a lot of feeling for \nthe  tyre going into the  corners, but  that’s often why he falls down. I’m \neasier going in,  and I work harder mid-corner and on  the  exit. Some \ntracks his  style works best, other tracks it’s  mine. I guess it levels out. \nAbout the  only thing we  do the  same is the way we  get on the bikes.’ \nSchwantz puts it all down to  machinery: ‘The way you ride depends \na lot on  the bike you're on.  On the  Suzuki you  always had to ride it into \nturns, stop it, turn it and get  it out. That was the  only way to  ride it, \nand it’s  easy to jump off when you have to  ride that way.’ \nAll  that changed at  the  start of  1993. Suzuki have finally built an \nRGV500 that works everywhere, while Yamaha seem to  have taken a \ngiant step backwards. \n‘Kevin's on  the best bike this year,’ Rainey affirms. ‘We’ve beat Suzuki \nevery year since ’88, it  was only a  matter of  time \nbefore they got it  right. We always used to  have a \nbike which worked pretty well right from when you ‘We  both know you \nloaded it  out of  the truck. This year the Yamaha can  get hurt real bad \nchassis has been a  real struggle at  every racetrack, on  a  racetrack’ \nand we’re not  sure why. \n‘Kevin's grown up a lot  this year too. He’s thought \nabout what it takes to  win a  world championship. Sometimes it takes \nfinishing fifth to  be world champion, I realise that.’ \nAlthough \nRainey \nand \nSchwantz \nhave \nclashed \nevery \nyear \nsince \nthey \nstarted \nsharing \nGP \nstarting \ngrids, \nthey’ve \nonly \nonce \ngone \nhead \nto \nhead \nfor \nthe \n500 \ntitle. \nThat \nwas \nin \n1990 \nand \nit \nwas \nSchwantz’s \nAnnus \nHorribilis. \nHe \nchased \nRainey \nhard \nfor \nmuch \nof \nthe \nseason, \nthen \ncrashed \nout \nof \nthree \nof \nthe final \nfour \nGPs. \nThere \nwas \na \nlot \nof \ntension \nbetween \nthem \nthat \nyear. \nBut  \nboth \nare  \nolder \nand \nwiser \nnow. \n‘I’m \nnot \nsaying \nthat \nego \nthing \nis \ntotally \nout \nnowadays,’ \nsays \nSchwantz. \n‘But \nwe've \ngrown \nup \na \nbit. \nWe \nrealise \nthat \nwe’re \nboth \nat \n\n46 THE FAST STUFF \nthe  top of the  sport, and all that petty stuff between us when we  were \nracing Superbikes and stuff is well behind us  now. \n‘Sure we  may have a  problem, but  when we  do  we  iron it out. We \nsettle our  differences and race clean —  we  both know you can  get hurt \nreal bad on  a  racetrack. When we're off  the  track I’d  say  we’re good \nfriends now.’ \nRainey echoes Schwantz’s feelings of mutual respect and friendship: \n‘When you see  each other for  eight months of every year it would be \nhard work if we  hated each other. We’d probably end up  taking each \nother out. We  respect each other’s talents, we  know the  pressures and \nit’s  good we  can  get on  and have a beer after the race. ‘But when you’re \nracing for  the world championship it’s  hard to  be best buddies, but  if I \ncan’t win it, I’d like  Kevin to,  because he’s American.’ \nDespite the friendship, the rivalry for biking’s biggest gong has  taken \nits  toll this season. ‘It’s already getting a  bit  tense,’ says Schwantz. \n‘Normally when Wayne’s leading the championship, he’s easier to find. \nHe  keeps to himself more nowadays. I guess neither of us  likes losing.’ \nEpilogue: I wrote this story just before the 2003 British GP  where \nSchwantz was taken out  on  the  first lap by a  brakeless Mick Doohan, \nputting Rainey back in  title contention. Then Rainey won at  Brno to \ntake the  points lead. Everyone knows what happened next —  Rainey \nwas leading the Misano GP on  5 September when he crashed and broke \nhis back, paralysing him from the  chest down. And that was the  end of \none  of the  most enthralling rivalries ever witnessed by GP  fans. \n\nCHAPTER 8 \nHOW TO  RIDE A MOTORBIKE, \nBY  MIGHTY MICK \nAugust 1993 \nMick Doohan won five 500 world championships in  a  row and \nwas the towering talent of the mid-1990s, so  not a  bad guy to \nexplain the art  of  motorcycle riding. We did this interview in \nthe summer of 1993, a year after he broke his  right leg at Assen. \nThe leg was still mangled —  somewhat bent and very weak —  but \nhe  had just started winning GPs again. \nAs  usual, this interview was conducted in Mick’s motorhome, \nbetween morning and afternoon practice sessions, Mick sitting \nthere, eyes aflame, studying the morning time sheets, observing \nhis  rivals’ splits to  see  who was fast where, wearing nothing but \na pair of stubbies and eating his  usual ‘lunch of champions’, an \nunbuttered French stick and some fruit. Mate and then full- \ntime 500 rider Niall Mackenzie was in  on  this interview too, \nperhaps hopeful of picking up  a  few tips \nNo  one rides a motorcycle better than 500  GP magicians Wayne Rainey, \nKevin Schwantz and Mick Doohan. These guys ride sideways out of \n100mph turns, rear tyre spinning and smoking, like it’s  all  part of an \nordinary day’s work, which is exactly what it is for  them. \nWhen I first talked to  Doohan about his  riding style he  said ‘I don’t \nreally know what I’m doing,’ and that’s still the  way he  likes to  talk \nabout it.  There are  three possible reasons for  this: either he’s lying, or \nhe \ndoesn’t \nwant \nothers \nto \nlearn \nhis \nsecrets, \nor \nhe’s \njust \ngot \na \nsickening \namount \nof \nnatural \ntalent. \nOr \na \nbit \nof \nall \nthree. \nHere’s \nwhat \nhe \nsaid: \nHow to  brake \n‘When \nI \nstart \nbraking \nI \nsit  \nup  \npretty \nsharpish, \nwhich \nhelps \nweight \nthe \nfront \nend \nso \nI’ve \ngot \nmore \ngrip \nfor \nhard \nbraking \nwith \nthe \nfront \nbrake. \nWith \nslicks \nyou're \nnot \nreally \ngoing \nto \nlock \nthe \nfront, \nyou’re \nmore \nlikely \nto \n\n48 THE FAST STUFF \ngo over the ‘bars if you overdo it. That’s why I use  the rear brake, initially, \nand then getting into the turn, but not  in the mid-part of braking. At first \nit’s  to pull the rear end down to  squat the bike, so  it doesn’t stand on  its \nnose. As  I get into the  turn I use  the  rear some more so  the  bike’s not \nloaded up on  the  front, and that helps get you turned. \n‘Tf I’m  getting into a turn too  hot  I use  the  rear a lot more, just to  try \nand slow the  bike, or  maybe I just go  in  there sideways. I use  the  rear \nbrake coming out  of corners sometimes too. If it’s a real peaky point of a \ngear, like  a first-gear corner, I just stay on  the  rear brake to ride through \nit and keep the  front wheel on  the  deck, rather than shut the  throttle.’ \nHow to  get into a turn \n‘As  I go  into the  corner I release all  the  brakes —  not in  a  big  rush, \notherwise the suspension rebounds too  quick and goes kinda crazy. \nThen I crack the  throttle just a  touch, not  to  give it power, but just to \nget the  engine firing so  the bike doesn’t slow itself up too  much. That’s \njust before or  just on  the apex but well before I \naccelerate for  real. I do  it at  a  constant throttle, not \n‘If the front starts to even an  accelerating throttle, so it doesn’t break away \ngo I dig my  knee the  rear tyre when I really get  on  it.  I guess it also \ninto the  tarmac even takes a  bit  of weight off  the  front tyre mid-corner, \nharder’ which is good. \n‘I  dig  in  my  knee pretty heavily as  I go  into and \nthrough a  turn. When the  front tyre gives me  a good \nfeeling I really drive the knee into the ground. I wear out  scrapers pretty \nquick. It sounds funny, but  if the  front end’s not  feeling good then I’m \nnot  really scraping my  knee but  just skimming it across the  tarmac — \nI’m  not  getting the  feel to  really bend the  bike over. If the  front starts \nto  go  I  dig the knee in  even harder —  it’s  just a  reaction to  save \nsome bark [Aussie for  skin] but  maybe it takes a  bit  of weight off  the \ntyres too.’ \nHow to push the front \n‘It’s \nnot \nsomething \nI \ndo  \non  \nevery \ncorner \n—  \nit \ndepends \non  \nthe  \ncircuit. \nSome \nplaces, \nlike \nEastern \nCreek, \nI \npush \nthe \nfront \nquite \na  \nbit. \nA  \nlot \ndepends \non  \nthe \nfront \ntyre \ntoo. \nBack \nin  \n1991 \nI \nwas \nriding \nthe \nbike \nsideways \non \nthe \nfront, \nbut \nnow \nit’s \njust \nskimming \nacross \nthe \ntarmac, \nalmost \nlike \nundersteer, \nwithout \nthe \ntyre \nactually \ntucking \nunder. \nSome \n\nHOW \nTO  \nRIDE \nA \nMOTORBIKE, \nBY  \nMIGHTY \nMICK \n49 \nguys \njust \nstick \nit \nin  \nthere, \nget  \nto  \na  \npoint \nand \ndrop \nit \nin \nwithout \nreally \nturning, \nso  \nthey’re \nstill \ngoing \nstraight \nahead \nwith \nthe  \nbike \nleant \nover, \nbut \nscrubbing \noff \nspeed. \n‘You can do it more on  a four-stroke because you can  feel  a lot more. \nI guess 500s are a lot  lighter and more precise, so  everything’s a  lot \nmore sensitive. A four-stroke is like a sponge —  it just absorbs everything \nand you can get  away with it  a  lot  more. A  few years back on  the \nRVF750 endurance bike I used to  be  able to  lay black lines with the \nfront tyre mid-turn, and in 1991 I was leaving a lot of black marks with \nthe  500’s front tyre. But the  tyres are  a  lot  better now, and they don’t \nscrub so  much as  skim across the  tarmac. You don’t really get the  front \ntucking under either, because you can  feel  them losing grip before they \nreally tuck, so  you’ve got  time to  do  something about it.’ \nHow to  steer \n‘I guess you're using opposite lock to steer all the  time —  pushing on  the \nright ‘bar to  turn the ‘bars left and make the  bike go  right. But you \nnotice it more when you're changing direction. That’s how I bagged it \nat  Eastern Creek in  December ’92  when my  right leg was still pretty \nweak. I wasn’t using my  feet much to  steer the  bike, I was putting too \nmuch force through the  ’bars. You do a lot more steering with your feet \nthan you realise —  I reckon it’s  pretty much a 50/50 thing between your \nfeet and your hands.’ \nHow to  change direction \n‘In  real slow-speed changes of direction, like the  chicanes at  Suzuka \nand Assen, you probably use more feet than hands. At  Assen it’s  a \nright, left, right chicane, and after a  few laps doing that my  right foot \ngets tired. You’re on  the  ‘pegs a lot —  you can tell  because the  ‘pegs are \nalways making big holes in the  soles of your boots. If you just used the \nhandlebars you wouldn’t get  through a  chicane.’ \nNiall Mackenzie chips in here: ‘When I’m  riding on  the  road I just sit \non \nthe \nbike \nbecause \nI’m \nso \nscared! \nBut \nif \nI \nstart \nriding \nproperly \nI \nfeel \nten \ntimes \nsafer. \nIf \nyou're \njust \nflopping \nabout \nusing \na \nbit \nof \nbody \nweight, \nyou \ndon’t \nfeel \nanything. \nYou \nfeel \na \nlot \nbetter \nif \nyou \nbrake \nto \nweight \nthe \nfront \ntyre, \naccelerate \nto \nweight \nthe \nrear, \nand \nkeep \nweight \non \nthe \n‘pegs. \nYou've \ngot \nto \ngo \ninto \nevery \ncorner \nproperly: \nbrake \nto \nget \nthe \nfront \ndown \nand \nchange the  geometry, so  the  bike steers better.’ \n\n50 THE FAST STUFF \nHow to  slide \n‘Ym not  sure really. If it snaps out  quick the instant thing you do is shut \nthe  throttle down, but sometimes when it snaps out  quick it feels all \nright, so  you just keep feeding throttle into it and the  bike pulls itself \nstraight. Once the rpm goes past the power peak, it starts to tone off, so \nthe  back wheel stops spinning and pulls itself back in. \n‘When you're getting on  the  gas  —  just feeding it in —  I guess it’s just \nlike a dirt  bike. Once it starts sliding I don’t give it any more throttle. I \njust keep a  constant throttle with a  little opening, and wait until the \nrpm has gone into the  over-rev, then I click another gear so  the  tyre \ndoesn’t get  a  big  surge of horsepower halfway through the  slide. It’s \nthe  same thing with a  four-stroke —  I let  the  RVF over-rev a bit  and it \npulls itself straight again. \n‘Also, when you're sliding, say coming out  of a left, you put pressure \non  the  right footpegs and that gives you a lot  more feel and a lot more \ncontrol. It just feels out  of control if you don’t put  any force through \nthe  ‘pegs. \n‘Once the  tyre starts to  spin you don’t really keep the  bike leant over \nand keep gassing it.  You start to  pick the  bike up,  and, as  the  contact \npatch gets bigger, you’re accelerating harder so  it keeps spinning. \n‘If  I want it to  spin some more I move my  body weight forward to \ntake some weight off the rear tyre. In  some places it’s  quicker to  spin it \nup  and get  to  the  rpm where you can hook another gear, rather than \nshut the  throttle. Basically, a 500  will spin no  matter what gear you're \nin.  Like at  Phillip Island there’s a  fifth gear left, and as  soon as  you \nbend it over the  bike picks up  revs and starts to  step out  sideways. \n‘I even used to  slide my TZR250 when I was proddie racing, but  that \nwas just because the tyres weren't good enough. It  wasn’t a  power \nthing. It was just the  corner speed breaking the  tyres away, but  it was \nthe  same thing. I didn’t shut it down, I just kept it in there, and I guess \nkeeping \nit \nsliding \nis \nthe \nsame \nprinciple \non \na \nTZR250 \nas \nit \nis \non \nan \nNSR500.’ \n\nCHAPTER 9 \nTHE \nHYPOTHALAMUS \nPAPERS \n— \nTHE \nSCIENCE \nOF \nSPEED \nSeptember 1997 \nSpeed is  the biggest buzz in  biking and you’re probably only \nhere, reading this, because you love the stuff, same as  most \nracers. But what’s speed all  about —-  why do  we love it  and \nwhat does it  do  to  us? Time to  investigate the facts behind \nfrighteningly fast \nOkay, so you like going fast. But have you ever wondered why? Is it for the \nsensation of speed or  do  you love the  risk factor? And what makes you \ndifferent from people who hate going fast? How does speed affect your \nbrain, what biochemical reactions take place when you give it some? \nAlmost certainly, you go  fast for  the  buzz, wherever it  may come \nfrom. When you race down some strip of tarmac faster than you've ever \nbeen before, you get  the  buzz and your body undergoes an  amazing \ntransformation, heightening your mental awareness, increasing your \nphysical capabilities and minimising risk of  injury in  case you crash \nand burn. It’s  adrenalin city: your heart pumps, your mouth goes dry, \nyou're buzzing. You know the  feeling... \nAs  you wind open the throttle and tuck down behind the screen, \nyour body and brain need energy, so  you produce hormones to  convert \nfats and proteins to  sugar, and your liver releases extra sugar to  fuel \nyour muscles. Your metabolic rate increases in anticipation of expending \nenergy, as  do  your heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate. Your \nspleen releases extra red  blood cells to  help carry more oxygen, your \nmuscles tense, and inessential bodily functions, like digestion, are \nhalted \nto \nsave \nenergy. \nSaliva \nand \nmucus \ndry \nup, \nincreasing \nthe \nsize \nof \nthe  air passages to your lungs (hence the  dry mouth). \nThese \nfunctions \nhelp \nyou \nperform \nbetter, \nso  \nyou \ncan \nride \nfaster \nand \nmore \nsafely, \nbut  \nat  \nthe  \nsame \ntime \nyour \nbody \nprepares \nfor  \ndisaster: \nyou \nsecrete \nnatural \npainkillers \ncalled \nendorphins, \nconstrict \nyour \nblood \n\n52 THE FAST STUFF \nvessels to minimise bleeding, increase your blood’s clotting rate, while \nyour bone marrow produces more white blood corpuscles to  fight \ninfection in case you go down big style. \nAll  this happens because you're in a high-stress, high-risk situation. \nYour brain’s stress centre, the  hypothalamus, kicks in  to  control your \nfight-or-flight response. It’s  the  adrenalin thing —  the  hypothalamus \nlooks after your brain’s neuroendocrine systems (the adrenal-cortical \nand sympathetic nervous systems), which pump out the hormones \nepinephrine (adrenalin), norepinephrine (noradrenalin) and ACTH \n(the adrenocorticotrophic hormone) to trigger the  drastic physiological \nresponses already mentioned. \nIt  all  adds up  to  the  sensations that speed freaks know and love: \npounding heart, dry mouth and a state of hyper-consciousness. Some \nracers will be aware of a particularly acute form of this condition, which \nmoves you into a  state of apparent hyper-reality. Psychologists call it \n‘flow’, and some racers liken it to  meditation, or  moving into a  fourth \ndimension, where despite the world rushing past at  180mph, you feel a \nZen-like inner peace. \nI experienced this feeling a  few times in  my racing career: you're \ngoing faster than ever and your subconscious takes over, it’s like  you’re \ndriving without interference from your conscious self. The world seems \nto  shift into slow-mo, and things go  quiet, except your breathing rate \nhas  gone sky high and you  are  riding better than ever before, seemingly \ncorrecting mistakes before you’ve even made them. Five-time 500 world \nchamp Mick Doohan knows the  feeling: ‘Riding fast is  a subconscious \nthing —  you go quickest, you’re most in control and least likely to make \nmistakes when you don’t have to  think about anything.’ \nThis is the biggest high that a racer or  speed freak can  ever have: it’s  a \ntranscendental moment. But  it can  just as  well go  the  other way. Your \nbrain can  reach overload if you become over-aroused —  too  excited, too \nangry or  too  scared. Instead of that state of hyper-reality, you just get \nhyper, your brain absorbs too much information and you end up thinking \nand reacting more slowly. It’s  like  an  adrenalin OD. As  a racer you have \nto  learn to  control your adrenal flow. When I started racing I used to \nalmost puke on  the  grid, and a  friend of mine sometimes used to  wet \nhimself waiting for  the  green light. You see, it’s  a myth that racers have \nto psych themselves up  for a race. If anything it’s  the  other way around, \nthey work to  calm themselves down.

Then there’s the  perceptual thing —  if you \nfocus on  the  periphery the  world’s whizzing past in \nthe  opposite direction at  a very high rate. ‘The risk doesn’t \n‘People learn to  love speed —  they don’t ride a bike appeal to me  now, \nfor  the  first time and do  140mph, they do  50,  then but years back I \n80,  then the magical ton.

Man is  a  naturally curious animal; some cheating injury on \nof us  love to  do  things we’ve never tried before, go the  road or  the \nwhere we  don’t know what’s going to  happen.’ track’ \nThe element of risk is part of the  rush and is also \nattractive to  many people —  the  theory goes that we \nlike to  get  close to  death because it  makes us  feel so  alive. And the \nquality of a  life  lived at  the  extreme is more important to  some than a \nlonger lifespan. Multiple British champ Niall Mackenzie admits that he \nused to  enjoy crashing! \n‘The risk doesn’t appeal to  me  now, but years back I liked crashing \nand cheating injury on  the  road or  the  track,’ he  says. \nGenerally, racers won’t admit a  conscious attraction to  risk. They \nmay acknowledge risk but they put it  to  one side, having convinced \nthemselves that they won’t suffer death or  some appalling injury: ‘It \nwon't happen to  me’. What they really like is  controlling the  risk — \nriding fast, right on  the  edge, knowing that their own skill is keeping \nthem on  the  brink. In  such a  situation they are  in control of their own \ndestiny, close to  death, but  not  too  close. \nOf \ncourse, \nnot \neveryone \ngets \noff  \non  \nthe  \nspeed \nbuzz \n—  \nmost \nhumans \nseek \npleasure \nand \nwant \nto  \navoid \npain. \nThey \nmay \nenjoy \nsitting \nin  \nfront \nof \nthe \ntelly \nwatching \nracers \ndo \ntheir \nstuff, \nbut \nno \nway \nwould \nthey \nwant \nto \nget \nout \nthere \nand \ndo \n180mph. \nSome \npeople \ncrave \nspeed \nand \n\n54 THE FAST STUFF \ndanger more than others, just as  some people enjoy skydiving, nicking \ncars, popping pills or  even the  thrill of unprotected casual sex. They all \ngive off  some kind of a  buzz, and they all  have that element of risk \nabout them. \nBy  the same token, many so-called fearless racers are  worried by \nstuff that wouldn’t worry most people: WSB champ Carl Fogarty is \nscared of water, three-time 500 king Wayne Rainey has vertigo and \nMackenzie is claustrophobic. \nThe  question is why do some people crave speed and excitement more \nthan others? Like everything else, it’s part nature, part nurture —  the mix \nof your genetic make-up and how you were brought up.  A lot  of racers \ncome from racing families and were brought up surrounded by bikes and \nspeed —  your dad  does it, so  you  end up doing it, that’s nurture. \n‘Everyone has a  different pathway to  this kind of  thing,’ adds Cox. \n‘Maybe you  get into speed from some experience in your youth —  you may \nhave seen a bike going fast  on  the  road, or  even on  TV, or  you were taken \nto a racetrack and you fell in love with the noise, the  speed, the smell.’ \nThen there’s the  nature aspect: the genetic configuration of  your \nbrain and its neural circuitry. The reticular system is another area of the \nbrain that plays a  major role in  controlling your state of arousal, and \nresearch shows that some people’s reticular systems demand more \nexcitement than others —  making the  difference between thrill-seekers \nand couch potatoes, extroverts and introverts. \nMackenzie obviously isn’t aware of  how his reticular system is \nconfigured, so  he  sees it  more simply. ‘You either like speed or  you \ndon’t,’ he  says. ‘You're either into going as  fast as  possible or you’re not \ninterested at  all.’ \nLike most adrenalin junkies, Mackenzie remembers loving speed \nfrom his  earliest years —  his  surroundings nurtured a desire for  speed. \n‘T lived in this village on a hill and I used to  go down that hill  as  fast as \nI could. I got  so  many bloody noses from crashing at  the  bottom —  my \nRaleigh Chopper wasn’t built for speed, it always got out  of control. I’ve \ngot so  many memories of  mates pushing the bike home, with me \nstaggering behind them. The fact that I kept doing it means I must’ve \nliked it.’ \nI still remember pedalling like crazy down hills when I was a kid. It \nwas the biggest thrill, more exciting than anything else I could do. And, \nlike Mackenzie, that lust for  speed got me  into bikes. Back in my  own \n\nTHE HYPOTHALAMUS PAPERS —  THE SCIENCE OF  SPEED 55 \nhoodlum \ndays, \nI \nused \nto \nlove \nbusting \nspeed \nlimits. \nI’d \nbe \nwell \npleased \nif \nI \ncould \ntreble \na  \n30mph \nspeed \nlimit: \nwow, \n90mph \npast \nthe  \npost \noffice. \nMoron, \nI know, \nbut \nit \nall \nmade \nperfect \nsense \nat \nthe \ntime, \nit \nwas \na \nbig \nmacho \nthing: \nthe thrill, \nthe \nrisk, \nthe \nego \ntrip, \nthe \nrebellion. \nMackenzie \nsays: \n‘You \ndo it because \nyou're \nnot \nsupposed \nto. When \nI was \nyoung \nall \nI \nwanted \nto \ndo \nwas \n100mph. \nIt \nwas \na \nmagical \nfigure \nback \nthen, \nnot \nmany \ncars \nor \nbikes \nwould \ndo \nthe \nton.’ \nHowever, racers see  speed very differently from your average speed \nfreak. Their childhood love of speed in its  own right is overtaken by the \ncompetition. The speed is  no  longer the  buzz per  se,  it’s  beating other \nguys by being faster and crazier than they are. Mackenzie again: ‘Once \nyou've done 100  or  150  a few times it’s no  big deal. Going down that hill \non  my Chopper was a big thrill, the wind in my face and all that, but  the \nbig thing became beating my mates, that’s why I wanted the  speed.’ \nRacers are  barely aware of the  sensation of speed. Ask a racer how it \nfeels to  do  190mph and he'll just shrug his  shoulders: the straights \nare  the  easy part, they’re not thinking about riding in a straight line, \nthey’re thinking about the next few corners, that’s the fun part. Michael \nSchumacher reckons that ‘straights are  boring’ in  an  FI  car, but of \ncourse it’s  slightly different on  a  GP  bike, you’re nudging the  double \nton, head and shoulders stuffed under the screen, fingers delicately \ngripping the  handlebars, hoping the  bike doesn’t break into a  terminal \nspeed wobble. I’ve done it on  Doohan’s Honda NSR500 and it is kinda \nscary, but you’re so  focused on  the next corner that you don’t have time \nto  savour the sensation. The scenery doesn’t even dissolve into a  blur, \nbecause you're looking dead ahead, not  to  the  side. It’s  just hellishly \nnoisy, and pretty uncomfortable. \nI once asked Rainey what's the fastest he’s ever been. ‘Three hundred \nand twenty three kays at Fukuroi,’ he said. (That’s 201mph at Yamaha’s \nmain Japanese test track.) So,  how did  that feel? ‘It  felt  like it needed \nanother \ntooth \noff \nthe \nrear \nsprocket,’ \nhe \nreplied. \nThe \nspeed \nitself \nmeant \ndiddly \nsquat, \nhis \nonly \nconcern \nwas \nthe \ngearing. \nNot \na \nhint \nof \na \nbuzz \nand \ncertainly \nno \nfear. \n‘It \ndoesn’t \nmatter \nif \nyou’re \ndoing \n150 \nor \n205,’ \nRainey \nadds. ‘You don’t feel  the  sensation.’ \nThere’s \nalso  \nanecdotal \nevidence \nthat \nit \nisn’t \nthe \nactual \nmiles \nper  \nhour \nthat \nare \nthe \nbuzz, \nbut \nthe \neffort \nrequired \nand \nthe \nactual \nsensation \n— \nI \nget \nmore \nof \na \nspeed \nthrill \nriding \nmy \nlittle \nTyphoon \nscooter \nat \n60mph \nthan \nriding \na \nSuper \nBlackbird \nat \nthe \nsame \nspeed. \n\n56 THE FAST STUFF \nSo,  is speed an  irrelevance, something that doesn’t matter nearly as \nmuch as  we  think it does? Just a cheap adrenalin fix, a manifestation \nof man’s inability to  leave anything alone, of his  desire always to  go \nbigger, better, faster, higher, deeper, louder? Or  am  I asking too  many \nquestions, rather than just getting on with it and having a blast? Maybe. \nThere’s just one thought I can’t get out  of my  mind, that suggests the \nwhole miles per  hour deal is indeed a  big joke: the  world motorcycle \nspeed record is held by a Harley. Work that one out... \nMotoGP Mutterings: November 1998 \nCrash, bang, ha ha ha!

This kind of stuff sounds even more scary in real Italian \n—  this is Nobby Ueda going to hospital in France: ‘Frattura omero dx. con \nparalisi del nervo radiale, operato dal Dottore Prost’. \nThe stats are  top stuff: during 1998 a  total of  132 riders fell  486 \ntimes, making for an  average of 34.7 crashes per  GP  1.6  per  cent up on \n1997. Put  it another way and every rider crashed an  average of 6 times, \nthe  second worst year on  record (in ’94,  riders crashed a mere 5.1  times \neach). \nKing crasher of  98  was Japanese 125 loon Youichi Ui,  the man \nwith the shortest name in  GP  racing. He  fell 13  times during the \n14-race season, just beating 250 kamikaze Yasumasa Hatakayama by \none tumble. \nThe most crashed-at GP  was Germany’s new Sachsenring (51  falls), \nfollowed closely by Donington (on 48). This fulfils a well-known racing \naxiom, ‘the safer the  circuit, the  more the  crashes’. The Sachsenring is \nslow and safe, and Donington’s gravel run-offs and neatly clipped \nlawns look so  inviting it seems churlish not  to  give them a go. \nThe \nmost \ncrashed-at \ncorner \nin \nGP \nracing \nis \nthe \nlast \nleft \nbefore \nthe \npits \nat  \nRicard \nin  \nFrance \n(17  \ntumbles), \nfollowed \nby \nTurn \nOne \nat  \nJerez \n(14), \nthen \nthe \nchicane \nat \nJohor, \nvenue \nfor \nlast \nyear’s \nMalaysian \nGP \nand \nDegner \nCurve \nat \nSuzuka \n(both \non \n13), \nthen \nthe \nexit \nof \nthe \nDonington’s \nMelbourne \nhairpin \n(12) \n— \nhighside \ncentral \n— \nand \na \ngood \nplace \nto \nwatch \nthe British \nGP \nif \nyou’re \na \nreal \nsicko. \nThe \nfigures \nalso \nshow \nus  \nthat \nthe  \nmost \ncrashed-on \nday \nis  \nSunday, \nwhich \njust \ngoes \nto \nshow \nthat \nGP \nriders \nhaven’t \nlearned \nthat \nold \nracing \nmaxim: \n‘Always \nget \nyour \ncrashing \ndone \nin \npractice’. \nThe \nmost \ndangerous \npractice \nsession \nis \nSaturday \nafternoon’s \nfinal \nqualifier \n— \nno \nsurprise \nthere \nsince \nthis \nis \nthe \nmoment \nwhen \nevery \nrider \nhas \nto \nlay \nit \non \nthe \nline \nto \nproduce \nhis \nfastest-possible \nlap \nto \nget \na \ngood \ngrid \nposition. \nAs  \nwell \nas  \ntelling \nus  \nhow \nmany \nriders \ncrashed \nin  \n1998, \nFalls \n’98  \nalso \ntells \nus  \nhow \nmany \ndidn’t \ncrash: \nprecisely \nzero, \nwhich \njust \ngoes \nto  \nshow \nhow \nhard \nthese \nbastards \nare \ntrying. \n\n58 THE FAST STUFF \nOf \ncourse, \nthere \nis  \na  \nreal \npurpose \nto  \nthis \nblood-soaked \ndocument. \nSerious \nanalysis \nof \nall \nthis \ndata \nwill \nhelp \nmake \nGP \nracing \neven \nsafer. \nFor \nexample, \nthe \nRicard \ncorner \nthat \nclaimed \nmore \nvictims \nthan \nany \nother \nis \none \nof \nthe \ncircuit’s \nfew \nleft-handers, \nso \nriders \narrive \nthere \nwith \nthe \nleft \nside \nof \ntheir \ntyres \ntoo \ncool. \nArmed \nwith \nhard \nfacts \nof \nlife \nlike \nthis, \nGP \nbosses \nmight \nstand \na \nbetter \nchance \nof \npersuading \ntrack \nbosses \nto \nspend \nsome \ncash \non \na \ncircuit \nredesign. \nOnly \none \nbad \nthing \nabout \nthe \nbook \n—  \nit’s  \nnot  \nin \nthe  \nshops, \nso  \nreaders \nwho \nenjoy \na \nbit \nof \nschadenfreude \nwill \nhave \nto \nstick \nto \nEastEnders... \nMotoGP Mutterings: December 1998 \nBike racing is meant to  be  fun, so  why’s everyone getting more \nserious and boring? \nWhy are  modern-day sportsmen so  boring? No,  let’s narrow the  focus: \nwhy are  modern GP  racers so  boring? Compare your Crivillés and \nSchumachers with your Mike Hailwoods and James Hunts and you’re \ntalking a breed apart. \nMaybe they're not  exactly boring, but they’re hardly a bundle of laughs. \nIn  TV  interviews they stare at  the  camera, mouthing weary platitudes \nbecause their minds are  fixed on  some hi-tech conundrum: data-logging \ngraphs, high-speed rebound damping and transient engine behaviour. \nBack in the  good old  days, GP  racers were fast-living, up-for-a-laugh \ndaredevils, apparently able to win races with inspired, risk-taking heroics. \nBack then racing was an  art  and racers behaved accordingly: out  on  the \npiss, sniffing and snorting their way through ranks of glamorous shags. \nSadly, it ain’t like that any more. Racing at  500 GP  level is a  science \nand racers are  the  front-line laboratory troops, they just wear leathers \ninstead of  white lab  coats. Talk to  Doohan of  racing concepts like \nbravery, risk-taking and heroics, and he  stares at  you like you're nuts. \nIt’s  not about that any more, nowadays racing is  a  cold and precise \nscience —  a  giant, globally televised physics experiment. Sure, racers \nneed balls just as  much as  they ever did, but only as  much as  they need \nto understand computer data-logging, kinetic traction or  the intricacies \nof transient engine behaviour. \nHailwood was happily technophobic. Someone like Mick Doohan \nain’t no  rocket scientist, but  he can  talk deep technical concepts. \n\nBIKE RACING IS  MEANT TO  BE  FUN 59 \nThere is  a  parallel here with the  USAF’s jet-fighter test pilots, as \ndescribed in  Hunter S.  Thompson’s book The  Great Shark Hunt. The \ngun-totin’ acid casualty author talks of how a  few decades back the \nUSAF developed ‘a  computerized version of  the legendary, hell-for- \nleather test pilot’, banishing the  old  ‘kick the  tyre, light the  fire  and \naway we  go’  heroes of old. He  goes on:  ‘the best pilot in  the  world — \neven if he could land a B-52 on  the number eight green at Pebble Beach \nwithout taking a divot —  would be useless on a test-flight project unless \nhe  could explain, in  a  written report, just how and why the  landing \ncould be made’. \nIt’s  the  same with modern GP  aces —  500s are  so  hi-tech that riders \nmust describe machine behaviour in  acute detail, then check it  and \ncross-check it with their technicians and computer read-outs. \nThere’s another link between old  fliers and GP  racers. Thompson \ndescribes how test pilots used to  get  their kicks in  the  Mojave desert: \n‘Back in the  good old  days, when men were men and might was right \nand the  devil took the  hindmost, the  peaceful desert highways were \nraceways for off-duty pilots on  big motorcycles. Slow-moving travellers \nwere frequently blown off  the  road by wildmen in leather jackets and \nwhite scarves, human torpedoes defying all  speed \nlimits and heedless of their own safety.’ \nNot any more: when he  revisited this base in  69, ‘The survivors \nhe \nfound \nthe \nUSAF \nappalled \nat \nthe \nidea \nof \nanything \npushed \non, \ntreating \nas \nfun \nand \nas \ndangerous \nas \na \nmotorcycle. \n‘Today’s \ndeath \nlike \na \npilots \ngo \nto \nbed \nearly, \nand \nregard \nbig \nmotorcycles \nchurlish, \nharping \nwith \nthe \nsame \nanalytical \ndisdain \nthey \nhave \nfor \ncreditor, \ntoasting \nhippies, \nwinos \nand \nother \nfailure \nsymbols. \nThey \ntake \ntheir \nown \nlegend \ntheir \nrisks, \non \nassignment, \nbetween \ndawn \nand \nwith \nwild \nparties \nto \n4.30pm.’ \nSo \nthe \nbig \nbrass \nweren’t \nimpressed \nwhen \nhe \nward \noff \nthe \nchill’ \nrolled up and shook hands with his left  hand because \nhe’d broken the  other in  some crazy bike crash. \nOf \ncourse, \nthere \nis \nanother \nreason \nfor  \nyour \nmodern-day \nGP  \nracer \nto \nget \nall \nserious \nand \nscientific: \nmoney. \nModern \n500 \nGP \nracers \nget \npaid \nbig \nmoney, \nwith \nenough \nnoughts \nto \ncommand \nanyone’s \ntotal \ncommitment. \nIf \nyou \nwere \non \nfive \nmill \na \nyear, \nyou’d \nstop \npartying \nand \nbecome \nboring \nfor \na while, \nwouldn’t \nya? \nYou \nmay \nwonder \nwhy \nI’ve  \nonly \nmentioned \n500s \nso  \nfar, \nand \nnot  \nFoggy \nand \nSuperbikes. \nWell, \nWSB \nhas \nstill \ngot \nthat \nol’ \nbarnstorming \nthang \n\n60 THE FAST STUFF \nabout it —  those heavy, wobbly streetbikes can  still be made to do things \nthey don’t want to with some seriously inspired heroics. And the  stakes \naren’t so  high —  hundreds of  thousands, not millions. The Supers \npaddock is old  skool too  —  there’s still riders staying up  late larging it, \nshagging other riders’ girlfriends, getting into punch-ups and trashing \nhotel rooms. Which is  great. It’s  just that 500s are  that much more \nserious —  too  many computer screens to  stare at,  too  much money and \nthe  meanest sonofabitch motorcycles that don’t take any shit from \nanyone. \nFinally, there is one  other reason why Mr  1990s Racer man takes his \ngame seriously (regardless of what bike he’s racing), and that’s DEATH. \nThose old-time racers may have partied non-stop, but  they spent way \ntoo  much time at  the  funerals of mates who’d broken themselves in \nhalf on  a  trackside telegraph pole. Just like their soul brothers in  the \n1950s USAF: ‘the survivors pushed on,  treating death like a  churlish, \nharping creditor, toasting their own legend with beakers of  gin and \nwild parties to ward off the chill. Live fast, die young, and make a good- \nlooking corpse.’ The list  of racing casualties is too  long and illustrious \nfor any modern racer to want to  add his  own name at  the  bottom. \n\nCHAPTER 10 \n‘I'VE CRASHED BIKES AT \n300MPH ...  TWICE’ \nApril 1999 \nFor several decades Californian Don Vesco was motorcycling’s \nking of speed, roaring across the Bonneville Salt Flats in  Utah, \nbreaking speed records on both two and four wheels. I \ninterviewed him in  the spring of  1999, three years before he \ndied of  prostate cancer at  the age of  63.  At  the time he  was \nworking on  his  Turbinator streamliner, designed to  be the first \nwheel-driven vehicle to  crack 500mph. Nutter! \nDon Vesco was the  first man to  do 300mph on  two wheels and he held \nthe bike land-speed record for  12  years from 1978 at  318.598mph, \nrunning a  streamliner powered by two turbocharged Z1000 motors on \nthe Bonneville Salt Flats. Before that he had used two  TZ750 two-stroke \nrace engines. \nIn  1990, fellow American Dave Campos broke Vesco’s record by a few \nmph, touching 322.87mph in  a  seven-metre streamliner powered by \ntwo Harley-Davidson motors (I kid ye not! ), but Vesco is now considering \na  new attempt in  a  streamliner powered by two supercharged Vincent \nengines. A  famed tuner, Vesco builds most of  his  own machines. He \nalso roadraced successfully in his  younger years. \nHow does it feel to go 300mph-plus on  a bike? \nI'd probably compare it to  being in a jet-liner on  the  runway, just before \ntake-off. The acceleration isn’t amazing, speed-record bikes don’t \naccelerate that hard, though my  car  goes pretty rapidly after 140mph, \nwhen it takes around 20  seconds to  reach 470mph. \nWith the  bikes it probably takes a  minute and a  half to  do a  six-mile \nrun, \nbut \nyou \ncover \nthe \nlast \nmile \nin \nabout \nten \nseconds. \nThey've \ngot \nthese \nmarkers \nthat \nare \none \nmile \napart \n— \nyou \ncan \ndo \nsix \nso \nfast \nyou \ndon’t \neven \nrealise \nyou're \nthere. \nWhere \nI \nreally \nsee \nthe \nspeed \nis \nwith \nthis \nblack \nline \n\n62 THE FAST STUFF \nthey put down to  guide you. The line is  straight, but where you’re \ngoing fast it gets wiggly. When the  speed picks up it seems to get darker \ntoo, but maybe that’s because you're concentrating \nso  hard. \n‘You cover the last You don’t get  a lot of vibration because the  track’s \nmile in about ten smooth. And the  engine noise tends to  get  carried \nseconds’ away. A lot  of the  time you don’t hear nothin’, but \nonly because you’re not  paying attention. \nAnd what's the fastest you've been? \nAbout 437 on  four wheels, 333 on  two. I did  it twice with my  twin- \nengine Kawasaki in  1978. I was just messing around. I ran 330 and \nthen 333, but I didn’t back them up  because I figured the  record was \npretty safe. [Official records must be two-way. ] \nWhat's the fastest you've crashed? \nAbout 350mph. That was with a bike made into a car —  it had four wheels \nat  the  back and one at  the  front and I got a flat. I saw it coming, but  I \nprobably knew it was going to happen for only 100th of a second. There’s \nnothing you can do, you just hang on.  I broke a collarbone one time. \nI’ve crashed bikes a  couple of  times at  300mph, but I  got the \nparachutes out  before I hit  the  ground, so  they took care of everything. \nOne time I did  crash sideways and, wow, that’s not  good because the \nthing can  pencil roll. \nApart from flat tyres, what makes you  crash? \nIf you get a crosswind, it tries to  tip you over like a boat, but  you don’t \nhave a keel. You try to  correct it by steering, but  if the wind is bad and \nyou run out  of lock, you’re gone. \nWhy do you  like speed so  much? \nIt’s  a  kind of thrill, I guess. I just feel the  desire to  do  it;  I certainly \ndon’t like  the risk part of it. I like  beating people; I like  the competition. \nIt’s  the  ego  thing and the  adrenalin rush. \nHow come you're still breaking records at 60? \nI never grew up,  I guess. If I’d  baled out  for  a  few years I wouldn’t be \nup with what’s going on,  but  I’ve  always stayed around. \n\n‘I'VE CRASHED BIKES AT  300MPH ...  TWICE’ 63 \nWhat are you  up to at the moment? \nI’ve been working on  my  Turbinator —  a  gas-turbine, four-wheel drive, \npowered by a  helicopter engine. I’ve run 439 miles and hour with it \nso  far. \nAny bike action? \nI haven't ridden my  two-wheeler but I’ve tested another guy’s twin- \nengined Vincent. \nIsn't the Vincent a strange motor to use? \nYeah, but they make good horsepower and they’re supercharged. It \ndoesn’t make any difference what engine you've got, you’ve just got to \nhave the  right power. The Vincent makes 500 to  600 horsepower, but \nthat’s too  much... things break or  don’t work right. Also, it’s  difficult \nwhen you've got  one guy building the  thing and another guy driving — \nI ride them and build them. \nHow fast should the Vincent go? \nThe builder is thinking of going 400 with it, but  I told him you've got \nto  do 322  first. \nSo how long are  the straights at Bonneville? \nThey vary from seven miles to eleven, and you need about ten  miles for \na run  —  five  to  go,  five  to  stop. The last  couple of years we've been lucky \nto  get  nine, because of the  salt  mining. \nAs a tuner, you  compete in the workshop too... \nRight, I have my  own ideas and I do  my  own stuff; I’ve always been \nthat way. Everyone has their own ideas about how to  break a record, \nyou've \ngot \nto \nchallenge \nit \nyour \nown \nway. \nBut \nnowadays \nwhen \nyou \ngo \nracing \nyou \ncan \njust \nbuy \neverything \nyou \nneed \n— \nYoshimura’s \ngot \nit \nor \nHonda’s got  it.  In  the  beginning you had to  do  it all yourself. \nHow much power do you  need to do 350mph? \nI'd  \nsay  \nabout \n300bhp. \nI \nonly \nhad \n160  \nwhen \nI \nwent \n280mph \nwith \nmy \ntwin-engined \nTZ750. \nIt  \nwas \na  \nbit  \nweak \ncompared \nto  \nmy \nKawasaki \nstreamliner, \nwhich \nran \ntwo \nturbocharged \nZ1000 \nmotors \nand \nmade \naround \n260bhp. \nWith \nturbochargers \nyou \ncan \ncompensate \nfor \naltitude. \n\n64 THE FAST STUFF \nHow did you first get into speed? \nI grew up  around it —  my  dad was racing cars. I got  into motorcycles \nbecause it was less expensive. I started out  drag racing, that was real easy \nbecause it’d  cost you three dollars to go drag racing at the weekend. \nDo you  do anything else dangerous? \nI don’t bungee jump, I don’t jump out  of airplanes, I don’t hang-glide \nand I don’t fly ultralights. I like being on  the  ground, with wheels. I \ntried boats but  I don’t like  them. \nDo you  ever get scared? \nI don’t think so.  Sometimes I get a little concerned. When you crash \nyou don’t have time to  be  scared. All  of  a sudden you’re crashing and \nyou just have to wait for it to  stop. \nMotoGP Mutterings: August 1999 \nWho’s that bustin’ through the pain barrier? Must be  Metal \nMicky D, Man of Steel \nIn  our wonderful modern world of  all-powerful anaesthetics, it  is \nsometimes difficult to  remember what true pain is  all  about. Not for \ntop  GP  racers though. \nThese guys may live pampered five-star lifestyles with helicopters, \nspeedboats and personal masseurs, but boy, do they know the meaning \nof  the  word ‘ouch’. Men like Doohan and Biaggi race when normal \npeople like you and me  would beg for  a  big, fat  syringe up  the  bum. \nGood night nurse. \nTrouble is,  no  one ever raced that well on  a  general, so  these guys \nhave something called mesotherapy inflicted upon them —  a  special \nlocal anaesthetic applied via  multiple injections.

On  the  road to  the  big \ntime, lots of stuff like  this will happen... \nA few years back I got young British hopeful Jamie Robinson a ride \nwith Team Roberts in the  Spanish Open series at  Calafat, a  few hours \nsouth of Barcelona. His  TZ250 seized flat  out  in  fifth and flicked him \ninto a rocky run-off area. He was badly battered and one  of his  fingers \nswelled up purple, he was in agony. So Sandy Rainey (Wayne’s dad  and \nthe team’s mechanic) says: ‘Son, you gotta relieve the  pressure’; he \ngrabs a  Black & Decker and drills through the  finger nail until blood \ngushes out. Trying hard to  look cool, I tell Jamie: ‘Better get down the \nmedical centre and get  that sterilised.’ ‘Hell no,’ barks Sandy. ‘Stick it \nin some gasoline, that'll fix it up.’ So  Jamie did, then went out, led  the \nrace... and fell  off again. \nThen there’s American Superbike racer Dale ‘Cut it Off’  Quarterly, who \nwrecked a  finger some years back at  a US  meet. Surgeons gave him a \nchoice: ‘We can fix  the  finger and you'll be  racing in \nthree months or we  can  cut it off and you can  race next \nSunday’. No  choice for a racer. ‘The man’s \nBut the  hardest motherfucker of them all is Metal resistance to pain \nMicky Doohan, Man of  Steel, the  man who lost a astounds his \nfinger in his  debut GP  season, nearly lost a leg in 92 surgeons who treat \nand \nhas \nmore \nbroken \nbones \nand \nscar \ntissue \nthan \na \nAmerican \nfootballer: \ngridful \nof \nWSB \nracers. \nand \nother \nso-called \nA few days after his  sickening career-ending crash ruff ‘n’ tuff \nat \nJerez \n1999 \nI \ncalled \nthe  \ngreat \nman \nat  \nhis  \nhospital \nin \nsportsmen’ \nthe \nStates, \nwhere \nhe \nwas \nwaiting \nto \nbe \nscrewed \nback \nEe \neae \nee \ntogether. \n‘How \nare \nyou \nMick?’ \n‘Aww, \nnot  \nso  \nbad, \n‘cept \nwhen \nI \ngot \nhere \nthey \nfilled \nme  \nup \nwith \ndrugs \nto \nkill \nthe \npain, \nso \nI \ndidn’t \nfeel \ntoo \ngood. \nI \ntold \nthem \nto \ntake \nme \noff \nthat \nstuff \nexcept \none \npainkiller \nand \nI \nfeel \nbetter \n— \nI’d \nrather \nhave \na \nclear \nhead \nand \ndeal \nwith \nthe \npain \nthan \na \nfuzzy \nhead \nfrom \nall \nthe \ndrugs.’ \nSo  \nthe  \nguy’s \nflat  \nout  \nin  \nhospital \nwith \na  \nparalysed \narm \nand \na  \nbroken \nleg, \nwrist \nand \ncollarbone \nand \nhe’s \ntelling \nthe \nnurses \n‘no \nthanks’. \nMick, \nyou \ngot \nit \nwrong \nman, \ntry \nthe \nmorphine. \nNo \nreally, \ntry \nthe \nmorphine, \nyou'll \nlike \nit. \nThe \nman’s \nresistance \nto  \npain \nastounds \nhis  \nsurgeons, \nwho \nregularly \ntreat \nAmerican \nfootballers \nand \nother \nso-called \nruff \n’n’ \ntuff \nsportsmen. \nEven \nnow, \nwhen \nhe \nmust \nhave \n10 \nto \n20 \nmillion \nin \nthe \nbank \nand \nfive \n\n66 THE FAST STUFF \nNSR500s sitting in his lounge in Oz  (Honda gave him \n‘Doohan says racing one for  each world title), he  is  still determined to \nis 90 per cent come back and race again. \npsychology’ Why? How come he doesn’t give up  and slip into a \nparadise retirement of mucking about in boats down \non  the Great Barrier Reef? Because he’s a devout pupil \nof racers’ logic, that’s why. Racers’ logic is a kind of divine madness, the \nability to  stare reality in  the  face and still  disbelieve. So when someone \nasks Mick if he’s scared of jumping back on  his  NSR, he  replies: ‘No, \nbecause I know I can  crash and I know I can  hurt myself.’ Fine. \nGP racing lost its edge the moment he was stretchered away at Jerez. \nHowever good guys like  Crivillé and Okada may be at racing bikes, they \njust don’t grill my burgers. Mick has  a  superb attitude to his  sport. The \nman doesn’t give a  flying fuck about anything but going fast. He’s a \nreal racer, not  an  image-obsessed, TV-pleasing PR  tart  like  some of your \nmodern stars. He’s often blunt, curt, even rude, but who cares? His job \nis  Hard Bastard Racer Who Doesn’t Know When To  Give Up. That’s \nwhat he’s good at. \nEven Mick doesn’t realise how much we’re going to  miss him. \nWhen I told him that, he replied: ‘You'll get used to it.”  Maybe, but  not \nfor a while. \nMotoGP Mutterings: september 1999 \nRacers are  strange people, so  you've got to delve deep into their \npsyches to  find out what makes a GP  winner \nSo,  what's the  most important part of a  GP  rider’s anatomy? His  right \nwrist, his  balls or  his  brain? \nIt’s  his  brain, or  to  be more specific, his  psyche. Going fast is above \nall  a  mental thing. Five-time 500  king Mick Doohan will tell  you that \n—  he  says racing is 90 per  cent psychology. \nIn which case, a rider’s state of mind is more important than anything \nelse when it comes to winning races, more important than engine, tyres \nand suspension, because if he doesn’t feel  right, he won’t go fast. \nThat’s \nwhy \nteam \nmanagers \nand \nengineers \n—  \nthe \nguys \nwho \nget \nclosest \nto \nriders \n—  \ninvest \na \nhuge \namount \nof \neffort \nin \nmaking \nsure \nthat \ntheir \nmen \nfeel \nconfident \nand \ncomfortable. \nIn  \nthe  \nmost \nextreme \ncases \nthis \nmay \n\nDELVE DEEP INTO THEIR PSYCHE 67 \nmean \ntreating \nthe  \nrider \nlike \na \nkid: \npatting \nhim \non  \nthe \nback, \ntelling \nhim \nhe’s \nthe \ngreatest, \nwiping \nhis \nbottom, \njust \ngenerally \nmaking \nhim \nfeel \nbig, \nbad \nand \ndangerous \nand \nthe \nmost \nimportant \ngeezer \non \nthe \nplanet. \nLook at  John Kocinski. When he’s in  the  right team, working with \npeople who know how to  get  the  best out  of him, he  goes superfast. \nWhen he’s not  in the right team, it all tends to go wrong. Castrol Honda \nwon his  confidence by doing stuff like fitting his  RC45 with his  own \nhandlebar grips. And he won the world championship. During 1998 he \nraced 500s for  Sito Pons, and the  Spaniards hadn’t a  clue how to  deal \nwith him, so  he flunked. \nIt sounds daft but  it works. What you have to remember is that fast \nmotorcycle racers are  very weird people. Treat them like normal human \nbeings and you don’t stand a  chance, treat them like weirdo psychos, \nand you're there. \nSo  how do you do  that? Well, start off with a bit  of straightforward \npsychoanalysis: understand that most of  these guys are driven by \nsomething very deep but very simple: personal insecurities. In  that \nrespect they’re probably no  different from anyone else who makes it \nbig in this world: people who dedicate their lives to climbing to  the  top \nare  usually desperate to prove themselves; well-adjusted, self-confident \npeople see  no  need to risk life  and limb to  show everyone they’re bigger \nand tougher than the  next guy. \nAs  Mike Sinclair —  the  engineer who guided Wayne Rainey to his  three \ntitles and now fettles Max Biaggi’s bikes —  says: ‘The fastest riders are \nusually the most insecure people.’ In other words, these guys gain strength \nfrom their weakness —  using their insecurities to push them to victory. \nSinclair is amazed that sports psychologists —  already widely used in \npretty much every other big-money sport —  have hardly made it into the \npaddock. ‘It’s a  huge area we’ve not got  into,’ he  adds. ‘But in  some \nways us  guys do  the  same job —  what you do  to  the  bike can  affect the \nrider’s head. I  had times with Wayne when he  really struggled in \npractice, so  I made a change on  Sunday morning and he went out  and \nwon \nthe \nrace, \nand \nI’m \nsure \nwhat \nI \nchanged \ndidn’t \nmake \nany \nreal \ndifference, he just thought it did. It’s  like a  placebo.’ \nThat’s \nthe  \nengineer’s \njob: \nto  \ngive \nhis  \nrider \nthe  \nconfidence \nto  \nhelp \nhim \npush \ndeep \ninto \nthe \ndanger \nzone \n—  \nand \nif \nthat \nmeans \nfitting \nthe \nback \nwheel \nin \nthe \nfront \nbecause \nthe \nrider \nreckons \nhe'll \nfeel \nhappier \nthat \nway, \nso \nbe \nit. \nWorld \n500  \nnumber \ntwo \nBiaggi \nemphasises \nthe  \ncrucial \npart \nplayed \nby \n\n68 THE FAST STUFF \npsychology in 500s. ‘I think you have to be very strong in your mind to \nride a 500 —  that’s the most important thing of all,’ he says. ‘I remember \nsomething Rainey once said —  he said you can  race a 500  all season and \nyour bike will work perfectly for  two or  three GPs at  best. That’s why \n500s are  so  different from other motorcycles. At  every other race your \nbike might not  be  steering exactly the  way you want it to,  so  you have \nto  use  your mental strength to  overcome any deficiencies, to  make the \nbike do what you want it to do.  If you really want to do something, you \ncan, but  it’s  like a mental sacrifice, and it’s  tough.’ \nBeyond the  rider/bike relationship, the  overall team environment is \nalso crucial to  a rider’s mental well-being. Kocinski didn’t only shine at \nCastrol Honda because they fitted his  RC45 with the  right grips, he  felt \ngood because it’s  a  hyper-organised Anglo-Saxon outfit, as  is Marlboro \nTeam Roberts, with whom JK won the  1990 250  world title. As  everyone \nknows, Kocinski has a cleanliness/tidiness obsession, so he likes his team \nto  have schedules and programmes and timetables. When he  rides for \nthe Latins —  like  Pons in ’98 and Ducati in ‘96 —  he struggles because they \ndon’t get  all  anal about doing things by numbers. Carl Fogarty’s the \nopposite —  he much prefers the laid-back but hot-blooded way Ducati do \nthings. Foggy and the  Italians operate on  passion, not  precision. \nIt’s  thus the team manager’s job to understand his rider’s personality, \nso  he  can build the  right environment around him. Hervé Poncharal, \nboss of the  French Tech 3 team that runs Olivier Jacque and Shinya \nNakano in  250 GPs, puts a  huge emphasis on  building relationships \nwith his  riders. He  tried, and failed, with JK,  with whom he  had an \nacrimonious split mid-way through the  ’93  250 GP  season. \n‘With John I thought I could give him something, he seemed lonely, like \nhe needed some support or  friendship, but  that doesn’t always work,’ he \nsays. ‘Generally, the  more you get  to  know a rider, the  more you know \nabout what he needs. If you spend time with him away from the racetrack \nand talk about non-racing things, you'll find out  different aspects of his \ncharacter. Some riders want to be your friend, some like  to be alone, some \nneed compliments, some don’t. Racing is not  an  easy life, especially when \nthings aren’t going well —  it’s quite easy for the rider to blame the  team or \nvice versa, or  maybe the  rider will start doubting himself. But  you can’t \npush your rider too  much or  he'll start crashing; then again, you mustn’t \nmake him feel too  secure or  he'll go  to  sleep —  you've got  to  keep him \nhungry. Like everything in life and in racing, it’s  a compromise.’ \n\nCHAPTER 11 \n‘I BELIEVE I CAN OUTRIDE \nANYBODY FOREVER’ \nMarch 2000 \nBack at  the start of 2000, Kenny Roberts Junior had yet to  win \nthe 500 crown, but he already knew he was the best rider in the \nworld —  he just didn’t want to  admit it \nYou can tell  Kenny Roberts is a  seriously dedicated motorcycle racer. At \nthe  climax of his  team’s glitzy launch night in  Spain, Roberts emerges \non  stage amidst a sweat of PVC-clad dancing girls and the first thing he \nsqueezes is the throttle grip of his freshly painted number-two RGV500. \nThen when his  index finger reaches out a  few moments later, it is to \nstroke the RGV’s front-brake lever. That’s what you need to  be  500 \nworld champion —  focus. \nLater that evening the grinning hostess stumbles across the stage \nand topples into his  Movistar Suzuki, so  Roberts dives forward to  save \nnot the girl, but the  bike. That’s something else you need to  be  500 \nworld champ —  a certain disregard for  the  comfort of others. \nThe rider formerly known as  Kenny Roberts Junior (he dropped the \nJunior suffix at  the  start of 2000, then reintroduced it a couple of years \nlater, then dropped it  again, then... oh,  I’ve lost interest) has pretty \nmuch got  everything it takes to  be  king of bike racing’s toughest class. \nAll  he  lacked in  1999 was a  fully competitive bike. Many GP  insiders \nnow consider him to be the best 500 rider in the world, better than Alex \nCrivillé, \nthe \nhugely \nexperienced \nSpanish \nHonda \nrider \nwho \nbeat \nhim \nto \nthe  ‘99  crown. \nKenny \nknows \nthat \ntoo, \nbut \njust \ntry \ngetting \nhim \nto \nadmit \nit. \nUnlike \nhis \nmouthy \ndad, \nthe  \nformer \ntriple \n500  \nchamp \nwho \nis  \n(quite \nrightly) \nnever \nafraid \nto \nvoice \nhis \nopinions, \nKing \nKenny’s \nson \nis \npolite, \nreticent, \na \nspeaker \nof \nsponsor-speak. \nSo  Kenny, are  you better than Crivillé? \n‘There \nis  \nno  \nbetter \nor  \nworse. \nAlex \nis  \na  \ngreat \nchampion, \nI \nfeel \nreally \n\n70 THE FAST STUFF \nhappy for  him and it’s  great for  Spain. The question I ask myself is \n“Could I beat him if he  was my  team-mate, if I was riding the  same \nmotorcycle?’ At no  time last  year did  I ever feel  less superior to him on \nriding ability.” \nNo  better or  worse? Hang on,  ain’t that what it’s  all  about, proving \nyou're faster than the  next guy, than the  rest of  the  whole goddam \nworld? So come on  Kenny, are  you a better rider than Crivillé? \n‘Whether I think that or  not is  irrelevant; it’s  too  basic to  say  I’m \nbetter or worse. If you were to ask me  whether I could take a motorcycle \nthat shouldn’t beat him and then go out  and do that, well yes, I believe \nI can  do that.’ \nSo you must be a better rider. \n‘No, that’s for you and the  fans to decide, that’s not  for me  to  say.  Of \ncourse I’m going to  think that, I wouldn’t be  a  grand prix rider if I \ndidn’t. I thought that when I was riding the Modenas. To make you see \nit, that’s a different thing.’ \nSo  you obviously believe you are  better, why don’t you just say  it? \n(He’s getting wound up  now). \n‘No! I want you  to say it,  I want other people to say it, because it doesn’t \nmatter what I say.  I believe I can  outride anybody forever, because that’s \nthe  way racers think, that’s the  way world champions think. But my \ngoal is for everyone else to  think that.’ \nOkay, okay, point taken. We’re sitting and chatting on  the  Jerez pit \nwall, Spanish spring-time sunshine beaming down while the Marlboro \nYamaha crew works on  a  YZR500 belonging to  Max Biaggi, the  man \nmany rate as  Roberts’ most dangerous rival for  the  2000 crown. \nBiaggi is  widely reckoned to  be  bike racing’s biggest earner, now \nthat ten-million-a-year Micky D  is  drawing his pension. Popular \nestimates have Biaggi on  four mill plus, and while Crivillé maybe earns \nsimilar wedge, no  one else comes close, not even Roberts. Does this \nworry him? \n‘Sure, I’d love to earn more money, make no  mistake. If  I made Max’s \nmoney I could probably afford to  burn what I earn. It’s  just because of \nwhere I was born, Max and Alex come from countries where bike racing \nis popular. If  I was Spanish I’d probably be making double what I make, \nbecause I’d  make good money off  sponsors. But Mick Doohan was the \nhighest-paid racer ever and he  made money from winning races and \nworld championships; that’s my goal too. If I can  do that my life will be \n\n‘I BELIEVE I CAN OUTRIDE ANYBODY FOREVER’ 71 \ncontent. Right now I’m content with my  ability but I’m not content \nbecause I’ve not  won a world championship.’ \nBiaggi, of course, works on  his image. He hangs out with models and \nTV  stars, lives in Monaco, drives around in flash motors and is in love \nwith the  camera. Roberts lives in Modesto, California, is engaged to  a \nlocal girl  he  first met at  school, drives a  Toyota pick-up and couldn’t \ncare less if he’s famous or  not. Perhaps he  could boost his  star rating, \nand thus his  dollar-earning potential, by following the  example of GP \nracing’s big stars, Biaggi, Valentino Rossi & Co.  Like, how much would \nhe want to  dye his  hair orange, $200,000? \n‘No, I wouldn’t do it for  a couple of hundred grand but  maybe for a \nmillion or more. In my job I’m  always concentrating on  something else. \nYou have to work on  an  image and I guess my  image is not  working on \nan  image. Anyway, I believe cameras have a way of seeing through that \nstuff. Being the  one with the  loudest hair, the  biggest mouth and the \nwildest lifestyle, it’s a game you never win.’ \nIf you wanted to  give Roberts a  tabloid-friendly \nnickname, it  would have to  be  something like Mr \nClean. No,  make that Mr  Squeaky Clean: never a hair \nout of  place, never a  rude word. Well, not until a \nJerez marshal strides over and orders us  off  the  pit \n‘The party fliers saic \nbring hard alcohol, \nbring shotguns and \nbring motorcycles’ \nwall. Kenny refuses to budge, then calls to  one of his \nmechanics to  ‘kick that guy’s ass’. \nRoberts hails from America’s conservative west, old  cowboy country \nwhere men are men, ‘good’ Christian values still hold true (or  are \ncertainly \nsupposed \nto) \nand \nthe \nunconventional \nis \nregarded \nwith \ndeep \nsuspicion. \nAs \nhis \ndad \nsays: \n‘There’s \nonly \ntwo \nkinds \nof \nmusic \nworth \nlistening to:  country... and western.’ \nOf \ncourse, \nthem \ncowboys \nhave \ntheir \nown \nway \nof \npartying \nand \nit \nain’t \nall  \nWillie \nNelson. \nDad \nRoberts’ \nbirthday \nis \non  \nNew \nYear's \nEve \nand \nhis \nModesto \nranch \nparties \nare \nlegendary, \nusually \ninvolving \nplenty \nof \nserious \nracing \n— \ndirt \ntrack, \nmotocross \nand \nthe \nclimax \nevent, \na \nfour-wheel \ndemolition \nderby. \nLast \nNYE \nlittle \nKenny \nplanned \na \nspecial \nmillennium \nbash \nfor \ndad, \nand \nprinted \ninvites \nfor \nfamily \nfriends. \n‘The \nfliers \nsaid \nbring \nhard \nalcohol, \nif  \nyou \nwant, \nbecause \nwe  \nwere \nproviding \nbeer, \nbring \nshotguns \nfor \nclay \nshooting \nand \nbring \nmotorcycles \nand \nkarts \ntoo. \nWell, \nour \nlawyers \ngot \na \nhold \nof \nthe \nfliers \nand \nwent \napeshit. \nThey \nsaid \nthat \nin \nCalifornian \nlaw \nthis \nthing \nwas \njust \nan \nopen \nletter \nof \nsin \n\n72 THE FAST STUFF \n—  bring booze, bring guns, bring bikes and cars. They said the  insurance \ncompany wouldn’t insure the  ranch. It was my  fault. None of that stuff \nhappened but we  had a party and it was a great party, no  one got out  of \ncontrol, though my dad was disappointed because none of the girls took \ntheir tops off, which has  been an  occurrence once in a while.’ \nDespite his  Jerez pit-lane outburst (hey, he was only jokin’), Roberts \nreally is a softly spoken, normal kind of a nice guy. Back in “96,  midway \nthrough his  first 500 season, I asked his  dad how this could be, when \ndad’s got  such a mouth? ‘Well,’ replied the  King. ‘He’s still got  time to \nbecome an  asshole!’ What Kenny Senior meant was this: ‘As  Kenny \ngets better, he’ll get harder to  please. That’s what I want, I never want \nhim to  be  satisfied with a  result or  with his  bike. You don’t win \nchampionships like that.’ \nRoberts Senior had every faith in  his  first-born back then. ‘Junior \nhas what it takes to be world champion,’ he said. ‘He has natural talent. \nSo  long as  everything happens right I see  no  reason why he  shouldn't \nbe champ.’ \nIronically, what happened right was Kenny defecting from his  dad’s \nstruggling Modenas team at  the  end of ’98  to ride Suzukis. Even in ’96 \n(when he  was riding Yamaha 500s for  his  dad) Junior knew he  had \nwhat it  takes. ‘I  know I can run top  three, mentally I don’t have a \nproblem with the  speed,’ he  said then. ‘It’s  just a matter of learning to \nget  the  set-up right.’ He  proved he’d learned that the  moment he  got \nback on  a V4 in  1999, whupping everyone including Doohan at the  first \ntwo  races. \nRoberts has  been bred for 500  glory. Back in ’96,  he also told me  this: \n‘For me, sliding a bike is like  a  streetbike rider turning on  the  ignition \nkey, I just do  it.’  He  grew up  sideways, spending his  childhood racing \nguys like Wayne Rainey, Eddie Lawson and the  King himself around \nthe  dirt oval at  his  dad’s ranch; wheelspinning a  500 is in  his  nature \nand in his  nurture. \nNow \nworking \nwith \ngenius \nAustralian \nengineer \nWarren \nWilling, \nhe’s \ntrying \nto \ndevelop \nthe \nSuzuki \ninto \na \nHonda-beating \nmotorcycle. \nThis \nis \nwhere \nwhat \ndad \nwas \nsaying \nabout \nnever \nbeing \nsatisfied \ncomes \nin, \nand \nwhen \nyou \nrealise \nthat \nwithin \nthe \nnice \nguy \nis \na \ncontrol \nfreak, \ndetermined \nto \nbend \nthe \nSuzuki \nfactory \nto \nbuilding \nthe \nbike \nhe \nwants. \n‘Some \npeople \nin \nthe  \nteam \nprobably \nsay  \nI’m  \noutspoken. \nI \ntry \nnot  \nto  \nbe \nderogatory, \nbut \nI \ntry \nto \nmake \nmy \nteam \nand \nengineers \nsee \nwhat \nwe \ncan \n\n‘I BELIEVE I CAN OUTRIDE ANYBODY FOREVER’ 73 \nachieve with this modification or  this improvement. I like  to  control the \nsituation in that I want to know what’s happening. And I pay  attention \nto  the  other motorcycles, a lot  of attention. I never stop thinking about \nour  motorcycle, how we  can improve it and what the  other teams are \ndoing. Because racing isn’t just about racing the  other guys, it’s  about \ngiving input to help Suzuki build the ultimate motorcycle.’ \nWilling’s target was always to build that bike for the 2000 season. He \njoined Suzuki alongside Roberts at  the end of  ’98  and knew there \nwasn’t time to  develop a  Honda-beater in  their first year with the \nfactory. No  surprise then that Roberts complained that the 99  RGV was \n‘out-gunned in all departments’. \n‘Now we've got more horsepower,’ he says. ‘We haven't gained what \nwe  needed to  achieve but we’ve got  a  better connection between the \nthrottle and the  rear tyre, which means I'll  have the  feel to  accelerate \nbetter. The bike is lighter, too, I could feel  the difference right away. The \nteam wants to  be  able to  get  under the  minimum weight, so  they can \nmove ballast around to  change the way the  bike handles.’ \nHis  other big worry in  ‘99  was burning tyres, a  problem blamed on \nexcess \nweight \nand \nlack \nof \npower, \nbecause \nRoberts \nhad \nto \nride \nthe \nthrottle \nharder \nto \ncompensate \nfor \nthose \ndeficiencies. \n‘It \nwas \nworse \nif \nI \nwas \nrunning \nwith \nsomeone \nwho \nuses \nless \ncorner \nspeed, \nso \nI \nhad \nto \nrun \nthrough \nturns \nslower, \nand \naccelerate \nharder. \nBut \nthe \nhuge \nbenefit \nfor \nme \nnow \nis \nbeing \non \nthe \nsame \nmotorcycle \nfor \na \nsecond \nyear. \nYour \ninput \nlevel \nis \nenhanced \nbecause \nyou're \nfeeling \nthe \nsame \nkind \nof \nthings, \nso \nyou \ncan \ncompare \nwhat's \nbetter \nand \nwhat’s \nworse. \n‘As  \na \nrider \nyou're \nalways \nlearning \nuntil \nyou \nquit. \nI \ntry \nriding \ndifferent \nways \nand \nthat’s \nhelped \nme \nwin \nsome \nraces. \nYou \ndo \nstuff \nlike \nchange \nyour \nstyle \nand \nyour \nappearance \nto \nthe \nguy \nbehind \nhalfway \nthrough \na \nrace. \nThen \nyou \nchange \nagain, \nto \ngive \nthem \nsome \nconfusion, \nso \neverything \nchanges, \nwhere \nthey’d \nplanned \na \npass \nor \nfelt \nthey \nhad \nan \nadvantage. \nYou \ncamouflage \nyourself \nuntil \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \nrace.’ \nThen \nhe  \ngoes \nand \ncontradicts \nall  \nthat \nstuff \nabout \nbuilding \nthe \n‘ultimate \nmotorcycle’, \nwhich \nisn’t \nmuch \nof \na \nsurprise, \nsince, \nhey, \nwe’re \nall \na \nmass \nof \ncontradictions. \nAnd \nracers \nespecially. \nWhat \nKenny \nreally \nwants \nis \na \nbike \nthat’s \nworse \nthan \nthe \nrest, \nor \nonly \njust \nas \ngood! \nHe \nmay \nspend \nmillions \nof \nSuzuki’s \nmoney \nand \ndevote \nhis \nevery \nwaking \nmoment \nto \nimproving \nhis \nRGY, \nbut \nthen \nhe \nsays, \n‘for \nme \nit’s \nno \nfun \nto \nhave \nthe \nbest \nequipment, \nthe \nbest \nteam \nand \nthe \nbest \nengine. \nIt’s \nno \nfun \nbecause \n\n74 THE FAST STUFE \nit’s  not a  level playing field. The best feeling in  the  world is  to  take \nsomething that is  lesser or  the  same and ride it harder than anyone \nelse, that’s what it’s  all about. All  I want is a level playing field.’ \nYou don’t need to  be  a  fully qualified shrink to  understand the \npsychology behind that —  Roberts wants everyone to have absolutely no \ndoubt that he’s the  best rider in the  world, then perhaps people might \nstop bugging him, asking him if he  really is the  greatest. Or  maybe it \ngoes a bit  deeper than that. Roberts’ dad is rated as  one of the  top  two \nor  three bike racers of all time, so  does Kenny have a burning desire to \nescape the  patriarchal shadow? \n‘I’ve never thought of it that way. What he  did  has  no  reflection on \nwhat I do.  The thing that drives me  is  doing the  best I can on  the \nequipment I have. That’s what my  dad accomplished and that’s what \nWayne and Eddie did  too. When it was their time they were the  best in \nthe  world, now I have the  chance to be the  best guy  in my  era.’ \nEpilogue: KRJR did indeed win the 2000 500 title, beating rookie \nRossi. He  drifted into apparent retirement in 2007, but  he’ll be back if \nhe finds the  right bike. \n\nCHAPTER 12 \n“DOOHAN’S \nA \nBIT  \nGERMAN, \nI’M \nDIFFERENT, \nI’M \nEASYGOING’ \nNovember 2000 \nGarry McCoy burned bright and burned short in  500 GPs —  his \nsuper-sideways style smokin’ him to five wins in 2000 and 2001 \nbefore injuries and the dastardly four-strokes ended his  time at \nthe top \nNever believe a journalist. The week after Garry McCoy won his  debut \n500  GP victory at Welkom, South Africa, in March 2000, a German mag \nscreamed this headline: ‘McCoy —  Der Neue Doohan!’ (That’s ‘The \nNew Doohan!’) \nWrong. Garry McCoy is  not the  new Micky D,  never will be,  never \ncould be. It would be hard to imagine two more different racers: Doohan \nwas the psycho, burning up inside, scarred and broken outside. He was \na  phenomenon, determined, driven and focused like no  other. As  a \nracer he  had an  aura that crackled with electric intensity; he  wasn’t \neasy to  be around. \nGazza is  the  total opposite: no  superhero aura, no  withering stares \nand gritted teeth, just a big toothy grin and plenty of laughs. Gazza is a \nnormal geezer who doesn’t stand out  from the crowd. He  soon got used \nto  the  Doohan comparisons but  never understood it.  ‘I reckon Mick’s a \nbit German, like  he’s got  a bit of German blood in him!’ he laughs. ‘I’m \nvery different, I’m easygoing and I don’t believe I'll  ever change. I’ve \nwon a  race as  I am, so  why do  I need to  be different to  win more?’ \nFair enough. What does make the  tiny Aussie stand out from the \ncrowd is  his  riding style —  a  lunatic, crossed-up-on-the-brakes, full- \nlock-on-the-gas rodeo ride. ‘Ferret tied to  a  rocket!’ cry  some. ‘Monkey \ntied to a greyhound!’ say others. McCoy gets more sideways than Kevin \nSchwantz ever did  and his  tyre-smokin’ antics have raised eyebrows. \nApparently \nyou’re \nnot \nsupposed \nto \nride \n500s \nlike \nthat \nany \nmore. \nSideways \nused \nto \nbe \nthe \nway \nto \nride \na \n500 \nback \nin \nthe \ndays \nof \nWayne \n\n76 THE FAST STUFF \nGardner, Wayne Rainey and Schwantz, when horsepower exceeded \nchassis and tyre performance. Australians and Americans ruled, because \nthey’d grown up  sideways on  dirt tracks, while Europeans couldn’t \ntranslate their 125  and 250  roadrace technique to those fiery old-school \n500s. But later advances in  chassis and tyre design allowed men like \nValentino Rossi, Alex Crivillé and Max Biaggi to ride 500s like they once \nrode 125s and 250s. Then along comes McCoy, sliding and spinning his \nYZR500 and disappearing into the  distance. \nAfter that first win at Welkom, Doohan wasn’t even sure Gazza had \ngot it right. ‘He  doesn’t really look in full control of the  thing when it’s \nsnapping sideways,’ said the  former grandmaster. However, McCoy’s \nfurther victories at  Estoril and Valencia proved that the boy does \nknow what he’s doing, even though he looks like he’s heading for  the \nstraw bales. \nOn  the  other hand, former champ Rainey reckoned that McCoy was \nthe only man who impressed him during 2000. ‘He rides the bike \nsideways and that’s where 500s are happiest,’ said the American. \n‘They’re okay until the  tyres go  off  halfway through a  race, then you \ngotta ride them sideways.’ \nYou see, McCoy needs the  bike to  snap sideways. ‘When it  snaps \nmid-corner, that allows me  to get the bike turned a lot quicker,’ he says, \nlaughing, as  he  does most of  the  time he’s talking about giving his \nfactory YZR heaps, giving it the  guts, to coin a couple of his  fave Aussie \nphrases. ‘People forget that everyone rode like that seven years ago  and \nsome guys have told me  I should pull the  bike back into line but  that’s \nnot  what I’m used to.  It’s  difficult to change your style, a lot of thought \nhas  gone into it, plus I’m  pretty light, so  the  rear spins up  easy.’ \nMcCoy’s style does cause him some problems but only because it’s \ndifferent from everyone else’s. ‘If I’m  behind someone they hold me  up \na  hell of a  lot  because they’re not  really on  the  gas  until their bike is \nupright, so  I have to  run through a  corner at  their speed, spending \nmore time turning the  bike. If I’m  on  my own I can  get on  the  gas a lot \nearlier, steer the  bike with some wheelspin, then stand it up  and away \nwe  go.  I learned most of that through riding speedway ten years back. \nTo me, it’s  the  same thing.’ \nMcCoy hasn’t raced speedway for  a  while. Nowadays he  hones his \nsideways style on  a  600 trail bike. ‘I’ve got  a  600 on  knobbie tyres and \nthat’s good for learning powersliding on  tarmac. You snap it on  through \n\n‘DOOHAN’S A BIT  GERMAN, I’M DIFFERENT, I’M EASYGOING’ TH \nroundabouts and get  big  slides, the  tyres are  just jelly. It’s  scary, but \ngood fun.’ \nThe man obviously has a startling amount of talent, so  how come no \none’s really heard of him until now? His  GP career is a convoluted story \nof hard knocks, tough luck and a  few  lucky breaks. He  started in  125s \nin  ‘92, then graduated to  an  uncompetitive Honda 500 twin in  ’98, \nwhen a badly busted ankle seemed to have ended his  GP career, until a \nmiddle-of-the-night call  from Red  Bull  Yamaha in June ’99. \nMcCoy made his  GP  debut at  Eastern Creek '92, subbing for  an \ninjured rider. Barry Sheene got  him the  ride after watching him win a \n250 proddie race a  few weeks earlier. He’d been roadracing just four \nmonths. Typically Aussie, Gazza wasn’t fazed. He  ran eighth at  the \nCreek until the  bike broke, even though this was his  first ride on  a \nreal race bike. \nHe  started speedway in ’89,  at  tracks near his  Camden home outside \nSydney and was all set  for a professional career on  the  shale until mate \nMat Mladin (who went on  to rule the US  Supers championship) started \nearning good money on  tarmac. McCoy was friends with wild child \nAnthony Gobert too, though he  admits ‘it’s always been a bit  difficult \nto  hang onto Goey’s rope! \n‘I'd  saved up  to  buy some speedway bikes, a van and an  air  ticket to \nEngland. But  Mat had just got a ride with Kawasaki Australia after one \nseason on  a 250  proddie bike. Everyone thought he was a hero and they \nwere throwing him into this factory team. I thought maybe that’s the \nway to  go —  there’s more money in it, though Id have been more than \nhappy to  struggle away doing speedway in England.’ \nSo McCoy canned speedway and blew his  cash on  an  RGV250. After \nhis \npromising \nGP \ndebut \n— \na \nweek \nafter \nhis \n20th \nbirthday \n— \nhe \ngot \na \nfull- \ntime \nGP \ndeal \nfor \n’93, \nriding \nan \nAprilia \nRS125, \nsoldiering \non \nin \n125s \nfor \nsix \nseasons, \neven \nthough \nit \nwasn’t \nwhere \nhe \nwanted \nto \nbe. \n‘Smaller \nbikes \ndon’t \nrelate \nto \nmy \nriding \nstyle. \nI \nwasted \na \nlot \nof \nyears. \nI \ndid \nslide \n125s \nbut \nit’s \nnot \nthe \nway \nto \ngo \nbecause \nyou're \nwashing \noff \nspeed. \nThe \nidea \nwas \nto \nprove \nmyself \nthen \nmove \nup \nbut \nI \ngot \nstuffed \naround \nby \na \ncouple \nof \nteams.’ \nOne \nGerman \noutfit \nabandoned \nhim \nin \nthe \nJerez \npaddock, \nleaving \nhim \nwith \njust \nhis \nsuitcase \nfor \ncompany. \nGaz \nhad \nrefused \nto \nride \nafter \nthey’d \noffered \nhim \njoke \nwages, \n50 \ndollars \nper \nchampionship point. \nThere \nwere \ngood \ntimes \ntoo  \n—  \nhis  \nfirst \nGP  \nwin \nat  \nShah \nAlam \n‘95  \nand \n\n78 THE FAST STUFF \nanother at  Eastern Creek ’96. Finally, at  the  start of ’98  he  got  a  500 \nride, albeit on  a Honda NSRV500 twin, giving away 50  horsepower to \nthe  dominant V4s. He  scored one top-ten finish that summer before \ncrashing big time at Brno, clipping the back of Doohan’s NSR, tumbling \nhorribly and shattering an  ankle. On  crutches all winter, he got passed \nover for a  99  ride and had resigned himself to working with his uncle, \nfitting garage doors. \n‘I'd  kind of had enough of racing. You put  your life  on  the  line and \nthe  teams don’t want to  pay you, you’re busting your ass  for nothing. I \nguess I wanted to  ride again, though with who and what on  I didn’t \nknow. I thought about racing in  the  US  —  you get  paid there and it \nmight’ve been a happy life.’ \nThen the  phone rang at  3am on  22  June 1999. It was Peter Clifford, \nrace director of the  Red Bull Yamaha WCM team, who’d just split with \nKiwi Simon Crafar. He wanted to put  Gazza on  Crafar’s YZRs. \n‘I was a little iffy. I still wasn’t 100  per  cent fit and \nI’d  never ridden a  four-cylinder 500 before. Peter \n‘I even tried riding made me  an  offer, hung up and said he’d ring back in \nwith the  wheels in two hours, I’d have to  get  on  a plane that afternoon. \nline but it didn’t I had nothing else to  go  for,  so  I just had to  do it.’ \nwork for me, the  lap McCoy turned up  at  the  Dutch GP  two days later \ntimes suffered’ looking like cannon fodder. You couldn’t think of a \nim worse place to  get  to know a V4 —  Assen is super fast \nand super narrow. He was out  of control through the \nawesome right-left kink that leads onto the  back straight, the  YZR \nwheelspinning, tank-slapping, Gazza hanging on  for  dear life. Hugely \nentertaining but  frightening too. \nHe  finished the  race 15th, alive, at  least, and continued relatively \nunnoticed at  the  next few GPs. It was at  the Valencia GP  a few months \nlater that McCoy first got noticed. He was getting the  hang of the YZR, \nstarting to  treat the  thing with some serious disrespect, smokin’ the \nrear tyre and finishing third. ‘After about four races I was into it,  I \nfound my style on  the bike and got comfy with it.  I  even tried \nriding with the  wheels in  line but it  didn’t work for  me, the lap \ntimes suffered.’ \nOver the  winter McCoy and his  amiable Scottish crew chief Hamish \nJamieson \nworked \nat \nadapting \nhis \nYZR500 \nto \nsuit \nhis \nmanic \nstyle. \n‘When \nI \nfirst \nrode \nthe \nthing \nit \nwas \nlike \na \nraging \nbull \nbut \nit’s \na \nlot \nbetter \nnow, \n\n“DOOHAN’S \nA \nBIT  \nGERMAN, \nI’M \nDIFFERENT, \nI’M \nEASYGOING’ \n79 \njust \nthrough \nriding \nit \nmore \nand \ngetting \nit \nset \nup \nto \nsuit \nmy \nstyle. \nHamish \nhas \nbeen \none  \nof \nmy  \nsupporters. \nHe \nwas \naround \nin \nthe \ndays \nof \nSchwantz \nand \nRainey \nso \nhe’s \nhappy \nto \nsee the sideways \nthing \nagain. \nHe \nsays \nif \nit \nworked \nin \nthem \ndays, \nwhy \nshouldn’t \nit work \nnow.’ \n; \nJamieson is  indeed delighted with his new man. GP  engineers \ngenerally have a  rough life  these days —  mega-serious, mega-stressful \n—  but  happy-go-lucky Gazza holds an  obvious joy for his  riding. \n‘Racing is  fun again,’ says Jamieson. ‘I  can’t wait for  Sundays to \ncome around because he’s a  real racer. These are  the  wildest bikes in \nthe world and though he’s got little upper-body strength he’s in control. \nHe’s riding it, he’s not  scared of it. \n‘The thing with Garry is  that he  doesn’t have much baggage. He’s \nnot  earned a  few million dollars over the  last couple of years like a  lot \nof  the  other guys, so  he’s not worried about spending it,  about his \nhouse, his  toys and so  on,  like a lot  of the  others. He’s very focused on \nthe  bike. He  goes away between races and thinks about it and he’ll be \nstraight back into it at  the  next race. A lot  of guys aren’t like that, you \nhave to  remind them what you were talking about at the last  race. He’s \nbright. And he’s not had many races on  the 500, so  he'll get  better, \nand as  he  gets better he  should get  a  bike and tyres that work better \nfor him.’ \nMcCoy is  the  man who started the  whole 500 pack switching from \nMichelin’s 17-inch rears to  16.5s. At  the  beginning of 2000, he was the \nonly rider using the  smaller tyre, but  pretty soon everyone was using it. \n‘The 16.5 has  more edge grip mid-corner, which is where I like to get on \nthe  power. The 17  is a  lot  flatter on  the  top  of the  tyre, so  there’s not \nenough rubber on  the  ground when you're cranked right over.’ \nIt’s no  coincidence that McCoy is  generally strongest after half- \ndistance, once his Michelins really start sliding around. He  even \nchanges \nhis \nriding \nstyle \nmid-race \nto \ncompensate \nfor \nthe \nchange \nin \ntyre behaviour. \n‘The \nrear \nstarts \nsliding \nmore \neasily \nand \nit \ncan  \nstop \ndriving \nforward, \nso \nI \neither \nshort \nshift, \nget  \neasier \non  \nthe  \ngas  \nor  \nstand \nthe  \nbike \nup  \nsooner \nwhen \nI’m \ncoming \nout \nof the \nturns.’ \nSome \nobservers \nare  \namazed \nthat \nMcCoy’s \ntyre-smoking \nantics \ndon’t \ndestroy \nhis \ntyres \nway \nbefore \nthe \nchequered \nflag. \nBut \nhe \nexplains \nthat \nhis \napparently \nreckless \nstyle \nis, \nin \nfact, \ngood \nfor \nthe \ntyres. \n‘Spinning \nthe \ntyre \ndoesn’t \nreally \nhurt \nit. \nWhat \nreally \nchews \nthe \nrubbers \nis \ngetting \n\n80 THE FAST STUFF \nmaximum drive out  of the turns without spinning, because that puts so \nmuch load on  the  tyre.’ \nMichelin has had much to  do  with McCoy’s success. In  1999, the \nFrench tyre brand accelerated development of its  16.5in rear slick, first \nused successfully by Schwantz in the mid-1990s. McCoy soon found he \npreferred the  tyre to  the  17in used by his  rivals, because it puts more \nrubber on  the road at max lean, giving him the kind of grip he needs to \nthrow it sideways. \nWhen McCoy won his first 500 race, the season-opening South \nAfrican GP  back in March, he used the  16.5in. But  because he was the \nonly man regularly using the  tyre, Michelin only had a limited range of \ncompounds and constructions and it took until mid-season to  get  the \nchoice he  wanted to  suit every racetrack. That’s why his results \napparently slumped after that great start to the year. ‘They always make \ntyres available to  everyone, so  it took time because they couldn’t just \nmake them for me. I started getting the  tyres I wanted in July.’ \nWith Michelin and Yamaha well behind him he undoubtedly looked \nlike a  major contender for  the 2001 title. But you have to  wonder \nwhether McCoy is just too  nice to  be world champ, like fellow former \nAussie 500  winner Kevin Magee and Niall Mackenzie —  hugely talented \nbut lacking that psychotic killer’s instinct. Then again perhaps his \nmusical tastes reveal a rougher side. ‘Iron Maiden and Megadeath are \ntwo of my  favourites, just something to  relax with at  the  end of  the \nday.” Megadeath for relaxation? Nutter! \nHow to  corner the Gazza way \nEver wanted to  rear-wheel steer? No  worries, just follow Garry McCoy’s easy \ninstructions... \n‘Coming into a turn I tend to get the rear end a little washy, so  the bike \ntends to  want to  back in  there.

I reckon I’ve  discovered the richest-ever source of future British \nworld champions! So much so  that I feel justified in guaranteeing you, \nthe  reader, a  21st century of  glorious Sunday-afternoon TV  viewing, \nwatching gangs of Pommie racers annihilate Johnny Foreigner while \nyou sit  there submerged in half-chewed pizza crusts, crumpled tinnies \nand a  sense of overwhelming wellbeing. Paradise, or  what? \nThe answer lies  right outside my  front door. Quite literally, mate. On \nany Saturday night (or any other night, for that matter) it’s  like  Brands \nbloody Hatch around my  gaff. It’s  all  wet cobblestones and dark alleys \nand gangs of kids thrashing around on  nicked scooters. Yip, crack’s not \nthe big buzz in London no  more, it’s  scoots, and these kids can’t be assed \nto  wait until they can afford the  things, so  they just \nnick them. From then on  it’s  chaos: they’re careering = \naround on  crashed-to-fuck Piaggio Typhoons, getting ‘On  any Saturday \ntotally sideways on  the cobbles and (sometimes) night it’s  like  Brands \nexecuting perfectly controlled two-wheel drifts. They bloody Hatch \nhave no  fear because they’ve nothing to lose. In other around my gaff \nwords, they’ll make great racers. \nI’ve been studying form over the  past few weeks \nand there’s a  couple of  the  little fucks who are  pretty trick. I have a \nplan: sign them up  on  ten-year contracts, guide them up  the racing \nladder, \nall \nthe \nway \nto \nGPs, \nand \ntake \na \ncool \n50 \nper \ncent \nof \nwhatever \nthey \nearn along the  way. Mr  Big, that’s me. \nBut \nI’m  \nplanning \none \nfinal \ntest  \nbefore \nI \nget \nthem \nto  \nsign \n(will \nthey \nbe \nable \nto \nwrite, \nI \nwonder, \nor \nwill \nit \njust \nbe \na \nthumbprint?). \nI’m \ngoing \nto \nlay \n\n82 THE FAST STUFF \nan  oil  slick at  the  end of my  street. No,  no,  no,  I’m  not  going to  shriek \nwith laughter when they highside into a  double-decker, I just want to \ngive them one  final test  of their ability before I risk getting involved. \nOf course, we  don’t like people who nick bikes but the  fact is  that \nmost top racers are  hard nuts with dark and dodgy pasts, racing around \non  the  roads and getting into all kinds of trouble with the  feds. Mick \nDoohan, for  example, was an  incorrigible truant who got  banned five \ntimes before he was 20,  for pulling wheelies and displaying unfriendly \nhand signals to  the  Gold Coast constabulary, amongst other things. \nAnd he did nick a bike once, well, it was his bro’s Z650. No  doubt about \nit, bike racers are  hooligans with a licence to  misbehave and, if they’re \nreal animals, they earn millions doing it. \nThe tricky part is  to  maintain these kids’ loony psychology all \nthe  way to  the  top. When they’re young, they’re full of  hunger and \nbursting with the  joy of  thrashing around on  race bikes. But with \nevery step they take, the pressures and rewards can kill the joy \nand take away the  hunger. All  of  a  sudden, they ain’t the  men they \nused to  be. \nThe pressures on  top racers, especially those doing 500 GPs, are  huge. \nWhen they’re off the  bike, their days are  filled by debriefing with their \nengineers and tyre technicians, meeting and greeting sponsors and \nVIPs, and getting interviewed by  idiots like myself. Boring, boring, \nboring. Valentino Rossi seems to  be  one of the  few 500 guys who has \ngot this sorted. By keeping the joy, he rides at his very best. He rides fast \nbecause he wants to,  because it’s  a blast. Most of his  rivals have let  the \nserious shit get to them, so they’ve stopped having fun and they struggle \nto  be quick enough. Racing has  become a chore. \nMoney is another problem. Once a rider earns his  first few million he \ncan easily mislay his  youthful nothing-to-lose craziness because now \nhe  has got  something to  lose. He’s got  a  nice house or  two, a  flash \nmotor or  three, a  tasty bird or  four, and a  garage full of toys. All  of a \nsudden he’s thinking he doesn’t want to get hurt, he wants to enjoy his \nsuccess, so  he  starts taking it  a  tad  easier on  the throttle and a  tad \neasier on  the  brakes, doing just enough to keep his job for another year \nor \ntwo. \nThen \nhe \ncan \nretire \nwith \na \ncouple \nof \nmill \nin \nthe \nbank \nand \ncruise \nthrough the  rest of his  life. Nice. \nMany \npit-lane \nengineers \nreckon \ntheir \nbest-paid \nriders \nget \nlazy, \nso  \nthey \nimplore \ntheir \nteam \nmanagers \nto \noffer \nresults-only \ncontracts, \nbut, \nof \n\nHOw TO  FIND THE LIMIT, THEN FATTEN IT 83 \ncourse, \nmost \nriders \nwon't \ngo  \nnear \nthose \ndeals. \nSomehow \nI've \ngot  \nto \nmake \nsure \nthat \nsuccess \ndoesn’t \nturn \nmy  \nkids \ninto \nsloths; \nit \ncould \ncost \nme \na lot \nof money. \nMotoGP Mutterings: March 2001 \nHow to  find the  limit, then fatten it \nGoin’ fast, and we  don’t mean on-the-road fast, we  mean racetrack \nfast, is all  about finding the  limit, bumpin’ right up  against it but  not \ngoing beyond it.  Sounds easy but, of course, isn’t. \nFirst of all, you’ve got to find the limit, that point where gravity takes \nover and dumps you in the dirt. Anyone who’s raced will know that the \nonly way to  find the  limit is by tripping right over the  bastard thing, \nrepeatedly, until you start getting the hang of what where it is (or retire \nwith several broken legs). Yet  where the  limit is  at \nchanges pretty much every time you race. If  you \nchange bike or  tyres, or  even if the  track temperature \nor  weather conditions change, the limit won’t be \nwhere you left  it last time. So you’ve got to find it all \nover again, hopefully not  the  bone-crunchin’ way. \nThis is  true whether you're doing a  track day at \nrainy Cadwell on  a  shagged CBR, or  whether you're \n‘Anyone who’s raced \nwill know that the \nonly way to find the \nlimit is by tripping \nright over the  thing, \nrepeatedly’ \nValentino Rossi on  his peerlessly prepped factory \nNSR500 at  sunny Jerez. Getting it just right is what \nracing is  all  about, the  buzz of rockin’ on  and bending those laws of \nphysics just as  far as  they'll go,  keeping the  bike skating on  the  edge of \ndisaster. As  a  mere mortal you need to  make the limit as  wide as \npossible, so  you know you're there before you're out  the  other side and \non  your arse. You need to  transform that knife-edge into a  big  grey \narea, a  transition phase where you can feel the  tyres running out  of \ngrip. \nYou \ncan \ndo \nthis \nseveral \nways: \nby \nbecoming \naware \nof \nthe \ntransition \nphase, \nby \nsmoothing \nout \nyour \nriding \nto \nimprove \nfeedback \nfrom \ntyres \nand \nsuspension, \nand \nby \nworking \non \nbike \nsettings \nand \ntyre \nchoice \nto \noptimise feel  and feedback. \nInevitably, \nthe \nfaster \nyou’re \ngoing, \nthe \nnarrower \nthe \ngrey \narea \nbecomes, \nso \nyour \nshagged \nCBR \non \nstreet \ntyres \nshould \nhave \na \nmuch \nwider \ntransition \nphase \nthan \nRossi’s \nslick-wearing \nNSR. \nI \nstarted \nracing \n\n84 THE FAST STUFF \non  street-tyred proddie bikes and found it  difficult to  adapt when I \nmoved on  to racers on  slicks. A proddie bike starts getting out  of control \nlong before it actually goes out  of control. The tyres are  squirming, the \nchassis is flexing, it’s  like an  early warning system, you see  the  limit \ncoming, so  you ease off just in time (at least that’s the  idea). GP  bikes \naren’t like that, the chassis is  rock steady, the tyres are gripping, \neverything seems totally cool. Then, whacko, you're flying through the \nair  wondering what the  fuck happened. The grey area was so  narrow \nthat it came and went before you even saw it, but as  you’re hurtling \ntowards pain city, you remember that maybe the  rear did  start sliding \n0.0001 seconds before it let go. \nObviously the skill required to  survive as  the grey area narrows \nincreases exponentially. And, just to  complicate matters further, the \nreally greatest riders can find extra speed by actually shrinking that \ngrey area. They are  the only ones able to use  a tyre that offers more grip \nbut  less feedback. \nMichelin, who have dominated 500 GP  racing for  years, spend vast \nresources on  widening that transition phase just as  wide as  it'll go, \nbecause that’s what all but  a handful of the  world’s riders need. \n‘To  slide like they do,  500 riders need a  huge amount of  feel and \nfeedback,’ explains the  firm’s racing boss Nicolas Goubert. ‘They need \nto  sense exactly what the  tyre is  doing, and from experience, know \nwhat it’s  going to  do  next. Tyre compound and, to  a  lesser extent, \nconstruction are  the  crucial factors in offering excellent feedback. \n‘The more grip a rider has  at his  disposal, the more feel and feedback \nhe needs. What most riders want is a period of warning as  they approach \nthe  limit. It’s  no  good having massive amounts of grip if the  limit is \nreached without any warning, because the rider won’t have the \nconfidence to  approach that limit. Most riders will go  faster with \nslightly less grip and more feedback. Only the  very best riders can go \nfastest with a  huge amount of  grip and minimal feedback, because \ntheir skill allows them to  cope with less of a  transition phase.’ \nMick Doohan is the man Goubert is talking about, and I only mention \nhim because Michelin’s tyre engineers are  still in  awe of the  bloke, \ntheir eyes rolling in the  back of their sockets when they recall what he \ncould do with their tyres. He was so  familiar with them that he reckons \nhe always knew what the  tyres were going to do before they did it. With \nthat kind of knowledge (and faith), ain’t no  one going to  touch you. \n\nWHY DO  PEOPLE RACE? 85 \nMotoGP Mutterings: April 2001 \nThe most basic racing question of all —  why do people race? For \nthe adrenalin rush, you say, but maybe it’s  way more complex \nthan that \nPeople race for  the  buzz, of course, which comes from riding the  edge \nof  disaster. But the risk itself isn’t the real deal, it’s  the feeling of \ncontrolling that risk which is what really gets you going. The risks are \nthere, of  course, but as  Martin Luther King said: ‘If  a  man hasn’t \ndiscovered something that he will die  for, he isn’t fit to live’. Now bike \nracing might not  be the kind of worthy cause that King died for, but it’s \nstill something you go  into eyes wide open, knowing you are  putting \nyourself in the line of fire. And by bringing yourself closer to death, you \nmake living all the  more vivid. \nA  friend of  mine, appalled by  some racing injury, suggested that \nracers must suffer from low self-esteem if  they’re willing to  get \nthemselves so  beat up  on a regular basis. There’s probably some truth \nin  that; certainly, the  desire to  prove yourself is  an  element in  every \nracer’s make-up, it’s  like a  rite of  passage, part of becoming a  man. \nLooking back I now know that was one  of the forces that got me  racing, \nplus the  deeply mistaken belief that it’d  get me  girls. \nPeople also race to challenge themselves, the  sport attracts characters \nwho don’t want an  easy life, who want to  have to work at  things, then \nlook back and feel  rewarded. Take Ducati star Ben Bostrom. Bike racing \nisn’t enough for  him, so  in between World Supers rounds he  goes rock \nclimbing. ‘Climbing is a  different kind of scary from bikes but  it’s  the \nsame \nadrenalin \nrush,’ \nhe \nsays. \n‘When \nyou \nfind \nyourself \nsomewhere \ndifficult \nyou’ve \ngot \nto \npush \nyourself \nand \ndig \ndeeper, \notherwise \nyou'll \nbe \nstuck \nout \nthere \non \nthe \nmountain. \nIt’s \nthe \nsame \nwith \nlap \ntimes, \nif \nyou \nknock \nit \nback \na \nfraction \nand \nrun \nhalf \na \nsecond \na \nlap \nslower, \nyou \nwon't \nwin the  race.’ \nEvery \nracer \nhas \nhis  \nown \nway \nof  \nforcing \nhimself \nto  \nride \nthe  \nlimit, \nto \ndangle \nover \nthe \nprecipice. \nI \nused \nto \nplay \nthe \nhunted, \nconvincing \nmyself \nthat \nthe \nguys \nchasing \nme \nwould \nkill \nme \nif \nthey \ncaught \nme \n(this \nwas \nway \nback \nin \nthe \nearly \n1980s \nwhen \nI \nwas \nwinning \nclub \nraces \non \na \n250LC, \npushing \nout, \nooh, \nat \nleast \n42 \nhorsepower). \nIt \nwas \na \nstriking \nact \nof \nself-delusion \nbut \nI \nremember \nthe \nfeeling \nbeing \nstrangely \nvivid \nand \nvery \neffective. \nI \nsuppose \nit \ntriggered \nsome \nbasic, \nprimeval \nsave-yourself \nreaction \nwhich \nopened \nup \n\n86 THE FAST STUFF \nanother dimension of perception and reaction that helped me  dig deeper \nand scrape a few more tenths per lap. \nRacing is also an  escape from the pressures of the day-to-day world, as \nSteve McQueen once said: ‘Speed has  a  kind of affinity to  me, it’s  the \ntime God and I have our  little talks.’ Riding on  the \ncoeeanie as a road isn’t quite the same, but it’s a few steps down the \n‘Speed has a  kind of same road: slip on  your lid, shut down the black visor \naffinity to me, it’s and get  away. Once you’re moving you’ve no  choice \nthe  time God and I but  to zone in on  the  road ahead and forget the world \nhave our  little talks’ around you, so your mind starts working in a different \nway and things become clearer. In  a  car  you read ad \nhoardings, check out  miniskirts, send text messages \nand read the backs of CDs, trying to find out  who mixed track nine. \nI think that’s another reason I started racing. It was the  only thing \nthat demanded everything of me, totally consumed me, gave my  lazy- \nassed mind no  room to wander uselessly, though having said that, I did \ncrash a few times in my first few seasons because I wasn’t concentrating \non  the job. I’d  find myself cartwheeling through the  gravel trap aware \nthat my mind had been somewhere else. Idiot. Even off-the-track racing \ndemands all of you, so  small wars in faraway big countries and romantic \nbust-ups don’t hit  so  hard. You’re too busy on  your knees in  the \nworkshop, thinking about the  next race, and even if there is some bad \nshit going down, you just channel all  your angst and aggression into \nthe  next race. Racing zoned me  out  of everyday life  for  a  few years to \nthe  extent that I have huge blank spots in my pop memory, like I’ve not \ngot  a  clue what happened on  Top of the  Pops between 1981 and 1985. \nOnly now, watching ancient music vids, do I realise how lucky I was. \n\nCHAPTER 13 \nCOMPUTER HACKER, SHOE \nCOLLECTOR, FUTURE WORLD CHAMP \nMay 2001 \nDaijiro Kato was only halfway through his second GP  season \nwhen we  had this little chat, but the world already expected \nhim to  become Japan’s first-ever MotoGP champion. Sadly, it \nwasn’t to be \nIt’s meet the media time at  Planet Kato. I’m among a  group of  GP \njournalists crammed into Honda’s PR  bus in  the  Le  Mans paddock at \nthe  2001 French GP  the  little man squeezed into the  corner looking \nslightly bemused, for  he’s a  shy  man surrounded by sweaty hacks — \nhangover eyes, pens and notepads at  the  ready. \nSomeone suggests we  should drive to  Skegness for  the  weekend; \nthere’s a  few laughs and Kato giggles politely, even though he hasn’t a \nclue what we’re on  about. We’re speaking to him through an  interpreter \ngirl from Shoei, whose lids Kato wears. The atmosphere is a little \nuneasy —  Japanese GP  riders are  notoriously difficult to  talk to.  The \nlanguage problem makes communication difficult at best and they very \nrarely say much, largely because most of  them are factory riders, \nunwilling to  let  loose their employers’ jealously guarded secrets. Most \ninterviews with Japanese stars of the  GP  scene rarely offer much more \nthan: ‘Yes’, ‘No’, ‘Coming better’ and ‘I  will try  my best’. We are \ndetermined to  try  our best at  squeezing something more out of  this \nridiculously talented 250 bladerunner, but  his  first words are: ‘I  don’t \nspeak much, not  only because I can’t really speak English. I don’t say  a \nlot  anyway, that’s my character.’ You can almost hear the clichés \nclanging \naround \nthe \nbrains \nof \nthe \nassembled \nhacks: \n‘Kato \n— \nthe \nman \nwho lets  his  riding do the  talking’. \nWhich \nis \ntrue. \nNo  \none \nin  \nracing \nhistory \nhas  \nridden \na  \n250 \nas  \nfast \nas \nthis \nwaif-like \n24-year-old, \nwho \nlooks \nmore \nlike \n12  \nin  \nthe  \nflesh. \nKato \nclocks \nlap \ntimes \nthat \nmake \n500 \nriders \nweep \nand \nhe \nrewrites \nthe \nhistory \n\n88 THE FAST STUFF \nbooks pretty much every time he jumps on  his  Honda NSR250 —  a jewel \nof a motorcycle that trips out  102  horsepower, tips the  scales at 96 kilos \nand is good for over 170mph. How trick is that? \nThe  day after we  spoke to him, Kato became the  first man to win the \nopening four rounds of a 250 world championship since Mike Hailwood \nin  1966. And since most experts rate Mike the Bike the greatest racer in \nthe  world ever, that’s a  big  deal. Kato’s French GP  win also took him \npast Mick Doohan’s phenomenal win rate, and not  only that, his current \nwin rate of  41.7 per cent puts him ahead of  men like King Kenny \nRoberts, Freddie Spencer, Wayne Rainey, Eddie Lawson, Kevin Schwantz, \nValentino Rossi and Max Biaggi. To  complete the statistics overload, \nKato already rates as  Japan’s fourth most successful \nGP  rider of all  time, even though he’s only halfway \n‘My dad tried to put through his  second world championship season. And \nme  on  a pocketbike by the  end of 2001, unless something goes horribly \nwhen I was three, wrong, he’ll be  Japan’s best ever. \nI was so  scared Scary-quick Japanese riders are  nothing new on \nI ran  away’ the GP scene but 20  years back there were few \nes < around, because they found life on  the road too \nunbearable, too  different from Nippon. Some would \nhave a  go  in  Europe but after a  few weeks of  unfamiliar food and \nsurroundings, their spirits would plummet and their results would \nfollow. Homesickness would strike too  deep and they’d return to Japan \ncraving raw fish, sushi, green tea  and more familiar surroundings. It’s \nperhaps understandable therefore that the  first Japanese in  GPs were \nmad bastards, fitting the kamikaze stereotype almost too well. Takazumi \nKatayama became Japan’s first world champ in  1977, three years after \nhis GP  debut when his  banzai riding style triggered a  barrage of \ncomplaints \nfrom \nEuropean \nrivals, \nused \nto \na \nmore \ngentlemanly \nstyle. \nHe \nlater turned to  Buddhism to  improve his  riding. \nKato \nbelongs \ntoa  \nvery \ndifferent \nJapanese \ngeneration. \nThe \nglobalisation \nof \neast/west \nculture \nhas \nchanged \neverything. \nKato \nand \nhis \npeers \neat \nBig \nMacs \nand \npasta \nin \nTokyo, \nso \nEurope \ndoesn’t \nseem \nso \ndifferent. \nAnd \nthe \nJapanese \npaddock \ncommunity \nis \nso  \nlarge \nnow \nthat \nhe \nhardly \nhas \ntime \nto \nfeel \nhomesick. \nTechnology \nhas \nalso \nplayed \nits \npart \nin \nmaking \npeople \nfeel  \nmore \nat \nhome \nwherever \nthey \nare, \nand \nlike \nevery \nGP  \nstar, \nKato \nhas  \na \nlaptop \nand \nGSM \ncommunications \nin \nhis  \nmotorhome. \n‘I  \nspend \na \nlot  \nof \ntime \non \nthe \nnet, \nin \non-line \nchat \nrooms, \nand \nI’m \na \nbit \nof \na \ncomputer \n\nCOMPUTER \nHACKER, \nSHOE \nCOLLECTOR, \nFUTURE \nWORLD \nCHAMP \n89 \nhacker. \nSometimes \nI \neven \nspeak \nto \nother \nJapanese \nriders \nby \nemail, \neven \nthough \nthey’re \nalso \nin \nthe \npaddock!’ \nKids \nthese \ndays, \neh? \nDuring \nthe \nGP  \nseason \nKato, \nwife \nMakiko \nand \nsix-month-old \nbaby \nIkko \nbase \nthemselves \non  \nthe \neast \ncoast \nof  \nItaly, \nclose \nto  \nhis  \nteam’s \nworkshops \nin \nthe \nseaside \nresort \nof Rimini \nand \njust \ndown \nthe \nroad \nfrom \nRossi’s \nhome \ntown. \nEver \nsince \n125 nutter \nNobby \nUeda \n— \nthe \nfirst \nof \nthe \nmodern \ngeneration \nof Japanese \nGP \nriders \n— moved \nthere \nduring \nthe \nearly \n1990s, \nJapanese \nand \nItalian \nGP people \nhave \nhad \na \nspecial \naffinity \nfor \neach \nother. \nAs \nthe \nTelefonica-sponsored \nteam’s \npress \nofficer \nsays: \n‘It’s \nan \nexplosive \nmixture \n— \nthe \npassion \nand \ntypically \nfancy \nnature \nof \nthe \nItalians, \njoined \nwith \nJapanese \nscrupulousness \nand \ndevotion.’ \nYes, \nquite. \nKato, who rides full-factory Hondas in  an  outfit run by former 125 \nchamp Fausto Gresini, loves living in  Italy. ‘I love it,  I love the  climate \nand I love Italian food, maybe too  much,’ he smirks, though he’s hardly \ngot a pizza problem. At seven stone and five foot four Kato is the perfect \nshape for 250 racing, not  a knee or  elbow poking outside the bodywork \nof his  tiny NSR. \nKato started riding at  the  tender age  of three after one false start. \n‘My dad was into bikes and he tried to put me  on  a pocketbike, I was so \nscared I ran away. He  ran after me, I tried again and my  fear went.’ \nKato has been riding Honda’s rapier-edged NSR250s since 95, first in \na  Honda Racing Corporation satellite team, and since ’97  with the \nofficial HRC outfit, when he won his  debut GP  contesting Suzuka as  a \nwild card. He  also won that year’s All-Japan 250 title and last season \nfinished third in his  debut world campaign, winning four GPs, two of \nthem at  tracks he’d never even seen before. The man and his  bike have \ngrown up  together, recording god knows how many thousands of laps, \nHRC adjusting every aspect of  engine and chassis performance to \nexactly complement his  riding style. ‘The bike was almost perfect last \nyear,’ he  says. ‘This year it is perfect.’ \nThe \nrider/machine \ncombination \nis  \nso  \ndevastating \nthat \neven \nTetsuya \nHarada \n(currently \nJapan’s \nmost \nsuccessful \nGP \nrider) \nis \nfalling \ninto \na \ndeep \ndepression \nbecause \nhe’s \nfed \nup \nwith \ngetting \nhis \nbutt \nwell \nand \ntruly \nkicked \nby \nthe \nyoung \nupstart. \nWhen \nKato \ncan’t \nrun \naway \nwith \na \nrace, \nhe \nseems \nto \ndelight \nin \ntorturing \nthe \n‘93 \nworld \nchamp, \nrunning \njust \nahead, \nthen \nletting \nHarada \npass, \nbefore \nfinally \nnailing \nhim \non \nthe \nlast \nlap. \nThat’s \nwhat \nhe \ndid \nat \nLe \nMans \nanyway, \nand \nHarada’s \n\n90 THE FAST STUFF \nbody language said it  all;  as  they crossed the line, the Aprilia man \nbowed his  head in  despair and his  wife Miuki burst into tears in  the \npits. You can  understand her  being upset —  it can’t be much fun  living \nwith a beaten man. \nKato admits he  prefers a  bit  of  fairing bashing, even though he’s \nmaking a  habit of winning races by a  mile. ‘I enjoy racing with other \nriders. When you're on your own, it can be difficult to keep concentration, \nmy  mind starts wandering; I start thinking about my  team’s PR  girl, \nMichaela!’ he  says, giggling at  his  own joke. Ah, the  man’s loosening \nup, spreading out on  the sofa, looking us  straight in  the eye and \nrevealing a bit of a  sense of humour. \nOf course, the question everyone wants to ask little Kato is when will \nhe graduate to 500s, or rather GP1, as  next year’s new 990cc four-stroke \nclass is likely to be christened. And will his  artful 250 style translate to \nbigger bikes? \nHe’s already answered that one. While 250s are  his  day job, Kato \nearns extra bucks by riding big lairy four-strokes at  Japan’s huge Suzuka \nEight Hours event. He  won last year’s race, riding a  factory SP1 with \nfellow NSR250 rider Tohru Ukawa, whom Kato quickly demoralised in \nlast  year’s 250  GP  series. And he’s already tested a  500. \nSo  which does he  prefer racing, the  250 or  the SP1? ‘I like the  250 \nmore because my feet don’t touch the ground on  the four-stroke.’ \nMore giggles. \nOf  course, the  chat gets more serious when we  start talking about \nmoney. Has he  already agreed terms with HRC for  2002? ‘Not yet, I \nhave no  contract with HRC for 2002. And if I don’t get a lot more money, \nI'll  quit and go  somewhere else.’ Fighting talk for a man from Japan, \nwhere job-for-life loyalty was once the cornerstone of  the nation’s \neconomy. Not any more. Nowadays people get sacked and made \nredundant \nin \nJapan \njust \nlike \nanywhere \nelse, \nand \nworkers \nare \nonly \nas \nloyal \nas \nthey \nwant \nto \nbe. \nFive \nyears \nago \nHarada \ncaused \na \nsensation \nwhen he  quit long-time employers Yamaha to  ride for  Aprilia, but \nnowadays \nit’d \nbe \nno \nbig \ndeal \nif \nKato \nspat \nhis \ndummy \nand \nmoved \non \nfrom Honda. \nSo \nwhat \ndoes \nhe \nspend \nall \nhis \nmoney \non?  \nWhen \nhe \nfirst \ncame \nto \nGPs, \nhis  \nPR \nprofile \nnamed \nshoe \ncollecting \nas  \nhis \nfavourite \nhobby, \nwhich \nmust \nmake \nhim \nthe \nImelda \nMarcos \nof \nGP \nracing. \nThe \nJapanese \ntrainer \nobsession \nis \na \nwell-documented \nnational \nphenomenon \nbut \nKato \nhas \n\nCOMPUTER HACKER, SHOE COLLECTOR, FUTURE WORLD CHAMP 9] \nnow kicked his  footwear habit, thanks to  sterling support from the \nmissus. ‘I used to  have too  many shoes, so  my  wife started throwing \nthem away, now no  more shoe collecting.’ Ah, the  lifestyles of the  rich \nand famous. \nKato may be a bit kooky but he’s also fast  as  fuck. So fast in fact that \nhe may be the  man to take on  and beat current 500  dominator, the  self- \nstyled Doctor Rossi, when he  graduates to  the  big class. The pair have \nonly shared the  same racetrack on  a few occasions —  on  250s and four- \nstrokes —  and so  far  Kato has always come out on  top. Watch out Dr \nRossi, your time may be at  hand. \nEpilogue: Kato did indeed go on  to win the 250 world title in 2001 and \nhe  had Rossi worried a  few times when he  moved up  to  MotoGP in \n2002. Named the man most likely to  steal Rossi’s crown in  2003, \nDaichan died after receiving massive injuries in  a  horrific high-speed \ncrash at  the  season-opening Suzuka GP. \n\nCHAPTER 14 \nNUTTER’ S DELIGHT — \nTHE CULT OF  ELSIE \nJune 2001 \nA  dewy-eyed retrospective of the Cult of LC, the lunatic two- \nstroke twin that helped give us  the supersport bikes of today \nThere’ve been plenty of legendary machines in biking history: Ducati’s \n900SS and 916, Honda’s RC30 and the  original CB750, Norton’s Manx \nsingle and Yamaha’s R1.  All  these bikes hold their place in  history for \npushing the limits of performance to new levels, but however impressive \nthey once were or  still are, they’ll never be as  great as  Yamaha’s RD250 \nand 350LC. \nWhile the 900SS, 916, RC30, CB750, Manx and R1  have changed \nmotorcycling forever, they aren’t bikes of  the people, they’re exotic, \ncostly machines owned only by the  lucky few, unlike the  LC.  No  other \nhumble, small-capacity motorcycle ever had such an  effect on  biking as \ndid  Yamaha’s first water-cooled sports bikes, descended directly from \nthe  marque’s ridiculously successful TZ250 and 350  GP  racers. And the \nLC  was the touchpaper for  today’s four-stroke superbikes, as  R1/R6 \nproject leader Kunihiko Miwa says: ‘With the  R  family we  wanted to \nre-create the  RD  sensation’. \nBetween 1980 and 1985 Yamaha sold almost 30,000 LCs in  Britain, \nand the  LC  was much more than just a  runaway sales success, more \neven than a  milestone in  sports bike history. The LC  was a cultural \nphenomenon, provoking the  Cult of Elsie that tore up  racetracks, dual \ncarriageways and town centres all  over Britain throughout the 1980s. \nFor years, LCs  dominated Britain’s sports bike scene and ruled club and \nnational racing. \nThe  LC hit  the  streets at a volatile moment in modern British history. \nPunk rock and new wave had swept all  before them in  the  preceding \ntwo or  three years, Maggie Thatcher and the  Tories had got  in  the \nprevious summer and the  country was a  seething mass of disaffected \n\nNUTTER’S \nDELIGHT \n—  \nTHE \nCULT \nOF  \nELSIE \n93 \nyouth, \nhalf \nof \nthem \non  \nthe \ndole, \nall \nof \nthem \nangry. \nUnemployment \nwas \nriding \nout  \nof \ncontrol \nand \nthe  \nkids \nwere \nrevolting. \nThere \nwas \na  \nfeeling \nthat \nsomething \nbig \nwas \ngonna \nhappen, \nthat \na \nrevolution \nwas \nJust \naround \nthe \ncorner. \nPerhaps \nit \nwas \nmere \ncoincidence, \nbut \nwithin \na \nyear \nof \nthe \nlaunch \nof \nthe \nLC, \nBritain \nwas \nburning \nup. \nFrom \nBrixton \nto \nLiverpool \nand \nfrom \nBristol \nto \nNottingham \nthere \nwere \nriots, \ntorching \nand \nlooting, \nthousands \nof \nyoungsters \nventing \ntheir \nfury \nagainst \na \ngovernment \nthat \nhad \ncut \npublic \nspending \nby \n£1000 \nmillion \nin \nits \nfirst \nbudget. \nIt’s \nhard \nto \ncredit \n20 \nyears \non, \nbut \nthe \ncountry \nWas \nteetering \non \nthe \nbrink \nof \nanarchy. \nYou couldn’t imagine a motorcycle better suited to ‘The LC was the \nsuch a seductive climate of mayhem. The LC was the touchpaper for \ndo-anything-you-want-to-do motorcycle (as punk today’s superbikes, \nband Eddie and the  Hot  Rods had sung a year or  two as  Yamaha says: \nearlier): buy one cheap, learn to  wheelie, get  pissed, “with the R1/R6 we \noutrun the  cops, crash out  at  the  squat, crawl out  of wanted to re-create \nbed next afternoon to  collect the  dole. It was about the RD  sensation \nas  anti-establishment as  you could get  in  an  age =a   es ear geet \nwhen just about every kid  hated the  establishment. \nAnd because LCs weren’t RI  expensive, it  didn’t matter if  you \ncrashed. In  fact the  cult of lunacy demanded you ride like  an  idiot and \nfall  like a  fool. LC  owners wore their dinged fuel tanks and scraped \nspannies with pride; after all,  a  scratch-free LC  could only belong to  a \nwimp. Anyway, the things were made for crashing and became more so \nas  aftermarket manufacturers created all  kinds of crash protectors, like \nspecial handlebar kits that covered the all-too vulnerable clocks console, \nallowing owners to  jump off  more often for  less money. Once again, \nthese bolt-on extras were a  symbol of hoodlum cred, but counted for \nnothing if  they too didn’t bear telltale scars of  excess speed and \ninsufficient judgement. After all, the early 1980s weren’t all about track \ndays and advanced riding techniques, it was just nail the  throttle and \nwait for  something scary to  happen. \nIt  was, of course, the  LC  powerband, that seven-grand kick up  the \narse, that got kids whipped into a  frenzy. The original 250LC, launched \nsome months before its  bigger-bored big brother in  the  spring of  1980, \ndidn’t \nmake \noutrageous \nhorsepower, \nit \njust \nfelt \nlike \nit \ndid. \nWhat \nreally \nmattered \nwas \nthat \nit \nwas \nthe \nworld’s \nfirst \ntrue \nton-up \n250, \nand \nthis \nin \nthe \ndays \nwhen \nnovices \ncould \nwalk \ninto \na \nshop, \nbuy \na \n250 \non \ncredit, \n\n94 THE FAST STUFF \nattach a  couple of L-plates and wheelie off  down the  road, probably \nstraight into an  oncoming Ford Escort. Without doubt Yamaha's \nhooligan creation played rather a  large part in  the government’s \nintroduction of  new learner laws the following year that restricted \nbeginners to  12bhp, 65mph 125s. That’ll learn ya. \nThe 350 turned up  in  the  autumn of  1980, visually identical except \nfor  a  second front disc brake and 350 stickers on  the  sidepanels. In \nstandard form it wasn’t the  loon tool everyone had expected, but with \na bit  of judicious work with a riffler file  and lathe, it rocked. The 350’s \narrival only accelerated the establishment of  a  countrywide cottage \nindustry dedicated to turning LCs  into insane streetbikes, nutty proddie \nracers or  full-blown open-class race bikes. Tuners like Stan Stephens, \nRob Farnham and Dave Swarbrick became legends in pubs and paddock \ncafés across the  land, their names dropped whenever an  owner felt  the \nneed to  impress: ‘Yeah, I just got  a  Stephens stage-three done on  me \n350, it wheelies in third now, no  problem.’ ‘Nah, mate, you wanna get \nsome Swarbrick pipes innit, really sort the  powerband they do.’ \nIt was perhaps inevitable that this LC-evoked infatuation with speed \nwould lead a  lot  of owners to  take to  the  racetrack, many of them not \nthrough choice, having lost their licences through repetitive madness \non  the streets. Club racing throughout Britain became an  LC  fest, \nbattered, rusting Transit vans arriving in paddocks from Brands Hatch \nto  Knockhill, each disgorging two or  three LCs and their spotty, \ndishevelled owners (me  amongst them), who would race in just about \nevery class going: production, formula and open-class events. Clean up \nin  them all  too. But  proddie racing was the  big deal —  with gridfuls of \nLCs and nothing else. These were the  years when British club racing \ncollectively removed its  brain, placed it in  a  toolbox and went out  to \nrace. The 250 and 350 proddie classes were the  big  entertainment at \nevery Club meet, nicknamed Demolition Derby, Headbangers, anything \nthat suggested brain-dead, elbow-to-elbow racing with not a  thought \nfor your own, or  anyone else’s, safety. \nThe racing was totally insane. I know because I spent my  second and \nthird seasons racing a 250LC. Six lap, 12 mile races at  Snetterton would \nstart with 40  riders and end with less than 20  crossing the  finish line. \nFirst corners would claim five or  six  victims —  I remember having tyre \nmarks on  my  bike’s fuel tank, and across my leathers and helmet after \none turn-one mass pile-up. And it was rare for  a  race to  go  its  full \n\nNUTTER’S \nDELIGHT \n—  \nTHE \nCULT \nOF  \nELSIE \n95 \ncourse \nwithout \ngetting \nred  \nflagged \nto \nallow \nfallen \nbikes \nand \nriders \nto \nbe \ndragged \nout \nof  \nharm’s \nway \nbefore \nthe \naction, \nand \nfurther \ncarnage, \nresumed. \nWeekend \nmeets \ngot  \nwilder \nand \nwilder, \nhuge \nSaturday \nnight \npiss-ups \nin \nthe  \nSnetterton \npaddock \nbar \nwere \nfollowed \nby \nSunday’s \nfirst \nrace \nat \n10am, \nstill \npissed. \nNo \none \nreally \nseemed \nto \ncare \n— \nif-you \ntipped \noff, \nLCs \nwere \ncheap \nto \nfix \nand \nyou \ncould \nalways \nblag \nspares \noff \nsome \nother \nLC \nowner \nin \nthe \npaddock. \nOr \nnick \na \nstreet \nbike. \nVarious \npolice \nraids \nin \nthe \nlate \n1980s \nestablished \nthat \na \nlarge \nproportion \nof \nproddie \nLCs \nwere \nstolen; \nand \nno \none \nseemed \nvery \nsurprised. \nSerious \nphysical \ninjuries \nseemed \nto \nbe \nremarkably \nfew \nand \nfar \nbetween. \nMere \nscabs \nand \nbroken \nbones \nwere \nthings \nto be \nadmired \nand \nlaughed \nat, \nand \nanyway, \nthe \nnurses \nat Norwich \nhospital \nwere \njust \nthe \ncutest. \nMy first LC,  bought on  hire purchase in the  spring of ’81  (I didn’t tell \nmy bank manager what I was going to  do with the  bike), never did  the \nbusiness. The squish band was too  big, or  the  exhaust port too  low, \nsomething like that, but  my  ’82  250 was a  rocketship. That summer I \nwon 40 races on  the bike, and a 350  borrowed from a mate, set  a few  lap \nrecords at  Brands and Snett and used one  front tyre all season. I think I \nmay also have changed the piston rings at  some point, but  I’m  not  sure. \nThe cult of Elsie spawned some pretty serious racers too. Mick Doohan \nwon five 500  world titles, ending up  earning ten  million a  year, after a \ntypical mid-1980s entry to the sport, on an  LC. He had bought a 250  (called \nan  RZ250 Down Under) for the  street and lost his licence five  times before \nhe  was 20  for  speeding, pulling wheelies, the  usual LC  lunacy. He  also \ncrashed the  bike a  lot  —  pretty much totalling the  thing on a trip to \nAustralia’s infamous Bathurst races in ’83, looping the bike after a wheelie \nwent wrong, then riding into the  side of a car  in a gas  station. He replaced \nthe wreck with one  of the just-out YPVS RZ350s, persuading his  dealer to \naffix 250  stickers to the  sidepanels because he didn’t have a full licence. \nDoohan was a  typical LC  hoon —  fast as  you like and not giving a \nflying fuck about anything. He’d fool around on  the street and \noccasionally fork out a  few bucks to  hustle around his  local Surfers \nParadise racetrack, as  elder brother Scott remembers. ‘He  never used to \ncheck the  tyre pressures or  anything. He’d be sliding around with 15psi \nin \nthe \ntyres, \nwith \nhis \nshirt \nhanging \nout \nbetween \nhis \ntwo-piece \nleathers. \nHe \nwas \na \nbit \nloose \nin \nthose \ndays \n— \nit \nwas \njust \nall \ngood \nfun.’ \nExactly. \nDoohan \nonly \nstarted \nracing \nbecause \na \nmate \nhad \nborrowed \nhis  \nRZ  \nand \nstacked \nit.  \nHis  \nlocal \ndealer \n—  \nhaving \nwitnessed \nMicky \nD’s  \ntalent \non  \ndirt \n\n96 THE FAST STUFF \ntrackers —  offered to fix the bike for free if he could be bothered to enter \na race. The rest, as  they say,  is history. \nMulti-British champ Niall Mackenzie also started his  career on  an \nLC.  ‘My first road bike was a  350. I’d  read about them a  few months \nearlier and reckoned they were the  most gorgeous bikes ever built, so  I \nscrimped every penny to  get one. Within a few  months I was racing. \n‘I was 19 with a death wish. I didn’t care about anything —  crashing, \nargy-bargy on  the  track, everything was fine. LCs were hooligans’ bikes \nfor  young kids, not  born-again bikers. You could throw them around, \nthey were easy to ride and pretty safe.’ \nMackenzie’s LC  career ended with the Pro-Am championship, a \nberserk, televised one-make series introduced in  1981 that perfectly \nencapsulated the sheer madness of  the LC  era. Pro-Am had been \ndesigned for mass-appeal armchair entertainment and provided exactly \nthat: full  ITV coverage (in an  age  when bikes never made it onto TV), \nserious prize money (£500 for a win was serious money back then) and, \nmost of all,  bikes loaned (and fixed) free by the  Yamaha importers. A \nrecipe for  serious trouble. \nThe Ams were riders in  their first year of international racing, the \nPros were a  bit,  but not much, more experienced. Competitors were \nallocated bikes by lucky dip, picking keys out  of a  hat  minutes before \npractice got under way, thus preventing any sneaky tuning. The racing \nwas never less  than terrifyingly close and though Mackenzie never won \nthe  series, he had plenty of laughs. \n‘It  was wild and it couldn’t happen nowadays because it wouldn’t \nwork with all  the  different sponsors and teams. We  were mental, we \ndidn’t care if we  crashed. It was free racing —  free bikes, wreck as  many \nas  you liked and no  one complained, and brilliant prize money. So you \ncould really put  it on  the  line and, if you got away with it, you'd win. I \ndidn’t care what happened, if I crashed spectacularly it was on  TV  so \nthat was a big result and if I won I was a hero; it was a no-lose situation. \nThere were always lots of  spectacular crashes and you'd just pick \nyourself up  and get  back on; you don’t get  injured the same when \nyou're 20  as  you do when you're 30 plus. , \n‘There'd \nbe  \nten  \ndifferent \nleaders \nevery \nlap. \nI \nwas \nthe  \noriginal \nleft- \nhand-on-the-fork-leg, \nboth-feet-up-on-the-seat \nmerchant. \nThe \nantics \ngot  \npretty \ncrazy, \nhitting \neach \nothers’ \nkill  \nbuttons \nand \nso  \non.  \nEverything \nseemed \nto  \nhappen \nin  \nslow \nmotion \nand \npretty \nmuch \nanything \nwent. \nA \n\nNUTTER’S DELIGHT —  THE CULT OF  ELSIE 97 \nfair \namount \nof \nkicking \nwent \non  \n—  \nthat \nwas \nfairly \nserious \nand  \nmalicious, \na  \nlot  \nof  \nit  \ninstigated \nby \nAlan \nCarter \n(who \nwent \non  \nto  \nwin \nthe \n1983 \nFrench \n250 \nGP). \nThe \nYamaha \nimporters \nsometimes \ngot \na \nbit \nconcerned \nthat \nit \ncould \nall \ngo \na \nbit \npear-shaped \nbut \nluckily \nit \nnever \ndid.’ \nMackenzie's final race on  an LC was the ’83  Euro final at Hockenheim \n—  by then the  LC  cult had spread far  beyond these shores. Mackenzie, \nKenny Irons (who also went on  to  race GPs but  got  killed in ’88), and \na  few others, including myself (I’d finished top  Am in that year’s UK \nseries), made up  the  British team. Mackenzie and Co  blazed a trail of \nchaos through Germany that autumn, crashing hire cars, doing runners \nfrom bars (no doubt confused by the  continental system of not  paying \nfor your drinks round by round) and terrifying the  foreigners. \nThey had the  number-one French hope in tears after ganging up  on \nthe  guy during practice and running him off the  track at  100mph-plus. \nAnd they dealt with the  threat of super-quick Brit Steve Chambers — \nwho was being dead serious, going to bed  every night at a sensible time \n—  by calling up whores from the  local brothel and sending them round \nto  his  hotel room in the  early hours. Irons lucky-dipped a dog of an  LC \nand compensated for  its  lack of speed by pulling himself past anyone \nahead by hauling on  the  leading bike’s pillion grabrail, then swerving \nviolently, forcing Johnny Foreigner to  back off  or  risk a  high-speed \nendo. Manxman Graham Cannell won the race by  a  gnat’s from \nChambers, and the  defeated continentals shuffled home, struck dumb \nby the  Brits’ full-on aggression. But it was only what Cannell and Co \nhad been doing at  home for years. \nThat LC  madness is still going on  today, there’s LC nutters out  on  the \ntrack and at large on  the  streets, though in much diminished numbers. \nWhile the  machine’s status as  a  race-winning phenomenon may have \nwithered somewhat, there’s now a special class for  LCs. Formula LC  is \na  cheap, fun  way of getting into a  fun, not-so-cheap sport. Bikes go  for \na \nfew \nhundred \nand \nbeginners \ncan \neven \nrent \nan \nLC \nracer \nfor \n£150 \nper \nmeet. \nJust \ndon’t \nask \nhow \nmany \ntimes \nyour \nbike’s \nbeen \ncrashed. \nOn  \nthe  \nstreets, \nthe  \nLC’s \nsignature \nchain-saw \nmassacre \nexhaust \nwail \nis \na \nrare \nsound \nand \nowners \nare \nso \nfew \nand \nfar \nbetween \nthat \nthey \nhave \nto \ncommunicate \non \nthe \nnet, \nlogging \nonto \nsites \nlike \nrd.linefeed.com. \nBut \ngood \nto \nhear \nthey \nkeep \nthe \n‘Sod \nyou \nall!’ \npunk \nspirit \nalive \nwith \nangry \ndiscussions \non \nthe \nsite’s \npacked \nmessage \nboard. \n‘Was \nlast \nnight’s \nChelsea \nrun \nany \ngood? \nCouldn’t \nmake \nit  \nmeself,’ \n\n98 THE FAST STUFF \nasks one LC  idiot. ‘The run  was good —  glad you weren’t there!’ comes \nthe reply from some other loon. ‘It must be hard being a moron,’ comes \nback number-one LC  geezer: ‘It’s a  good job your parents gave you a \nname with only three letters or  you’d have been struggling with any \nmore than that.’ Morons one and all, just the way it should be. \nLC  history lesson \nThe original RD250LC —  descendant of  the air-cooled RD250, itself \ndescended from Yamaha’s original sports twin, the  1959 YDS1 —  appeared \nin  Britain in  the  spring of  1980. It was a  true milestone machine and \nstayed on  sale for  six years, undergoing just a handful of minor changes \nduring that period; the bike was that good from the  start. \nThe fully square 54  x  54mm motor employed technology learned \nfrom Yamaha’s range of TZ250 and 350 racers but  was nevertheless a \nfairly straightforward piston-ported two-stroke with reed-valve \ninduction. Bullet-proof —  until club-race owners started doing dodgy \nhome-tuning jobs —  the  stock motor made over 30bhp, with well-tuned \nversions exceeding 40bhp. \nThe 108mph 350, with 10mm bigger bore, turned up half a year later, \nlooking identical to  the  250 but for  an  extra disc. Yamaha claimed 47 \nhorsepower from this engine and, like the  250, it  responded well to \nsimple but clever tune-up jobs. And, also like the 250, the chassis \nneeded few modifications for  the track: fit  some KR124 Dunlops \n(KR124 front/Michelin TG22 rear were the  go later on), stick spacers in \nthe  forks and you’re winning races and setting lap records. \nUnlike the 250, the 350 did undergo a major revision. The much-changed \nmark two version appeared in  1983, with handlebar and belly fairing, \nuprated chassis and YPVS exhaust control. The motor was undoubtedly \nmore powerful and easier to  use  than the  original, with a  smooth 59bhp \nand 115mph top  speed. Full-race versions could be tweaked to  a genuine \n70bhp plus. The new chassis was appreciated by road riders though racers \nweren’t so  keen on  the handling. Nevertheless, it came to rule the 350  and \n500  proddie classes, just as  its predecessor had done. \nLater versions of the  YPVS were given unpretty full sports fairings \nand, as  sales faded in the  mid-to-late 1980s, production was moved to \nYamaha’s Brazilian factory, where the last  RD  rolled off the line in 1995. \nIt  seems only right that such a  mad motorcycle should end its  days \nbeing built by Brazilians, people who know how to  have a mad time. \n\nCHAPTER 15 \nTHE \nEMPEROR \nWHO \nWANTED \nTO \nBE \nKING \nJuly 2001 \nMax Biaggi had a horrible job in 2001 —  trying to  beat Valentino \nRossi for the last 500  title and fighting his nemesis for the love of \nthe Italian fans. There was only ever going to be one winner \nIt’s not  easy being Max Biaggi. You're racing Valentino Rossi, everyone’s \nfavourite GP rider. Beat him and everyone hates you, get beaten by him \nand everyone thinks you’re a  wuss. Win or  lose, you lose. You're the \nbad guy, he’s the  good guy, end of story. \nThen you go  and have a  punch-up. No  one really knows who won, \nbut  everyone just hates you some more, or  at  least, that’s the  theory. \nAnd yet  Max Biaggi seems to  have come out  of the  infamous scrap at \nthe  2001 Catalan GP  winning respect. Mostly, the  self-styled Roman \nEmperor courts unpopularity for  his  apparent arrogance but  the  feud \nhas  uncovered a possibly surprising streak of dignity. \nThe notorious fracas, which followed the pair’s one-two at Catalunya, \ndemands deeper examination of  their relationship and individual \npsyches. For years it’s  been known that they don’t get  on; they’re \nirreconcilable. Biaggi’s background is  black-and-white different from \nRossi's, which surely goes some way to  explaining their very different \nattitudes to  life  —  Rossi the  laidback, sometimes shabby young liberal \nwho likes to get messy in nightclubs, Biaggi the intense thirtysomething \nwith the  painstakingly crafted goatee who once had tea  with the  pope \nand a rumoured romance with supermodel Naomi Campbell (with the \nemphasis on  ‘rumoured’ ). \nTo  be  fair, Biaggi hasn’t had the  fairytale life  that his  nemesis has \nenjoyed; his  road to  the  top  has been altogether tougher. While Rossi \ngrew up  in  a  loving family environment (his parents divorced but \nstayed \nneighbours \nand \nfriends), \nracing \nminibikes \nfrom \nthe \nage \nof \nfour, \ncoached \nby \nhis \nGP-winning \ndad, \nBiaggi \nwas \nbrought \nup \nby \nhis \nfather \n\n100 THE FAST STUFF \nafter his  mother deserted her  husband and young child. He  didn’t go \nnear a racetrack until he was 18. As such he’s probably the latest starter \nin MotoGP, surrounded by rivals who were mostly riding or  racing by \nthe  age  of four or  five. Rossi rode his  first bike race in  1990 at  the  age \nof ten, one  year after Biaggi started his  career aged 18.  On  top  of that, \nthey’re rival suitors for  the  love of the  Italian fans, and the  millions of \neuros that come with that devotion. \nLooking back over the  years, it’s  always been Rossi who’s wanted to \nmake something out  of their rivalry. ‘It’s simple,’ Rossi told me  a  few \nsummers back. ‘I don’t like Max and he  don’t like me.’ And he rarely \nmisses a chance to mock, whether he’s riding a victory lap with a blow- \nup  doll to  diss Biaggi’s alleged affair with Naomi Campbell, or  tipping \nhim a contemptuous wink on  the  podium. \nBiaggi never even publicly acknowledged his long-running feud with \nRossi until after the  fisticuffs. ‘My only defence is to  say  nothing,’ he \nnods. ‘By  getting involved I have everything to  lose and nothing to \ngain.’ All he will say is that Rossi only whacked him once someone had \nBiaggi’s arms behind his back. ‘That wasn’t nice,’ he says, face flecking \nwith hurt. ‘It was unfair.’ No  one really seems to know exactly who did \naSe    Ate: what in that chaotic melee, but  the  roles of bad  guy, \njoan good guy don’t seem so  clear any more. There’s a \n‘Rossi is clever, he new and darker side to The Doctor. \ngets energy from all According to one  witness of the contretemps, Biaggi \nthis, but I think managed to headbutt Rossi’s team manager while the \npeople \nget \ntired \nof \nit’ \nguy  \nhad \nhis  \narms \nbehind \nhis \nback, \ngiving \nRossi’s \nboss \nCae \nears \nen \na \nblack \neye. \nThen \nhe \nmanaged \nto \nfight \nfree, \nclocking \nRossi \nin the \nface. \nIf \nyou \nwere \nlooking \nfor \na points \ndecision \nin \nthe \nabsence \nof \na \nknockout, \nyou'd \nhave \nto \ngive \nthe \nfight \nto \nMighty \nMax. \nEven \nbetter \nwas \nhis \nanswer \nto \nsomeone \nwho \nasked \nhim \nwhat \nhad \ncaused \nthe \ngraze \non \nhis \nface. \n‘Oh, \na \nmosquito \nbit \nme,’ \nhe \nreplied, \nexhibiting \nthat \nskill \nfor \nlightning-quick \nput-downs \npossessed \nonly \nby \nthe \nvery proud, like  Romans and the  British aristocracy. \nBiaggi \ninsists \nhe’s \nbaffled \nby \nthe \nwhole \nrivalry, \nwhich \nstarted \nin \na \nSuzuka \nrestaurant \nback \nin \n1997 \nafter \nRossi \nhad \ntaken \na \npop \nat \nhis \nelder \non \nItalian \nTV. \n‘We \nonly \nstarted \nracing \ntogether \nin \n2000 \nbut \nit \nfeels \nlike \nRossi’s \nbeen \nracing \nme \never \nsince \nhe \nwas \nin \n125s. \nIt’s \nnot \nnormal \nto \nhave \na \ngo \nat \nanother \nrider \nwhen \nyou're \nnot \neven \nin \nthe \nsame \nclass. \nIt’s \nlike \nme \nsaying \nTroy \nBayliss \n[then \nriding \nin \nWorld \nSuperbikes] \nis \nan \n\nTHE EMPEROR WHO WANTED TO  BE  KING 101 \nidiot; why would I want to fight him if we’re not  racing together? Rossi \nis clever, he gets energy from all this, but  I think people get tired of it.’ \nEight years Rossi’s senior, Biaggi was first on  the  GP  scene, though \nhe  only started racing a  year before his  arch-rival. While Rossi was \nraised on bikes by his  GP-winning dad, Biaggi had nothing to  do with \nthem until a  visit to  a  racetrack in his  18th year. Now 30,  he  came to \nGPs four years later, and won four back-to-back 250  titles from ’94,  the \nfirst three with Aprilia, the  fastest 250s of the  era. But  then he fell  out \nwith his  Italian employers and made an  apparently ill-judged switch to \nHonda for ‘97, winning the title again, against all the odds. That success \nsecured Honda 500s for  the  following year, when he had Mighty Mick \nDoohan rattled, an  achievement of which he’s still proud. ‘Mick had an \neasy life  until I came to  500s, I put some fire  on  his  back!’ \nWhile Doohan stayed at  Honda, Biaggi wasn’t going to  get  full- \nfactory support, so  he moved again, joining Yamaha, even if that meant \nhe was back to  riding second-best machinery. The  Yamaha YZR is good \nnow, though not as  perfect as  Honda’s NSR, and that’s something \nBiaggi never lets  anyone forget. \n‘Rossi is lucky, he’s always in the right place at the right time, he had \nthe best bikes in  125s and  250s and now he has  the best 500, the Honda \nhas some magic. At  the  end of ’98  it was obvious Honda would never \nput me  in  the HRC team, so  my destiny was elsewhere. I’m not a \nmagician, how could I have known Doohan would stop in  ’99?\" So \nBiaggi is used to  the  underdog role. ‘In  ’97  I proved you can  win if you \nreally believe you can do  it —  I have a  strong mind.’ \nSince \n1999 \nBiaggi \nhas \nworked \nceaselessly \nto  \nimprove \nhis  \nYZR500s, \ncommitting \nto \na \ngruelling \ntest \nprogramme \nthat \nfew \nother \nriders \nwould \neven \ncontemplate. \n‘In \n’99 \nthe \nYamaha \nwas \nnowhere. \nI’m \nproud \nbecause \nwe've \nmade \nthe \nbike \nbetter, \nand \nif \nwe \nmake \nanother \nstep \nforward \nit'll \nbe \nhard \nfor \nHonda \nto \nwin. \nI \njust \nhope \nthey \ndon’t \nmake \nanother \njump. \nThe \nHonda’s \nstrongest \npoint \nis \nits \nengine, \nit \nbrings \na \nbig \nbenefit \nto \nthe \nbike. \nIn \n1999 \nthe \nYamaha \nwas \nnowhere, \nHonda \nwas \nwinning \neverything. \nTo \nstart \noff \nin \n‘99, \nthe \nYamaha’s \ncrankshaft \nwas \ntoo \nlight, \nso \nI \nasked \nfor \na \nheavier \ncrank \nto \nimprove \nthrottle-to-tyre \nconnection. \nThe \nnext \nyear \nall \nthe \nYamaha \nriders \nhad \nthe \nsame \ncrank, \nand \nthat \nwas \nbetter \nfor \neveryone. \nMy \njob \nisn’t \njust \nto \nfight \nfor \nthe \nchampionship, \nit’s \nto \nbe \na \ntest \nrider. \n‘Bven \nat  \nthe \nstart \nof \nthe \n2001 \nseason \nwe  \ndidn’t \nhave \nthe  \nright \nset-up, \nwe \nwent \nthe \nwrong \nway \nat \nthe \nfirst \ntwo \nraces. \nI’ve \nalso \nchanged \nmy \n\n102 THE FAST STUFF \nstyle to  better suit the  500. I’m  trying to  go  in deeper, then stand the \nbike up,  so  I can get  on  the  throttle sooner. Riding the  500 like a  250 \ndoesn’t make sense, you can only be  fast until the rear tyre starts \nsliding, then you struggle.’ \nThe contest for the last-ever 500 crown is drawing into its final stages. \nRossi has  been ahead since the  start but  the  upcoming tracks suit the \nYamaha, and Biaggi is one of those rare people who gets off on  stress, \nthe  kind that buckles normal minds. ‘I won three of my  four 250 titles \nat  the  last race, I respond well to  pressure.’ He  was also the  highest- \nscoring rider in the  final phases of both the  1999 and 2000 series, and \nthere’s every reason to  expect he’ll have an  even stronger finish to  this \nseason. \nThis title fight is going to be a close call, scarily close probably, because \nthe  pair have already ridden into each other at  120mph. It’s  a bit  of a \nworry, really, but  it’s  going to be great watching history unfold. \nEpilogue: Biaggi went on  to  get  soundly beaten for the  2001 500  title, \ncrashing out  of several crucial races as  he vainly tried to stay with Rossi. \nThings didn’t get  any better when MotoGP went four-stroke in 2002 — \nBiaggi was on  the  hopeless Yamaha, Rossi on  the  awesome Honda. \nBiaggi got a Honda ride for  2003 but  still couldn’t win. His  ignominy \nwas complete when Rossi switched to  Yamaha in  2004 and won the \ntitle again. \n\nCHAPTER 16 \n“HOLY FUCK, THESE GUYS ARE \nDOIN’ SOME REALLY SCARY STUFF’ \nJuly 2001 \nFormer 500 legend Kevin Schwantz talks about 500 GPs, crashing \nPorsches and having fun on  his  200mph ‘Busa streetbike \nKevin Schwantz was the  Valentino Rossi of  the  late 1980s and early \n1990s. Hugely popular, he won fans for  his  give-it-everything-you-got \nriding style and a  dogged determination to  have a  ball, whatever he \nwas doing, wherever he was doing it. \nRevvin’ Kevin first made it big  in  the States, muscling Yoshimura \nGSX-R750s into submission while commencing a bitter and career-long \nrivalry with Wayne Rainey. The two took their fight to GPs in  1988 and \npretty much dominated the  world championship scene until Rainey’s \ncrippling accident in  1993. Following Rainey’s hat-trick of titles, Texan \nSchwantz won the  crown that year, but, with the  man he loved to beat \nthe  most in a  wheelchair, he was never the  same again. Having built a \nreputation for  ridiculously brave (or  foolish) comebacks from injury, \nSchwantz retired from racing midway through '95, suffering major \nproblems with a much-battered wrist and hip. He  took the last  of his 25 \nGP  wins at  Donington ’94. \nAfter he  quit, Schwantz didn’t go  near a  motorcycle for  a  year or  so. \nHe  tried his  hand at  car  racing, without much success, and is now back \ninto two wheels in  a  big  way. He  is  now rider adviser to  Suzuki's US \nSuperbike team, dispensing wise words to  factory Yoshimura GSX-R \nriders like US  champ Mat Mladin. He  also runs a  GSX-R race school at \nRoad Atlanta. In  other words his  life  revolves around GSX-Rs, just like \nit did  in the  mid-1980s. \nMostly, anyway. When we  met up  during the 2001 Italian GP  at \nMugello \nhe’d \nbeen \nriding \n— \nof \nall \nthings \n— \nan \nR1100RS \nin \na \nBMW \nBoxer \nrace. \nThis \nwas \nhis \nfirst \nroadrace \nsince \nhe \nquit \nGPs \nand \nit \nwas \nhardly \na \nspectacular \nreturn. \nRiding \npurely \nfor \nfun, \nthe \nouting \nfailed \nto \n\n104 ' THE FAST STUFF \nre-ignite Schwantz’s famous will to  win, and there’s no  GP  comeback \non  the cards. \n‘It'd be fun to come back but I’d only want to do it when the weather’s \nperfect, when it’s a track I like and when we've got the set-up, otherwise \nI don’t want to know!’ he smiles, that famous ear-to-ear grin still firmly \nin place. ‘It’s like when I went to  Phillip Island last year and it really \nstarted raining. Kenny (Roberts Junior) offered me  his  gear and said \n“Hey, you  go ride”. I just said “I’m off for a coffee and doughnut, I'll see \nyou later”. All it takes is for me  to come here and watch one guy hit the \nground and it’s  “Uh oh,  it’s  not  worth it”. \n‘Anyway, every now and then Suzuki say  “come ride this or  come \nride that”, and I still get a huge buzz from riding top-level machinery. I \nrode Mladin’s bike at  Road Atlanta and I rode Kenny’s bike at  Phillip \nIsland. The 500  was a kick in the  ass!’ \nHaving been away from GPs for  a  while, Schwantz admits he  was \nstunned at  Mugello. ‘I never question why I raced but I look at  these \nguys now and think “holy fuck, they’re doin’ some really scary stuff”. \nAs  a  kid  growing up,  I’d  ridden and ridden and ridden and the  bikes \nhave gotten bigger and speeds have gotten greater, and it’s  all  kinda \nworked into itself. Now  I play around on  dirt bikes and ride a street bike \noccasionally, and to come back and watch the 500s, it’s a huge difference \nfrom anything you'd ever imagine. It’s a whole different mindset. I’m \nsitting there watching some 500 guy goin’ around a  corner and \nriingggggeg [he does a very passable imitation of someone having a big \nsideways moment] and it’s  like “fuck, I’d  pull in  and stop right now, \nthat would’ve scared the  living shit out  of me!’”” \nSchwantz used to have the  same effect on people watching him. He’d \nhave a  wince-inducing highside on  Saturday, crack a  few bones, get \npilled up  at  Dr  Costa’s, then win the  race on  Sunday. But he was paid \nwell for the pain. ‘The year I won the championship I made five  million \ndollars. That’s bonuses and everything said and done.’ At  15  GPs a year, \nthat’s $333,333 a ride. Riders like  Rossi and Max Biaggi make more but \nSchwantz wouldn’t want to  have been born later. He  reckons he raced \nin a golden age, when riders could earn millions and still party. \n‘Back \nthen \nSunday \nnights \nweren’t \nabout \nworrying \nwhere \nthe  \nnext \nrace \nwas \nor  \nthe  \nnext \ntest  \nwas, \nit \nwas \n“where \nwe  \nall  \ngonna \nmeet, \nhave \nbeers, \ntell  \nstories, \nlie  \nabout \nthe  \nrace \nand \nwhatever \nelse?’”’ \nEverybody \nwho \nraced \nin  \nthat \nera  \nraced \nas  \nhard \nas  \nthey \npossibly \ncould \nthe  \nentire \n\n“HOLY FUCK, THESE GUYS ARE DOIN’ SOME REALLY SCARY STUFF’ 105 \ntime. So on  Sunday evenings we  needed to go do something that made \nus  realise we  were still havin’ fun because it was nuts on  the line 99 per \ncent of the  time, though I’m  not  saying that’s not  the  case now.’ \nBut things are  very different now. Crashing still hurts just as  much \nand bike racing is still a vicious way to earn a living but  the  technology \nhas changed everything. Twenty-first century racing is  all  about ‘the \nset-up’. ‘Yeah,’ he  continues. ‘It’s [adopts whingeing voice] “we don’t \nhave the  set-up right”. You know how many times I rode a 500  that was \nset  up  right? I could count them on  one hand and have some fingers \nleft  over. A 500’s never gonna be perfect.’ \nAnother thing Schwantz has noticed is that GP  racing has got a lot \nmore corporate, just like the  rest of the  world. ‘The paddock probably \nneeded to  do  that, but  you don’t get  so  many of those happy-go-lucky, \nfun-to-be-around people that used to be involved.’ \nSchwantz always made sure he was having fun when he was racing, \nto the point that things inevitably got out  of control. Like when Porsche \nloaned three 944s to  him, Eddie Lawson and Randy Mamola. They \nstacked the  lot  of them. ‘I came around this totally blind corner where \nthere’s this little lady stopped. I just get  stopped but  I’m  thinking “1 \nknow who’s comin’ up  behind me,” so  I’m  rolling forward, thinking I \nneed to  give these guys some space because this is \ndangerous. Eddie gets through, then we  hear Randy \ncomin’. I look in  the  mirror and Eddie’s hunched in ‘We'd probably he \nhis  seat, waiting, and Randy comes round the corner, just a  little bit to \nhits Eddie and Eddie hits me. So  we've got three much to drink, ar \nwrecked Porsches and it’s  getting dark so  we  have to Eddie stuck his \nstop \nat \na \ngas \nstation \nand \nborrow \nsome \ntyre \nirons \nto \nPorsche \nin \nthe \npry  \nopen \nthe  \npop-up \nheadlights.’ \nditch, \nwith \nmy \nIt \ndidn’t \nend \nthere \neither. \n‘After \nthe \nrace \nin \nAustria, \ncoaching’ \nEddie \nand \nI \ndecided \nto  \ndo  \na  \nlap \nand \nhonest \nto  \nGod, \nes \nwe \ndidn’t \ndo \nit \nfast. \nWe \njust \ndrove \naround \nand \ntalked \nabout \nthe \nrace, \nbut \nwhen \nwe \nwere \ndone \nthere \nwas \nthis \nsecurity \nguy, \nabout \neight \nfeet \ntall, \nand \nhe’s \nlike \n“What \nare \nyou \ndoing? \nYou're \nnot \nsupposed \nto \ndo \nthat.” \nHe \ngoes \nto \npull \nme \nout \nthe \ncar \nbut \nI \nhad \nthe \nseatbelt \non, \nso \nhe \ncouldn’t. \nEddie’s \nlaughing \nnow \nand \nthat \npissed \nthe \nguy \noff, \nso \nhe’s \nslammed \nmy \ndoor, \nshattered \nthe \nwindow \nand \nthe \nglass \ncuts \nmy \nface. \nThere’s \nblood \ngushing \nout, \nso \nwe \nboth \nunclip \nand \ngo \nafter \nthis \nguy. \nHe’s \nrunning, \nbecause \nthere’s \ntwo \nguys \nhalf \nhis \nsize \nout \nto \nkick \n\n106 THE FAST STUFF \nhis ass  and  Eddie kicks him in his nuts as  hard as  he can. After that we \nwent into town. We  came back to the paddock at three in the morning, \nwe'd probably had just a little bit  too  much to  drink, and Eddie stuck \nhis  Porsche in the  ditch, with my  coaching.’ \nDespite a good few years of jackassing around the world, there’s not \nmuch that Schwantz regrets having done in his career. The single world \ntitle he won certainly wasn’t reasonable recompense for his astounding \ntalent, and there’s plenty of so-called experts who reckon he would’ve \ndone better if he’d ditched Suzuki's fickle RGV to  ride a  more user- \nfriendly 500 from Honda or  Yamaha. But despite an  eye-opening ride \non  Mick Doohan’s NSR a year after he limped into retirement, he thinks \nhe  did  the  right thing. | \n‘Mick’s NSR was intimidating, but  then any 500  would’ve been after \na  whole year of  not riding. I’m happy I stayed at  Suzuki. I had an \nopportunity to  go  ride Yamaha at  the  end of ’89.  All  I wanted was the \nsame exact shit that Wayne had, because I wanted to  beat him on  the \nsame stuff. When Yamaha couldn’t promise that, I stayed where I was. \nI also talked to  Erv (Kanemoto, Honda GP  guru) midway through ’92 \nbut  that never really got  close. \n‘If  I regret anything it’d  be  what I did  to  my  wrist in  ’94  to  fix  it \nquick. I should’ve taken time, got it fixed right, taken a year or  two off \nand realised at  that point, “Shit, I’m  still  only 32”. \nOf course, Schwantz’s career-long association with Suzuki has opened \nup  some cool retirement options; he seems to enjoy his new role as  rider \ntraining guru. ‘I go  watch the  Yoshimura Suzuki guys practise. Then I \ncome in and say  “Hey, some other guy is out a little bit  from where you \nare  at  that corner, and they’re not  hitting that bump, so  the  front’s not \nunsettling, so  the whole bike’s not  getting messed around”. That seems \nto work good with the young kids. If their mechanic tells them this and \nthat, the kids are  like “What does he  know about riding?”, where \nhopefully I can  come from a different perspective.’ \nAlthough \nhis  \nprime \nduty \nis  \nto  \ncoach \nup-and-comers, \nSchwantz \nis \nalso \nan  \ninvaluable \ngo-faster \naid  \nto \nMladin \nand \nSuzuki's \nolder \nriders. \n‘I'll \nsee  \nsome \nguy \nfrom \nanother \nteam \nusing \na \ngear \nhigher \nto  \nget  \nthrough \na \ncorner, \nnot  \nhaving \nto \nmake \na \nshift \nand \nnot  \nunsettling \nthe \nbike. \nBut  \nsure, \nyou \ncan’t \njust \nsay  \n“Hey, \nyou're \ndoing \nthis \ncorner \nwrong”. \nIt \ncompletely \ndepends \non \nif \nhe’s \ncomfortable \ndoing \nit \nyour \nway \nand \nif \nthe \nbike \nset-up \nwill \nlet \nhim.’ \n\n“HOLY FUCK, THESE GUYS ARE DOIN’ SOME REALLY SCARY STUFF’ 107 \nAt  Daytona 2000, Schwantz’s track-spotting skills helped Mladin \nwin the 200  miler, America’s biggest race. ‘Mat said “My bike’s working \nreal good through the  infield but  it’s  not  getting up  on  to  the  banking \nas  good as  Id  like it to.  But I know that if I adjust it to  get  on  to  the \nbanking better, I’m gonna give away the  advantage I’ve got  through \nthe  infield, so  tell me  what it looks like  to you, is it that much worse on \nto  the banking than everyone else’s?” I went out  and watched him and \nhis  bike didn’t look any worse than anybody else’s, it actually looked \none of  the better ones getting up  there. I  said “You're not giving \nanything away,” so  he raced it that way.’ \nTwo of  Schwantz’s biggest GP  rivals —  Rainey and Doohan —  have \nalso tried their hand at  trackside coaching. Rainey gave it up  as  a bad \njob, realising it’d take forever to find a rider who matched his staggering \ncommitment. Doohan still dispenses advice to  Honda riders like Rossi \nand Chris Walker, but never begins to pretend he can  instil anyone with \nworld title-winning skills. \nSchwantz agrees, adding: ‘It’s just keeping their minds open to \ndifferent ideas. When guys get to  this  level they don’t need to learn how \nto  do  stuff, they just need to be reminded there’s more than one  way to \ndo  it.  Maybe they get  too  focused, a  bit  of  tunnel vision about some \ncorner, so  they're going \"I  gotta make this work”, so  they hit  that same \nbump and bang! [He shouts a passable impression of a race bike crashing \nto  earth.] Whereas if they’d made a later or  earlier entry, they wouldn’t \neven have hit  that bump. It’s  like at  Mid-Ohio, they’ve got  big concrete \npatches right through the  apex of some corners, with only so  much on \nthe inside that’s asphalt. So Mat asks me  “Where’s everyone running, on \nthe \npatch \nor \ninside \nthe \npatch?” \nI \nwent \nand \nwatched \nand \nall \nthe \npeople \nwho \nwere \ngetting \naround \ngood \nwere \nriding \nright \non \nthe \nedge \nof \nthe \nasphalt, \nwhere \nthere \nwas \nlike \na \nlittle \nberm, \nwhere \nthe \ncars \nhad \npulled \nup \nthe \nasphalt \nto \nthe \nedge \nof \nthe \nconcrete, \nso \nthey \nwere \non \nrails.’ \nSchwantz’s \ncloseness \nto  \nSuzuki \nalso \nguarantees \na  \nwell-stocked \ngarage. \n‘I \ngot \na \nHayabusa, \na \nGSX-R1000 \nand \na \n750. \nI \nlike \nriding \nthe \n750 \nand \nthe \n1000 \nwhen \nwe \ndo \nthe \nschool, \nand \nthe \nHayabusa \nis \na \nneat \nstreetbike. \nI’ve \ngotten \nbetter, \nI’ve \ngotten \nto \nwhere \nI \ncan \nride \nit \nsane \n75 \nper \ncent \nof \nthe \ntime. \nAny \ntime \nI \ngot \non \na \nstreetbike \nwhen \nI \nwas \nracing, \nit \nwas \nlike \n“how \nfast \nwill \nit \ngo \nand \nhow \nquick \nwill \nit \nget \nthere?”, \nthat’s \nall \nI \ncared \nabout. \nNow \nI \ncan \nride \nfor \nfun, \nI \nstop \nand \nlook \nat \nthings \nand \nenjoy \nthe \nscenery.’ \nJeez, \nhe'll \nbe \nbuying \na \nHarley \nnext. \n\n108 THE FAST STUFF \nMotoGP Mutterings: July 2001 \nSpending too  much time in the GP  paddock can make you a bit \nnuts. Here’s the proof \nA few nights before the 2001 GP season kicked off at Suzuka I had a dream, \none of  those pre-season anxiety dreams I have before most seasons. I \ndreamt that all the riders had had head transplants with each other. I was \nrushing around the paddock searching for riders I needed to interview, but \n‘I dreamt all the \nriders had had head \ntransplants with \neach other. I was \nrushing around \nsearching for riders, \nbut  kept speaking to \nI kept speaking to  the  wrong guys. I walked over to \nKenny Roberts Junior and started talking to him, then \nrealised it was Rossi; the  pair of  them had swapped \nheads. I tracked down Leon Haslam, only for him to tell \nme  he’d exchanged with Jezza McWilliams (that'll be \nthe old head on young shoulders, then). I tell you, I was \ngetting a  little confused, a little panicked, and a  long \nway behind my deadlines. \nThe GP  paddock can  have that effect on  you. It’s  a \nweird environment, populated by some of the  most \nextreme people you'll ever meet. And not only the \nriders, everyone at  GPs has a  hint of  the  psychotic \nabout them (yeah, I’m including the  media in  this) because they’re \nultra-ultra serious about what they’re doing. The riders, for  starters, \nhave one of  the weirdest jobs on  earth: flying around the world, \nemployed as  mobile advertising hoardings and occasionally hurling \nthemselves into Armco barriers. Their mechanics are  no  less obsessed \nwith what they do; most of them only get to return home for  six weeks \nin a year. And then there’s the  team managers, the PR people, the cooks \nand the  gofers, the  medics and the  media, the  hangers-on and the \nfloozies, almost a  thousand people in all —  and stress monkeys, the  lot \nof them. As Randy Mamola said recently, if  a bunch of Martians started \nmonitoring bike racing from space, they’d worry for humanity. \nIt’s  my job as  a journalist to wander through the  paddock and make \nsense \nof \nthe \nmadness. \nBut \nlike \nlife \nitself, \nit \ndoesn’t \nquite \nwork \nout \nlike \nthat. \n‘The \nmore \nI \nsee, \nthe \nmore \nI \nknow, \nand \nthe \nmore \nI \nknow, \nthe \nless \nI \nunderstand,’ \nsang \nthat \ngeezer \nfrom \nThe \nJam \nand \nhe \nwas \npretty \ndamned \nright. \nHowever, \nwe \nhave \nsome \nfun \nalong \nthe \nway, \ntrying \nto \nsuss \nout \nthis \ntravelling circus of semi-lunatics. \nYears \nback \nI \nused \nto \nwork \nwith \nJohn \nKocinski’s \nYamaha \nteam \nand \nit \n\nTOO MUCH TIME IN  GP  PADDOCK 109 \nwas \nmy \njob \nto  \nspeak \nto  \nthe  \nunpleasant \nlittle \nman \nevery \ntime \nhe \ngot \noff \nhis \nmotorcycle. \nWhen \nhe \nwasn’t \ndownright \nrude \nhe \nwas \noften \nhilarious, \nthough \nhe \nprobably \ndidn’t \nrealise \nit. Spitting \nvenom \none \nSunday \nmorning \nafter \npre-race \nwarm-up, \nhe \nsnarled \nat \nme: \n‘I \ncould \ndo \nmore \nwith \nthe turd \nthat \nwas \nfloating \nin my \ntoilet \nbowl \nthis \nmorning \nthan \nwith \nthat \nmotorcycle’. \nI had \nhazy \nvisions \nof \nthe former \n250 \nchamp, \nlater \nWorld \nSupers \nking, \nlining \nup \non \nthe \ngrid \nastride \na \nbig \npile \nof \nsteaming \nshit, \nthe \ncommentator \nshrieking: \n‘And \nheeeere’s \nthe \nlittle \nshit \non a \nbig \npile \nof \nshit’. \nI \nnow \nhear \nthat \nLittle \nJohn \nhas \nbecome \na \nreal \nestate \nmagnate, \nselling \nmulti-million \ndollar \nplots \nof \nland \nin \nBeverly \nHills \nto \nHollywood \nstars \nlike \nEddie \nMurphy. \nCongratulations, \nmate, \nI \nalways \nknew \nyou’d \nmake \na \nreally \ngood \nestate \nagent. \nOf  course, you can’t really expect the riders to  be  anything other \nthan slightly crazy: it is,  as  I’ve already pointed out, part of their job \ndescription. And as  some team bosses occasionally say,  with only a hint \nof irony in their voices, they’re only cannon fodder. You only really see \nthe  truth in  that statement when you've been hanging around in  the \npaddock for  a  decade or  two, watching riders come and go,  arriving \nfresh-faced and enthusiastic, leaving gnarled, slightly broken and \n(occasionally) very rich. \nThe  cleverest people in the GP paddock are  the  team managers and  the \nriders’ personal managers. They’re around forever, like  us  journalists, and \nthey don’t have to  hurl themselves at  the  Armco barrier to  make a  few \nquid. You’ve got to get up early in the morning to catch out a manager, way \ntoo  early for  me. A few  years back I caused a  bit  of a  paddock furore by \nwriting something about Max Biaggi. I wrote that there was a  rumour \ngoing around the  paddock that he  was gay (it transpired that this was \nindeed only a  rumour), and I’d  only mentioned it because some other \nmagazines had started writing puerile, vaguely homophobic stuff about \n‘pole \npositions’ \nand \n‘coming \nfrom \nbehind’, \noh \nhow \nvery \nfunny. \nMy \nangle \nwas \nthat \nif \nhe \nwas \ngay, \nit \nwas \neveryone \nelse \nwho \nseemed \nto \nhave \na \nproblem. \nWandering \nalong \nthe \nback \nof \nthe \npits \none \nmorning \nI \nwas \naccosted \nby \na \ncouple \nof \nSuzuki \nmechanics \n(behind \nthe \npits \nat \nGPs \nis \nlike \nbehind \nthe \nbike \nsheds \nat \nschool, \neveryone \nhanging \nout, \n‘aving \na \nfag), \nwho \nwanted \nto \nknow \nwhy \nI’d \nwritten \nthat \nMax \nwas \ngay. \nNah, \nI \nsaid, \nI \nonly \nwrote \nthat \nthere \nwas \na \nrumour \ngoing \naround \nthe \npaddock \nthat \nhe \nwas \ngay. \n‘Well,’ \nreplied \ntheir \nteam \nmanager \nGarry \nTaylor. \n‘There’s \na \nrumour \ngoing \naround \nthe \npaddock \nthat \nyou're \na \ncunt.’ \nTo \nwhich \nthere \nis \nno \nreply. \n\nCHAPTER 17 \nBEST BEFORE... \nAugust 2001 \nBritish Superbike dominators Steve Hislop and John Reynolds \nwere approaching their sell-by dates but still kicking arse in  a \nmajor fashion when we  got together for  this interview in  the \nsummer of  2001. In  the light of  what happened to  poor old \nHizzy, it’s  full of poignant moments \nBorn-again bikers dominate the  British biking consciousness —  scoring \nmore bike sales and hospital visits than anyone —  so  it’s  perhaps fitting \nthat two knocking-on-40 racers are dominating the 2001 British \nSuperbike series. \nSteve Hislop and John Reynolds are the Chris Walker and Neil \nHodgson of  2001, duking it  out  way ahead of  the  pack and getting \ninvolved in  some seriously hairy paint-swapping. At  their age, these \ntwo dads should know better. \nBut, of  course, they don’t. Hizzy and Gentleman John just keep \ngetting faster and faster, this final flourish to  their careers powered by \nnear-factory-spec 996s and bankrolled by rich patrons Paul Bird and \nBen Atkins. Hislop, backed by Bird’s MonsterMob crew, is the  older of \nthe  two, just five months away from the big Four-0 and with 19 seasons \nof  roadracing behind him. His career has been mostly British \nchampionship with a  heap of TT  successes and a  few endurance wins \nthrown in.  Reynolds, three years younger but more touchy about his \nage, has  been racing 15 years. He’s done 500  GPs and World Superbike, \nreturning to  the  British scene for  the  past few years with ever-faithful \nbenefactor Atkin’s Red Bull outfit, even winning a  Brands WSB race \nlast autumn. And both did  schoolboy motocross before they hit  the \ntarmac. In other words these old  gits have an  extraordinary amount of \nrace experience within them and there’s nothing that beats experience \non  the  racetrack. \n\nBEST BEFORE... ail \n‘The only way you can tell  how you're riding is by results and lap \ntimes, and every year we're going quicker,’ says Reynolds, who first \nwon the  British Supers crown in  1992. ‘That tells me  I’m  still learning \nand I feel I still ride aggressively. You know when you're riding on  the \nlimit —  you just get  the  bike stopped for  a  turn, just scrub off  enough \nspeed, so  the front’s moving around as you tip in, then the rear’s moving \nwhen you tap on  the  power. The whole bike is just floating.’ \nYes, nothing beats experience on  the  racetrack, except experience. \n‘That's the  thing,’ says Hislop, who was British 250  champ way back in \n1990. ‘We've both got  15/20 years of knowledge and gamesmanship, so \nit’s  “Where am  I gonna try him on  the  last lap?” I’m  digging deep and \nthe  problem is that John’s been racing almost as  long as  me.’ \nReynolds adds: ‘When you first start racing you're ten  feet  behind the \nbike, that’s the dangerous part, where all the learning and hurting comes \nin.  Then as  time goes on,  you get  level with the  bike, so  you're sort of \nhappy. Now I feel like I’m  ten  feet ahead of the  bike, so  I’m  predicting \nwhat it’s going to do, and that’s where you want to be at.’ Then he thinks \nfor  a moment... ‘Having said that, you still make mistakes.’ \nReynolds is  right though, it’s  all  about using brains rather than \nbravery to go fast. But  does that mean that racing gets easier the longer \nyou go  on? ‘No  way!’ he  answers. ‘Nah,’ adds Hizzy. ‘Maybe it’s  easier \nriding because your knowledge is  greater, but the  racing never gets \neasier; in  a  way it  gets harder every bloody race.’ Reynolds chips in \nagain: ‘It  bloody well does with him about!’ \nOut of  Walker’s and Hodgson’s shadows, both men know they’re \nriding harder than they’ve ever ridden in  their lives, so  they bristle \nwhen people suggest they should pack it in  and give the  kids a  break. \n‘We're \nenjoying \nit \nand \nputting \non \na \ngood \nshow, \nso \nwhy \nshould \nwe \ncall \nit \na \nday?’ \nsays \nHizzy. \n‘People \nexpect \nyou \nto \nhang \nup \nyer \nboots \nand \nlet \na \nyoungster \ntake \nover \nyer \njob, \nbut \nI’ve \ngot \ntwo \nkids \nto \nthink \nof \nand \nI \ndon’t \nknow \nwhat \nI’m \ngoing \nto \ndo \nafter \nracing. \nI’ve \nnot \nmade \nenough \nmoney \nto \nretire, \nI’ve \nscrewed \nup \nwith \na \nfew \nteams \nand \nbeen \nused \na \nbit, \nso \nit’s \na \nproper \njob \nfor \nme \nif \nI \ncall \nit \na \nday. \nJamie \nWhitham’s \nthe \nfunniest \nguy \never, \nhe \nsays \n“I’m \nscared, \nscared \nof \ngetting \na \nreal \njob”.’ \nWhich \nbrings \nus  \nto  \nfear. \nRacers \nnever \nlose \ntheir \nskill, \nthey \njust \nlose \nthe  \nwill \nto  \nuse \nit,  \nand \nuntil \nthey \nreach \nthat \npoint \nthey \nkeep \ngetting \nfaster, \nThat’s \nHislop \nand \nReynolds \nfor \nyou; \nthey’ve \nnot \nyet \nreached \nthat \nmoment \nwhen \nfear \nbegins \nto \ncreep \naround \ntheir \npsyches, \nstealing \na \n\n2 THE FAST STUFF \ntenth of a  second here and a  tenth of a  second there, until they’re no \nlonger competitive. Or  maybe they’re just better than most at  keeping \nthe  fear at  bay. Ask Reynolds whether he  gets more scared now than \nwhen he  was a  youngster and he  sounds like he’s trying to  convince \nhimself: ‘Scared doesn’t come into it,’ he  says. ‘Once you're scared it’s \ntime to  pack it in.’  But doesn’t he  find himself getting more sensible \nwith age? ‘No, and that’s sometimes a worry to  my wife Shelley. She’d \nlike  me  to  stop tomorrow, but why would I do that when I love doing it \nand I get paid pretty well?’ \nReynolds puts his  own sell-by date a  couple of years down the  line. \n‘You've got  to  take every weekend as  it comes,’ he  says. ‘But I’d like to \ngo for another two or  three years.’ So has  he got a pension sorted? ‘I’ve \na  few things in the  pipeline,’ he  says mysteriously, politely refusing to \nreveal his  earnings after Hizzy tells us  his  pay packet is knocking on \n100K, though Reynolds almost certainly earns more. For Hislop, the \nproverbial gold carriage clock looms a little larger. ‘I said at  the  start of \nthis  year that I’d ride this season and see  how it goes \nbut probably do  at  least another year beyond that. \n‘The only thing that You  never know, why quit when you’re riding good? \nreally scared me  was ‘The thing that worries me  is  the  thought of  an \nwhen I broke my injury, I can’t cope with the  thought of being beat up \nneck at Brands last every weekend. Some of  the  younger guys seem to \nyear’ jump off, get beat up and jump straight back on.  I did \ng that ten years ago but now it  takes longer to  get \nbetter. A  bit  o’  age and bringing up  kids, you start \nthinking a  bit,  you’re more aware of  the  details in  life. I drive a  bit \nsteadier on  the  road these days. \n‘The only thing that really scared me  was when I broke my  neck at \nBrands last year. We never found out  it was broke for a couple of months \nand it wasn’t the broken neck that scared me, it was my left  arm which \nhad stopped working. We  got  the  neck scanned and they found two \nbroken vertebrae and loads of gunge and shit which had jammed in a \nnerve port. I knew something was wrong and I'd  been scared I was \ngoing to  end  up with a withered arm for the  rest of m’life.’ \nI know what he means. The only things that really worried me  when \nI was racing were head and spinal injuries. I first started getting proper \nscared \na \ncouple \nof \nyears \nbefore \nI \nstopped, \nand \nI \ncan \npinpoint \nthe \nexact \nmoment \nwhen \nfear \nfound \na \nfoothold \nin \nmy \npsyche. \nI \nwas \neating \n\nBEST BEFORE... 113 \nbreakfast \nafter \nearly \nmorning \nTT  \npractice \non  \nthe \nIsland, \nthe \nnews \ncrackling \nout \nof \nthe \ncafé’s \ntinny \nlittle \nradio, \ntelling \nus \nthat \na \nrider \nI \nknew \nhad \nbeen \nkilled \nthat \nmorning. \nFrom \nthen \non, \nthis \nthought \nwould \ncreep \ninto \nmy \nmind \non \nrace \nmornings: \n‘Is \nthis \nmy \nlast \nbreakfast?’ \nAs \na \nracer, \nI \nwas \nfucked \nfrom \nthat \nmoment. \nAlthough he  won’t admit to  fear, Reynolds still feels something on \nrace mornings: ‘I get  sick as  a  dog, not  physically sick but  I don’t feel \nwell.’ Hislop is more laid back about it all,  though maybe only because \nshort circuits seem so  safe after years of cheating death on  the  Island, \nwhere he won 11  TTs. ‘I used to get really wound up before the TT, that \nwas terror butterflies. These days I just get  a  little bit  butterfly-ish \nbefore we  go  up  pit lane, but  I watch my  250 team-mate, little Stuart \nEaston, get dead wound up at  British meets.’ \nHislop, now an  Island resident, hasn’t done a  TT  in  seven years and \neven though he still rates it his favourite circuit (and considered doing the \n2000 TT:  ‘I thought it’d  be a  good idea to  get  some wedge’), the  terror of \nthe  place is  still  with him. ‘Every year on  the  last  lap  of  the  last  race, \ncoming out of Ramsey and up the mountain, I always used to say to myself, \n“Just one more time over this mountain and that’s it,  thank fuck, for \nanother year”. By the end  of ’94 I was like, “I’ve had enough of this’’.’ \nReynolds raced the TT just once. A chance meeting with Hizzy during \npractice, as  they tackled the  terrifying Baaregarroo section, was enough \nto  convince him never to  return. ‘Jesus Christ, Steve came past like I \nwas stood still, and I wasn’t hanging about. He  bounced through the \nbottom of Baaregarroo, sparks flying off  the  bottom of the  bike, and \nwobbled off to  Kirkmichael. I thought “If that’s what you’ve got  to  do \nto win a TT,  you can flippin’ keep it”.’ \nSince then Reynolds has had his  fair share of  scary moments on \nshort circuits. ‘I  got  a  ride with a  Japanese team in  the  Suzuka Eight \nHours in  ‘92  which was going to  make me  quite a  bit  of cash. First \nthing they did  was take us  to  see  this spiritualist. She wanted a bit  of \nmy  hair, a bit of each fingernail and a bit of toenail which she wrapped \nup, \nsaid \na \nfew \nwords \nover, \nand \ngave \nto \nme. \nFuckin’ \nhellfire, \nwe \nhad \nto \nhang \nit \nover \nthe \npit \ndoor \nso \nwe'd \ngo \nunder \nit \nwhenever \nwe \nwent \nout. \nFirst \ntime \nout, \nmy \nfirst \nlap, \nI \nwent \ninto \nSpoon \ncurve \nand \nsaw \nsomething \nfly \nout \nthe \nfront \nof \nthe \nbike, \nthen \nwhen \nI \nhit \nthe \nbrakes \nfor \nthe \nnext \nturn, \nnothing \nhappened. \nI \nlooked \ndown \nand \nsaw \none \nof \nthe \nbrake \ncallipers \nswinging \nin \nthe \nbreeze. \nDon’t \nknow \nhow \nI \nstayed \non.’ \n\n114 THE FAST STUFF \nIf Hislop is mostly more frank about feeling fear, he’s used that very \nweird thing called racers’ psychology to  convert the  negative into a \npositive. ‘Getting my arm fixed was what gave me the sheer determination \nto  come back this year. People wrote me  off,  “Oh, he’s a  half-season \nspecial, he’ll go fast for  a while but his head’ll go, he’s a fuckin’ fruitcake”. \nEverybody’s wrote me  off that way for the past four or  five years. I’ve had \nproblems in teams but there’s been reasons for that, which is why I’m  so \ndetermined to  come back and do well. The arm scared me  but  it’s  given \nme  real  determination since then. It’s  like  Doohan in ’92, he wrecked his \nleg and came back from that. Fantastic!’ \nAnd here’s another dose of racers’ psychology, from Hizzy again. ‘I \nwas panicking a few weeks back because I hadn’t crashed in ages, so  I \nwas thinking, oooh nooo, I’m  in for a big one. Then I went and lost the \nfront in  practice at  Oulton. That’s the  way to  do  it, lose the  front, go \ndown nice an’  easy. I felt  a lot better after that.’ \nDespite a  bit  o’  fairing bashing this year, at  Oulton and elsewhere, \nthe pair remain friends, though they're not  sure how long that'll last as \ntheir title fight approaches the  final round. ‘I enjoy racing Steve,’ says \nReynolds. “You can  pretty much rely on  what he’s going to be doing, but \nsometimes you can’t, and that’s what racing’s all  about. We  all  do  it — \nyou try and pull off  a move and you end up  colliding.’ \nHislop knows what he’s talking about: ‘I know, I know, two years ago \nI did  a  do  or  die  on  John at  the  Old Hairpin at  Donington, taking him \nand Bayliss out. On  the  way back to  the  paddock, John said to  me  “If \nthere was one guy in Britain I trusted not  to wipe me  out  it was you, Ill \njust have to  watch you now.” That was a rare moment of madness for \nme. John is fast and aggressive but safe —  I can almost work out  what \nhe’s going to  do,  just like he  said about me. We’re the  old  school of \nriding, we’ve got  a  bit  of  mutual respect here, whereas some of  the \nyounger guys just run into you and wipe you out.’ \nSpeaking \nof  \nyoung \nguys, \ndoes \nit \nworry \nthe  \npair \nthat \nthere \ndoesn’t \nseem \nto  \nbe \nmuch \nyoung \nBritish \ntalent \naround? \n‘I \nthink \nthere \nare  \nsome \ngood \nguys \ncoming \nthrough,’ \nsays \nReynolds. \n‘But \nthe  \nproblem \nis \nthat \nit \ncosts \nso  \nmuch \nto  \nrace \nSuperbikes. \nA  \nteam \nlike \nours \ncosts \na  \nmillion \na \nyear, \nso \nyou \ncan’t \nafford \nto \ntake \na \ngamble \non \nsome \nkid.’ \nHislop \nreckons \nthat \nproposed \nregulations \nchanges \nfor \n2002 \nwill \nmake \na \ncrucial \ndifference. \n‘There’s \nalready \na  \nfew \nguys \nlike \nShane \nByrne \ncoming \non \nstrong, \nhe’s \nmega, \nbut \nthe \nchange \nto \nsemi-Supersport \nrules \nwill \nallow \n\nBEST BEFORE... 115 \nsome of those wilder young guys to  stick on  some slicks and see  what \nthey can  do.’ \nUntil then it’s  likely that the  Old  Gits will have it all their own way. \nAnd while they may be  approaching their sell-by dates, Hizzy and \nReynolds are  a long way from being that carton of rank, stinky milk at \nthe  back of your fridge. \nEpilogue: JR went on  to win the  2001 BSB crown after Hizzy got hurt \nat  the dreadful Rockingham racetrack. Hizzy got his  revenge the \nfollowing year, then lost his  life in  a  helicopter crash in  July 2003. \nReynolds won his third BSB title in 2004, then quit racing the following \nyear after two bone-shattering accidents. \n\nCHAPTER 18 \nWHO WANTS TO  BE  A \nMILLIONAIRE ? \nSeptember 2001 \nNot Leon Haslam, well not much anyway. Back in the summer \nof 2001 the Pocket Rocket was getting paid £150 a week by his \nmum for  racing a Honda NSR500. Not greedy, our Leon \nLittle Leon and me  are  chatting in his motorhome, parked at  the  end of \nmillionaires row in  the  Brno paddock. A few doors up  from Haslam’s \nhumble(ish) abode are  those of multi-millionaires and fellow factory \n500 riders Max Biaggi, Noriyuki Haga, Valentino Rossi and Loris \nCapirossi. This is  the  poshest part of the  paddock, 100 grand Ferraris \nsqueezed in  amongst the  rolling palaces, hired drivers spending their \ndays scrubbing and polishing motorhomes until the chrome hurts \nyour eyes. \nGuys like Biaggi know how to  blow their millions —  private jets, \nMonaco apartments, $600,000 motorhomes and armies of  personal \nflunkies. So far,  18-year-old Haslam’s fiscal concerns aren’t quite in the \nsame league. Son of  Ron may ride factory 500s just like the  rest of \nthem, but while his colleagues stash millions in offshore bank accounts, \nthe  Pocket Rocket™ gets by on  £150 a  week pocket money from his \nmum, Ann. \nSo  far  the  high-roller lifestyles of Haga and Co  hold no  interest for \nHaslam. ‘It’s nice to  look at  but  for  me  money’s not  the  thing, so  long \nas  I can get  from A  to  B  and do  what I like,’ he  says. ‘I  give all  the \nsponsorship to  my  mum and she  pays me  £150 a  week, plus expenses \nand bonuses, like last  year I got a car  bought for me. I don’t go short on \nanything.’ ; \nA  factory 500 star working for  the  minimum wage, pretty bizarre, \neh? Not really. Haslam’s career is  a  family thing, racing is  what the \nHaslams do  and they’re not exactly skint, so  money really isn’t the \ndeal. Leon has  lived his  life  in  the  paddock and on  the  racetrack, and \n\nWHO WANTS TO  BE  A MILLIONAIRE? Nig? \nhis  career so  far  has been a  breathless, meteoric rise to  the  premier \ndivision. Not that you’d know it;  considering where he’s at,  he’s \nremarkably down to  earth and ungobby. \nHaslam was on  the  GP  trail from six  weeks old, travelling through \nEurope with his  dad, once the  wild man of  British racing, who was \nriding Honda NS500s alongside world title-winning team-mates \nFreddie Spencer and Marco Lucchinelli in  the  early 1980s. Leon won \nhis  first race, a  kids’ off-road event at  the  ’87  Argentine GP  when he \nwas four, ‘I can remember that, I got  a  nice little trophy,’ and he  was \nnational schoolboy motocross champ at  12.  A year later he  switched to \ntarmac and walked the British scooter title. That success made him the \nyoungest-ever winner of a national roadrace crown, the  first of  a whole \nrun  of youngest-ever achievements. \nThe following year, 1998, Haslam graduated to  125s and became the \nyoungest-ever winner of a  British championship race. He  made his  GP \ndebut the same summer to  become, you guessed it,  the country’s \nyoungest-ever GP  rider. He  contested his  first world championship \nseason in  2000, still on  125s, and commenced 2001 riding Honda \nNSRY500 twins for  the  Shell Advance squad, scoring points in  two of \nthe first seven GPs. But when senior team-mate Chris Walker was \nsacked after falling out  with Aussie team-owner Jeff Hardwick, Haslam \nwas given the Stalker’s NSR V4s. The surprise promotion makes him \nHonda’s youngest-ever 500  GP rider and completes a giant leap from 45 \nhorsepower to  190 horsepower in  less than a  year. Oh  yes, and Leon \njust got voted a  top-ten pin-up by teen girls’ mag Bliss. \nAll  giddy stuff, but racing has  also been hard on  Haslam. He  lost  two \nuncles to  the  racetrack, broke his  left  leg when he was 12,  his  right leg \nwhen \nhe \nwas \n13 \nand \nhis \nfirst \nGP \nseason \nwith \nthe \nshambolic \nItaljet \nteam \nwas \na \nnightmare \nthat \nwould’ve \nfinished \nsome \nriders. \nHe’s \ncome \na \nlong \nway, \nbaby, \nand \nnow \nhe \nfaces \nthe \ntoughest \nchallenge \nof \nhis \ncareer \n— \ntaming the  bikes that ate  Walker alive. \nHaslam \nhas \nuntil \nthe  \nend \nof  \n2001 \nto  \nprove \nhe’s \nworthy \nof  \nfactory \nsupport \ninto \n2002 \nand \nbeyond. \nThat’s \nserious \npressure \nfor \nan \n18-year- \nold, \nespecially \nwhen \nthe \nNSR \nappears \nless \nthan \nwilling. \nWalker \nspent \nhis \nfive \nmonths \nwith \nthe \nNSR \ncrashing \nhis \nbrains \nout \nand \nHaslam \ndidn’t \nget \noff \nto \na \nmuch \nbetter \nstart, \ntumbling \nout \nof \nhis \nfirst \ntwo \nGPs \non \nthe \nbikes. \nOne \ncan’t \nhelp \nbut \nwonder \nwhether \nShell’s \nNSRs \nare \ncursed \n2c \n\n118 THE FAST STUFF \n‘My theory of racing was always that if you can  ride a bike, you can \nride any bike but these things have opened my  eyes,’ he  says, like a \nteenager who once thought he  knew it all.  ‘They’re not  normal bikes, \nthey’re different, and if you don’t understand them, you'll never get on \nwith them. It’s  not so  much riding to  go  faster, it’s  sitting down and \nthinking about it  to  go  faster. I always wondered why Chris was \nstruggling because I know he’s a  good rider, now I know it’s  not so \nmuch whether you're a  good rider, it’s  more a  case of  thinking and \nunderstanding. \n‘The Honda is hard because it’s reckoned not  to turn so well [Haslam’s \nNSRs aren't latest-spec bikes like  Valentino Rossi’s], and coming from \n125s I’ve  always rode heavy on  the  front, doing all my  steering off the \nthrottle, all through the front end. Plus the four has  got so much power, \nso  you've got to  steer it off the rear more, concentrating on  not  running \nso  much corner speed and getting it  out of  the corner. It’s totally \ndifferent for  me, I’ve got  to  get  my  head sorted not  to  go  into corners \nputting all  the  weight on  the  front. It’s  hard; guys like John Kocinski \nnever got on  with the Honda 500, but I’m learning the set-up and \nthe  style.’ \nDespite all  the scary losing-the-front moments, the NSR does, of \ncourse, have its good sides. ‘It’s a full-on bike, and it’s mega spinning it \nup.  First time I rode it,  I was spinning it up  every corner and loving it. \nBut  you've got  to  be  precise. I could get  away with a  lot  more on  the \n500 twin, you could run  wide, square off  the  corner \nby spinning it all the way to the white line and fire  it \n‘Mum and dad out, but  if you’re a foot off line on  the  four, the  lap’s \ntried to put me  off finished. That’s what I’ve learned from looking at \nand get me  into Mick Doohan on  videos, he  was so  smooth. When \nfootball’ you try harder on  the  four, you go  slower.’ \neae \nSo \nHaslam \nis \ndiscovering \nthat \nthe \nprocess \nof \nadapting to  life  in  the  fastest lane of  all  isn’t easy, \neven though his whole life has been working towards this moment. ‘All \nI \nknow \nis \nthat \nfrom \nfour \nyears \nold \nI’ve \nalways \nbeen \nriding. \nWe've \ngot \na \nmotocross track at  my  dad’s farm and all  I can remember is  riding \nevery \nday, \nfrom \nmorning \ntill \nit \ngot \ndark, \nspending \nwhole \ndays \nwith \nmy \ndad \nworking \non \none \naspect \nof \nmy \nriding. \nI \nwouldn’t \nbe \nwhere \nI \nam \nnow \nwithout \nhim. \nWhat \nhe \ngives \nme \nnow, \nmore \nthan \nanything, \nis \nreassurance. \nAs \na \nnewcomer \nthere’s \nalways \ndoubts \nin \nyour \nmind, \nso \nif \nyou've \ngot \n\nWHO WANTS TO  BE  A MILLIONAIRE? 119 \nsomeone \nthere \nwho \nunderstands \nwhat \nyou're \nsaying, \nit  \ngives \nyou \nso \nmuch \nmore \nconfidence.’ \nBut  \nHaslam \nSenior, \nwho \nscored \nnine \n500  \npodium \nfinishes \nin \nan  \neight- \nyear \nGP  \ncareer \nwith \nHonda, \nSuzuki \nand \nCagiva, \nhasn’t \nalways \nbeen \nbehind \nLeon. \n‘When \nI broke \nmy legs \ndoing \nmotocross, \nmum \nand \ndad \ntried \nto \nput \nme \noff \nand get \nme \ninto \nfootball. \nI \nnearly \nlost \nmy \nright \nleg \nin \nIreland, \nI had \ncompartment \nsyndrome \nlike \nDoohan. \nMy \ndad knew \nsome \ngood \ndoctors \nin \nEngland, \nso \nhe \nrang \nthem \nand \nthey \nairlifted \nme \nstraight \nhome. \nThey \ncut \nopen \nthe \nside \nof \nthe \nleg \nand \nthe \nmuscle \njumped \non to \nthe \ntable; \nthey \nsaid \nId \nhave \nlost the \nleg \nin \nanother \ncouple \nof \ndays. \nAfter \nthat \nI \nasked \nmy \ndad \nfor \none \nmore \ngo, and \nthat’s \nwhen \nhe \nrealised \nI \nwas \n100 \nper \ncent \ndedicated, \nso \nhe’s \nbeen \nbehind \nus \never \nsince.’ \nWith or without his dad’s help, the final month of the 2001 season will \nbe the  most crucial period in Haslam’s career so  far.  And he knows he’s \ngot  it tough, though 14  years of racing helps him handle the  pressure \nwith admirable cool. ‘The 500  twin was good for me  because there wasn’t \nany pressure. The twin was only capable of so  much, and I was already \ndoing that but now I’m on a bike that’s capable of much more than I am, \nat  the  moment. I’ve got  a  lot  more to  come from myself, simply from \nmore track time, but  I’ve  been struggling with fitness. I did  a wrist at  Le \nMans in May, a finger at Assen in June and I dislocated my collarbone in \nGermany, they've all  knocked me. But I’m  where I want to  be.  I turned \n18 this summer, Valentino Rossi is 22,  so  I’ve  got  four years on  him and \nI feel  confident that I won’t be far away with a year of learning. If I can \nget  V4s for next season, and so  far  Honda Japan seem very interested, I \nsee  that as  a learning year, then hopefully the  year after that I’ll  be on  a \nfour-stroke, then the  next season I can  go  for  the  title. And if I make it \nthen, I'll be the youngest-ever premier-class champ.’ And hell, you  never \nknow, he may even get a pay  rise, too. \nEpilogue: \nHaslam \ndidn’t \nget \nthe \nHonda \nGP  \njob \nin  \n2002, \neveryone \nknows \nthat. \nInstead \nhe came \nhome \nto \nrace \nBSB \nand \nWSB. \n\nCHAPTER 19 \nHANGIN’ WITH \nHAGA \nNovember 2001 \nNoriyuki Haga may have flunked his  debut 500 season in 2001 \nbut the so-called Sultan of  Slide still rocked as  a  super-cool \npaddock dude when I caught up with him in his  Liberace-style \nmotorhome \nI never thought my  life  would come to  this. It’s  race morning at  the \n2001 Valencia GP  and we’re huddled in  a  paddock hospitality unit \nhaggling over the  price of laydeez. Things are  starting to  get  seriously \nembarrassing. We  want four and we're ready to  pay them fifty quid \neach for  ten  minutes work. Seems like a  fair deal to  us,  and the  girls \nseem up  for  it, until their screaming harpy of a  pimp sticks her  nose \ninto the  deal. \nShe’s not  a nice lady and she’s not  being reasonable, at all.  She wants \nmore than her  pound of flesh for  her  girls and she  can sense she’s got \nus  cornered. The problem is we’ve only got  £250 cash on  us  and we \ndon’t want to  make a  scene. Eventually she  nails us  down to  two girls \nfor  the  price of five, or  £250 for two for ten  minutes. We  hand over the \ncash, feeling seriously fucked over. \nButit’s not what you think. The girls aren’t for us,  they’re for Noriyuki \nHaga, and once we’ve chosen the  sweetest two, we  walk them over to \nHaga’s motorhome. You can’t miss the  thing, it’s  the  biggest, baddest \nin  the  MotoGP paddock, which is as  it should be  because Haga-san is \nthe  biggest, baddest dude in the  paddock. \nHaga is  racing’s Mr Boombastic. While most 21st-century racers \nstash a  good whack of their multi-million earnings into pension funds \nand investments, Haga prefers to  live life  for  the  moment and live it \nvery large indeed. His  £450,000 13-metre motorhome packs acres of \nwhite leather and a  1300-watt sound system, enough to  keep a  club- \nfull  of pill-heads rocking. And it’s  the  man’s love of phat hip hop beats \n\nHANGIN’ WITH HAGA 121 \nthat \nexplains \nthe  \ntwo \nyoung \nlaydeez \ngetting \ntheir \nkit  \noff  \nin \nthe  \ntrailer \nbehind \nhis  \n‘home. \nWe're \nsetting \nup  \na  \nbooty \nbabe \nshoot \nfor  \nthe  \nman, \nbecause \nhe’s \nthe \nP \nDiddy \nof \nthe \npaddock, \nthe \nRoots \nManuva \nof \nthe \nracetrack: \nnuff \nbooty, \nnuff \nbeats, \nnuff \nsaid. \nHaga’s \nlivin’ \nit \nlarge \nattitude \nis \nold  \nskool, \na \nblast \nfrom \nthe  \npast \nwhen \nracers \ncounted \ntheir \ndays \nlike \nWWI \nsoldiers \nin \nthe \ntrenches. \n‘Racing \nlife \nmaybe \nnot \nas \nlong \nas you \nexpect,’ \nhe \nsays. \n‘So \nwhenever \nyou \nhave \nmoney \nyou \nmust \nspend \nit, \notherwise \nmaybe \nit will \nbe \ntoo \nlate. \nIf \nyou \nwant \nsomething \nand \nyou \nhave \nthe money, \nbuy \nit. \nThis \nis \nracing \nlife. \nAnd \nif \nyou need \nmoney, \nyou \nhave \nto \nwin \nit, \nha \nha \nha!’ \nOf course, Haga didn’t do much winning in 2001, in fact  he did none \nat  all. A year after he’d come within one drugs test  of \nwinning the World Supers title on  an  R7  (nothing \nfun, just ephedrine, from a cold-cure, he  insists), he ‘Racing life maybe \nstruggled so  badly on  his  Red Bull Yamaha YZR500 not  as  long as  you \nthat he  pretty much gave up  and just rode around. expect, so  whenever \nCynics reckon he  backed off  because he  couldn’t be you have money you \narsed to learn the  art  of 500  riding, preferring to wait must spend it, \nfor  the factory’s more user-friendly YZR-M1 four- otherwise maybe it \nstroke GP  bike to  show, though there’s rumours he will be too  late’ \nmay even return to  Supers. \nFor a man who needs to  enjoy his  racing, the  2001 \nseason must’ve been tough. But what’s more important to  Haga, \nwinning or  having fun? That may sound like a  daft question to  ask  a \npro-racer, but  years back I asked Kevin Schwantz what meant more, \nwinning the 500 world title (which he  hadn’t done at  that point) or \nmaking wads of cash. ‘About the  same,’ he answered, which was weird: \nI always thought winning had to  be  the  main deal. Haga is  the  same. \n‘For me, first priority is enjoyment. For  sure it’s  important to  win, but \nfirst priority is  to  enjoy racing.’ And what about the  money? ‘Money \ndepends on  results, so  if I get a lot of money it means I am  winning, ha \nha  ha.’ \nHaga spends most of this interview laughing and cracking jokes; not \nvery Japanese. When we  move on  to  the  subject of girls and sex  (‘Jiggy, \njiggy,’ \nin \nHaga \nspeak), \nI \nask \nif \nhe’s \ngot \na \ngirlfriend. \n‘No, \nunfortunately \nI \nhave \nwife,’ \nhe \nsays, \nslapping \nme \non \nthe \nshoulder \nlike \nsome \ndowntrodden \nhubby \nmale-bonding \nwith \nme \nat \nthe \nbar. \n‘After \nthis \nrace \nI \nmust \ngo \nhome \nand \nmake \nmarriage.’ \nAt \nthis, \nhis \npersonal \nassistant \nnearly \nfalls \noff \nhis \n\n122 THE FAstT STUFF \nchair, shrieking questions in Japanese. ‘No, no,  it’s joke,’ replies Haga. \nYeah right, it is.  He’s not  the  funniest man in the world but  Haga’s got \nto be the Vic  Reeves of  Japanese GP  racers. \nAnyway, it’s nice to see  him in a good mood, because he’s spent most \nof 2001 looking dead miserable, and not  only because he’s bombed out \non  results. ‘One problem is I don’t have so  many friends in GP,  this is \nmy  first time. But everyone so  serious, I don’t think that’s necessary. \nFor  sure Superbike paddock is more funny and people more friendly.’ \nSuch is the  curse of modern corporate-funded sport —  more money \nequals more pressure equals more stress equals less fun. Football’s the \nsame, everything’s the  same. There are  far greater rewards available in \nGPs than World Supers, so  there’s no  time for charging around getting \nwrecked on  Sunday nights. Haga finds this hard to  cope with. ‘There’s \nalways so much thinking about riding the bike, so  there’s much tension. \nIf I think too  much, for  sure coming stressed.’ \nHaga copes with stress the  same way as  most normal folk: he  gets \npissed. Okay, so  he’s cut  down since his  pre-2000 fat-boy days, but  he \nstill likes a beer and he’s happy to  front up  to his  vices. ‘Basically I like \nalcohol, I like  drink beer. But  now I’m  26  so  when I take a lot  of beer, \nnext day not  possible wake up!’ Haga has  partied with the  legendary \nAnthony Gobert on  occasion, most recently after July’s Suzuka Eight \nHours, where racing’s most renowned pissheads shared a  factory R7. \nIncidentally, it’s  interesting that Goey and Haga have stopped doing all \nthat crazy colour shit  with their hair; as  Haga says, they’re getting old. \n‘After race Yamaha make party and we party a  bit, but he’s \nunbelievable. I ask him “What alcohol do you drink”, and he say  (Haga \nadopts very loud and totally bizarre Asian Ocker accent) “For me  always \nonly beer!” He  drank about ten  litres in  four hours, too  much! But \nwhen he drunk, he very funny, very funny!’ [Haga enunciates ‘very’ like \nmany Japanese who struggle with their Vs  and Rs,  so  it  comes out \n‘belly’.] And what about Haga, does he  get  funny when pissed up? ‘I \ndon’t remember!’ More guffaws. \nEventually we  move on  to  serious stuff, like why hasn’t.he ripped up \nthe  tarmac in  GPs the  way he  did  in  Supers? Of  course, we  already \nknow the answer —  an  R7  on  Dunlops is a cosy armchair ride compared \nto a 500  on  Michelins. As former Supers champ Scott Russell once said: \n‘You better take your time with 500s or  you'll be  pulling straw out  ya \nass  and having Dr  Costa shoot Novocaine in ya  feet.’ \n\nHANGIN’ WITH HAGA 123 \nHaga \nlikes \nto \nride \nout  \nof \nshape, \nsideways \non  \nthe \nbrakes, \nsideways \non \nthe \nthrottle \nand \nhe’s \nnot \nbeen \nable \nto \ntranslate \nthat \nstyle \nto \nthe \nless- \nforgiving \nYZR. \nBut \nhe’s \nnot \nkeen \nto \ngo \ninto \ndetail, \nso \nhe \nmostly \njust \nshrugs \nand \ngrunts. \nAsked \nwhether \nhe \nprefers \nfour-strokes \nto \ntwo- \nstrokes, \nhis \neyebrows \narch \nand \nhe \nreplies: \n‘What \nis \ntwo-stroke? \nNo, \nbasically \nI \nlike \nfour-stroke. \nSometime \nI \nlike \ntwo-stroke \nbut \nnormally \nfour-stroke. \nI \nknow \nwhat \nis \nproblem \nbut \nI cannot \nsay, \nbecause \nafter \nthere \nwill \nbe \nproblems \nfor \nme. \nBut \nfor \nsure \nSuperbike \nis \nmore \neasy, \nmore \neasy \nto \ncontrol.’ \nHaga has  also struggled to make the move from Dunlop to Michelin, \nafter eight years on  the  Anglo-Japanese tyres, but again he  avoids \ndetailed questioning. ‘I don’t know. Yeah, yeah, I think so,’  is his  only \nreply to persistent interrogation on  the  subject. You see, Japanese riders \nare  not  renowned for  making revelations —  they maintain a  corporate \nloyalty way beyond that of most round eyes. \nBut there’s good reason for  Haga to  keep his  lips zipped. Despite his \nmiserable performance during 2001 (mostly qualifying on  the  third or \nfourth rows and finishing 10th or  worse), Yamaha still rate him as  a \nfavoured son, and they’d be  mad not to  give him a  YZR-M1 for  2002 \nbecause however shite he is on  a  500, he’s the  bomb on  big, lairy four- \nstrokes. There’s only one problem. Carlos Checa recently destroyed lap \nrecords on  the M1  so  there’s others after this  particular 200 horsepower \nride and Haga’s got  to join the  queue with Checa, Biaggi and Co. \nNot surprisingly he avoids all talk about 2002; indeed we'd been told \nthat this subject was out  of bounds. We  ask  him anyway. ‘Maybe I stay \nhouse, in Japan.’ he replies. ‘Maybe my father and mother come to GPs \ninstead.’ Thanks Nori, you’ve been most helpful. \nEpilogue: Haga returned to  WSB in  2002 and has been there ever \nsince. At  the  time of writing, however, he  still hadn’t won the  title. \n\nCHAPTER 20 \nTHE Boy WONDER’ S \nLONGEST INTERVIEW \nNovember 2001 \nThese days, all  media interviews with Valentino Rossi are \nrestricted to  ten minutes, give or  take a minute or  two for  good \nbehaviour (on the journalist’s part). Back at  the end of  2001, \nsoon after he’d wrapped up  his  first premier-class crown, Rossi \nagreed to  a  one-on-one interview which ended up  going on  for \nan  hour, in his  team’s office within the Sepang paddock. As  the \nclock ticked, Rossi’s white-haired manager Gibo Badioli began \nto  pace the room impatiently, but Vale was happy chatting, so \nGibo let him be. This might just be Rossi’s longest-ever interview \nwith a non-Italian journalist... \nYou  were incredibly dominant throughout 2001, were you surprised by how \nmany races you won? \nI was surprised to  win the  first three in a  row because I’m  usually not \nso  fast at  the  start of  the  season. But we  had some very good tests \nduring the  winter, so  we  arrived at  the  first three GPs in good shape. I \nknew we had the potential to  win some races and the world \nchampionship, but  I thought it would start more slowly. \nMax Biaggi always talks a lot about you  having the better bike... \nWho? Max who? Ha,  ha! \nBut  could you  beat him if you were on  a  Yamaha? \nFor  me, I think yes, because we're not  talking about Biaggi winning six \nraces and me  seven, or  me  scoring just ten  points more than him. Of \ncourse, I think my  bike is very good. Me, my  team and HRC had worked \nhard on  this bike since October 2000, we  did  some fantastic work and \nwe  made a fantastic bike, but  I also think that I was the  fastest rider in \n2001, usually. I won 11  races, Biaggi won three and he only won Assen \n\nTHE Boy WONDER’S LONGEST INTERVIEW 125 \nbecause \nthe  \nrace \nwas \nstopped \nearly \nbecause \nof \nrain. \nAnd \nwhen \nhe \nwon \nat  \nLe \nMans \nand \nSachsenring, \nhis  \nteam-mate \nCarlos \nCheca \nwas \nsecond, \nso \nfor \nsure \nthose \ntracks \nwere \nnot \nso \nbad \nfor \nthe \nYamaha; \nat \nSachsenring \nthere \nwere \nfive \nYamahas \nin \nthe \nfirst \nsix! \nSometimes \nLoris \nCapirossi \nalso \nsaid \nhe’d \nbeat \nme \nif \nhe’d \nhad \na \n2001 \nNSR \nlike \nme. \nHe \nhad \nthe \nold \nbike \nthis \nyear \nbut \nI \nstill \nbeat \nhim \nin 2000 \nwhen \nI \nwas \nriding \nthe \nsame \nbike \nfor \nmost \nof \nthe \nseason. \nI \nended \nthe \nseason \nsecond \noverall, \nhe \narrived \nin \nseventh. \nYou seemed to make a big jump forward after the midseason break, which halted \nBiaggt's title charge; how did you do that? \nWe had a few better parts from HRC, but it was the  team that made the \ndifference because they changed their way of working to  suit  me.  Mick \nDoohan had a different riding style from me, he  didn’t use so  much \ncorner speed, so  he had less  of a problem with settings. He used to  slide \nand go,  like a  real 500 rider. But I came from 250s so  I had to  change \nmy style to  go  into corners a  little slower and though I learned to \nunderstand slide control and started to  slide like Mick, I’m  still faster \nin the  middle of the  corner, not  because I’m  a better rider, just because \nI have a  different technique. And to  ride with this style, using more \ncorner speed, you have to  have more accurate settings. \nBut  the  team also started working my way. Germany was a very hard \nrace for  us  and a  very bad result [Rossi was seventh, his  worst dry- \nweather result of  2001], but it  was also very good because Jeremy \n[Burgess, Rossi’s ex-Doohan crew chief] understood that it  was \nnecessary to follow me  more and to make more changes. From Germany \non  he  changed a  lot  and we  tried many different things with settings. \nBefore that I would sometimes say  I want to  try  this or  that and he \nwould say  ‘No, for  sure it won’t work’, but  now we  try everything. \nSo how did the bike change? \nAll \nthe  \nsuspension \nsettings, \nto \ngive \nme  \nmore \nfront \ntyre \ngrip, \nbut  \nmost \nof \nall \nthe \nbike \nnow \nturns \nbetter. \nThe \nHonda \n500 \nhad \nalways \nhad \na \nturning \nproblem, \nit \nwould \nalways \nrun \nwide; \nnow \nthe \nbike \nis \nbetter \nfrom \nthat \npoint of view. \n[At  \nthis \nmoment, \nRossi’s \nHRC \nteam \nmanager \nCarlos \nFiorani \nchips \nin: \n‘I’m \nsaying \nthis \nbecause \nI \nknow \nValentino \ncan’t. \nWhen \nValentino \ncame \n\n126 THE FAST STUFF \nto  500s, Jeremy would only let  him test one or  two things at  a  time, \nbecause Mick was like that, Mick would never test more than two or \nthree things at  a  time. But now Jeremy says that Valentino has an \nincredible system, he can  test  many different things at  the  same time, \nwithout getting confused. He  has some kind of amazing link system \nwhich allows him to  think “I like this” and “I don’t like this’’.’] \nDo you  think Max hasn't changed his style from 250s? \nYes, absolutely. Biaggi is  a  very hard 250 rider, he  won four 250 \nchampionships, so  he’s very good on  250s, and of  course, he’s also \nvery good on  500s. But he  never slides the rear, never, you never \nsee him sliding because he  uses the front so  much. Riding like \nthat it’s  possible to  win three or  four races a  year, because with that \nstyle it’s  necessary to  have the  settings 100  per  cent correct. When I \nstarted 500s I also used the  front very much, and I crashed many times \nbecause I was using the  front too  much. Biaggi also uses the  front \ntoo  much. \nDoes Biaggi’s Yamaha YZR have any advantages over your Honda NSR? \nYes, the Yamaha is easier to use  than our  bike on  acceleration, it’s easier \nto  open the  throttle early because the  engine character is  softer. We \nhave good braking stability but the  Yamaha has a  very good corner \nspeed. \nYou  rode your best  race of 2001 at  Donington, coming from 11th to  win; how \ncome you're so good at overtaking? \nI’m  very used to  coming from the  back because I’ve  never been a very \ngood starter; it was the  same in  125 and 250. Like at  Barcelona this \nyear, I started from pole but  I was almost last at the first corner because \nI collided with Alex Crivillé or  Sete Gibernau. Maybe other riders would \nhave thought ‘Oh fuck, we’re lost’, but I did  the  same in  the  250 race \nthere in “98.  I started from second on  the  grid, and I’d had a good pace \nin \npractice, \nbut \nI \nstarted \nvery \nbad \nand \nI \nwas \n20th \nat \nthe \nfirst \ncorner, \nso \nit \nwas \nnecessary \nto \nstay \ncalm \nand \njust \ngo. \nIt’s \nalways \nbeen \nquite \neasy \nfor \nme \nto \novertake \neverywhere, \nbut \nI \ndon’t \nthink \nthat’s \nbecause \nI’m \nbetter \nthan \nthe \nother \nguys, \njust \nbecause \nI \ntry. \nMany \nother \nriders \nsay \nthat \nit’s \nvery \nhard \nto \novertake \nat \nthe \nSachsenring, \nokay \nso \nit \nis, \nbut \nif \nyou \ntry, \nmaybe it’s  not  very hard. \n\nTHE Boy WONDER’S LONGEST INTERVIEW 127 \nDuring \n2001 \nthe \n500 \npace \nwas  \nmuch \nfaster \nthan \nbefore, \nwhy? \nWith \nMichelin’s \n16.5in \nrear \nfor \nsure \nit’s \npossible \nto \nhave \na \nfaster \nrhythm \nall \nthe \nway \nthrough \nthe \nrace. \nAlso, \nthere \nwere \nthree \nItalians \nfighting \nfor \nthe \nchampionship, \nso \nthere \nwas \nlots \nof \nrivalry \nand \nwe \nall \ngave \n120 \nper \ncent \nto \nbe \nthe \nfastest. \nPlus \nI’ve \nalways \nhad \na \ngood \npace \nin \nraces, \nso \nif the \nothers \nwant \nto \nchase \nme \nand \nbeat \nme, \nthey’ve \ngot \nto \npush. \nDuring 1999, when I was doing 250s, and during 2000, the  500  pace \nwas sometimes the same as  the  250s and I hated that. It’s  not  right \nthat the pace should be  the same because 500s have double the \nhorsepower, so  it was time to raise the pace. After Mick stopped in early \n1999, the  500  pace was very calm and sweet, the lap times were always \nslower than the  lap record. \nSo if Mick was  still racing, could you  beat him? \nHa ha!  I think I’m  now quite good on  500s, but  I’ve  seen some Bf Mick’s \ndata readouts and, fuck, he  was very fast. It  was him that made the \ndifference, not the  bike. He  was able to  make the  difference because \nhe’d always been fighting with Rainey, Schwantz, Lawson and  Gardner, \nand when all the ‘Old Dogs’ stopped, it was easy for him to beat Crivillé, \nRoberts, Okada and all.  If  I was to race Mick, I think I could fight with \nhim, but  I don’t know who would win. Nobody knows, ha ha! \nWhen Biaggi crashed right in front of you  at Motegi, for the second time in four \nraces, are you  sure you  didn’t smile? \nNo, I didn’t smile. When Biaggi crashed at Brno and Motegi he was going \nso  quick. I had my mind on  other things, like  ‘Ah, maybe it’s  possible to \novertake him here on  the  last  lap’, or  ‘Here I’m  faster, there I’m  slower’, \nand when he  crashed I thought ‘Oh fuck, now it’s  necessary to  change \nmy plan’, so  it was ‘What do I do now?’ For  sure it was easier to win after \nhe crashed at  Brno and Motegi but  I didn’t smile either time. \nWill beating Biaggi to the title change your relationship with him? \nIt \nwon’t \nchange \nmy \nrelationship \nwith \nhim, \nbecause \nwe \ndon’t \nhave \na \nrelationship, ha! \nTell \nus  \nwhat \nhappened \nwhen \nyou  \nhad \nthe \npunch-up \nat \nCatalunya. \nWhat \nhappened \nwasn’t \nvery \nbig \nand \nit \nwasn’t \nimportant. \nIt \nwas \nlike \nbeing \nat \nschool: \n‘He \nstarted \nit!’, \n‘No, \nhe \nstarted \nit!’, \n‘No, \nhe \nstarted \nit!’ \nBiaggi \n\n128 THE FAST STUFF \nsaid that I started this  fucking shit but it’s necessary to think about what \nhappened before. I started the  race from last  position and I arrived first \nat  the  flag, I made the  fastest lap and I made a fantastic victory, so  why \nwould I want to make all that shit? That’s all I’m  saying. \nMax says you  use  the rivalry for energy to help you  ride faster; do you  agree? \nWhen I was racing for  the  250 title in  1999 my  main rival was Tohru \nUkawa but  I always knew in my  mind that I could beat him. For  sure, \nBiaggi is stronger because he’s so  fast. To beat me  he gave 120  per cent, \nso  the  fight was fucking hard. In the  past in he never rode the  500  like \nhe  did last season, maybe ’98  but  in ’99  and 2000 he wasn’t so  fast. \nIn 99, when I was fighting with Ukawa, he had a 40 point lead after \nmy chain broke at  Paul Ricard. It  was a  strange situation because I \nknew I was faster than him but  I knew I couldn’t afford one mistake \nbecause the  gap  would go to  60 points and I’d be fucked. \nYou  want to choose between the RCV and NSR for 2002, but do you  really think \nHonda will let you  make the choice? \nIt’s  a difficult situation but  I think it’s  necessary for me  to  try the  RCV \nbecause although Honda think this bike is very much faster than the \n500, I’m  not  so  sure. Before I speak any more I think I need to  try the \nRCV again because so  far I’ve  only ridden it for eight laps at  Suzuka in \nthe  rain. \nYou  seem to think the four-stroke won't give you  as  much riding satisfaction as \nthe 500... \nYes, the  satisfaction of riding the  500 is a very, very big motivation for \nme, because when you're riding the most difficult bike in the world, it’s \nnecessary to  have a  perfect set-up if you’re to  be  able to  ride fast, and \nyou've also got to ride perfect all the  time. I think it’s  necessary to have \nbig balls to  ride the  500. I think the  four-stroke may be  faster but for \nsure it won't give the  same sensation. \nYou  have achieved a huge amount of success, and wealth also, but is the price of \nfame too much? \nThere is a price, but  for  sure fame has  more good points than bad. The \nfirst bad thing is  the stress. Now I can’t go  anywhere in  the  world \nwithout being recognised. Very many people recognise me  and want \n\nx0 great.

The situation is a little better in London, but \nnow I’ve won the  500  championship, Italy is a nightmare, a nightmare. \nI will never be able to live  a normal life  there, never. \nYou  seem to  cope very well with fame, especially the  attention you  get from \nthe media. \nUntil 2001 I was most famous when I started 125s because I was new, \nand I started to win very much and I made some big shows at  the  end \nof races. At  that time my  popularity increased and it changed my  life, \nbecause before then I was normal! Now I don’t know when I'll dare to \nreturn to  Italy. But fame affects you in different ways; when you have \nmany fans waiting outside your motorhome who follow you like a \nslipstream, yes, it’s heavy, but it’s good. But it’s worse \nwith the  Italian journalists because they only follow \nme  for one reason, they're waiting for a mistake. If I ‘Rossi won very \nsay one word wrong or  if  I  crash, it’s  ‘Ah fuck, many 125  races in \nhe’s stupid.’ 1997 but now he \nmakes mistakes, he’s \nAfter you won the  125 title, you went to  250s and your stupid’ \npopularity slipped, why? \nWhen I started 250s my  results were, well, not  shit, \nbut  during the first half of the  season I only won one  race. I made some \nmistakes, \nhad \nsome \ncrashes \nand \nsometimes \nI \nfinished \nbehind \nTetsuya \nHarada \nand \nCapirossi, \nwho \nwere \nalso \nriding \nAprilias. \nI \nthink \nthat \nwas \nnormal \nbecause \nHarada \nand \nCapirossi \nhad \nridden \n250s \nfor \nmany \nyears, \nwhile \nit \nwas \nmy \nfirst \nseason, \nso \nit \nwas \ndifficult \nto \nbeat \nthem \nwith \nso \nlittle experience. \nBut  \nvery \nmany \npeople, \nwho \nI \nthought \nwere \nmy \nfriends, \nsaid \n‘Ah, \n250s \naren’t \nthe \nsame \nas \n125s. \nRossi \nwon \nvery \nmany \n125 \nraces \nin \n1997 \nbut \nnow \nhe \nmakes \nmistakes, \nhe’s \nstupid’. \nThis \nwas \nreally \nbad \nfor \nme, \nbut \nalso \nreally \ngood \nbecause \nI \nfound \nout \nwho \nmy \nreal \nfriends \nwere. \nBefore \nthen \nI \nthought \nI \nhad \nmore \nfriends \nthan \nI \nactually \ndid. \nSo \nwho \nare \nyour \nreal \nfriends, \ncelebrities \nor \nold \nmates? \nFor \nsure, \nin  \nmy  \nposition \nI \nknow \nsome \nfamous \npeople, \nsingers, \nactors \nand \nwhenever \nI’m  \nin \nMilano \nor  \nRoma, \nI \nsee  \nthese \npeople \nand \nsay  \n‘Ciao!’ \nBut \nmy  \nbest \nfriends \nare  \nold  \nfriends. \nWe  \nhave \na  \ngroup \nof \neight \nor  \nnine \npeople \nwho \nhave \nbeen \nfriends \nfor \n15 \nor \n20 \nyears, \nsince \npre-school. \n\n138 THE FAST STUFF \nYou seemed less open and more serious during 2001, have you  changed? \nThe way you see  things, your view of the  world, changes between the \nage  of 18 and 22.  I’m  older now, so  I think I understand more, and for \nsure my  life  has  changed. Whenever I leave my  motorhome there are \nalways very many people and unfortunately I don’t have enough time \nto do every autograph and photo because we  have work to do.  If I never \nsay  stop, I don’t get a minute to myself. \nWhen you're 16 or  17 you  don’t have problems, unless it’s  something \nreally big  like family problems. Life is  different when you're young, \nyou only think about having fun. All  that changes when you get \nmore responsibilities, especially in  my  case because I have so  much \nto  do. \nTell us  about your alter egos: Rossifumt, Valentinik and  the Doctor... \nBefore I started racing in the world championship I was a big fan of GP \nracing, it  was my passion. I watched all  the races on  TV,  knew all \nthe riders’ numbers, all  their helmet design, the whole circus. \nRossifumi was for  Norifumi Abe because I really liked him and all  the \nJapanese riders. \nWe  changed to Valentinik in  1999 because we  needed a superhero to \ncome back from the bad situation of ’98.  At the end of 98  I changed my \nriding style a little, won the  last  four races and became very strong on \nthe  250. After that I prepared to  win the  championship in  ’99, so  we \nchose this superhero based on  an  Italian comic hero called Paparinik. \nPaparino is Donald Duck in Italian and Walt Disney has a duck superhero \ncalled Paparinik, who wears a  mask and a  cape, but he’s not like \nSuperman, he’s a little bit  unlucky, he  makes some mistakes, some \ncasinos [Italian for chaos], but  at  the end of every story he’s always the \nsuperhero. Paparino becomes a  superhero and becomes Paparinik, so \nValentino became a  superhero and became Valentinik! \nAfter that we  changed to  the  Doctor for 2001 because with 500s you \ndon’t need a  superhero, you need to  be  quiet, calm and thoughtful, \nmore like a  doctor. Also, because in  Italy there are  very many doctors \ncalled Dr  Rossi, so  I became Dr  Rossi. ; \nSo what's next? \nFor  2002 we  stay with the  doctor for  sure, and after that I don’t know, \nwe've no  ideas yet. \n\nTHE \nBoy \nWONDER’S \nLONGEST \nINTERVIEW \n139 \nAnd \nwhat \ndo \nthe \nwords \n‘Tribu \ndei \nChihuahua’ \non \nyour \nvisor \nmean? \nIt  \nmeans \n‘The \nChihuahua \nTribe’. \nThe \nChihuahua \nwere \na \ntribe \nof \nNorth \nAmerican \nIndians, \nand \nour \ngang \nof \nfriends \nis \ncalled \nthe \n‘Tribu \ndei \nChihuahua’! \nAnd WLF on  the collar of your leathers? \nWLF stands for ‘Viva La  Figa’ which means ‘Long Live Pussy’! \nTell us  how your post-race victory celebrations started. \nUsually in a bar in Tavullia at  two in the  morning! They’re just a game, \njust some fun with my fan club. When I started winning GPs, we \ndecided we  should try to  make some big fun  because back then all the \nriders were very, very serious. We just wanted to  do  something new to \nshow the  big emotion of winning races. \nSo why did they finish? \nBecause I don’t think a lot of people really understood the whole thing, \nso  they don’t deserve it.  It’s  like last  June at Mugello, we  had my bikes \nin that Hawaiian paint scheme, they looked great. But  when I crashed \nout  of the  race some people said I’d  only crashed because I’d  been up \nall night painting the  bikes! \nIn  98  at  Mugello I  finished second and arrived on  the podium \nwearing beach gear and people said bad things. It’s  like if you win \nevery race of your career you're a genius, but  if you finish second you're \na fucking clown, or  stupid! So I decided it was better to  stop all this and \njust wave like other riders, then have a  big party on  Sunday night with \nmy  real friends. \nThe problem with many journalists who write bad things is  that \nthey are  too  conformist, so  if you make a  rude sign for  fun, you’Te a \npiece of shit, or  a  criminal, so  you should go  to jail. I don’t understand \nall  that. \nWhere did the Hawaiian paintjob come from? \nIt was an  old  idea. In  ’99  we  had two different ideas for  my  Mugello \npaintjob \n— \nthe \n1970s-style \nValentinik \npeace \nand \nlove \nthing, \nwhich \nis \nwhat \nwe \nused, \nand \nthe \nHawaiian \nthing. \nSo \nwe \nalready \nhad \nthe \nidea, \nand I think it was a very, very beautiful bike. \n\n140 THE FAST STUFF \nTell  us  about your sleeping habits, JB  has  had to  wake you a few times for \npractice... \nI never go  to  bed before one o’clock, and there’s no  limit on  when I go \nto  bed, but  even when I go  to  sleep very late I always wake up  at  8.30, \nthough when I do wake up  I always have a big confusion for  the  first \nfive minutes, then after that I remember: ‘Oh fuck, I’m  at world grand \nprix!’ So I have a  shower and then I’m  okay. I never get up  too  close to \nriding time because the  500 is a  dangerous bike so  it’s  necessary to be \nawake when you  climb aboard. Maybe in the afternoon after practice at \nfour or  five o’clock I'll  sleep for another hour. \nHow much time do you spend in London now? \nMost of the  time. I have very many Italian friends there, who work in \nrestaurants. There’s one near my  home, all  the  chefs and waiters are \nItalian, and when they finish work we go  dancing, to  clubs like \nChina White. . \nWhat's the girl situation? \nI split up  with Eliana last October, so  I’ve been single for  a  year, one \nyear of freedom, ha! \nYou're 22  years old  and you've already won everything in  bikes; how are  you \ngoing to stay interested? \nNow we  have a  new fight with the  four-stroke. It’s  like starting from \nzero, like changing classes again. But if  I win with the four-stroke \nmaybe it will be  necessary to  change sport. I know myself very well, \nand once I’ve won, I don’t find it very interesting to  stay on  to  win \nagain. Breaking records isn’t important to  me. Once I’ve won the  250, \nI’ve \nwon \nit, \nsame \nwith \n500. \nNow \nI \nhave \nthe \nfour-stroke, \nwhich \nis \na \nnew \nbike to  develop, a bit like  having a baby. If we  win with the  RCV, it will \nbe very satisfying. And after that, bo, I don’t know... \nWhat about rally driving? : \nI \nlike \ndriving \ncars \nvery \nmuch. \nMy \nfirst \ndream \nwhen \nI \nwas \nyoung \nwas \nto \nbecome \na \ncar  \nracer. \nI \nstarted \nracing \nin \nkarts \nbecause \nI \nvery \nmuch \nliked \nFormula \nOne, \nSenna, \nProst \nand \nMansell, \nI \nwas \na \nbig \nfan, \nso \nI \nstarted \ngo-kart \nracing. \nI \nalso \nstarted \nriding \nminibikes, \nbut \nthat \nwas \njust \nfor \nfun. \nBut \nthe \nproblem \nwith \ngo-karts \nis \nthat \nthey \ncost \ntoo \nmuch \nmoney. \nJust \n\nTHE Boy WONDER’S LONGEST INTERVIEW 141 \nto  do  the  Italian championship needed very much money, so  I said to \nmy father, ‘Maybe it’s better we  race with the bike,’ and he say ‘Ah, bo, \nreally?’ I say  ‘Yes, so  is it possible we  try a  bike?’ He  said ‘Yes,’ so  we \nstarted minibike racing in 92. \nMaybe you should retire and become an  actor, like Agostini did? \nI think no!  I like  driving cars very much so  maybe that will be the  new \nfight. After bikes, rallying is my passion. But  to  say I'll do the world rally \nchampionship after bikes is  unreal, because, fuck, you have people \nwho've been racing rallies for 25 years, while I'll be starting from zero. I \ndon’t know if I can  be fast enough. Yes, I’m quite good because my father \nhas  raced rallies for the last  ten  years and I sometimes go with him, so  I \nunderstand it a  little, and I’m  quite fast with a WRC car  like Subaru or \nToyota. I did  a Michelin championship in the  Canary Islands at  the  end \nof 2000 and I fought with Panisi, who won a  round of the  WRC this \nseason, but I lost five or  six  seconds to  him in  two minutes, so  I’m  not \nthe best in the world, and it won’t be very easy to change sports. \nI guess your other choice is a very, very  long retirement. \nYes, for  now I have something to  do  here, though I don’t know how \nlong for.  The problem is  that I'll  be  finished by the  time I’m 30.  And \nthat’s too  long a  retirement, so  it will be  necessary to  have something \nnew to  do. \n\nCHAPTER 21 \nTHE INSIDE STORY OF  THE MOST \nEXOTIC GP BIKE IN  HISTORY \nJune 2002 \nFour-strokes returned to GP racing in 2002, 21 years after the last \nfour-stroke contested the premier 500 world championship. That \nbike was Honda’s fabled oval-piston NR500, and this is its  story \nFour-strokes took over GP  racing at  the start of  2002, when new \nregulations allowed 990cc four-strokes to  take on  the  500 two-strokes \nthat had dominated for so  long. Cynics viewed this transformation as  a \nfinal victory for  Honda, the  four-stroke fans who had been trying to \nmake GPs a  four-stroke deal for 25  years. \nWhen Honda first contested the  world championships in the  1960s, \nfour-strokes were king, but  as  the  strokers got up  to  speed, Honda quit \nand stayed out  of GPs for  a  dozen years. When they returned in  1979, \nthey did so  with a  four-stroke, even though two-strokes were all- \ndominant by then. The wondrously exotic oval-piston, 32-valve NR500 \nraced for four years, cost Honda billions of yen and never scored a single \nworld championship point, though it  did win a  couple of  low-key \nnational events. Nevertheless Honda rated the project a success, because \nit taught them plenty about four-stroke technology, much of which will \nhelp them in the  new four-stroke GP  era. \nThis is the  story of Honda’s NR500 as  told by five  people close to  the \nproject —  Youichi Oguma, Seiki Ishii, Gerald Davison, Mick Grant and \nRon Haslam —  and an  outsider —  GP journalist Mick Woollett. \nOguma was one of Honda’s most charismatic warlords and the  man \nwho masterminded the  NR’s first win in  a  low-key Japanese race. He \nalways said what he thought. Engineer Ishii started out  working on  the \nNR’s ultra-complex carbs before becoming HRC team manager in  the \nmid-1990s, looking after NSR250s and 500s. \nDavison was team manager of  the Honda International Racing \nCompany and the  man who oversaw much of  the NR saga, liaising \n\nTHE \nINSIDE \nSTORY \nOF  \nTHE \nMOST \nEXOTIC \nGP  \nBIKE \nIN  \nHISTORY \n143 \nbetween \nHonda’s \nengineers \nand \ntheir \nriders, \nlike  \nGrant, \na \nTT \nexpert \nand \ntop \nGP  \nrider \nof \nthe  \ntime. \nGrant \nspent \ntwo \nfruitless \nyears \ndeveloping \nand \nracing \nthe  \nNR  \nbefore \nyoungsters \nFreddie \nSpencer \nand \nHaslam \nhad \na \ngo. \nHaslam \nwas \non \nhis way \nup \nthe \nracing \nladder \nwhen \nHonda \ngave \nhim \nthe \nNR; \nhe \nlater \nwent \non \nto \nrace \nthe \nfactory’s \nNS and \nNSR500 \ntwo-strokes. \nWoollett was a  doyen of  1960s and 1970s GP  journalism, an  old- \nschool writer who could always see  through the  PR  fog. \nGerald Davison ‘Soichiro Honda used to hate two-strokes; if he saw a \ntwo-stroke engine in  R&D, the engineers would tell him it  was a \nlawnmower engine. Of  course, Honda wanted to  get  back into GPs, \nwe'd been out too  long and we  were losing commercial ground to \nYamaha, but  the  NR  was conceived right at  the  top  of the  company by \npeople who weren’t in  touch. The passion within Honda was four- \nstroke but these people had no  grasp of  the  gap between two-stroke \nand four-stroke technology, they simply believed that Honda could win \nby putting enough muscle into it.  What we  ended up  doing was like \ntrying to put  a man on  the  moon. \n‘I was in Japan for  the  press launch of the  CBX1000 six.  I was pretty \nclose to  Kawashima (team manager of Honda’s original TT team in  1959 \nand then president of Honda Motor) and he  sent for  me, asking me  to \nwrite a  speech for  the  press. We  got  well into it  and then he  said he \nwanted to announce that Honda would return to GP racing, with a four- \nstroke. I was shocked but  he  thought it was funny that he’d told me  in \nthis way. Then he told me  I was going to organise the whole thing.’ \nMick Grant ‘When Gerald was trying to get me  to sign a contract he told \nme  they’d got  some radical ideas which frightened me a little. Like they'd \nuse  liquid nitrogen to cool the motor so  they wouldn’t have radiators, and \nthey'd use a lot of ceramics, which were almost unheard of at the  time.’ \nGerald Davison ‘The management said “We're going back into racing \nand \nwe \ndon’t \nwant \nanyone \nold, \nthis \nproject \nwill \nhelp \nyoung \nengineers \ncut \ntheir \nteeth”. \nThat \nwas \na \nmiscalculation \nbecause \nthere \nwas \nno \none \nwithin \nthe \nNR \ngroup \nwith \nany \nracing \nexperience, \nit \nwas \nall \ngreen. \nSilly \nmistakes \nwere \nmade \nbut \nno \nmatter \nhow \ndark \nthings \ngot, \nno \none \never \nasked \nfor \nadvice \nfrom \npeople \nlike \nMichihiko \nAika \n(the \nengineer \nwho \nmasterminded \nHonda’s \n1960s \nGP \nsuccesses \n).’ \n\n144 THE FAST STUFF \nMick Woollett ‘I wrote at that time: “What are  they doing?” They didn’t \nseem to realise that things had moved. I didn’t see  how it could possibly \nsucceed against the  latest two-strokes but  I never expected them to  fail \nquite so  totally or dramatically. The  thing they built in ’79 wasn’t even as \ngood as  the  ’76  MV Agusta (the last four-stroke to  win a  GP,  at  a  wet \nNurburgring in ’76), it was slower and it didn’t handle half as  well. That \nfirst year it had 16-inch wheels, a funny frame and weird forks. The next \nyear all  that was gone, it had a  British-made Maxton frame, 18-inch \nwheels and ordinary forks. It was all just an  engineering exercise.’ \nMick Grant ‘When IJ arrived at Honda R&D I went into the workshop and \nit all looked so  convincing, I couldn’t believe it wasn’t going to work. But \nwhen I first rode it the  engine wouldn’t tick over at  less than 7000rpm \nbecause there was  no flywheel. The power started about 12,500 and though \nit’d run  on  to 21,000, it was all done by 17 five. And it felt slow, very much \nso.  I was four seconds off the  Suzuka record and I was riding as well as  I’d \never done in  my  life. The engineers couldn’t understand why it wasn’t \ngoing quicker, they almost didn’t want to grasp the reality. \n‘The handling wasn’t a big problem, but with less than 100 horsepower \nit wasn’t going to  be.  The main worry was the  aluminium monocoque \nchassis, it kept cracking. I’d do three laps, come in and have it welded, \nthen another four laps and the  same again. It  didn’t make for  happy \nmotoring! The monocoque was a great idea, it would’ve worked well in \ncarbon fibre. There were lots  of good ideas but they jumped in too  early; \nthey should’ve kept it under wraps and kept testing.’ \nMick Woollett ‘We all just fell  about laughing when the bike made its \ndebut at  the  British GP.  It was such an  absolute total balls-up, the  only \nreason they got on  the  grid was that someone pulled out. Then poor old \nGranty fell arse over head at the first bend and the bike burst into flames! \nA lot  of people hated Honda because they always had the  most money, \nthough we  were delighted they’d come back into racing. It was good to \nsee  them get beaten and the  NR  kept us  amused for a few years.’ \nMick Grant ‘At  Silverstone we  went out  for first practice with the  125s \nand 250s and there were TZ250s pulling away down the  straights. The \nadded problem was that Mr  Honda was there, so  the  pressure on  the \nengineers must’ve been huge. \n\nTHE INSIDE STORY OF  THE MOST EXOTIC GP BIKE IN  HISTORY 145 \n‘It wasn’t so bad for me  because I knew I was riding good. As a racer, \nyou can  win and be pissed off because you've not  ridden your best, and \nyou can come away from a  race with a  lower placing and be  happy \nbecause you rode 100  per  cent. \n‘We'd never have finished Silverstone because —  and I don’t know if I \nshould say  this —  the  bikes didn’t have enough fuel in  them because \nHonda didn’t want to finish last. The NR was a bastard to start and when \nI leapt on,  I was on  the back of the thing and it wheelied, pumping oil on \nto the rear tyre, so when I laid it into the first corner, down I went. I was \ndisappointed but  it wasn’t like  I thought I was going to win. I never said \n“let the  bastard burn!” As  a  racer you’ve got  to  believe in what you’re \nriding —  if you don’t you can’t give your best. My two  years with the NR \nwere great, it was such an  experience. People called it the “Never Ready” \nbut  I never thought the bike was a joke.’ \nGerald Davison ‘At  GPs we  had two teams to look after the bikes, one \nthat worked at  the  track during the  day and another that worked away \nfrom the track, in  secret, rebuilding engines. These \nJapanese engineers slept during the  day and spent all \nnight rebuilding the  motors because we  couldn’t run ‘We  took some NR \nthem one day and rely on  them the  next.

I was concerned \nbecause the  NR  wasn’t doing well for  Honda. I made big voice to  my \nbosses: “The NR   idea is stupid, impossible!” But they put me  in charge \nfor  a Suzuka national race, saying that if  I made the  bike win, I could \ngo back to  street projects. We made clever fuel-stop strategy for  Suzuka \nand won the  race but  the  bosses said I must stay with the race team.’ \nMick Woollett ‘The whole oval piston thing was so  wrong, they \nshould’ve thought about it for  one minute and discarded the  idea. It’s \na horrible concept: long pistons with two con  rods each, all that friction \nand rocking motions too. All  the  bloody thing could do  was scratch \naround with the  also-rans on  RG500s, then in  1981 they put  the  best \nrider in the world on  it. Freddie Spencer rode his guts out  at  Silverstone, \ngot up  to  fifth, then it blew!’ \nSeiki Ishii ‘I  came to  Europe with the NR in  1980, working on \ncarburettor settings and engine development. My best memory was \ndoing a  non-championship race at  Laguna Seca in  1981. Freddie \nSpencer was racing the  NR  and Kenny Roberts his  TZ750. They had a \nbig  fight in  the  heat race and Freddie won. They had clutch start for \nthis race but  in those days GPs were push starts, the  NR  was not  easy \nto  push start. My other good memory was sitting in  the  forest at  Spa, \nwatching Ron Haslam ride the  NR  in the  1982 Belgian GP.  He  got  11th, \njust one  place outside the  points.’ \nRon Haslam ‘Kork Ballington was in front of me  at  Spa and he cut  the \nchicane. He  should’ve had so  many seconds added for that but we  were \ntoo \nlate \nwith \nour \nofficial \nprotest. \nWe \nshould’ve \nbeen \ntenth \nand \nthat \nwould’ve \ngiven \nthe \nNR \nits \nfirst \npoint. \nHonda \nwere \ndisappointed \nbut \nnot \ntoo \nmuch \nbecause \nthey’d \nhad \nhigher \nhopes \nfor \nthe \nbike, \nthey’d \nwanted \nit \nto \nwin \nGPs. \nThe \nbike \nweren’t \nbad \nby \nthen \n— \nit \nhad \nmore \nspeed \nthan \nthe \nbest \nprivateer \n500s \nbut \nyou \nstill \ncouldn’t \nget \nnear \nthe \nfactory \nbikes.’ \nSeiki \nIshii \n‘I  \nstill \nbelieve \nthe  \nNR  \ncould’ve \nwon \nGPs; \nby  \n1982 \nit \nwas \nproducing \n130 \nhorsepower. \nIf \nwe \ncould \nhave \nsolved \ndurability, \nwe \ncould’ve \nimproved \nperformance. \nThe \nmain \nproblems \nwere \nvalves \nand \npiston \nrings. \nNowadays \nthat \nwouldn’t \nbe \na \nproblem \nbecause \nmaterials \n\nTHE \nINSIDE \nSTORY \nOF  \nTHE \nMOST \nEXOTIC \nGP \nBIKE \nIN  \nHISTORY \n147 \nare  \nbetter. \nAlso, \nif \nGPs \nhad \nbeen \nclutch \nstarts, \nI \nthink \nit \nwould’ve \nbeen \neasier \nto \nwin \nraces. \nOf \ncourse, \nthe \nresults \nwere \nnot  \nsatisfying \nbut \nHonda \nlearned \nso  \nmuch. \nThe \nslipper \nclutch \n[used \nin \nmost \nmodern \nsuperbikes \n] \ncame \nfrom \nthe \nNR, \nplus \nwe \nlearned \nabout \nV4 \ntechnology, \ngear \ncam \ntrain, \ncarbon \nbrakes \nand \nso \non.’ \nRon Haslam ‘I really enjoyed the bike. Even so,  when I first rode it we \nwere getting a lot  of blow-ups and that gave me  a  few panics because \nit threw oil  on  to  the  rear tyre. The motor would always chuck its  oil \nout  and then blow, so  we  cured that in the  simplest way by putting the \nbreather where I could see  it, inside the  screen. If I saw oil, I’d kill  the \nmotor, and we  made a  lot  more progress that way because we  didn’t \nblow so  many engines.’ \nYouichi Oguma ‘I told my  bosses again that the  NR  had no  potential. \nWe'd spent over three years of development budget and still couldn’t \nbeat the two-strokes. I began to look at Honda’s two-stroke motocrossers. \nHonda was dominating motocross and I wanted that technology. Honda \nsent me  to  a  GP  and I confirmed what we  needed, timing other bikes \nwith stopwatch, taking photos and so  on. My report said it  was \nimpossible to  win with the  NR, that if we  continued, we’d have to  do \nhara-kiri (Japanese ritual disembowelment). My report exploded at \nHonda like a  terrorist bomb. Then the  bosses ordered Miyakoshi (the \nengineer in  charge of  Honda’s motocross programme) to  help the \nroadrace department. We  went to  a  drinking club together and drank \nsake, discussing what kind of two-stroke engine we  needed. We  both \nchose V3  because other types were too  heavy or  complex. We  worked \nvery fast so  the  two-stroke NS500 could replace the  NR. This bike won \nHonda’s first 500 title in ‘83  with Freddie Spencer.’ \nGerald Davison ‘After the NR project folded I was taking care of Honda’s \ninterests at  the  FIM, trying to  get  the  FIM to  agree to  a  four-stroke GP \nformula. All  they’d agree to  was turbocharging at  half capacity, which \nwasn’t \nthe \nideal \nsolution \nfor \nHonda \nbut \ntheir \nengineers \ngave \nit \na \ntry \nanyway. \nIn \n’85 \nthey \nbuilt \nan \nNR250 \nturbo \ntwin \nwhich \nmade \nsomething \nlike \n150 \nhorsepower. \nThey \nwere \ndetermined \nto \nuse \nan \noval \npiston \nbike \nbut \nthe \nturbo \nwas \nnever \nraced. \nAnd \nyet \nwith \nfour-strokes \ncoming \nback \nto \nGPs \nI'd \nsay \nthe \noval \npiston \nidea \nstill \nhas \ntremendous \npotential.’ \n\nCHAPTER 22 \nQUIET STORM FROM \nTHE WEST \nJuly 2002 \nJohn Hopkins came from nowhere to race a Yamaha YZR500 in \nthe inaugural MotoGP championship in 2002. Even Yamaha had \nnever heard of the teenager from SoCal, but things didn’t stay \nthat way for long \nAcclaiming future world champions is always a risky business. Fifteen \nyears ago, when I was editor of Performance Bikes magazine, we  ran a \ncentre spread of up-and-coming Aussie talent Kevin Magee, the caption \nproclaiming ‘One day this man will be world champion’. The likeable \nyoungster had just won his  first GP  —  beating Eddie Lawson, Wayne \nRainey and others in one of his  first 500 rides —  and it seemed he was \nso  gifted that it could only be  a matter of time before he won a world \ntitle. But racing isn’t so  simple, Magoo ran  into a few issues that stopped \nhim getting it together. \nBut we  never learn. Early in 2002 I named Daijiro Kato as  the man most \nfeared by Valentino Rossi. I interviewed him a couple of weeks after he’d \nharried Rossi at Jerez, but  life went pear-shaped for the little Japanese at \nthe  next few GPs, he  started crashing his NSR500 rather too  often. This \nseemed like  the usual 500  learning curve of a 250  genius —  fast  out  of the \nblocks, then faster, then crash, crash, crash. (In fact, deeper investigation \nrevealed that HRC had given Kato some wacky NSR engine spec that \nproved impossible to  tame.) Only time will tell  if Kato can  pick up  the \npieces, get his confidence back and start rattling Rossi once again. \nWhich brings us,  by a  rather circuitous route, to  John Hopkins. This \nAmerican teenager, born of British blood, has  been stealthily working \nhis way towards the front of the MotoGP pack since scoring points first \ntime out  at  Suzuka in April 2002 (after two race crashes, no  less). He’s \nbeen learning quietly, gaining confidence and getting quicker little by \nlittle. This is the  only way to  do  it in  GP  racing’s big class —  you walk \n\nQUIET STORM FROM THE WEST 149 \nbefore \nyou \nrun \nor  \nelse \nyou're \ntaking \ngiant, \nbone-crunching \nleaps \nthrough \nthe  \nair.  \nBy  \nDonington \nin  \nJuly, \nHopper \nwas \nquick \nenough \nto \nmake \nthe  \nprovisional \nfront \nrow \nand \nafter \neight \nraces \nhe \nwas \nthe  \nonly \nman \napart \nfrom \nRossi \nto \nhave \nscored \npoints \neach \ntime \nout. \nFor \na \n19-year- \nold \nriding \n500s \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \naround \ntracks \nhe’s \nnever \nseen \nbefore, \nthat’s \nseriously \nimpressive \nstuff. \nHopkins had slipped into GPs at  the  start of 2002 almost unnoticed. \nWhile the racing world whipped itself into a  froth about the  new \nMotoGP four-strokes, Red Bull Yamaha WCM (for World Championship \nMotorsports) had signed this unknown kid who’d been thrashing GSX- \nR1000s around the States. Even Yamaha, who have to  sanction Red \nBull's signings, were wondering if WCM race director Peter Clifford \nhad taken leave of  his  senses. Hopper had won the  2001 American \nFormula Xtreme crown, but  so  what? \nClifford, a former bike journalist, and one of the  few GP  team bosses \nprepared to  take risks in  nurturing new talent (most of the  paddock \nthought Clifford was nuts when he  signed Hopper’s Red Bull team- \nmate Garry McCoy in  1999), had given the teenager a couple of runs on \nhis  YZR500s during 2000 and 2001, following a  tip-off from American \nbike journalist John Ulrich, who’d spotted Hopkins before he’d even hit \nhis  teens. Ulrich, by the  way, is  the  guy who recommended a certain \nKevin Schwantz to  Yoshimura Suzuki way back in  1984... \nSo who is John Hopkins? He  sounds American but  that SoCal drawl \ndisguises 100 per cent Limey blood coursing through his  veins, his \nparents hailing from Acton, a  not  particularly salubrious west London \nsuburb. His  dad, who died from lung cancer when Hopper was 12, was \nwell into bikes and even raced the  TT  before heading west. The family \nemigrated to  the  States in  the  mid-1970s, settling down in  Ramona, \nclose to  the  Mexico border, and pretty soon dad was hooning around \nthe  desert on  dirt bikes. Hopper joined him at  the  age  of three. ‘First \ntime I ever rode a  motorcycle was in  the  desert, my  dad figured he’d \nput \nme \non \nthis \nlittle \nHonda \n70 \nbecause \nI \nwas \nalready \nriding \nmy \nbicycle \npretty \nwell, \nhittin’ \nlittle \nramps, \njumpin’ \noff \nkerbs \nand \nstuff. \nEvery \nweekend \nwe'd \nhead \nout \ninto \nthe \ndesert \nwith \na \nvan \nfull \nof \nbikes, \ncamping, \nhaving \nbarbecues, \nhanging \nout \nwith \nfamily \nand \nfriends.’ \nPretty \nsoon, \nof \ncourse, \nHopper \nwanted \nto  \ndo  \nmore \nthan \njust \nthrash \nthrough \nthe  \ndunes. \n‘We \nwere \nwatching \none \nof \nmy  \ndad’s \nbuddies \nrace \nmotocross \nat \nAscot \nand \nI \nsaw \nsome \nkids \nracing \nPW50s, \nso \nI \nasked \nmy \n\n150 THE FAST STUFF \ndad  “Can I do that? Can I race?” We were out  there the next Friday and \nmy whole life has  been motorcycles ever since.’ \nHopkins started motocross, dreaming of becoming a  Supercross pro, \nbut got sidetracked during an  Oklahoma national. ‘They had this \ngo-kart track where they were running YSR50 races and they were \nletting kids ride around on  their PW50s. Being a  roadracer, my dad \nthought it’d  be good for me. It was kinda funny because everyone was \nriding their PWs on  dirt-track tyres and I was on  knobbies, I did  four \nraces and ended up  pulling away and lapping up  to  second place every \ntime; it just came natural to me. But until I was 11  tarmac was just my \nhobby, my real thing was motocross.’ \nHis  moment of awakening came at  Willow Springs, when a  family \nfriend offered him a  run on  a  Honda RS125 GP  bike. ‘That’s what \nchanged my  whole perspective, it was the  thrill of  everything —  the \nhandling of the  bike and doing the  straightaway —  that just made me \nfocus on  roadracing, and from then on  I was looking at  Schwantz \nand Rainey.’ \nBut  Hopkins was still too  young for  the  real hard stuff. Until he was \n14  he  had to  make do with YSR racing and a  once-a-month track-day \nthrash aboard the  RS125. He’d already graduated to  250s at  the  age  of \n15  when a  rash of blow-ups persuaded him to  return to  motocross. ‘I \ngot  frustrated, I said ‘I’m done with this, this isn’t \n_ getting me anywhere, I’m gonna concentrate on \n‘Next thing I know motocross’. That’s when John Ulrich gave me a call \nI’m  shooting and asked me  if I wanted to try one  of his GSX-R600s. \nthrough the air, The bike was strange, it was like riding a  big  boat \nlooking down at the after what I’d  ridden.’ So  Ulrich got  him a start in \nground thinking, the  Aprilia Cup for  hotted-up RS250 streetbikes and \n“all right, why did Hopper won the '99  title at  16.  ‘The bonus was a \nthis happen?’”’ ticket to  Italy, to  go  test a  GP  125, plus a  few days \nTea vacation in  Florence, Rome and Venice; that was \ndefinitely a mind-changing deal.’ \nAfter that he raced GSX-R600s and 750s for  Ulrich’s outfit, winning \nthe  2000 Supersport 750 title and shifting up  to  Formula Xtreme for \n2001, riding a  185  horsepower GSX-R thou. ‘From there the  thrill just \nstarted gaining and gaining and we  ended up getting the championship. \nThe 1000 was a lot  of fun, it definitely got  me  familiar with the  speed \nbut  without the  handling and acceleration of the  500.’ \n\nQUIET STORM FROM THE WEST 15] \nSo how do you  compare riding the 1000 and  the 500? \nWith \nthe  \n500  \nyou've \ngot  \nto \nbe \na \nlot \nmore \nfocused, \ntons \nmore \nfocused, \na \nlot  \nmore \ndetermined \nand \na  \nlot  \nmore \nphysically \nfit.  \nIt  \nwas \nfun \nslidin’ \naround \non \nthe \n1000, \nbackin’ \nit into \ncorners, \ncomin’ \nout \nand \njust lightin’ \nit \nup. \nI \nhad \na \ncouple \nof \nsamples \nof \nthe \nasphalt \nwhen \nI \nfirst \nstarted \nriding \nit, \nso you \ngotta \nlearn \nyour \nlimits \nas \nfast \nas possible. \nIt takes \nlonger \nto \nlearn \nthe \nlimit \nof the \n500, \nin \nfact \nit’s \nalmost \nlike they \nhave \nno \nlimits. \nOn \nthe \n1000 \nyou \ncan \nhave \nbig slides, \nhuge \nslides, \nbut \nmostly \nyou \ncan \nrecover, \nwith \nthe 500 \nyou \nmake \na mistake \nand \nyou’re \nnot \ngonna \nrecover. \nIf \nit \nsteps \nout \ntoo far, it’s \ngonna \nbite \nyou, \nit’s \ngonna \nget \nyou hard. \nThe  1000 is more wobbly, so you get early warnings? \nYeah, I had a  big  one on  the 500, testing at  Valencia. I hadn’t been \nsliding it, I was just startin’ to  learn to  slide it.  I’m  getting on  it out  of \na right-hander and the slide I had would’ve been just a minor tankslapper \non  the  1000, nothing big at  all,  so  I kept it sliding, I didn’t want to  let \noff the gas, but then I found myself running all the way out  to the kerb, \nso  I thought I better back it off  a  little. The second I back it off,  next \nthing I know I’m  shooting through the air, looking down at the  ground \nthinking ‘all  right, why did  this happen? Okay this is gonna hurt’. \nHas your team been telling you  to take it easy? \nThat’s always been my kinda approach, but Peter has definitely \nencouraged that. He  says ‘just take it easy, take it at you own pace, this \nis  just a  learning year, ride smooth, step it  up  little by  little every \nweekend’, and that’s when the  results come. \nYou've been consistent and running with some good guys; are you  surprised? \nNot surprised, just really happy with the  way everything’s been going. \nAt \nthe \nbeginning \nof \nthe \nyear \nI \nwas \njust \nthinking \nabout \nfinishes, \nI \ndidn’t \nwant \nto \npush \nmyself \ntoo \nhard. \nI \ndon’t \nwant \nto \ntry \nand \ntake \ntoo \nbig \nsteps, \nyou \nknow, \njust \na \nslight \nincline, \njust \nkeep \ngoin’ \nup \nand \nup \nand \nup, \nmake \na \ncouple \nof \nbig \nsteps \nhere \nand \nthere, \na \ncouple \nof \ntimes \njust \nlittle \nsteps. \nI \njust \nwant \nto \nkeep \nimproving \nuntil \nI \nget \nup \nto \nthe \ntop. \nWhat are  the big things you've learned this year? \nJust \nriding \nability \nand \nworking \nwith \nthe \nteam, \ngetting \nto \nknow \nthem \n\n152 THE FAST STUFF \ngood, plus the  team is learning what I like done to  the  bike, my riding \nstyle and stuff. \nRiding 500s is all in the set-up; how are you finding that? \nTo me, that’s when you get lost. When I first started working with the \nteam, I'd  go  out  and ride, then we’d change it and I’d  end up  getting \nlost. If there’s not  a problem, to  me  there’s no  point in changing it, so \nnow they’ve gotten to work with that, they come up with a base setting, \nthen I go out  and ride it, then if  I do have a problem, I let  them know. \nI tell  them I’m pushing the  front through some corner and they’re \npretty good at  fixing that. I’d  say  I’ve  gotten better the less changes we \nmake to  the  bike. \nSo  it’s  a  case of getting used to  the set-up, so  you  can  predict what's going to \nhappen? \nYeah, you're not  gonna get  the  same feelin’ out  of the  bike if you keep \nchanging it,  especially when you're havin’ to  learn the  circuits, learn \nthe  tyres and everything about the  bike. \nWhat have you  learned about riding? \nI’ve had to  adapt to  a  completely new style this year. I’m finding that \none  of my strong points compared to other riders is braking. I’m  getting \ninto the  corners really good. I think that comes from motocross, I was \nalways one of the  best getting into the  corners, I used quite a  bit  of \nfront brake in motocross, though a lot more rear brake. It’s  kinda funny \nbecause I don’t use any rear brake whatsoever on  the  500, not  in  the \nwet either. The team finds that strange. \nHow do you get the bike settled into  turns? \nI guess I’ve got  a  good body set-up, a  good body language to  keep the \nrear kinda okay. I’ve had to  work on  my  riding style to  keep the  bike \nsettled because I’d rather not  touch the  rear brake. \nWhat's the biggest buzz of the 500? \nFirst, I’d  have to  say  the  competition, then the  speed-to-weight ratio, \njust how fast it gets goin’. And when you’re riding the  thing fast it’s \nlike  you’re always on  the  edge, you're always right there. When you're \nriding a good lap it’s  a very fine line between keepin’ it up and throwin’ \n\nQUIET STORM FROM THE WEST 153 \nit down. The thrill of that the whole time you're riding the  thing is just \nreally good --  you've got it right there on  the edge. \nHow do your lap times compare to last year’s 500  times? \nWe'd have ended up  bein’ on  pole at  Barcelona last  year, and my  race \ntime would’ve put  me  on  the  podium. \nYou  were 18 on your GP debut, you  must've thought you  were about to wake up \nfrom a dream? \nSuzuka was the biggest. I’m sittin’ there thinking ‘Oh man, I’m gonna be \non  the  grid with these guys I’ve only seen on  TY,  I’ve never even met \nthem in person’. It was a bit  of  a wakeup call, but  once I started doing \ncompetitive times, within a couple of seconds of them, I started realising, \nyou know, that they’re just normal people, just like  I am, maybe just a \nlittle more experienced. I had to  go out  and learn from them, use  their \nexperience to my advantage, learn from what they got. \nDo you do a lot of following? \nYeah, quite a bit.  I never wait out  on  the track, but I’m always trying to get \nbehind someone and follow them and get around them, stuff like  that. \nSo you're always having a go too? \nYeah, always havin’ a go with them. \nDo you  ever  wonder how it'd feel if you  took out  Rossi or Biaggi? \n(Looks perplexed) It  doesn’t affect me, I mean they’re racing on  the \nsame \ntrack \nas \nI \nam. \nThey \nmay \nbe \na \nlittle \nmore \nwell \nknown \nbut \nI’m \nout \nthere racing, same as  they are. \nAre you  surprised by how quick you got to GPs? \nGPs \nare  \nwhere \nI \nalways \nwanted \nto  \nbe,  \never \nsince \nI \nstarted \nroadracing. \nSuperbike \nwas \nnever \na  \nthing \nfor  \nme, \nI \njust \nhad \nto  \nget  \non  \na  \nfour-stroke \nback \nhome \nto \nget \nwhere \nI \nam \nnow. \nThat \nwas \nalways \nmy \ngoal; \nI \nnever \neven \nwatched \nSuperbikes \non \nTV, \nalways \nGPs. \nSo who was your hero, Schwantz or Rainey? \nI \nwas \ngoing \nfor \nSchwantz, \nalways \nrootin’ \nfor \nSchwantz. \nI \ndidn’t \nknow \ntoo \nmuch \nabout \nit, \nI \njust \nliked \nhis \nriding \nstyle. \n\n154 THE FAST STUFF \nYou  remind us  of Schwantz, you're excited by everything... \nOh  yeah, I’m definitely excited about it,  I’m not a  quiet person. \nSchwantz was definitely my hero, then it  was Doohan, just from \nwatching his  style and his ability to go out  and win championship after \nchampionship. I found that pretty amazing. \nWho's the best guy out  there, who’s amazed you  most? \nI mean, I definitely don’t want to  look up  to  any of them but  I’d  have \nto say Garry [McCoy], just for his riding style. I find that most impressive \nout of everything, it’s  just so  different, it doesn’t seem like top-level \nroadracing. Last winter when I first started testing properly with the \nteam I followed him a lot at  Sepang, but his lines are  so  much different \nfrom what I run. His  slides take him all  the  way out  to  the  edge of the \ntrack, where I like keeping it pretty much in line, drivin’ it out. I hold it \na little bit tighter, he kinda swings it out  a lot wider with his  sliding and \nthen he kinda shoots back. \nIt looks like time wasting... \nBut it works out. \nAre you  looking forward to getting on four-stroke in 2003? \nI’ve  been really lucky to  get one of the  last  rides on  a  500, so  I’m  takin’ \nadvantage of that. That was my whole goal and I just made it on  to one, \nso  I’m  really happy about that. But I think it’s  gonna be a really good \nthing to  have a  four-stroke next year, because I can  combine my  four- \nstroke experience from back home with my  500  experience and fill it all \ninto the  MotoGP bike. And with the  knowledge of the  tracks and the \nknowledge of the  riders around me, I think it’s  gonna be  really good. \nAnd, depending on  what bike it is, I think it could be quite a bit  easier \nto  ride. \nWhat's your best  GP moment so far? \nI'd have to  say  Assen, comin’ into the  last lap tryin’ not  to  go too  hard, \nbut  to judge it so  I could stay ahead of Nakano. He  ended up comin’ by \nme  on  the  brakes, I was really hard on  them into the  chicane and he \njust came right up inside of me. He kinda ran  it wide, then we  bumped \na  little into the  chicane and then he went wide and came back across \nthe \nfront \nof \nme, \nthen \nI \nshot \nup \nacross \nthe \nkerb \nand \nbeat \nhim \nto \nthe \n\nQUIET STORM FROM THE WEST 155 \nfinish line, went through the roof. That was definitely the best moment, \nI was really goin’ for top Yamaha two-stroke. \nNakano’s a very smooth rider; is that you  too? \nThat’s one of my  goals. I’ve heard it from the  team, they’re surprised \nhow smooth I look and that’s definitely a compliment because that’s \nwhat I’ve  always wanted to  achieve, being a  smooth rider. \nBut you've also ridden in some hardcase groups, with McWilliams, Laconi and \nso  on... \nI was with McWilliams and Gibernau at  the  beginning of the  Assen \nrace. They’re were goin’ back and forth, making some pretty dangerous \npasses, I’d  say.  I didn’t want to get mixed up in that, so  I stayed behind \nand, sure enough, McWilliams shot around the  outside of  Gibernau \ninto the  chicane, just went right in  front of him and clipped his  front \nwheel. Gibernau went down right then, so  I was like, all  right, that’s \none of them I don’t have to pass, then I worked on  McWilliams, caught \nup  to  him, then his  bike broke. \nSo you're 19 and saying some 38-year-old ts crazy! \nYeah, I guess it’s  strange! \nWhy've you  always been so  level headed? \nI'd  have to  say  I had a  pretty quick childhood with my  dad passing \naway as  early as  he  did. I definitely had to  take a  lot  in and learn a lot. \nTell us  the story of the tattoo. [Hopper has a huge tatt  on  his back ] \nI \nwanted \nmy  \nname, \nthen \ncouldn't \nfigure \nout  \nwhat \nto  \nget  \nafter \nthat. \nThe \nname \nwas  \njust \nthe \nbase \nof \na \nback \npiece \nI \nwanted, \njust \nbuild \nit \nup \nfrom \nthere. \nI \nwanted \nsomething \nto \nsymbolise \nwhat \nmy \nlife \nis \nand \nwhat \nit’s \ngoing \nto \nbe, \nso \nI \nthought \nit’d \nbe \ngood \ngetting \na \ntrophy \ngirl. \nShe’s \nstanding \nthere, \nher \nhair’s \nwaving \nin \nthe \nwind \nlike \nthe \nbike \njust \nwent \npast, \nand \nshe’s \nholding \nthe \nchequered \nflag \nand \nthe \nAmerican \nflag \nin \nher \nhands. \nThen \nthere’s \nthe \ndress, \nthat’s \nbecause \nI \ncouldn’t \nfigure \nout \nwhere \nto \nput \nthe \nUnion \nJack \npart. \nSo  \nshe’s \nnot  \nGeri \nHalliwell \nor  \nMichaela \nFogarty? \n[Both \nfamous \nfor  \nwearing \nUnion Jack dresses] \nNeither of them, I never even knew. \n\n156 THE FAST STUFF \nDo you  consider yourself American or British? \nI’ve got an American passport, but I have the option because my family’s \nstill got European passports. I just consider myself both, I was born and \nraised in the United States, so  I’m  definitely American, but  at the  same \ntime I consider myself British. \nWhere do you stay in Europe? \nI’ve been living in  Clermont-Ferrand [in  France] but I just moved to \nAustria, where the  team is based, because I'll get the  chance to do a lot \nof motocross. \nWhat else are you  into? \nI do a lot of snowboarding, and also surfing when I’m home, but always \nmainly motocross. I pretty much stay on  motorcycles all the  time. \nWhat about music? \nFairly hard music [his girlfriend Desiree Crossman giggles]. \nSlipknot, that’s one of  them, Disturb is  one of  my favourites, then \nthere’s a  punk rock band called Pennywise, I listen to  them a  bunch, \nand Bad Religion. Just all  pretty hard and Garry likes that stuff too. \nWe  get  on  really well, I’ve been hangin’ out with him at  his  place \nin Andorra. \nAnd partying? \nI’m  keen on  it every once in  a while, it’s  good fun, you gotta let  loose \nevery once in  a  while, especially when the  racing and the  training is \njust boom, boom, boom, so  every once in a while... \nHow often then, once a month? \n[Desiree offers: ‘We  usually blow out  every other week.’] Well, not  blow \nout. I never drink unless it’s  Sunday night. I train every day, so  I don’t \nsee  any need to have just one beer. If I’m  gonna drink... \nYour favourite drink? \nDepends what kind of night it is.  If I’m  just hanging out  with some \nbuddies, I don’t mind Heineken. If you’re gonna go  out  to  a  disco or \nwhatever, throwing down a Red Bull and vodka is the way to go.  I don’t \nlike  dancing, I’d rather just go to a bar  and hang out. \n\nWELCOME \nTO  \nTHE \nSMELL \nOF  \nSPEED \nLY, \nA \nlot \nof \nother \ntop \nGP \nguys \nget \nwell \nstressed \nthese \ndays, \nyou \ndon't \nseem \nto. \nYeah, \nI \nnoticed \nthat \nand \nit’s \nkinda \nsad \nin \na \nway. \nYou've \ngot \nto \nenjoy \nwhat \nyou're \ndoin’. \nYou \nknow, \nthey’ve \nbeen \nin \nit \na \nlot \nof \nyears \nbut \nif \nthey're \nnot \nhaving \nfun \nany \nmore, \nwhat's \nthe \npoint \nof \ndoing \nit? \nI \nthink \nit’s \nunbelievable \nto \nget \nto \ntravel \nthe \nworld \nand \nrace \nmotorcycles. \nAnd get paid good money... \nBut  I’m  not  making half as  much as a lot of the MotoGP field. \nEpilogue: You've gotta love Hopper —  he  signed for  Suzuki in  2003, \ntook five seasons to  score his  first-ever MotoGP podium —  then he signs \nwith Kawasaki for  a  few mill. No  doubt, the  most expensive winless \nrider in MotoGP history. \nMotoGP Mutterings: July 2002 \nWelcome to  the smell of speed, the  whiff of danger \nOkay, so  we’ve got  our unobtainable MotoGP paddock passes around \nour  necks and they’re not just tatty bits of multicoloured card swinging \nfrom pieces of string, they’re as  shiny and neat and perfectly formed as \nyour Visa card, just like  the  shiny and neat and perfectly formed world \nwe're about to enter. The MotoGP paddock is someone’s idealised vision \nof what the world should be, it’s  fake; of course, utterly fake, but maybe \nthe  real world’s faker. \nWelcome to the world of seriously wired weirdness and may I suggest \nthat we  begin by  entering this hospitality suite fronted by  an  over- \nmade-up beauty in a bikini, looking ever so  awkward as  she  ‘welcomes’ \nus  (by  delivering one of  them smiles that offers everything and yet \nnothing) into the  ‘glamorous’ environs of her  corporate dining awning \n—  all  leafy house plants, bangin’ Italian house music, aluminium café \nchairs and plastic floor tiles. Behind the  pits and well away from the \nspeed and excitement, this is where we’re gonna hang out, suck our \ncorporate cappuccinos and relax. Except you can’t relax. There’s no \nplace to  hide in  the MotoGP paddock, because the joint lives \nand breathes on  racers’ angst and mechanics’ angst and team \nmanagers’ angst and hostess girls’ angst. We're not  backstage at Glasto, \nfor \nfuck’s \nsake. \nThere’s \nno \ncomfy \nfloor \ncushions, \nhorizontal \nhangers-on \n\n158 THE FAST STUFF \nand clouds of  weed smoke here, just the smell of  speed, the  whiff \nof danger. \nWe  down our cappuccinos and head outside to  discover the  ‘real’ \nworld of  MotoGP, pacing alongside the  perfectly regimented line of \nartics parked behind the  pits, where the  proper stuff goes on.  There’s \n110  articulated lorries here and they all  look like they’ve been parked \nby an  obsessive compulsive with a GPS system. Which is exactly how it \nworks. There’s chalk marks on  the tarmac to indicate each artic’s exact \nparking position. If only God had been as  meticulous \nwhen he made the world... \n‘Behind the staff is a You  want a look inside one of the  trucks —  okay, so \nbank of 12  TV we  dive inside the  Yamaha motorsport artic, parked \nscreens, all alongside the  two Marlboro Yamaha trucks. This is \nbroadcasting the my favourite, it’s  one of  those expandable artics, \nsame Japanese which grows six  feet wider when parked, and inside \nwinter scene, it’s just a little like being on  the bridge of the Starship \ncalming Japanese ©     Enterprise —  all  computer monitors, coloured lights \nfolk music playing and earnest Japanese technicians poring over facts \nat low volume’ and figures, throwing you suspicious looks as  you \npress the entry button and the  sliding door schloooks \nopen. Behind the  staff is  a bank of 12  TV  screens, all \nbroadcasting the  same Japanese winter scene, snow gently falling to \nthe  ground, calming Japanese folk music playing at  low volume. Very \nstrange. This is  Yamaha’s holy of  holies, no  entry for  no  one, better \nleave and slide into the pits. More suspicious looks. A  couple of \nmechanics give us  the  ‘paddock nod’, ‘Awright, mate’, ‘Ciao!’; several \nmore blank us  because there’s nice guys and not-so-nice guys here, just \nlike  the  real  world. There’s a  carpet on  the  floor and I challenge you to \nfind one spot of  dirt thereon, or  one smear of  grease on  any of  the \nbikes. The motorcycles are too much, too much to  go  into here, \nfabricated masses of  one-off parts hand-machined from billets of \nunobtanium and worth more than people know, though only because \nno  one  dares to calculate their true value. Honda are  rumoured to want \n£1.5 million to lease an  RCV in 2003 and that certainly doesn’t include \ndevelopment costs. \nBack out  of the pits, someone’s shouting at us:  ‘Hey queer, come over \nhere, I wanna word with youl’ It’s  King Kenny Roberts and he’s talking \nto us  (he nicknamed me  thus after I’d had my head shaved some years \n\nWELCOME TO  THE SMELL OF  SPEED 159 \nago). The King is probably the  greatest man in the  paddock, so  he gets \nto  call  you what he likes. He’s also a bit  of a psycho, like  everyone else \nhere, as  you might already have noticed. No,  he’s more than a bit  of a \npsycho, he’s won dirt track crowns, 500 world titles and he’s built his \nown motorcycle, and you  need to be one  hell of a psycho to achieve that \nmuch in  your life. Which is  why bike racing is  cool, because it’s  an \nextreme world full of extreme people, within a world of mediocrity and \nnormality. Okay, it is voluntary and it is only a  sport, but it’s  still an \nextreme of human existence and about as  close to being in a war as  you \ncan get without being shot at.  Like we  said —  the  real world is faker. \nI have this theory that many years ago, some world government \nconsipracy had the  bright idea of creating this sport to  encourage as \nmany psychos as  possible to  spend their weekends in  the  same place, \nsurrounded by ten-feet tall  wire fences, to  keep normal society safe \nfrom these crazies. So,  forget the paddock, stay at home and watch the \nracing on  TY,  it’s  safer and much less hassle. \n\nCHAPTER 23 \nPLANS FOR THE FUTURE? ‘NOT \nREALLY, JUST TO  BE  IN  MOTOGP’ \nJuly 2002 \nDuring his  debut GP  season in 2002 teenage star Casey Stoner \nwas pretty laid back about his  ambitions, but his  talent and his \ndetermination were already there for  all  to  see. And even as  a \n16-year-old he made a great interviewee... \nCasey Stoner is the  16-year-old 250  GP rider with his  eyes firmly set  on \nthe MotoGP big time. A multiple Aussie junior dirt  track champ, Stoner \ncontests his first world championship campaign in  2002 and he’s \nalready got factory bosses sniffing around him. \nA  bright and sparky kid, Stoner has the  stamp of  greatness upon \nhim, no  doubt whatsoever about that. He  only started roadracing in \n2000 and had never raced a  250 before the  start of 2002. But second \ntime out  in  South Africa he  became the  youngest rider in  the  53-year \nhistory of the  sport to  qualify on  the  second row for  a  250 GP.  And at \nthe  Czech GP  he  scored a  remarkable fifth-place finish, coming back \nfrom 15th on  the first lap. But Stoner also jumped off a lot as  he battled \nto  get to  grips with his  100  horsepower Aprilia RSV250. \nStoner’s parents brought him to  Europe to  start his  tarmac career in \n2000, because he would've had to wait another two years to go roadracing \nif he’d stuck around Down Under. He was quick from the get-go, winning \nthe 2000 British Aprilia RS125 Challenge and more importantly attracting \nthe attention of GP talent spotter Alberto Puig, a former 500  star  to whom \nGP rights holders Dorna had given the task of bringing non-Spanish and \nnon-Italian blood into the  southern Europe-dominated GP  scene. Puig \nsorted him bikes for  the  super-competitive Spanish 125  series and also \nfixed him wild card rides for the 2001 British and Australian GPs. Stoner \nscored his  first world points at  Phillip Island but  that ride cost him the \nBritish 125 championship, which he’d totally dominated in  between \ntrucking down to  Spain every other weekend. \n\nPLANS \nFOR \nTHE \nFUTURE? \n‘NOT \nREALLY, \nJUST \nTO  \nBE  \nIN  \nMOTOGP” \n161 \nEven \nfive-time \n500 \nchamp \nMick \nDoohan, \na \nhard \nman \nto \nplease \nif \never \nthere \nwas \none, \nis \nconvinced \nof \nthe \nkid’s \nability \nto \ngo \nall \nthe \nway. \nMicky \nD’s \nnot \ndaft \neither, \nso \nhe \nalso \njumped \non \nthe \nStoner \nbandwagon, \noffering \nadvice \nand \nopening \ndoors \nwherever \nhe \ncan. \nYou've not  been to school for a while? \nI haven’t been to  school since I was 12.  Even in Australia, when we  did \ndirt track, we  didn’t have time for  school, because we  were always \naway racing. I did  quite well at  school but  never liked it, I absolutely \nhated it. \nWhen did you start riding? \nEver since I was born! When I was 18 months I was doing the  throttle, \nsitting on  the bike, with my cousin on  the back, turning the throttle on \na  Pee  Wee. My dad raced a bit,  and my  sister raced before I was born, \nso  I grew up with her riding around the place. I started doing dirt  track \non  a  Pee Wee. \nDirt track has  produced a lot of good riders, basically everybody who \ndoes roadracing in  Australia did  dirt track. If they made dirt track a \nworld championship thing and it was big, I'd like  to  do that better than \nroadracing. It’s  just really enjoyable, I absolutely love doing it, it’s just \na  fun  thing. I did  speedway for  a  bit  but  it’s  not  the  same. Dirt track’s \njust really good, you get  oil  tracks, so  it’s  like  supermoto but  slipperier, \nyou've got to  choose the right lines between the loose stuff and the \nshiny stuff, a lot  of different things. \nWhen did you start dirt track and then roadracing? \nAt four and I finished at  13 when we  came to Europe. You  can’t roadrace \ntill  you’re 16  in  Australia, so  I started at  14  in  the  UK. Alberto had \nheard of us  doing quite well in  the  last couple of rounds of the  2000 \nBritish championship, so  he  asked us  to  do  the  last two rounds of the \nSpanish championship to  see  how we  went. \nWe  had a  few problems but I didn’t do  too  bad, so  we  got  on  his \nteam \nand \nwent \ntesting \nat \nthe \nstart \nof \n2001. \nI \ndid \nreally \nwell \non \na \nstandard \nbike, \nso \nAlberto \nwas \nquite \nimpressed \nand \npushed \nHonda \nto \nget \nbetter \nparts. \nI \nwas \nvery \ngrateful \nfor \nthat, \nplus \nI \nhad \nthe \nopportunity \nto \ndo \ntwo \nGP \nwild-card \nrides, \nthat \nall \nhelped \nand \ngave \nme  experience. \n\n162 THE FAST STUFF \nSo you  never roadraced before you  came to Europe? \nI once rode a  Moriwaki 80  around a  go-kart track but  we  had a  few \ncomplications with the  people who run the  Moriwaki grand prix 80 \nseries, they wouldn’t let us  race in the championship. It was a bit weird; \nI was old  enough, I'd  got the  licence, I’d  got the  approval. There’s a lot \nof jealousy in that kind of thing. The guy who runs the  series didn’t get \nalong with us  because we  didn’t go through him. All the other kids had \nbought their bikes off him, they’d done everything through him but we \ndid  it our  own way. He  didn’t like us  because of that, so  he  didn’t let \nus  race. \nDo you get a lot of stuff like punch-ups in kids’ racing? \nThere’s a lot of punch-ups! Normally not  between the  kids, most of the \nkids get along pretty good. It’s just the parents, very strange. I only had \nproblems my  last couple of years of  dirt track. I’d  been winning for \nquite a  lot  of my  life, then all  of  a sudden they started saying I was a \ndirty rider and shit like  that. I’d been going up  the  age  groups, so  I was \nracing against kids who I didn’t normally race against and they weren't \nused to  me. All the  other kids I’d ridden with through the years didn’t \nfind me  bad at  all, we’re just all good mates. \nIt was just when I went into the  older age  groups and I was racing \nand roughin’ it in there with them and they didn’t like  it. But  I’ve seen \nseniors race and when those guys get there they’re gonna shit \nthemselves. I always wanted to  race seniors because I’ve always been \nquite aggressive. In  roadracing I need to  learn to  be  more aggressive, \nbut  in dirt track I knew exactly what I was doing with the  bike. \nDo you  consider yourself more mature than other 16-year-olds? \nWhen I went back to Australia after two  years here I just had a different \nlook on  things, I guess because the  only people I'd really had to  talk to \nwere adults. \nDo you find life on  the road hard? : \nVery hard. It’d  be a little easier if I was driving, because it’d  pass the \ntime and I’d probably enjoy it. \nDoes it feel like an  adventure or are you gagging to get to the next race? \nI’m  basically gagging to  get  to  the  next race and try  the  next track. I \n\nPLANS FOR THE FUTURE? ‘NOT REALLY, JUST TO  BE  IN  MOTOGP’ 163 \ntravelled from England to  Spain a lot of times last year, so  it’s  the  same \nroad every time: Yeah, seen that... Yeah, seen that... \nDo a lot of kids race just because their dads want them to? \nIt happens a lot in dirt  track, the parents have a lot of money, they have \nthe best bikes and the kids come back in bawling their eyes out because \nthey know they'll get  a  flog off their dads because they didn’t win; it’s \njust not right. But most of  the good riders have \nalways wanted to  do it all their lives. \n‘The data-logging \nDo you feel pressure? said I was doing \nI put pressure on  myself and all this crashing has put 191kmh when I \na bit of pressure on.

Then I fell off again, exact \nsame place, exact same crash, except the bike spun around and walloped \nme  one in  the  head. That probably knocked some sense back into me \nbecause I felt  better after that one. I just wanted to  ride, I don’t even \nremember making the  decision. \nWhat you  do for fun? \nPlay my PlayStation quite a bit because I don’t have any friends to hang \naround with, plus I’ve lately been very bored because I’ve had injuries, \nso  I haven’t been out  on  my  motocross bike or  mountain bike. Back \nhome on  the  Gold Coast my  parents have got  a  static caravan park. \nThere’s a  big beach five minutes away, then 500 metres away there’s \nflat water, for  fishing, boats and stuff. I can’t wait to  get  a  car  in \nAustralia, so  I can get  around, do  things and see  mates, so  I’m  getting \nan  English licence at  the  end of the  year. \nDo you  drink? \nNo.  I’m  not  goin’ to  drink either, only tiny little bits. \nWere you a good boy or a bad boy at school? \nMedium, I think. I wasn’t bad but  I wasn’t good. \nDo you  have friends in the paddock? \nChaz [Davies] pretty much, he’s the  only British person who’s got  any \ntime. Before the  British GP  I stayed at  Chaz’s house and met all  his \nmates. I really enjoyed that. \nWhat about girls? \nNot at  the  moment. \nHow has Puig helped? \nI \ndefinitely \nwouldn’t \nbe \nhere \nif \nit \nwasn’t \nfor \nhim, \nhe \npushed \na \nlot \nfor \nme \nto  \nget  \nthis \nride. \nHe  \nknew \nI \ncould \ndo  \nsomething. \nHe’d \nbeen \ngreat \nwith \nme  \nall  \nthrough \nthe \nSpanish \nchampionship. \nHe  \nlets \nus  \nborrows \nhis \nmother’s \ncar  \nwhen \nwe  \nstay \nat  \nhis  \nplace \nin \nBarcelona, \nhe \nlets  \nus  \nuse  \nhis \nmotocross \nbike, \nhis  \nsupermotard \nbike, \nhis \ntrials \nbike, \nhe \njust \nlets  \nme  \nuse \nanything \nhe’s \ngot, \nhe’s \na \nreal \nnice \nguy. \nHe’s \nbeen \nabsolutely \nfantastic. \n\nPLANS FOR THE FUTURE? ‘NOT REALLY, JUST TO  BE  IN  MOTOGP’ 165 \nDoes he coach you  on  riding or mental attitude? \nNot so  much on  riding, just how to  control my  head, what to  think \nabout. He  doesn’t know what the bike’s like, so  he knows he  shouldn’t \ninterfere with things he  doesn’t know about, but the stuff he  does \nknow about he  helps me  with. That’s what it’s  all  about here, how to \ncontrol yourself —  it’s  not  how good you are, it’s how good your head is. \nMost things on  riding I’m  learning for myself. \nDid you want to race 125  or 250 this year? \nI'd wanted to  get  on  a bigger bike for  a year or  so.  I had a  go  on  a 250 \nlast  year and absolutely loved it, so  I just wanted to  get  on  something \nwith a bit more power. It’s  definitely more fun, but also a lot harder. It’s \njust how to  keep your head when you crash because they’re scary \nmachines. With the 125 you could crash it and get  straight back on. \nThe 250 is so  hard to get right, and when you crash you get a bit scared \nof it.  I’m  getting there though, I’m  learning from my  crashes. \nAre you surprised how competitive you've been? \nSouth Africa was the  biggest surprise, my  second meeting and I was \neighth in qualifying. I was like ‘you got  to  be joking,’ I didn’t believe I \nwas that close. The field has  been spreading out  over the last  few races, \nthe  Aprilia factory bikes have been upping their pace, leaving the  rest \nbehind but  I’m  still not  too  far off the rest of them. I’ve just got to learn \nmore about set-up. \nWho were your heroes as a kid? \nPretty \nmuch \njust \nDoohan, \nmy \nwhole \nlife. \nI \ndidn’t \neven \nknow \nwhat \nthe \n125  class was until ‘98  or  ‘99, all  I knew was 500s. \nDid you  watch GPs  on  TV? \nSince \nI \nwas \nthree \nor  \nfour. \nDoohan \nwas \nthere \nfrom \n‘89, \nso  \nI’ve \nfollowed \nhim \nmy  \nwhole \nlife. \nMum \nand \ndad \nused \nto  \ntape \nthe  \nraces, \nbut  \nnot  \nany \nmore. \nYou \nget \nwrapped \nup \nin \nwhat \nyou're \ndoin’ \nyourself. \nYou \ngo \nthrough \nso \nmuch \nstress \nand \nups \nand \ndowns \nduring \na \nGP \nweekend \nthat \nyou \ncan’t \nreally \nbe \nbothered \nto \nwatch \nthe \nother \nraces. \nAre you  enjoying it? \nDefinitely, \nyes, \nbut \nsometimes \nwhen \nI \ncrash \nI \ncan’t \nfigure \nout \nwhy. \nI \ngo \n\n166 THE FAST STUFF \nthrough \na \nlot \nof \npressure \ntrying \nto \nfigure \nit \nout,  \ntrying \nto \nget \nthe \nset-up \nright. \nI \nfeel  \nbad \nfor \nthe  \nteam, \nI’m  \ntryin’ \nto  \nfigure \nout  \nwhat’s \ngoin’ \non,  \nbut  \nI \ncan \nonly \nexplain \nit \nto \nmyself, \nI \ncan’t \nexactly \nexplain \nin \nwords \nwhat \nI’m  \nfeeling. \nHow’s the team about the crashes? \nThey say  don’t worry, but you can always see  it in  their faces, which \njust makes you feel worse. \nPlans for the future? \nNot  really, just eventually to be in MotoGP. I'd have liked it to have still \nbeen 500s, because I think they’re great, but four-strokes is  the  class \nnow. Alberto is my manager and he knows what he’s doing, he'll get us \nin the  right place, I think. \nEpilogue: you know it —  five years later Stoner kicked Rossi’s arse to \nbecome MotoGP world champion. \nMotoGP Mutterings: August 2002 \nYou don’t have to be mad to work here, but it helps. Here’s some \nmore weirdness going down within the GP  paddock... \nYou may have heard of Dr  Claudio Costa. He’s the, erm, extraordinary \nItalian physician who stitches, bolts and plates top racers back together \nwhen they smack themselves up.  Costa and his  crew of surgeons and \nphysios roll  up  at  every GP  with their own very special equipment — \nscalpels, Black & Deckers and one  of the most impressive drugs cabinets \nknown to  man. Inside the  Clinica Mobile —  otherwise known as  the \nHouse of Pain —  they perform all manner of gruesome ops  on  pro  riders \nwho will endure seven shades of suffering to  get  themselves back on \ntrack tomorrow rather than the  day after. ‘And if the  pain gets too \nmuch, Valentino, just pop a couple of these...’ \nCosta’s methods are applauded by  some, mostly riders and_ their \nmanagers, anxious to keep the money flowing, but not by more circumspect \nonlookers, who fear the  long-term effects of the  patch ‘em up  and send \n‘em  out  mentality. But, hey, no  one  forces these guys to  do what they do, \nand anyway, imagine the  quality of painkiller they'll have in 2040, when \nRossi and his peers will be shuffling into their arthritis-racked dotage. \n\nMORE WEIRDNESS IN  THE PADDOCK 167 \nWhatever, \nCosta \nhas  \njust \npublished \nhis  \nautobiography, \nwhich \nhas  \nto \nrate \nas \none \nthe \nmost \nbizarre \nbooks \nto \nhit \nthe \nshelves \nsince \nThe \nHoly \nBible, \nor \nmaybe \nTrainspotting. \nEntitled \nTears \nand \ntriumph: \nmy \nlife \nin \nthe \nClinica \nMobile, \nthe \ndoctor’s \nown \ntee \nbrand \nof  \nvery \nweird \nreligious-tinted \nphilosophy \n‘As \nyou \nlay \non  \nyour \ngushes and oozes from every page. Here are  a  few bed of thorns, \nrib-tickling highlights. wounded by fate and \nFirst, Costa’s paean to  Mick Doohan, the man as your tears glinted \nwhose right leg he saved in 1992. Good doc or bad doc, in the faint light of \nDoohan might've been a one-legged non-world champ \nif Costa hadn’t saved the  limb from amputation, but \nbe warned, you may need a hanky here. ‘As you lay on \nyour bed of thorns,’ writes Costa. ‘Wounded by fate and man’s arrogance \nand as  your tears glinted in  the  faint light of  the  hospital room, we \nthought those tears would never fill the  abyss of your distress or  soothe \nthe  suffering of your injury... and indeed they soon ceased to  stream \ndown your pain-struck cheeks and in an  instant those feelings of hope \nand desire which sustain a  human being as  he  shoulders life’s burdens \nreturned to  the  fore: the  hope of going back to  racing and the  desire of \ngoing back to winning. \n‘And when you did  go back to racing, your wounds still bleeding, we \nsaw your spirit bloom, invading your being as  if emerging from some \nhalf-sealed casket. But  time, unrelenting, continued to  yield only pain, \nsuffering and disillusionment, and desire was unable even to  find \nshelter in the  sweetest of harbours... \n‘Then, suddenly, the casket of  treasures which every human \nbeing carries inside himself opened completely and you, Michael, \nsaw your entire self, from the  depths of  your soul to  the  heights of \nreason. You had become world champion for  the fourth time. And \nin  the joy of  that instant, you felt that the theatre of  pain had \nvanished, that it had ceased to  exist, and you learned that time, which \nhad cruelly defined your suffering, no  longer was. You realised in \nhappiness the  human being becomes, in  that precise instant, eternal, \nand \nyou \nbreathed \nimmortality \nin \nthe \nembrace \nof \nvictory.’ \nStop \nit, \ndoc, \nthat’s hurting me! \nDoohan, \nof  \ncourse, \nwinces \nwith \nembarrassment \nwhenever \nyou \nremind \nhim \nof \nthe \ndoc’s \neulogy, \nprobably \nmore \nthan \nhe \ngrimaced \nwhen \nthe \nsurgeons \ndrilled \nthat \n[lazaroff \ngantry \ninto \nhis \nleg. \nIncidentally, \nall \n\n168 THE FAST STUFF \nIlazaroff patients (should that be victims?) pop morphine daily to  kill \nthe  pain. Mighty Mick took paracetamol. \nHere’s another Costa classic, referring to  Carlos Checa’s Czech GP \ncomeback from the scary, life-threatening injuries he  suffered at \nDonington 1998. ‘As  I approached the  Spanish rider’s pit area I had an \nodd feeling, as  if  I were about to  enter an  unusual, almost holy place. \nIts occupants were there as  usual... yet something impossible to define, \nsomething peculiar was hovering in the  air.  Carlos finished the  race... \nthose present lined up  like devout friars along the  sides of an  altar... \nThen, taken aback, I realised who had helped Carlos pick himself up.  It \nwas the  same “Old Lady” who had befriended him in Sherwood Forest \nnear the  hospital of Nottingham and had become his  friend. The lady \nthat no  one remembers or  wishes to  remember. The “Lady” St Francis \nreferred to  as  Sister Death!’ Jesus, Mary, Joseph... \nFinally, Costa’s thoughts on  motorcycles. ‘The motorbike is a  symbol \nof energy. It is not, as  most might think, technological, but  natural. It \nis that animal part of the  ancient centaur that safeguards our  instincts \nand frees them to  ride out and seek the answers to  questions that \ntorment us.  Not even the fury of  the  wind can stop this quest for \nfreedom, this attempt to  seek answers different from those that society \npalms us  off with daily.’ You see, deep within the  weirdness, now and \nagain Costa does get it right. Kind of. \nEpilogue: the Clinica Mobile celebrated its 30th anniversary of looking \nafter GP riders at  the  2007 San  Marino GP.  The invite read thus: ‘Thirty \nyears ago, Clinica Mobile, the little travelling hospital of the mythological \nworld of motorcycling, was created. Throughout the  years, our clinic \nhas  become a home for  the  heroes, an  altar for  riders to  celebrate the \nmagical ritual with which they resurrect from their injuries, from their \nfractures, from their illnesses, to  climb the enchanted mountain of \nmotorcycling, the  mountain with only the  stars in heaven above it.’ \nThe invite included an  illustration of  a  rider climbing a  rocky \nmountain towards the starlit heavens while wearing leathers and \nhelmet and with both arms and both legs heavily bandaged... \n\nCHAPTER 24 \nSEX ON  THE \nRACETRACK \nSeptember 2002 \nCagiva’s C594 500 GP bike and Aprilia’s RS3 Cube MotoGP \nmachine are two of  the sexiest bikes ever to  have graced a \nracetrack. The Cagiva was more than pretty, it won GPs. The \nAprilia didn’t, possibly because it was too far  ahead of its  time \nwith pneumatic valves and ride-by-wire throttle \nCagiva C594: Kocinski’s 1994 bike had it all - \npassion, romance, success \nThe Cagiva C594 has  its  place in history as  the  last Italian machine to \nwin a  500 GP.  But this is  not  what makes the  bike so  seductive. The \nC594 was the culmination of almost two  decades of extravagant though \nultimately unproductive investment by the  Castiglioni brothers, who \nowned much of Italy’s motorcycle industry, from Cagiva to MV Agusta, \nfrom Ducati to  Moto Guzzi. \nClaudio and Giancarlo Castiglioni are  industrialist empire builders, \nrenowned for  their hardnosed business dealings, and yet  their grand \nprix adventure was marked by a  singular lack of  penny-pinching \nbusiness nous. They went racing because they loved it, and in  an  age \nwhen accountants rule the corporate world, knowing the price of \neverything and the value of  nothing, that’s to  be  applauded. The \nCastiglionis had a  passion for  racing, with a  capital P. \nIn  this sense the brothers were the last in  the line of  Italy’s \nromantic old-school motorsport patrons, men of  means like Count \nDomenico Agusta and Enzo Ferrari, who ruled over their stables like \n20th-century Machiavellians, enjoying the  behind-the-scenes political \nmachinations as  much as  they adored the wondrous machines they put \non the racetrack. The Castiglionis poured tens of  millions of \npounds \ninto \ntheir \nGP \nproject, \nwithout \never \nbuilding \na \nrange \nof \nroad \nbikes \nthat \nmight \nprofit \nfrom \ntheir \ninvestment. \nAnd \njust \nwhen \nthey \nwere \n\n170 THE FAST STUFF \non  the cusp of wresting the 500 world championship from the Japanese, \nthey quit. \nIn fact, the brothers didn’t fall from GP racing, they were pushed, by a \nbunch of bankers. If they had managed to get away with their megabuck \nhobby for  16 years, they were finally told to  stop playing in  1994 when a \nconsortium of banks rescued the  Castiglioni group from the  financial \ndifficulties that also threatened to engulf Ducati. The banks’ accountants \ninsisted on  the  curtailment of  GP  activities as  a  precondition of  their \nrescue package. Ducati were allowed to  stay in World Superbike because \nthat series offered a direct commercial kickback. \nDuring Cagiva’s final years on  the  GP  scene, when they were at  their \nmost competitive, the  Castiglionis steadfastly refused generous offers \nof commercial sponsorship, for  the  simple reason that they wanted a \nblood-red motorcycle, just like the  older Ferrari Fl  cars that are  still \nworshipped the  world over. Perhaps it’s  just as  well that Cagiva’s GP \ndream ended when it did, before its purity got perverted by 21st-century \nracing mores —  blanket corporate sponsorship and dodgy team orders. \nIt  is  also somewhat ironic that Cagiva only achieved success with \ntwo wholly un-Latin riders —  American racing automatons Eddie \nLawson and John Kocinski. Of course, both men have a  huge passion \nfor  motorcycles and racing, but it took the  strange brew of their cold- \nblooded brains and the  Italians’ warm-blooded hearts to  win Cagiva’s \nthree GP victories, between 1992 and 1994. \nThe C594 was a development of the  previous year’s C593, which was \ncreated out  of Lawson’s invaluable input during 1991 and 1992, when \nhe won the  factory’s first GP  after a clever tyre gamble at  a damp 1992 \nHungarian GP. The machine was totally redesigned for  ‘93, when \nKocinski became the  first Cagiva rider to  beat the  Japanese V4s in  a \nhead-to-head \nrace \non \na \ndry \ntrack. \nThe \nfollowing \nyear \nthe \nweird \none \nfrom \nArkansas \nwon \nagain \nand \nled \nthe \nworld \nchampionship, \nslipping \nto \na \nbest-ever \nthird \noverall \nat \nseason’s \nend, \nbehind \nMick \nDoohan’s \nHonda \nNSR \nand \nLuca \nCadalora’s \nYamaha \nYZR. \nDuring \nthese \nyears \nthe \nCagiva \ncrew \nwas \nheaded \nby \naffable \nengineer \nRiccardo \nRosa, \nwho, \nalong \nwith \nseveral \nof \nhis \nengine \nand \nchassis \ntechnicians, \nwas \nlater \nswitched \nto \nthe \nCastiglionis’ latest baby, the  MV F4  (né Cagiva). \nRosa \nbrought \na  \nmuch-needed \npragmatism \nto  \nthe  \nreds’ \nshow. \nBefore \nhis  \narrival, \nCagiva \nhad \nalways \nbeen \nkeen \nto \nexperiment \nwhere \nthe \nmore \nbusinesslike, \nless \nimaginative \nJapanese \nteams \nfeared \nto \ntread. \nCagiva \n\nSEX ON  THE RACETRACK 171 \nwere evaluating fuel injection in  1989 and built a gorgeous all-carbon- \nfibre chassis for rider Randy Mamola the following year, well before the \nBig Four were involved in similar ventures. But  racing proves time and \nagain that success is  achieved by  effective application of  known \ntechnology, rather than by brave forays into the technological unknown, \nso  Rosa focused his  team’s efforts on  research and development that \nwould bring immediate results. \nThe 593 and 594 were styled by  Rosa, along with chassis designer \nRomano Albesiano and Claudio Castiglioni, who liked to  involve himself \nat  every level of  the project. ‘The bike’s style came naturally during \ndevelopment,’ says Rosa, who went on  to  work with Benelli’s Tornado \ntriple. ‘I think that good style is very much linked to aerodynamic efficiency, \nas  Enzo Ferrari once said: “If a car  is beautiful, it will also be functional”.’ \nYou see, the function equals beauty equation works both ways. \nThe C594 is an object lesson in clean, straightforward design, in which its \ncreators have maintained their focus on  functionality, letting the machine’s \nmission define its appearance. And it’s almost certainly no  coincidence that \nDucati’s 916 style icon has  more than a  passing resemblance to  the  bike. \nRosa gave 916  designer Massimo Tamburini a  C594 for his  design offices, \nand Tamburini had already borrowed heavily from an  earlier Cagiva 500 for \nhis design of the marque’s Mito 125  streetbike. \nRosa presided over three years of great industry and success within \nCagiva’s race department that coincided with a  period during which \nmuch of  Italian commerce was starting to  enjoy something of  a \nrenaissance, mating its  age-old talent for  design and manufacture to \nmodern-day business practices. It  was a  far  cry  from Cagiva’s earlier \ndays on  the GP  trail, when the team staggered along Don Quixote- \nstyle, \njousting \nineffectually \nwith \nthe \n‘windmills’ \nof \nthe \nFar \nEast. \nThe \nfirst \nten \nyears \nat \nleast \nwere \nrarely \nany \nless \nthan \ntragi-comic, \nriddled \nwith \nrider \nwalk-outs, \nmechanical \nmeltdowns \nand \ntales \nof \ntrickery. \nLegend \nhas \nit, \nfor \nexample, \nthat \nthe \nfirst \nCagiva \n500 \nof \n1979 \nwas \nbuilt \naround \na \nset \nof \nSuzuki \nRG500 \ncrankcases \nnicked \nfrom \nSuzuki's \nfactory \nteam \nHQ \nin \nSurrey \nthe \nprevious \nsummer. \nThat’s \nthe \nCagiva \nGP \nstory \n— \nwrapped more in romance than in sex. \nAprilia \nRS3 \nCube: \nFrighteningly \nfast, \ngood-looking \nand \nItalian \nCan \nbrutal \nbe \nbeautiful? \nOr \nsexy? \nIn \nmotorcycling, \nalmost \ncertainly \nyes. \nAprilia’s \nRS3 \nCube \nlooks \nbeautiful \nin \na \nbrutal \nkind \nof \na \nway. \nIt \nlooks \nlike \n\n172 THE FAST STUFF \nit  might hurt you. Badly. And it  sounds like it  wants to  hurt you. \nNo,  really. \nThe new breed of four-stroke MotoGP bikes are  sexy like 500 two- \nstrokes never could be.  Five hundreds ruled the  world for  decades but \nalways sounded like tricked-up scooters, whereas the earth moves every \ntime the  Cube rumbles past. Styling is a visual thing, of course, and yet \nthe  noise that tracks a  motorcycle as  it rocks on  by is \njust as  important. The Cube sounds wonderful, like a \n‘The Cube sounds tumult of bellowing bassoons at the  front of an  ancient \nwonderful, like a army, weaponry glinting in  the sunlight as  it  rushes \nturnult of bellowing onward towards the gates of  Hades. You see, we're \n,assoons at the front already getting carried away here, but this is  what \nof an  ancient army, Italian racing motorcycles are  all  about: Aprilias and \nveaponry glinting in Ducatis engage the  emotions in a way that Hondas and \nthe sunlight’ Yamahas never will. \nAprilia knows this. Yet factory race chief Jan \nWitteveen insists that form follows function in  the \nNoale race shop. The Cube’s styling was born out of a  desire to  win \nraces, not to  flog streetbikes, but since function is  beauty, these two \nintents usually deliver the  same end result. ‘No  one at  Aprilia tells us \nthat we  need a nice design for marketing reasons,’ proclaims Witteveen, \nthe  main man behind the  little Italian marque’s Superbike, 250 and \n125 successes. ‘Our first target is  always performance, though I also \nbelieve that the  emotion of the  fans, and of the  people who work with \nthe  bike, is important.’ \nThe Cube’s shark-like look was created in the wind tunnel, or  rather \na virtual wind tunnel, to cope with the particular aerodynamic demands \nof  MotoGP racing. Which doesn’t mean top-speed slipperiness, even \nthough the  RS3 was the  first MotoGP machine to  crack the  200mph \nbarrier at  the  2002 Italian GP.  Racetrack aerodynamicists, like  Aprilia’s \nCorrado Ficuccello, have realised that chasing the  lowest-possible drag \ncoefficient will gain 0.2  seconds at  the  end of  a  racetrack’s longest \nstraight, and lose a whole second through the  twists and turns because \nless drag usually means more lift, which badly affects handling. \nAprilia’s work in  their virtual wind tunnel —  that’s a  computer \naerodynamics program to  you and me  —  was complemented by real- \nworld development at  military airbases in  northern Italy, where the \nCube’s onboard datalogging clocked 205mph. ‘But that’s not a  real \n\nSEX ON  THE RACETRACK 173 \nspeed because it was measured at the rear wheel,’ adds Witteveen. ‘And \nyou get  a  lot  of  tyre slip at  that kind of  speed.’ That’s double-ton \nwheelspin, very sexy. \nThe Cube was so  powerful off  the  drawing board that rider Regis \nLaconi initially struggled to control the brute. He would invariably head \nthe top-speed charts while his lap times languished somewhere outside \nthe  top  ten. So Aprilia have steadily detuned the  motor, replacing top- \nend horsepower with mid-range torque, and each time they do that, he \ngets quicker. \nNevertheless, whenever the  Frenchman with the, erm, enthusiastic \nriding style climbs off the  bike, he looks like  he’s just gone ten  rounds \nwith some mythical six-headed monster. Eyes bulging and sweat \nglistening, Laconi mimes the  experience of riding the  220  horsepower \nCube as  a  horseman might act  out a  wild-stallion ride towards the \napocalypse: arms straining from their sockets as  he’s dragged towards \nthe  horizon at a terrifying rate, with seemingly little control over his \ndestiny. So  the  former 500  and Superbike winner obviously adores the \nbike. ‘It really kicks in every gear, more than my Yamaha 500  ever did,’ \nhe jabbers, still pumped after another practice run. ‘It  feels like a  500 \nbut  with more power and much more torque. The engine internals are \nvery light, so  it picks up  revs really fast and accelerates like crazy.’ \nThe Cube’s Cosworth-designed inline triple is crammed with more \nradical technology than any of  the  Japanese MotoGP bikes, namely \npneumatic valves and a  super-small, super-light, Fl-style AP  Lockheed \ncarbon clutch. Also sexy. ‘We have more than enough power, so  the \npneumatic valves aren’t necessary at  this moment,’ adds Witteveen. \n‘But if we  need to  increase performance in the  long term, they will give \nus  a  useful margin.’ \nAnd this is where Witteveen contradicts his  earlier declaration that \nAprilia’s \nracing \ndepartment \nhas \nno \ntruck \nwith \nthe \nmen \nfrom \nmarketing. \n‘We \nchose \na \nthree \ncylinder \nbecause \nI \nwas \nsure \nthe \nJapanese \nwouldn't \nmake \na \nthree; \nwe \nwanted \nto \nbe \ndifferent. \nOf \ncourse, \nour \ncomputer \nsimulations \ntold \nus \nthe \nthree \nwould \nbe \ngood \non \nthe \ntrack, \nand \nsince \nit’s \nmore \ndifficult \nto \nmake \nhorsepower \nwith \na \nthree \nrather \nthan \na \nfive, \nthis \nhelped \nus \nin \ndeciding \nto \nuse \npneumatic \nvalves. \nWe \nliked \nthe \nidea \nbecause \nwe \nwanted \nsome \nhigh \ntechnology \nin \nthe \nengine.’ \nLeast \nsexy \nof  \nall,  \nmanufacturing \ncosts \nalso \nhelped \ndetermine \nthe \nCube’s \nconfiguration. \n‘An \ninline \nmulti \nis \ncheaper \nto \nproduce \nthan \na \n\n174 THE FAST STUFF \nv-twin, a V3  or  a V4, because you only need one  cylinder head, one  cam \ndrive and so on.’ Such are the humdrum considerations of the production \nline. But  wait, this surely means there'll soon be a Cube road bike. ‘Not \nthis year, not  next year, I don’t know when,’ insists Witteveen. And if \nthere ever is a street Cube you can  be certain it will be a dead ringer for \nthe racer, because the link between track and street is  particularly \ncrucial to Aprilia. The company only started making motorcycles in the \nmid-1970s and would be  nowhere in  the  global consciousness if Max \nBiaggi, Valentino Rossi, Laconi et al hadn’t put  its name up  in lights. \nMeanwhile, the  Cube racer is  expected to  get  quicker and quicker. \nThe 2002 bike is well over its  MotoGP-minimum weight limit and will \nstay that way for  some months, while each prototype part is whittled \ndown to  size and recast or  re-machined in  unobtanium. Witteveen \nreckons his  creation is  currently losing a  kilo every GP  (it’s the  new \nMotoGP diet: lose a  kilo a  fortnight, only £45,000!), which suggests \nthat the Cube will be pretty trim by Christmas and down to the  135-kilo \nlimit by the  start of the  2003 MotoGP season. \nQuick, shapely and Italian, the Cube’s sexiest attribute is probably its \npotential to  beat Honda. ‘We have a  chance to  beat them because, I \nhope, we have more fantasy, more creativity,’ Witteveen says. ‘If \neconomic power was all  that mattered in  racing, Honda would win \neverything, but  we've already demonstrated that’s not  always so.’ \nAnd he’s not  the only man who believes, as  one  rival Japanese factory \nengineer recently let slip: ‘The Aprilia will soon be kicking our  asses’. \nThe little guys defeating the big guys, now that is sexy. \nEpilogue: Sadly, the Aprilia never did beat Honda. World Supers champ \nColin Edwards rode the  bike in  2003 and got  his  arse burnt when the \nbike caught fire in Germany. In 2004 Jeremy McWilliams did  his best to \ntame the fiery beast. But  the factory was already in dire financial trouble \nand so  the  Cube project was crushed, exactly a decade after the  Cagiva \nwent west. Shame. \n\nCHAPTER 25 \nI’M \nA \nLOSER, \nBABY, \nSO  \nWHY \nDON’T \nYOU \nKILL \nME? \nNovember 2002 \nSo sang the great Beck a few years back. But just how bad do bike \nracing’s biggest losers feel? Grand Prix and World Superbike nearly \nmen Randy Mamola, Aaron Slight and Ralf Waldmann reveal what \nit’s  like never quite to shake off the  habit of finishing second \nRacing is  all  about winning, but if anything, it’s  more about losing. \nThere’s only one victor in every race but  many vanquished. And it’s  the \nwinners you get  to  read about, while the  losers barely rate a  mention. \nYet, just as  the  devil has  all the best tunes, it’s  the  losers who've got all \nthe  best tales. \nIn  500 GPs and World Superbikes, there’s two king losers: Randy \nMamola and Aaron Slight. Mamola won 13  GPs and finished second in \nfour 500  world championships during the  1980s; Slight won 13  Supers \nrounds (that scary number again) and made the  top  three in the  world \nchampionship six  seasons running from ’93.  Both men were at the top of \ntheir game for  years, as  fast as  anyone out there, but somehow they \nnever quite won a world championship, so  they’re left  to live  out  the rest \nof their lives wondering what might have been, the  memories of those \nbig days that didn’t turn out  right forever eating them up  inside. \nThere are  plenty of  reasons why Mamola and Slight never struck \ngold. Racers get  slagged for whingeing but, in all honesty, their excuses \nusually are  reasons. No  one ever had a  perfect race, there’s always \nsomething that might’ve panned out  better. The potential for cock-up is \nimmense. Riders are  at  the  mercy of inanimate objects, thousands of \ncomponents that might not  work exactly right. Or  the  weather may go \nwrong, even a  two-degree temperature change can confound a  tyre \nchoice. And then there’s 30  other very animate riders out there, all \nquite prepared to  ride into you at  140mph. Like war, the winner is \ngenerally the  one who has the  fewest fuck-ups, it’s  all  ifs and buts. \n\n176 THE FAST STUFF \nSlight, whose bike career ended prematurely at  the  end of 2000, still \nhurts bad. The title of his  autobiography You  Don’t Know the Half of It \ncertainly suggests that there was a whole load of emotional! investment \nand ifs  and buts that he wanted off his  back. ‘Writing the  book was a \nsort  of therapy for me,’ says the New Zealander, who switched to racing \ncars after he quit two wheels. ‘I couldn’t go through all the ifs and buts \nhere, because there’s so  many of  them, but the  biggest one was the \nrules. I was the  nearly man of Superbikes because I was riding a  750 \nfour when everyone was winning on  1000 twins. Now everyone knows \nyou've got  to  be  on  a  twin, but I was screaming about that for  ten \nyears.’ \nOf  course, Slight did eventually get  to  race a  twin when Honda \nunleashed its  SP-1 in  2000, but that’s the  year his  head went pop, a \n‘cavernous malformation’ in  his brain causing the stroke that \nprematurely ended his  career. Some people never get  the  luck. And \nthere were other moments, like ‘94, when a  blow-up at  Hockenheim \nand a disqualification at  Donington cost him the  title. Or 96, when he \nled  the  championship into the  penultimate round, only to  suffer a bad \nattack of flu at Albacete. ‘I got sick when Honda sent me  to the Cologne \nshow to  do publicity stuff, I’d argued for hours to  try and get out  of it.’ \nOr ‘98, when he was up for the  title but  his  team never instigated team \norders to help him out. That contest went to the wire with Ducati’s Carl \nFogarty at  Sugo, where Slight had tyre problems. ‘That year I won five \nraces, Carl won three and still took the  championship.’ \nSo  does Slight’s ultimate failure to  win a  world title still keep him \nawake at night? ‘I really have to make sure it doesn’t have that effect or \nI’d  stay awake forever. I started racing cars because that’s the  only way \nI could take my  mind off it; it had a huge effect on  me.’ \nMamola, a  decade into his  retirement from GP  racing, is a  little more \ndistant from his failures and therefore more sanguine. Like Slight he had \nhis  disasters, like when he  led  the 1980 championship into the  final \nround at  the  daunting Nurburgring. First time out  at  the  lethal 14-mile \ncircuit, the  20-year-old needed a win to  take the  title from. King Kenny \nRoberts. He was leading when his RG500 popped an oil seal. The following \nyear he signed with Nava helmets, whose visors fogged up  so  badly that \nhe  couldn’t see  where he  was going in  wet races. ‘Trying to  hold your \nbreath at  170mph with your heart doing 150bpm, I was furious.’ Or  ’84, \nwhen he only secured a  ride three races into the  championship. Or  ’86, \n\nI’M A LOSER, BABY, SO  WHY DON’T YOU KILL ME? 177 \nwhen he  was fighting Eddie Lawson for  the  title and crashed during \npractice at  Silverstone, cracking his  right shoulder. He  raced anyway: ‘I \nremember sitting on  the grid, I couldn’t lift my arm, so  I had to crawl my \nhand across the gas  tank to get it to the  throttle’. \nFor  sure, luck plays a  part in  racing, just as  it does in life, though \nsometimes you make your own luck. As someone once put it: ‘the more \nI practise, the  luckier I get’, and in racing you’ve got  to  do  everything \nto  stack the  odds in  your favour, whether that’s signing for  the  right \nteam or  playing in-team politics to  mess with your team-mate’s head. \nSlight did  neither of those things. When the  chance came to  sign for \nDucati in  ‘95, he  stuck with Honda. Wrong decision. ‘I never trusted \nwhat was going on at Ducati. You work with Japanese \nand you get  paid every month, work with Italians \nand you get paid when they want.’ ‘I kick myself in the \nSe \nSlight was also unlucky with his team-mates, ass  but at the same \nlining up  alongside a  succession of hard nuts, men time I’m  patting \nwho would stamp on  anyone to  get what they myself on  the back’ \nwanted. It’s probably no coincidence that his \nerstwhile team-mates Fogarty, Scott Russell and \nJohn Kocinski all  won the  title. ‘During my  Honda years it  felt  like \nHonda were testing me,  like  they didn’t believe in me. It was like  “we'll \nput  another world champ next to you and see  how you fare”.’ It seems \nSlight didn’t have the  psycho psyche to  deal with these situations. \nMamola is also accused of being too  much the nice guy, too  much the \nfun \nguy \nto \nbe \nworld \nchampion. \n‘Yeah, \nmaybe \nthat’s \ntrue,’ \nhe \nsays. \n‘I \ncan \nlook \nat \nit \nand \nthink \nI \nshould’ve \npushed \nmyself \nharder, \nbut \nI \nwent \ninto \nevery \nrace \ntrying \nto \nwin. \nDo \nI \nstill \nkick \nmyself \nin \nthe \nass? \nYeah, \nI \nkick \nmyself \nin \nthe \nass \nbut \nat \nthe \nsame \ntime \nI’m \npatting \nmyself \non \nthe \nback. \nSure, \nI \nmade \nmistakes, \nI \nlost \nchampionships \nbecause \nI \ncrashed \nor \nbecause \nmy \nbike \nbroke, \nso \nwho \ndo \nI \nblame? \nI \ndon’t \nblame \nanything, \nit’s \njust what happens.’ \nSlight \nworked \nhard \nto  \nbring \nout \nthe  \ndevil \nfrom \ninside; \nthat’s \nwhat \nthose \nMohican \nhairdos \nwere \nall \nabout. \n‘When \nI \nfirst \nleft \nNew \nZealand \nI \ntook \nout \nmy \nearrings \nbecause \nI \nwanted \na \nride, \nbut \neventually \nit \nwas \nlike, \nfuck \nthat, \nI’ve \ngot \nto \nrebel, \ndo \nwhat \nI \nwant \nto \ndo.’ \nBut \nhowever \nhard \nhe \ntried, \nhe \ncouldn’t \nbe \nthe \nbad \nguy. \n‘One \nof \nmy \nworst \npoints \nas \na \nracer \nis \nthat \nI \nlike \npeople \nto \nlike \nme,’ \nhe \nsays. \n‘I \nthink \nthat’s \na \ngood \ntrait \nin \nlife, \nbut \nas \na \nracer \nit’s \na \nbad \ntrait. \nAt \nthe \nend \nof \nevery \nseason \nI'd \ngo \n\n178 THE FAST STUFF \nhome and write down the positives and minuses of the year, and I'd fix \neverything I could. Every year I wrote “Don’t be  such a nice guy, think \nof yourself,” but you are  what you are, I was just too  soft.’ \nIn fact, Slighty has had his moments of badness, including feuds with \nboth Foggy and Hodgson. ‘There was a bit of drama at  Sugo ’98, when I \nhad that run-in with Neil. On  the  grid for  race one I walked up  to  Carl \nand said “I guess it’s between you and me”, shook his hand and walked \noff.  On  the  way back, I don’t know what possessed me, but  I saw Neil \nand  said to him: “If I poke a wheel up, will you give us  some room?” That \nwas like a  red  rag  to  the  bull, every chance he  got, he  carved me  up,  I \nthink we  came together about six times, so after the race I rode up behind \nhim and smacked him in  the  kidneys. He  stopped, I parked my bike \nagainst the barrier, went over, grabbed him by the chin piece and dragged \nhim off the bike. Yeah, I saw red, but it wasn’t about him that day, it was \nthe championship slipping away.’ Ironically, that incident highlights \nSlighty’s gentler side, not  his  ruthlessness. Few other racers would even \ndream about shaking hands with a rival on  the  grid at  such a moment, \nand few would dare ask a fellow rider for any  quarter. \nNot surprisingly, he  cites that day’s second race as  the gloomiest \nmoment of his  career. ‘I made the  best start of my  life, from tenth on \nthe  grid to  fourth at  the  first corner, and when I turned on  to  the  back \nstraight I saw Carl pulling away, I could feel  the  championship slipping \nthrough my  fingers.’ \nMamola’s darkest moment came at  the  end of  ’87, just after he’d \nfinished second overall for  the  fourth time. Roberts, boss of his  Lucky \nStrike Yamaha team, sacked him and brought in Wayne Rainey. \nBoth Slight and Mamola console themselves with the  fact that they \ndidn’t do  so  bad; second place may be  the first loser, but it’s  heaps \nbetter than 28th. ‘When you look in the  record books and your name’s \nnot listed as  world champion, that kinda hurts,’ adds Mamola, now \nmarried with kids and living in  Barcelona. ‘The thing that keeps my \nhead above water is  that I  stood on  the podium in  three different \ndecades —  the  1970s, the  1980s and the  1990s —  and that J got  to  ride \nwith some great guys like Kenny, Sheene, Spencer and Lawson, Rainey, \nDoohan and Schwantz. I’ve beaten people who were world champions \nand \nI \noutlasted \nthem. \nAnd \nthose \nguys \nall \nlook \nat \nme \nand \ngo: \n“Man, \nyou \nshould’ve \nwon \none”. \nOkay, \nthat \nmakes \nme \nfeel \ngood \nbecause \nI’m \naccepted as  one  anyway.’ \n\nI’M A LOSER, BABY, SO  WHY DON’T YOU KILL ME? 179 \nEventually the only way to  cope with any kind of  failure, to  stop \nyourself becoming a bitter old  man, is  to  put  things into perspective. \n‘When you're racing it’s  everything, you’re so  focused, that’s all  there \nis,,  says Mamola, who's heavily involved in  charity work between \nworking for Eurosport at  GPs. ‘Man, since I stopped, the world is huge \nand racing is so  tiny, and the Riders for Health thing is beyond standing \non  the  podium, because it’s  something for the world.’ \nSlight has  managed to  transform the negative of his life-threatening \nmedical condition into a positive, and he’s convinced himself that being \nthe  good guy isn’t so  bad after all.  ‘I’m lucky I’ve had a life-altering \nexperience,’ he  says. ‘When I look back now I think I didn’t do  such a \nbad job, and how many top guys have stopped because of  racing \ninjuries? I think how lucky I am  to get out  of there still walking. And if \nI get  in  that “what if?” mode, I just tell  myself that I could still be \nworking on  farm bikes in  a  bike shop in  New Zealand; I’ve seen the \nworld and the last five years of  my career I  earned good money. \nMotorcycling was such a huge part of my  life  but  it’s  such a  small part \nof your whole life, I’ve still got  60  years to  live and I’m  just glad I’m \nliving that as  Aaron Slight and not  as  Fogarty or  Kocinski.’ \nTears before bedtime with Waldi -  another loser who never \nlacked emotional investment \nRalf Waldmann is the  most successful GP rider in history never to have \nwon a world championship, though he mostly contested the  lesser 125 \nand 250 classes. He’s also a  very funny man, with a Teutonic knack of \nloudly hitting the  nail on  the  head. At  the  2000 British GP,  when he \nheroically came from 90  seconds down to  win the 250 GP  after an \napparently idiotic choice of  rain tyres came good when the  heavens \nopened, \nhe \nopined: \n‘The \ndifference \nbetween \nidiot \nand \nhero \nis \nvery \nsmall’. \nFew \ntruer \nwords \nhave \never \nbeen \nspoken \nin \nmotorcycle \nracing. \nWaldi \nwon \n20 \nraces \nin \na \nGP \ncareer \nspanning \n15 \nyears, \ntwice \nfinishing \nsecond \nto  \nMax \nBiaggi \nin  \nthe \n250 \nworld \nchampionship \n(by  \njust \ntwo \npoints \nin \n’97) \nand \ntwice \nthird \nin \nthe \n125 \nworld \nchampionship \n(in \n“92 \nhe \nsquandered \na \n30-point \nmid-season \nlead, \neventually \nlosing \nout \nto \nAlessandro \nGramigni). \nSadly, \nWaldi \nis  \nlikely \nto  \nhang \non  \nto  \nthe  \n‘Most \nsuccessful \nrider \nin \nhistory \nnever \nto \nwin \na \nworld \ntitle’ \nlabel \nfor \nsome \ntime. \nI \nwonder \nif \nthese \nwords \nlull \nhim \nto \nsleep \nevery \nnight \nlike \nsome \nkind \nof \nSatan’s \nlullaby. \n\n180 THE FAST STUFF \n‘No, no,  this is  all  behind me!’ he  says brightly. We’re talking in  the \nback of his  team’s truck, not  in a palatial motorhome, during his  brief \nGP.  comeback during 2002. I’m sat  on  a  drum of gas, he’s on a pile of \ntyres, and he thinks this is hilarious. It seems that Waldi really is happy \nwith what fate has  bestowed on  him. We  distil the  reasons for his  two \nclosest world-title failures to  two moments. In ’92  his  Honda 125  team \nhad a  mid-season meltdown, a  bitter feud between his  two chief \nmechanics erupting into a  pit-lane brawl. In  ’97  he  chose a  wrong- \ncompound tyre for  the  penultimate Indonesian GP.  He  finished that \nrace seventh when fourth place would’ve given him the  title. Just ten \nseconds separated fourth from seventh. \n‘If you look for  reasons, you find them,’ he  says, a little more glum, \nthe memories seeping up  to haunt him. ‘Before ’97 it was brilliant with \nthe  money, with the  stuff we  get, but  then we  lose our sponsor and it \nwas really shitty, because we don’t have enough money. We have \nminimum of budget and only one bike; Max has two bikes.’ I notice a \nslight tremble in  Waldi’s voice, and, yup, he’s welling up.  Jeez, I’ve \nopened a real can of worms here. So it does still affect you, then? ‘Little \nbit, yes,’ he trembles, rubbing swollen, watery eyes. ‘Doesn’t matter, it’s \ntrue, so  no  problem, I live  with that or  I don’t live with that.’ \nThis is getting heavy, I almost feel like giving him a  hug but  feebly \nproffer some kinder words. But  you  had a good career... ‘Ja, ja, ja.’ And \nyou were really popular... ‘Ja,  ja, ja, and I have so  much fun  when I \nmake races.’ My next attempt at  cheering him up  is even more cheesy, \nbut  knowing what many world champions are  like, I kind of mean it. \nSo  Ralf, if you had the  choice of  being a  nice guy without a  world \nchampionship, or  an  asshole with a world championship, which would \nyou be?  By  now Waldi’s on  an  emotional rollercoaster and suddenly \nhe’s in hysterics. ‘Ha, ha ha!  Ja, ja, ja, it’s better nice guy  and not  world \nchampion.’ A big grin and another rub  of those puffy eyes. \n‘I don’t know, maybe I was not  lucky enough to  get a title, or  maybe \nI’m not fighting enough, or  maybe a  funny guy like I am, maybe I’m \nnot  strong enough. World titles is what every racer looks for, but  I had \nso  many nice races and I win 20  times, so  I must keep this in  my \nmemory, not  one title. For  sure one title would be nice but  the wins are \nalso very important, I think.’ \n\nCHAPTER 26 \nTHOSE WERE THE \nHAZE \nNovember 2002 \nSmoky ol’ two-stroke 500s and disco conquered the world in the \n1970s. Barry Sheene and friends trace their years at  the top of \nthe GP  power curve \nBack in the 1970s, GP  racing didn’t just look great and sound great, it \nsmelt great too, although that had nothing to  do with the  great smell \nof Brut, the  pervading whiff in Barry Sheene’s caravan. It was sweeter \nthan that. Back then, racetracks were a  fog of Castrol R fumes exuded \nby the  500 two-strokes that were starting to  kick ass, the  warm grey \ntaste filling your nostrils with mineral-based sweetness each time a \nnational flag was dropped to  start a grand prix. \nCastrol R was the  smell of a generation —  the wide-lapelled jetsetters \nwho battled those medieval ‘stinkwheels’ to  world domination, \napparently consigning four-strokes to the dustbin of racing history. Like \nsmoke machines in  nightclubs, the  two-stroke haze added a  layer of \nmystery —  and therefore romance and glamour —  to  proceedings. Like \nmaybe, just maybe, you might catch a  glimpse of  Sheeney’s bird \nStephanie Maclean through the  sweet, sickly greyness. \nIt  wasn’t all  glamour, of course. Those early 500 two-strokes were \nnasty pieces of  work —  their engines likely to  lock solid at  the  most \ninappropriate moment, skewing the  machine sideways and jettisoning \nthe  rider skyward, seriously dangerous when tracks were adjoined by \nbrick walls and telegraph poles, not  cosy expanses of gravel trap. The \nbikes were agonisingly noisy too, for  it wasn’t until the  late 1970s that \nanyone even thought about silencers, by which time many an  eardrum \nhad been shredded (presumably they couldn’t think for  the  racket). \nTommy Robb, whose GP  career straddled the  four-stroke and two- \nstroke eras, was one of many who suffered. ‘Seizures were always a \nworry,’ \nsays \nthe \nUlsterman \nwho \nrode \nfactory \nHonda \nfour-strokes \nto \n\n182 THE FAST STUFF \nseveral GP  wins in  the 1960s, later contesting world championship \nevents on  Yamaha strokers, the  forerunners of the RD  streetbikes. ‘And \nwhen an  engine locked up,  it locked up  very quickly, \nwhich is why I wear two hearing aids today. If you \nAG \n‘I miss the  two- wanted to  catch a  seizure early you needed to  notice \nstroke sound very that slight pinking noise just prior to  a  seizure, so  I \nmuch, even though never wore cotton wool in my  ears. The two-strokes \nit shattered my shattered my  inner ears.’ 1970s racers like Robb had \ninner ears, and the a phrase for that misleading moment of serenity that \nsmellwas ~- heralded a  seizure: ‘whispering death’. \nwonderful’ And yet  Robb has no  regrets. ‘I  miss the sound \nvery much, it’s  done me  damage but I wish it was \nstill  the way it was. I feel sorry for people who never \nheard racing in  the 1960s and 1970s. And the  smell was wonderful, \nwhen we  got around a table we  used to joke that we  should get a little \ntray of Castrol R and set  it alight, just to  get  the  atmosphere for  the \nchat. It was lovely.’ \nRobb finished third in  the 1971 Ulster 500 GP  aboard an  ageing \nNorton single. More than half a lap ahead, Australian Jack Findlay was \nmaking history, riding a  Suzuki TR500 to  victory, the  first-ever two- \nstroke premier-class win. Findlay’s air-cooled twin, a  somewhat basic \ndevelopment of the  T500 streetbike, had a  powerband, oooh, 900rpm \nwide, but it was the start of something big. \nTwo years later Sheene was developing Suzuki’s seminal RG500 \nsquare four, with which he  won the  ’76  and '77  500 titles. ‘The two- \nstrokes were lighter than the four-strokes and they had more horsepower \nbut  they were far  less tractable,’ he  recalls. ‘The first RG  I rode at  the \nend of ’73  started at  nine grand, below that there was nothing, and \nwhen I  say  nothing, I mean nothing. To  get  it  out of  the paddock \nyou had to  scream it  at  10,000rpm or  it wouldn’t even clear, and it \nstopped at  ten-five, so  once you'd got it  clear at  nine-five, you had \n1000rpm to  play with. I told them it was a  waste of time unless they \nspread the  powerband, but they were going “But Barry-san, it’s  got \n105  horsepower!” \nBy then the  two-strokes were winning now and again, mostly when \nLatin heartthrob Giacomo Agostini and his  mighty MV Agusta four- \nstroke had already wrapped up the title, Ago indulging himself on  some \nCaribbean beach while the also-rans completed the championship. And \n\nTHOSE WERE THE HAZE 183 \nyet Agostini could see  the writing on  the wall. In ’74  he terminated his \nnine-year relationship with Count Domenico Agusta and signed for \nYamaha. The two-strokes were getting faster and more refined with \nevery race —  the  four-cylinder OW26 which the  Italian stallion rode to \nthe  following year’s 500 title had a  powerband almost 2000rpm wide \n—  while the  four-strokes were going nowhere. But guys like Sheene — \naccustomed to  spending their winters partying hard —  paid a high price \nfor the  strokers’ improving usability. ‘Foolishly enough I told Suzuki I’d \ncome to  Japan at  the  end of ’74  and stay there until the  engine was \nright,’ he says. ‘I was there for five weeks, the biggest jail sentence I’ve \never served in my  life, a nightmare, but  the bike came good.’ \nThe only riposte that the four-stroke faithful had had to  the \nstinkwheels’ two-power-strokes-for-the-price-of-one technology was \nmultiplying cylinders and gears, as  Honda had done with their five- \ncylinder/eight-speed 125 and six-cylinder/seven-speed 250. But new \ntechnical regulations, intended to  reduce costs, limited the number of \ncylinders and gears, outlawing Honda’s most exotic creations, including \na  250 V8  and 500 six  that were rumoured to  be on  the  drawing board. \nThe new rules swung the advantage irrevocably towards the two- \nstrokes. Only by rewriting the  regs for  2002, when four-strokes were \ngiven a near 100  per  cent capacity advantage in MotoGP, was the  reign \nof the  two-strokes ended. \nAs  the  1970s accelerated to  their disco-pumping peak, Sheene’s hair \ngrew longer and the two-stroke’s powerband grew wider. ‘By the end of \n‘76  people knew the  four-stroke was finished,’ he  adds. ‘In  “79  the  RG \nwould start at  seven five  and go through to  11,000; it was just the extra \nknowledge they had about porting, expansion chambers, ignition \ntiming, everything.’ \nAnd they just kept getting better. Improved metallurgy, lubrication \n(the fog of Castrol R finally cleared around then) and all-round know- \nhow \nincreased \nreliability, \nperformance \nand \nridability \nquite \ndramatically. \nBut \nyou \nnever \nget \nrid \nof \nall \nyour \nproblems \nin \nracing \n— \nback \nthen \nSheene’s \njust \nchanged \nfrom \ndodgy \ntwo-strokes \nto \npesky \nAmericans. \nKenny \nRoberts \nhad \narrived \nin \nEurope \nin \n’78  \nand \nswiped \nthe  \ntitle \nfrom \nSheene \nat \nhis \nfirst \nattempt. \nBy \nthe \ntime \nthe \nKing \nquit \nat \nthe \nend \nof \n’83, \nwhen \nhe \nlost \nout \nto \nFreddie \nSpencer \nand \nHonda, \nAmericans \npretty \nmuch \nruled \nthe \nscene. \nAnd \nnew-fangled \ntechnology \nwas \nbroadening \npowerbands \nstill \nfurther. \nSheene \nagain: \n‘By \n‘86 \nor \n“87 \nyou \ncould \nride \na \n\n184 THE FAST STUFF \nee \n500 \naround \ntown \nif \nyou \nfitted \nlow \nenough \ngearing; \n‘I \ntold \nthem \nit was \na \nthey \nwere \nincreasingly \na lot easier \nto \nride.’ \nwaste \nof \ntime \nunless \nWell, maybe \neasier \nto \nride out \nof \npit \nlane, \nbut not \nso \nthey spread \nthe \neasy \nat \nthe \nring-dinging \nlimit. \nFuelled \nby \na \nglobal \npowerband, \nbut \nthey \neconomic \nboom \nthat \nfattened \nbudgets \nand hastened \nwere going \n“But \ndevelopment, \ntwo-stroke \ntechnology \nreally \ncame \nBarry-san, \nit’s \ngot \ntogether \nin \nthe \nmid-1980s. \nHorsepower \noutputs \n105 horsepower!” \nexploded, \nand suddenly \nthings \nstarted \nto \nget \nserious. \nThere’d been cash in the  1970s, but  the  lucre was \nspent with Dancing Queen-tinged innocence and \nabandon —  frittered away chasing chicks at Tramp, tooting coke in Ibiza \nand filling the garage with Rollers. The party stopped as  the 1980s \nkicked into gear —  the  boom pumping serious money into sport for the \nfirst time. Evermore-bloated budgets raised the stakes for  the riders \nand the people making the bikes, so  engines got quicker, tyres got fatter \nand chassis stiffer. All of sudden, riders needed to be more than half fit \nto ride the  things, so  the  flared-up, Gitane-puffing playboys caved in to \nthe  cool-headed, cold-hearted professional automatons, pumping iron \nand riding sideways. \nThis was also the age  of the computer, when data acquisition allowed \nengineers to fully understand the inner mysteries of the life of the  two- \nstroke, so  they could hone efficiency to  dizzy new heights, not  only in \npeak power, but also in  power delivery. Reed-valve induction, power \nvalves and digital ignition mapping calmed engine character, though \nRoberts missed out  on  the  luxury of reeds by just one  year. ‘It was only \nafter Yamaha copied Honda and went to crankcase reeds in ’84  that the \nYamaha got pretty ridable,’ says Roberts, who spent his GP  years \nheroically wrestling with much less friendly piston port and disc valve \ninduction. ‘The reeds just broadened out  the whole powerband, so  you \ncould spin the  tyre and know where you were with it.’ \nUp  to  a  point, anyway. The OW70 V4  that Roberts raced in ’83  had \n135  horsepower, by the  early 1990s Honda’s NSR500 V4 was screaming \nout  170, and riders were once more running out  of traction, the endless \ncycle of engine and chassis development spiralling upward. Once again \nit was Honda that divined the  way forward, creating the  ‘big bang’ \nengine for  Mick Doohan in  ’92. This firing order bunched the  V4’s \npower pulses together, giving the rear tyre time to  regain traction \nbetween each salvo. Roberts again: ‘The big bang was the  one, it just \n\nTHOSE WERE THE HAZE 185 \nsmoothed \neverything \nout, \nso  \nthe \nrider \nwasn’t \nalways \nplaying \ncatch- \nup \nwith \nthe \nthrottle, \nbut \nYamaha’s \n“big \nbang” \nwas \njust \na \nBand \nAid \nfor \na \nshitty \npowerband. \nHonda \nwere \nthe \nonly \nones \nwho \never \ngot \ntheir \npowerband \ntruly \nlinear, \nso \nthe \nrider \nhad \nthe \nthrottle \nresponse \nto \nreally \ncontrol \nthe \nbike \nwhen \nthe \nrear \ntyre \nwas \nspinning. \nHonda \nalways \nhas \nmore \nmoney, \nso \nthey \ngot \nall \nthe \nstuff \nright \n— \ncylinders, \npipes, \ncarburettors \nand, \nmost \nof \nall, \nthe \nelectronics.’ \nSuzuki never got  it  quite right either, as  93  World Supers champ \nScott Russell discovered when he raced RGV500 V4s  in ‘96.  ‘You better \ntake your time with this thing,’ he  said. ‘Or else you'll be pulling straw \nout  0’ your ass  and having Dr Costa shoot Novocaine in your feet.’ \nHonda got it so  right that Doohan was soon calling for sharper power \ndelivery, surely the  first time anyone had asked for such a thing from a \ntwo-stroke. Mighty Mick reckoned he  could handle something a bit \nmore fiery, and he was right. Honda gave him a 90 degree motor for ‘97, \nwhen he  won 12  of  14  races. The last time HRC ran an  even-spaced \nfiring order was in  1990, when Doohan & Co were regularly jettisoned \nover the  highside by the  screamer’s lairy power curve. Soothed by a \nblack box-load of hi-tech electronics, the new-age screamer \ndemonstrated just how far two-stroke technology had come. \nDespite Doohan’s towering talent, the  500s were running into a brick \nwall with lap times by the late 1990s; once again they'd got too powerful \nfor  existing chassis and tyre technology. King Kenny had a clever idea \n—  to build his  own 500, a less  powerful but  more nimble three-cylinder, \nrather like Spencer’s NS500 triple that had beaten his  lardy V4  in  ‘83. \nThe KR3 might’ve matched the NS   if tyre technology hadn’t leaped \nforward, once more allowing the V4s to  take advantage of  their \n190 horsepower engines before they were legislated into extinction \nin 2002. \n\nCHAPTER 27 \nONE GIANT LEAP \nFOR BIKING \nNovember 2002 \nHonda’s all-conquering RC211V took over from the NSR500 as \nthe fastest race bike in  the world but what made the bike so \ndevastatingly good? Only one way to  find out —  ride Valentino \nRossi’s RCV \nAt  the end of  2001, Honda’s NSR500 ruled the  world, the greatest \nrace bike ever, the  most wanted race bike on  earth. Now the  NSR is \nobsolete and unwanted, its  reputation swept away by its  four-stroke \nsuccessor, the  RC211V. And now I know why. Testing the  RCV and NSR \nback to back at Valencia the  day after the  2002 season-ending Valencia \nGP,  the RCV takes your breath away, helps you do  things you never \nthought you’d do on  a motorcycle. Then you  ride the  NSR and it’s  a bag \nof  nails —  it  doesn’t stop, turn or  go,  it’s  vicious, awkward and too \ndamned demanding. \nI feel weird slagging the  once all-powerful NSR but I’m  not alone. \nAlex Barros, who’d beaten fellow RCV rider Valentino Rossi in  the \nprevious day’s race, turned up  during the test to  ride the NSR he’d \nridden during most of 2002, just for old  time’s sake. He  rode a handful \nof  laps on  the machine, returned to  the  pits and handed it  to  his \nmechanics, announcing: ‘This bike is sheeeet!’ \nHow can  this  be?  How can  Barros heap scorn upon a motorcycle that \nhad taken him to  three 500 GP  wins during the  previous two seasons? \nMaybe because its  successor took him to  two MotoGP wins during just \nfour races at the end of 2002. But more so because the RCV is a quantum \nleap forward in  all-round engine and chassis performance. It’s  both \nfaster and easier to ride than an  NSR500, and you can’t say  anything \nbetter than that about a race bike. \nRiding the  RCV leaves you dizzy, struggling to  translate its  other- \nworld performance into words and wary of getting carried away on  a \n\nONE GIANT LEAP FOR BIKING 187 \nwave \nof  \ngushing \nhyperbole. \nBut \nwhat \nthe  \nhell, \nthis \nis  \nlike \nno  \nother \nmotorcycle \nI’ve \never \nridden. \nIt  \nconsigns \nevery \nturbocharged, \nnitrous- \nboosted, \navgas-crammed \npsycho \nbike \nI’ve \nridden \n— \nincluding \n500 \nGP \nbikes \nand \nWorld \nSuperbike \nwinners \n— \nto \nlimpid \ngreyness, \nthough \nmaybe \nnot \nfor \nthe \nreasons \nyou'd \nexpect. \nYou'd think that the  RCV would blow you away \nwith \nits  \nspeed \nand \npower \n—  \nsurely \nany \nmotorcycle \n‘The \nRCV \nconsigns \nthat \ncan \naccelerate \npast \nan NSR500 \nlike \nit’s \nstood \nstill \nevery \nturbocharged, \nmust \nbe \na brain-frazzling \nterror. \nBut \nthe \nV5 isn’t \nlike \nnitrous-boosted, \nthat \nat all. \nThe bike’s \nmost \nremarkable \ncharacteristic \navgas-crammed \nis \nits \nuser \nfriendliness, \nnot \nits insane \npower-to-weight \npsycho \nbike I’ve \nratio (1.5 \nhorsepower \nper \nkilo compared \nto \nan \nNSR’s \nridden \nto \nlimpid \n1.45bhp/kg \nor \na \nGSX-R1000’s \n0.82bhp/kg) \nthat \ngreyness’ \ndelivers a hilarious frenzy of acceleration, kicking up \nthe  front wheel in  second, third, fourth, whenever. \nYou shift gears at  14,750rpm, though HRC say  the  motor will go  to \n16,000, and there’s no  apparent powerband. The RCV is  never scary, \nwhich is some achievement for a 220  horsepower motorcycle; it’s like  a \n500  that wants to be your mate. Five hundreds aren’t friendly —  they’re \nnasty, evil  pieces of equipment that'll mug you given half the  chance. \nMost of all, and I don’t quite know how to say this without sounding \nridiculous, the  RCV feels like a  toy, so  manageable that you can play \naround with the thing and it'll do  whatever you want it  to  do,  go \nwherever you want it to go.  And this is what HRC were aiming at when \nthey created their first four-stroke GP  racer in more than two decades. \nRCV project leader Hejiro Yoshimura wanted the  bike to  be  ‘easy to \nmanage, like  a motocross or  trials bike’, and that’s pretty much what it \nfeels like  —  a  220bhp trials tool, very cool. \nHRC achieved this goal largely through a  radical centralisation of \nmass, starting with the  75.5 degree vee  engine, which is  significantly \nmore compact than any other big-capacity four-stroke, including \nHonda’s SP-2 World Supers motor. The V5’s mass is highly concentrated, \nwith an  almost spherical shape, allowing ideal location of  centre of \ngravity and centralisation of mass, which play a vital role in  the  bike’s \nremarkable \nsteering \nand \nhandling. \nThis \nconcept \nis \nconsolidated \nby \nthe \nsuper-compact \nsemi-dry \nsump \nlubrication \nsystem \nand \nthe \nlow-slung \ngas \ntank, \nallowed \nby \nthe \nUnit \nPro-Link \nrear-suspension \nsystem \nwhich \neliminates \nthe \nneed \nfor \nan \nupper \nchassis \nshock \nmount. \n\n188 THE FAST STUFF \nWhen you ride the  RCY, it feels like its  entire mass has  been tucked \ninto the  size of a  football just beneath your stomach, offering amazing \ncontrol. The  bike seems two feet long, so  you don’t ride around corners \nso  much as  dive in  and out, and yet  it has none of  the  nervousness \nassociated with a  short wheelbase. \nRacing at  the limit is  all  about confidence, and the RCV delivers \nshed-loads of the  stuff because engine/chassis/suspension integration \nallows a  remarkably balanced machine. The RCV’s neutral behaviour \nalso reduces the  need to  rework set-up at  every track, so  the  rider can \nuse  the  same settings week after week, which allows him to intimately \nunderstand the  bike’s behaviour, so  he  knows what it’s  going to  do \nalmost before it does it, which gives him yet more confidence, so  he can \nride even harder. \nThe RCV is so  good at  cornering that it makes an  NSR feel like  hard \nwork. Four-strokes are  easier to  ride around corners than two-strokes \nbecause they’ve a constant connection between throttle, tyre and tarmac, \nwhich is why Superbikes run  so  close to 500  lap times. Shut the  throttle \non  the  RCV and the  engine helps you turn the  corner, shut the  throttle \non  the  NSR and there’s no  rear-end connection, the  bike wants to  go \nstraight, so  you have to  do all the  steering through the  handlebars. \nThe RCV seems committed to  helping the  rider in every way possible, \nvery unlike 500s, which only yield their real potential to  the most \naccomplished riders. You notice this at every point of the  racetrack —  the \nRCV happily rides through fast sweepers on a trailing throttle while the \ntwo-stroke surges and snatches. And if you misjudge your braking aboard \nthe RCY, the engine helps slow you down. Get your braking wrong on  the \n500  and it’s  panic stations, because there’s zero engine braking! \nThe four-stroke’s character doesn’t only help you ride into corners \nmore easily than the  two-stroke’s, it also helps you coming out  of the \nturns. The RCV has so much power and torque that it’s almost impossible \nto  find yourself in  the  wrong gear when it’s  time to  crack open the \nthrottle. Not so  with the  NSR —  run into a  corner in  too  high a  gear, \nwith say  8500rpm on  the  tacho, and the  motor’s batelve interested in \ngetting you down the  next straight. \nHRC also designed lateral flex into the  RCV’s chassis to  improve feel \nthrough comers and to  offer less snappy slides. Inbuilt chassis flex is \nan  increasingly important consideration in  racing design, because as \nlean angles increase, suspension efficiency decreases, so  engineers have \n\nONE GIANT LEAP FOR BIKING 189 \nto  find another way of absorbing forces driven into the  chassis. A too- \nrigid chassis also delivers too  much torque reaction to  the  rear tyre, \ncausing difficult-to-control wheelspin. \nFor many years racing purists have considered four-strokes to  be \nsecond-rate race bikes, but  only because pretty much every four-stroke \nracer of the  previous three decades used a turgid street engine. The RCV \nand its  rivals are  the  first prototype four-strokes since Honda’s and MV \nAgusta’s GP bikes of the  1960s and 1970s. The RCV feels like  no  other \nfour-stroke you've ridden, with a real crack to the throttle. It’s like  a two- \nstroke without the hassle. Believe —  prototype four-strokes rock! \n\nCHAPTER 28 \nTHERE S MORE THAN ONE WAY \nAROUND A RACETRACK \nDecember 2002 \nWorld Supers rivals Colin Edwards and Troy Bayliss use hugely \ndifferent riding techniques -  Edwards silky smooth, Bayliss \napparently out of control, so  how come both work so  well \nThe duel for  the  2002 World Superbike crown was probably the  most \nclimactic Supers championship ever. And, somewhat strangely, the \ncontest reached its climax at Imola and panned out just like  the best-ever \n500  world championship battle. Back in  1983, King Kenny Roberts and \nFreddie Spencer were neck and neck going into the final 500  GP at Imola, \nRoberts needing help from Yamaha team-mate Eddie Lawson if he were \nto sneak the title from his  Honda arch-rival, just like Troy Bayliss needed \nhelp from Ducati team-mate Ruben Xaus to  overhaul Honda’s Colin \nEdwards at  Imola 2002. But  Xaus wasn’t up  to  it, just as  rookie Lawson \nhadn’t been in ’83.  Enough of the  history lesson, though... \nBayliss and Edwards couldn’t have ended up  running closer to  each \nother —  both on  the track and in the points chase —  and yet you’d be pushed \nto  think of two motorcycle racers who look so  different when they’re on \ntheir bikes. Bayliss looks like  a  maniac —  all wobbles and tankslappers — \nwhile Edwards looks like he’s out  for  a Sunday afternoon cruise. \nSo how did these two  riders develop such contrasting styles? And what’s \nit like  to  duke it out  with someone whose technique is so  different from \nyour own? Does Edwards get  scared witless by his  opponent’s apparently \nout-of-control shenanigans? And what exactly did  Bayliss teach Edwards \nthat crucially helped change the course of their title battle? \nColin Edwards \nHow come you're so smooth on  a bike? \nI'll  be  honest with you, it started from my  kid  motocross days and it \njust carried over. When I was motocrossing, David Bailey was god to \n\nTHERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY AROUND A RACETRACK TOM \nme, he was my  childhood hero and is still one of my  heroes to this day. \nHe  was obviously the smoothest guy out there, and like any tennis \nplayer or  golf player or  whatever, when you're comin’ up,  you want to \nemulate their style or  their swing, and that’s basically what happened. \nI saw what Bailey was doin’ and just tried to  emulate him, he  was \nsuper smooth and that’s what I aimed for.  I knew that being smooth, \nthe  less out  of control you were, the  more you kept it off  the  ground \nand so  the  faster you could go.  I learned it from a  young age, to  keep \neverything under control, and that kinda carried over to  roadracing. \nDo you  ever get ragged? \nYou know, ragged to  me  would just be a  small moment for Troy! What \nI consider ragged, you probably wouldn’t even be  able to  see  on  TV. \nAlthough I’d  feel it,  I’d  correct it  before anybody even knew what \nhappened. That’s the  way I’ve  learned the  game. \nTroy reckons you  really hang over the front \nThat wasn’t something that was built into me. When I was at  Yamaha \nI had what I’d  say  was a  neutral riding style, that’s the  way it looks \nwhen I watch tapes from yesteryear. Whereas as  soon as  I got  with \nHonda, \nthe \nonly \nway \nI \ncould \nturn \nthe \nsonofabitch \nwas \nto \nput \neverything \nI \nhad \non \nthe \nfront \nof \nthe \nthing, \nyou \nknow. \nThat’s \nbeen \na \nHonda \ncharacter \nforever, \nif \nyou \nlook \nat \nthe \nway \nMick \n[Doohan] \nused \nto \nplough \nthe \nfront, \nit’s just Honda understeer. \nWhat's it like following Troy? \nYou \nknow, \nwhen \nI \nfollow \nTroy \nthere’s \nso  \nmuch \nshit \ngoin’ \non,  \nthat’s \nthe \nonly \nthing \nI \ncan \nsay! \nAnd \nhalf \nof \nit \nis \nhis  \nsparky \ntoe  \nscrapers. \nI \nthought \nsparky \nthings \nwere \nillegal, \nI \ndon’t \nknow, \nbut \nthat \nobviously \nbugs \nthe \nshit \nout \nof \nme, \nyou \njust \nthink \nhe’s \ngonna \ncrash \nevery \nother \ncorner \nwhen \nhe’s \ngot \nsparks \ncoming \noff. \nThe \nknee \npucks \nthat \nI \nuse \nare \nleather \nand \nevery \ntime \nI \ntouch \nthem \ndown \nit’s \na \nlittle \npuff \nof \nsmoke, \nso \npeople \nthink \nmy \nbikes \nblowin’ \nup \nor \nsome \nshit. \nIt \nsmells \nlike \nass \nwhen \nyou're \nfollowing \nme \nbecause \nit’s \nburnin’ \nleather! \nWhenever \nI \nfollow \nTroy \nit’s  \nentertaining, \nthat’s \nfor  \nsure, \nthough \nit’s \nnot \nas \nentertaining \nas \nfollowing \nHaga! \nTroy \nstays \non \nhis \nlines \nbut \nhe \nalways \nasks \na \nlot \nfrom \nthe \nbike, \nhe’s \nconstantly \nasking \nfor \nthat \nnext \nlittle \ninch \nand \nthe \nthing’s \ngettin’ \nsideways \nand \njumpin’ \nand \nwrigglin’. \nI \n\n192 THE FAST STUFF \nthink a lot of that’s the difference between Ducati and Honda. Whereas \nI know where the  edge is with the  Honda, I think the  Ducati is maybe \nmore grey in that area. Just from watching him, it looks like  the Ducati \n‘Following Troy is \nentertaining, he’s \nconstantly asking for \nthat next little inch \nand the  thing’s \ngettin’ sideways and \njumpin’ and \nwrigglin’ \nis either hooked in or  it’s  not; everything feels right, \nyou go  to  hit  it and next thing it might snap itself a \nlittle sideways. Whereas with the Honda, it’ll step \nout an  inch but before it even snaps real sideways \nyou can  control it. \nTroy is ragged, but are  his lines consistent? \nYou don’t win all those races without being consistent! \nHe’s definitely consistent when I follow him, you \nknow, hitting the same spot, the same couple of \ninches every lap, he  just goes about it  differently. \nSometime he  might out-brake himself or  he  might \nbrake a little bit  early but  he  always manages to hit  around the  same \narea into the  turn. It’s  just something you ride with, you just follow \nand watch what’s happening. \nDo you  ever get wary of him? \nAt times, though not  necessarily when he’s alone, just when I’ve gotten \nbehind him when him and Haga have been touchin’ and bumpin’ and \nkickin’ the  shit out  of each other, that’s when you get a little bit wary \nof being really close because one of them might go  down or  whatever. \nBut  when he’s on  his  own, no,  nothing really throws you out  to  chop \nthe  throttle or  anything. \nAre  there advantages and disadvantages to your different styles? \nEarlier in the  year, with Troy’s style, he was in the  corner and out  of it \nbefore I’d  even got my  thing tipped in.  I think he’s really aggressive on \ndigging the  front and getting the  thing fully flexed and turned, then \nstood upright out  of the  turn, while I’m  running wide on  the  corner. \nWhereas when I got  more horsepower after the  Eight Hours in July I \ndidn’t have to carry the  absolute limit of corner speed and. run  wide, so \nI could afford to  get in a little bit like  him —  dig it in and go. \nHe steers his thing hard... \nHell, you can see  him, sometimes his  position on  the  bike is so  funny \n\nTHERE’S \nMORE \nTHAN \nONE \nWAY \nAROUND \nA  \nRACETRACK \n193 \nthat \nyou \nknow \nhe’s \njust \nwrenching \nthe  \nshit \nout  \nof \nthe  \n‘bars \nto  \nget  \nthe \nthing \nover, \nthat’s \njust \nTroy’s \nstyle. \nI’d \nalmost \nsay \nit’s \na \nbit \nlike \nFogarty’s \n—rough \non \nthe \nbike \nand \nwrestling \nit. \nI \nmean \nyou \nreally \nsee \nit, \nyou \nknow, \nwhereas \nwhenever \nI \nsee \nmyself \non \nTV \nI \njust \nlook \nlike \na \nslow \nfucker. \nIt’s \nlike \n‘man, \ncouldn’t \nI \nwork \njust \na \nlittle \nbit?’, \nbut \nthat’s \nwhen \nI \ngo \nmy \nfastest. \nSo do you  think it’s the Ducati that dictates his style? \nYeah, you could say maybe it’s the Ducati that made Fogarty and Bayliss \nride like  that, but  then you  look at  [Troy] Corser, he obviously made the \nthing ride good. I would say if there’s anybody out  there with a similar \nstyle to  mine it’s  Corser —  never really out  of shape, keeps the  thing in \nline, and goes white line to white line. It’s just different techniques and \nobviously he  made the  Ducati work really well. I mean, it might be  a \ncharacteristic of the  bike, but  I think a lot  of it is in Troy’s ridin’. \nWhat did you  learn from Troy this year? \nThe thing I learned with Troy is that you never ever give in.  It doesn’t \nmatter if you've got five, six or  seven seconds on  him, the  guy just does \nnot stop. I know a lot  of riders out  there, and I'll  agree I was one of \nthem, who when somebody pulled out  five or  six  seconds on  me, well \nshit, I’ve only got  six  laps left, I’m  not  going to make up a  second a lap, \nso  you Settle for the  position you’ve got and you take it home. Whereas \nTroy.... [Edwards adopts slow-paced, deep-toned voice like a trailer for \na horror movie] doesn’t... believe... in that... he’s just flat-out from go \nto  stop. At  times when you think it might be an  easy win you still gotta \nride your ass  off just to  keep the  gap. With Troy you can’t even allow \nthe gap to  come down two or  three tenths a  lap, instead of  almost \ncruisin’ to  the  finish. \nI'll  be  honest with you, I’ve never raced against anyone like him. I \nmean he’s awesome —  as  a  rider he’s awesome and his mental \ndetermination is  awesome. He  wants to  win, sure we  all  do,  but the \nthing I learned from him is that when I get  out  front I’m  going, I keep \nthe lap times going, until I know it’s  two laps from the  end and I’ve  got \nfive or  six  seconds, so  I can afford to  catch my  breath and go  on  to \nwin the  thing. It  used to  be  the  last five or  six  laps, whoever was a \nfew seconds back would ease off  a  little bit  or  whatever, but not \nwith Troy. \n\n194 THE FAST STUFF \nTroy Bayliss \nWhy do you  ride the way you  do? \nA lot of guys ride quite similar and then there’s guys that stand out  and \nhave got their own styles, there’s plenty of them about. When you first \nstart roadracing you hop on  the  bike and whatever makes it go where \nand when and how you want it to  go is what works. You come up with \nyour own little ideas, and it just happens like it happens. \nHave you  always ridden aggressively? \nYep, I’ve always had the same sort of  style. For sure I used to  be \nmore ragged [laughs]. I look quite a bit smoother than I used to, though \neven now I  look like I  put a  lot  of  physical effort into it  and I \nactually do. \nSo when did you  change from super ragged to smooth ragged? \nI think 2001 was the only time it settled down a bit.  When I was racing \nin England a few years back I started to get a little bit more smooth, but \nwhen I first came on  board of Ducati to have a go in World Superbike I \nwas pretty... I don’t know about ragged... but very physical on  the \nbike. In  2000 I was trying to  get  the  Ducati job  for  2001 and I didn’t \nknow the  bike or  anything very well; I was riding Michelin for the  first \ntime, everything was new, and I had to  try and get  myself a job. But I \nthink I’ve settled down a little bit  since. \nWere you  aggressive as a club racer? \nFor  sure, they used to  call  me  ‘the can  opener’! When I did  club races \nbefore I got into national events we  used to do, like 10 or  12 races a day, \nso  it was always the  same guys in  the same races, and the  first and \nsecond corners were always absolutely crazy. I used to ride a KR-1 and \nwe  were riding in Formula Two, up  against 600 Supersports and stuff, \nall  sorts of different bikes, so  it was quite funny. It’s  a  good place to \nstart, that’s for  sure. \nIs aggression what it’s all about? . \nThe bikes are  getting so  fast and so  powerful that to  get the  last  bit out \nof them you've got  to  put  a  lot of physical input into them. Like when \nyou do loads and loads of laps on a test day you really feel it.  Over the \nlast  years Superbikes have become much more fast, but  they’re already \n\nTHERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY AROUND A RACETRACK 195 \nvery close to the  500  and MotoGP times, so  I can’t see  them getting too \nmuch faster. I think physical fitness really does play a part —  it definitely \ndoes for  me. If I wasn’t fit and feeling good I wouldn’t be  able to  ride \nlike I do, I have to be able to really muscle the bike around. \nI have the bike quite flat, the  geometry’s not  like very steep. Ruben’s \nand Ben’s [Xaus and Bostrom, Bayliss’ factory Ducati team-mates] \nbikes are  set  up  so  steep that I can’t ride them, but them guys are \nbigger and stronger than me, anyway. I ride the  bike like a  chopper, \ntype of thing, that’s just how I like to ride it, so  yeah, I have to work it \nover! I don’t feel comfortable with a  steep set-up, it’s  just how you're \nbrought into it, people want their bikes certain ways. \nLearning your way on  proddie bikes must've influenced your style. \nAfter the  KR1 I did  600 Supersports. I can  see  that guys who started in \n250 production and then went to  250 GP  bikes went in  a  different \ndirection, so  for  sure they'll ride different. I’m  used to  sponges, that’s \njust how it is. \nDoes your style ever  cost you  time? \nThere’s some places where I suffer a bit for it, but  I don’t like  to change \nthe  bike too  much, because it’s  hard to  get  comfortable again. Once \nyou're \nto \nthe \nlimit \nof \na \nmotorcycle, \nit’s \nhard \nto \nchange \nit, \nthen \nfind \nthe \nlimit \nwith \na \ncompletely \ndifferent \nset-up, \nso \nI \ndon’t \nsteer \ntoo \nfar \naway \nfrom what I've got. \nAt which tracks do you suffer? \nAssen \nwas \na \nbit \ndifficult \nfor \nme \n— \nthere’s \na \nlot \nof \nchanges \nof \ndirection \nwhen you're hard on  the  throttle. \nIs \nthere \nalso \nan  \nelement \nof \njoy \nin \nyour \nriding \nstyle? \nYeah, \nfor \nsure, \nwhen \nthings \nare  \nworking \ngood, \nI \nlove \nriding \nthe  \nbike. \nIt’s \nnot  \nfun  \nall  \nthe  \ntime, \nsometimes \nit’s  \na  \ndrag \nwhen \nyou're \nstruggling, \nbut \nwhen \nyou \nget \nto \nthrash \nsomething \naround \nthat’s \nthe \nbest \nyou \ncan \nget \nand \nit’s  \nnot  \nyours, \nit’s  \nquite \nnice, \nit’s  \na  \nball! \nDoes \nyour \nstyle \nhelp \nwith \nintimidating \nother \nriders? \nI’ve \nnever \nhad \nanybody \ncome \nup \nand \ntell \nme \nthey’ve \ngot \na \nproblem \nwith \nmy \nriding. \nBut \nmaybe \nyou \ncould \nrun \ninto \na \nhairpin \ncorner \nby \n\n196 THE FAST STUFF \nsomeone, pull the  clutch in  and just hold it on  the  stop, that’d scare \nthem more! [laughs] \nHave you  ever  tried smoothing out your riding? \nThere’s some places you do have to change your style. The biggest place \nI’ve  had to  do  that is Daytona. You've really got to  get off the  bike and \nkeep it a bit upright because you've got a very hard rear tyre and you’ve \ngot  to  do  a  lot  of laps on  it.  There’s no  grip there, so  you've got  to  try \nand get the  bike up,  so  I did  change my  style a little bit  there. \nAlso, every now and then I hang off the  inside of the bike a bit more, \nto  try and pick it up  a bit, because when once you're hanging over the \nbike and you’re at full lean there’s very little grip there when you try to \nopen the  throttle. Mick Doohan used to hunch right over too, though I \nnever tried to  copy him, it’s just the way I was. \nDo you  think the fans prefer your style? \nI guess if you’re very smooth it can look a little bit  dull, whereas I’m \nfighting with the  bike and I’m very active on  the  bike, so  I guess it \nmakes good watching. Some people get really excited about it and some \npeople who know me, they know I’m a pretty tame sort of a  guy, then \nthey seem me  riding the bike and they can’t watch me  [more laughter] \nbecause they think I’m  going to  crash. That’s quite strange, so  yeah, I \nget  funny reactions. \nDo you  let out  an  explosion of aggression when you jump on  the bike? \nI’m  pretty laid back off the  bike but  I’ve always been aggressive on  the \nbike. When I hop on  the  bike it’s  like another me, well, not another \nme... I don’t feel like  I’m  riding crazy, I don’t even feel like  I’m  so  active \non  the  bike, I feel totally in  control and I actually feel smooth at  the \nmoment, smoother than I’ve  ever done. So I must’ve been pretty ragged \na  few years ago! \nWhat do you  do for the wet? \nI just slow down quite a  lot,  that’s about it!  But the  tyres are  comin’ a \nlot better than they used to be and some of the  tracks are  pretty grippy \nnow. I learned my wet-weather riding when I was racing in England. I \nwasn’t fast  in the  rain when I moved there but  I done quite a lot of wet \nriding in  BSB [British Superbike], plus Michelin have got  really good \n\nMotoGP \nTECHNOLOGY: \nTHE \nWRITING’S \nON  \nTHE \nWALL \n197 \nwet \nweather \ntyres \nnow. \nEventually \nit \nclicks \nwith \nriding \nin  \nthe  \nrain, \nso \nnow \nI \ndon’t \nmind \nriding \nin \nthe \nwet \nat \nall. \nWho rides like you  in MotoGP? \nMaybe \nCapirossi, \nhe \nreally \ngives \nit \na \nhard \ngo. \nAnd \nRossi \ndoes \nas \nwell, \nhe \ngets \non \nit, \nhe’s \nalways \ngot \nit \nbackin’ \nin \nand \njumpin’ \naround. \nHow do you  compare your style to Edwards? \nYeah, we're quite a  lot  different aren’t we  [laughs]! I like watching \nColin on  the  bike, he can  slide it out. He  definitely looks more smooth \nthan me  but I like his  style. It’s  a  good style, he  hangs right over the \nfront doesn’t he? I still learn stuff but  I think Colin learned a bit  from \nme  this year, he learned not  to give up so much, so he was really hookin’ \ninto it those last  races. \nMotoGP Mutterings: December 2002 \nLess is  more, they say, so  does more technology mean less \nexciting racing? And if so,  should upcoming MotoGP technology \nbe banned? \nThe first season of MotoGP wasn’t so  bad. Okay, so  Rossi won a few too \nmany races, but  the  action got  tighter as  things went on,  not  the  other \nway around, which bodes well for  next season when the  grid will be \nrammed with four-strokes —  Ducati and Proton joining Aprilia, Honda, \nYamaha, Suzuki and Kawasaki. \nWhat makes the  four-strokes fun to  watch is  the  sideways corner- \nentry chaos, with the  hottest guys cheerfully backing into turns like \nthey're riding single-pot trail bikes on  the dirt, not slick-shod 220 \nhorsepower racers on  asphalt. The quickest MotoGP bikes are  pretty \nwild out  of turns too, those big 990cc motors burning more rubber than \nthe  500s ever did. Which is all  good —  we  want to  see  riders wrestling \nto  stay in control, it’s  what racing’s all about. But  for  how long will this \nkind of madness go on? Not  much longer if progress has  anything to do \nwith it. \nGP  \nracing \nis \nnow \nentering \nan  \nera  \nof \nspace-age \nracetrack \ntechnology, \nfuelled \nby \nmega-money \nfactory \nMotoGP \nbudgets, \nin \nwhich \ncomputer \nsoftware \nrules. \nIn  \nfact, \nthe  \nthin \nedge \nof  \nthe  \nhi-tech \nwedge \nis  \nalready \n\n198 THE FAST STUFF \nvisible, or  in this case, invisible. How often have you seen Carlos Checa \ngetting all crossed-up into turns on  his Yamaha M1? Never, because the \nM1 uses a  computer-controlled engine-braking system which keeps \neverything nicely under control on  the  way into corners. And Honda \nand the  rest have got  to  be working on  their own versions of the  M1 \nsystem, so  pretty soon everyone will be  cruising into turns all neat ‘n’ \ntidy. And, as  traction control gets better, they'll all  be  cruising out of \nturns all neat ‘n’  pretty too  —  none of that oh-so-scary sideways action. \nOkay, so  maybe the future holds less highsidin’, tankslappin’ TV fun, \nbut  at  least racing should get  closer, just because all  the  bikes are  so \ngood. In  fact the  opposite tends to  happen —  witness the  ‘racing’ joke \nthat is Fl  cars, where the  pit-lane computer geek has long been king, \nand technology overkill long ago replaced the  concept of actual racing \nas  entertainment. The problem is that overtaking gets too  difficult once \nthere are  no  bad bikes out there. Ever-improving \nbraking systems have the same effect, because the \n‘Nowadays everyone shorter the  braking zone, the less room for passing. \nbrakes about the Things were different when bikes were less \nsame damn place, advanced and machine set-up was more of a hit-and- \nleans into the corner miss affair; weird shit happened in  races because \nthe same place and riders could make the difference, overcoming a \ngoes around the settings cock-up or  an  equipment deficiency with \ncorner at the same some inspired heroics. And when tracks were more \nspeed’ dangerous, a brave rider (or a fool, you decide) could \nmake a  winning difference through a lethal corner, \nthrough which his more sensible rivals might \ncrucially back off.  There’s not  so  much call  for  that any more —  all  GP \ntracks are pretty much as  safe as  they can get, no  one backs off \nanywhere, everyone rides the ragged edge through each and every \ncorner. You only need check GP  qualifying times —  these days it’s  rare \nfor  the  top ten  to be separated by more than a second —  to  see  the  scale \nof equality. \n‘Nowadays everyone brakes about the  same damn place, leans into \nthe corner the same place and goes around the corner at  the same \nspeed; some guys just do  it a little bit  better than others,’ says former \n500  champ King Kenny Roberts. \nPerhaps the  only way out  of this loop is to restrict technology and (I \ndon’t really mean this) host GPs at  faster, more dangerous racetracks. \n\nMotoGP TECHNOLOGY: THE WRITING’S ON  THE WALL _ 199 \nBut how would you keep the  bikes nice and out  of control? You can’t \nreally specify stuff like chassis with hinges in  the  middle; well, you \ncould... No, the  bad stuff is  electronics, so  bad that even the  riders \ndon’t want their bikes running fly-by-wire. ‘Already in  F1  the  driver \ndoesn’t even shift gear,’ adds Rossi. ‘So  the  driver becomes very much \nless important. I’m a rider, so  I don’t want this.’ \nRoberts, however, believes that the Japanese factories, who effectively \nrun world-level racing though the MSMA (Motorcycle Sports \nManufacturers’ Association), won’t do anything about keeping \ntechnology under control. ‘No one’s thinking about this kind of stuff \nand I’d  imagine that in  three years’ time people will be  saying the \nracing’s boring,’ he  adds. \nGloomy stuff for  armchair race fans. But perhaps I’m missing the \nwhole point —  future technology will make sportsbikes so  user-friendly \n—  with ABS, traction control and computerised engine braking —  that \nyou'll even be able to  ride pissed. The future is indeed bright. \nEpilogue: I hate to  say  I told you so,  but... \n\nCHAPTER 29 \nTHE TALE OF \nSLIDE \nMarch 2003 \nIt’s  the flashest trick in the  book and the riders who are  best at \nit are  the  riders that win races. This is the history of rear-wheel \nsteering and the masters of slide, before traction control came \nalong and spoiled everything \nIn  the  good old  days, when men were men and a fast 500 GP  bike \nrattled out, ooh, at  least 50  horsepower, the fastest way around a \nracetrack was knees tucked in, wheels in line, chin rattling on  the  gas \ntank. But  time moves on.  With more than two hundred horses kicking \nthrough the  rear tyre, wheelspin is  something you've got  to  live  with, \nso  you'd better use  it to your advantage. \nThe number-one reason that racers spin the  rear is  to  steer out  of \nturns. Getting sideways points the  front end back towards the  corner’s \ninside, tightening the  rider’s line, giving him more room to  get  on  the \ngas, which means more speed down the  next straight. It’s  like using \nthe  handbrake in a car, except you're breaking traction with throttle, \nnot  brake, and you're doing it to  go faster, not  slower. \nRear-wheel steering came from US  dirt track. American racers used \nto  start their careers riding ovals and then roadrace, and having grown \nup  sideways it was only natural they’d be  the  same on  tarmac. King \nKenny Roberts was the first serious back-end boy and his  success \nencouraged a  whole generation of bad-ass American and Aussie dirt \ntrackers to go GP racing. Also, it just so  happened that 1980s 500s were \nkicking out  way more power than their tyres and chassis could handle, \nso  there was only one  way to  subdue them: kick ’em sideways with big \nfistfuls of throttle and slingshot out  of the  turn. \nRoberts, Spencer, Lawson, Gardner, Rainey, Schwantz and Doohan \nall  ruled GPs after starting out  on  the  dirt. But during Doohan’s mid- \n1990s reign, chassis and tyre technology improved so  that tarmac- \n\nTHE TALE OF  SLIDE 201 \nfixated \nEuropeans \ncould \nride \n500s \nlike  \n250s, \nusing \ncorner \nspeed \nrather \nthan \nsideways \nexits. \nGuys \nlike \nValentino \nRossi \nwent \ndirt-track \ntraining \nanyway, \ngaining \nthemselves \na \ncrucial \nedge. \nAnd \nthen \nalong \ncame \nex-speedway \nnutter \nGarry \nMcCoy, \nushering \nin \na \nnew \nage \nof \nslide \nduring \n1999 \nand \n2000. \nKing Kenny Roberts: first man sideways \nKenny Roberts never felt  right on  a  roadracer until he  started sliding. \nLike other dirt trackers, sideways was what he  knew best, things felt \nsafer and more comfortable that way. \n‘It  was Ontario Motor Speedway in  ’72, I think,’ \nrecalls King Kenny, 500 champ in  1978, ’79  and ’80. \n‘I'd  just started dragging my  knee, and that helped \nme  feel the  bike slide. Then I started setting it  up \nthrough the turns for the  slide, that’s when everyone \nwent “you're crazy, you’re nuts”, that’s when it all \nstarted. If  I hadn’t been a dirt tracker, I wouldn't \nhave done it, wouldn’t have had the  feel, wouldn’t \n‘I started setting it \nup  through the  turns \nfor the slide, that’s \nwhen everyone went \n“you're crazy, you're \nnuts”, that’s when it \nall started’ \nhave known what I was looking for. \n‘T went to  Imola that year and I put it on  Giacomo \nAgostini pretty bad, even though he was 13  time world champion and \nI’d never seen the  place before. I could find the  limit, while Ago was a \nline racer, so  it was much harder for him to define the limit. If you  gave \nhim eight days of  practice he  could ease up  on  it  but otherwise I’d \nsmoke him.’ \nRoberts believes that spinning the  rear is an  essential weapon, not \nonly for  steering but  also because it allows more feel. \n‘You do it so you  don’t need to ride the line. You  can  start sliding it and \nthat points you in  the  right direction, plus, when it starts to  slide, you \nknow exactly how much traction you have and where your traction limit \nis. That’s Biaggi’s problem; he rides 500s like  they’re 250s, so  he feels the \nlimit with the  front tyre, and when you  find the  limit with the  front, it’s \nanother \nthing \nto \nsave \nit. \nSliding \ntakes \nthe \nfront \nout \nof \nthe \nequation.’ \nThere’s \ncorners \non  \nevery \nracetrack \nwhere \nthe  \nability \nto  \nslide \nis \ntotally \ncrucial. \nRoberts \ncites \nDaytona, \nwhere \nriders \ncome \non  \nto  \nthe  \nbanking, \ngiving \nfull \ngas \nfor \nthe \nall-important \n190mph \nblast \nto \nthe \nfinish \nline \nand \ntrying \nto \nmiss \nthe \nwall. \n‘You'd \nbe \npointing \nthe \nbike \nup \nthe \nbanking, \ngoin’ \nlike \nhell \nand \ngoin’ \ntoo \nfast \nto \nmake \nit, \njust \nby \nusing \nlean. \nSo \nyou'd \n\n202 THE FAST STUFF \naim at  the  wall, then lean it over at  the  last moment to break traction, \nthe  bike would kick sideways and away you went. If you didn’t you’d \nhave to nick it back on  the  throttle and that lap was gone.’ \nAlthough the  aim is  always the  same, other racers have their own \nway of getting sideways and Roberts knows the  differences better than \nanyone, having watched trackside since the  mid-1980s. \n‘It depends on  the  rider and the bike. If you’ve not  got the  power, you \ncan  do it with lean angle —  lay the thing over so it breaks traction. Doohan \ndid  it like that —  he’d exit the  corner a little too  fast, lean a little more, \nthen give it more gas  so  the  tyre would light up  and fix his  line. McCoy \nis  a  little different from Mick, he  sets it up  with a  lot  more rpm, he’s \nslower mid-corner, sets  it up a little earlier, then gases the hell out  of it.’ \nDespite tyre and chassis improvements, Roberts insists dirt track is \nessential training for  anyone aiming at  a  premier-class crown. ‘Alex \nCrivillé wouldn’t have been champ in  1999 if he hadn’t gone to my dirt- \ntrack school’ —  Alex said so  himself. Guys like McCoy obviously know \nhow to  do it and Rossi messed around doing dirt track when he was a \nkid. He  still does some on  his  XR650, he knows how to  do it.’ \nWayne Rainey: sideways is as  normal as  going straight \nLike all  the greatest rear-wheel steerers Wayne Rainey learned his \nracing craft as  a  child. Sliding and throttle control were nurtured into \nhim from the  earliest of ages. \n‘As  a kid, being sideways was as  normal as  riding in a straight line,’ \nsays Rainey, who emulated mentor Kenny Roberts with a  500  title hat \ntrick in 1990, ’91  and “92.  ‘When I started roadracing in the early 1980s, \nI didn’t know if it was right or wrong but it was what I felt  comfortable \nwith. If  the  tyre wasn’t spinning and the  bike turning, I didn’t feel \nright. I liked it spinning because it gives you a  safety buffer, you kinda \nknow where you can  go with it. \n‘In  fact, sliding is  the  easy part, the  difficult part is front-tyre feel. \nThe key to  my  riding style was getting through that area really quick, \ngetting the front tyre out of  the  way so  I could get  on  the throttle. \nWhen you brake and flick, it’s  all front tyre, which is kinda risky. \n‘The advantage rear-wheel steering gave me  was huge. And it’s just the \nsame now —  watch Rossi, he’s getting a bit sideways now. It’s  great when \nyou've \na \nlot \nof \ngrip \nbecause \nyou \ncan \nuse \nmore \nthrottle \nthan \nthe \nother \nguys, \nand  when the grip starts to fade, you  know where the traction is. \n\nTHE TALE OF  SLIDE 203 \n‘To  me  the  throttle was everything. But  when you're doing this  you're \ntalking very small changes in throttle opening because you're at the limit \nof everything —  throttle position, chassis flex, tyre flex, you're feeling all \nthat stuff. Spinning the rear relieves pressure on  the tyre, relieves pressure \non the suspension and that widens the safety area. But you're only spinning \nto  keep the bike turning, just to keep it on  track. There’s no  performance \nadvantage in spinning like speedway. I think McCoy will get better at  it, \nhe'll know where to spin and where not  to spin, whereas now he spins too \nmuch. Most of the  time you don’t want the  tyre to  spin much at  all, you \nwant it to drive maximum, you're always focused on  drive.’ \nBut there are  times when getting truly, madly, deeply sideways does \nhave its uses. ‘I used to do it just to piss off the guys behind me  because \nthey couldn’t do it. It was just intimidation.’ \nRainey reckons that rear-wheel steering will always be  around \nbecause traction control won't work in bikes (but time has  proved him \nwrong). ‘The tyre contact patch is so  small in bikes and that’s what you \nrely on. You need to  control that contact patch, you don’t want a \ncomputer controlling what the  tyres are  going to  do because they’re so \nmuch less forgiving than in a car,  and on  a bike you're always changing \nlean angle and so  on.  Plus, in a car  you spin, but  a bike throws ya.’ \nMick Doohan: oversteer, understeer, wobbling free \nMany fans will always remember Mick Doohan for his  artful, crossed-up \ncorner exits, etching arcs of molten rubber on racetracks around the world. \nBut  The Mighty One insists he wasn’t a  total rear-wheel steerer. In fact  it \nwas his  input during the 1990s that brought emphasis back to  the  front \ntyre, and the Aussie’s deadliest weapon was always high corner speed. \n‘My first roadrace stuff was production racing and when the  bike \nstarted to break traction, I found it was quicker to keep it sliding rather \nthan not  keep it sliding. After dirt track, I’d  tip the bike into a turn and \nexpect it to  go  sideways, so  it wasn’t a  problem when it did. \n‘Then \nwhen \nI \nfirst \nstarted \n500s, \nthe  \nHonda’s \nengine \nwas \npretty \nwild, \nso \nthe \nfastest \nway \nout \nof \na \nturn \nwas \na \nbit \nsideways, \nrather \nthan \nrunning \nout \nof \nracetrack. \nBut \nonce \nthe \ntyres \ngot \nbetter, \nthe \nquickest \nway \nwas \nto \nkeep \nthe \nbike \nin \nline. \nYou’d \nonly \nstart \nsliding \nand \nspinning \nit \nup \nMahe \ntyres \nwere \ngoing \naway. \nWhen \nit \ncomes \ndown \nto \nit, \nthe \nreality \nis \nthat \nsideways \nisn’t \nquickest, \nand \nI \nwanted \nto \nwin \nraces, \nnot \nlook \ngood, \nso \nI \nonly \nused \nit \nwhen \nI \nhad \nto. \n\n204 THE FAST STUFF \n‘Sure, a little bit of oversteer helps the  bike steer and it’s  also good if \nyou're running out  of racetrack, though I always found rear brake to be \na  better tool to  stop understeer. Also, having the  rear spinning feels \nsafer, rather than having the  tyre on  an  edge where you don’t know \nwhen it’s  going to break loose.’ \nThe five-time champ reckons he was more of a drifter than a serious \nsideways merchant. ‘I was more into the drifting slides, rather than the \nactual “get in,  turn it and wheelspin it out” stuff. I was always into \ncorner speed, so  a lot of my slides came from that —  the bike would start \nto  drift and I’d just keep it drifting, laying black lines from lean angle. \n‘If you’ve got  great grip, there’s no  need to  slide around and get  the \nbike unsettled. But once the  tyres start losing grip, the  momentum \nyou're carrying through a  turn makes them drift, and other than \nslowing your corner speed by  shutting the throttle, which will slow \nyour lap  times, you start slowly feeding in  the  power to  take some \nweight off  the  front, which keeps the  rear sliding and also introduces \nsome wheelspin. So  you keep that going, but not to  a  degree where \nyou're completely sideways, sitting there spinning and burning rubber, \nlooking fantastic but  not  going forward.’ \nDespite his  insistence that McCoy’s fully sideways antics aren’t the \nway forward, Doohan agrees with Roberts that mastery of the  rear is \nvital. ‘If  you’re confident enough to  slide when the  bike or  the  tyres \naren’t working at  their optimum, then you’ve got  an  advantage. A lot \nof guys can  slide the rear when they've got good grip but when the  tyre \nloses its  edge they don’t know the  limit. You’ve got  to  have the  feel to \nride the tyre and use  throttle control to  spin it up just enough, so  you’re \ngoing forward, not  just smokin’ rubber.’ \nGarry McCoy: there’s sideways, and then there’s sideways \nSerious sideways antics seemed to  have disappeared from 500 racing \nuntil Garry McCoy came along in  late 1999. The ex-speedway rider \nfound that the only way he  could ride his  YZR500 was oval-style, \noversteering like crazy, smokin’ the  rear like a  bastard. So  much so \nMcCoy has  choked rivals on  the  fumes. ; \n‘We went testing at  Estoril and Noriyuki Haga hadn’t been there \nbefore so  I said he  could tuck in  behind me,’ recalls McCoy with a \nmischievous chuckle. ‘I  gave him a little wave to  say  “come on,  let’s \ngo”, \nthen \ndid \ntwo \nor \nthree \nlaps, \nlooked \nback \nand \nhe \nwasn’t \nthere. \nBack \n\nTHE TALE OF  SLIDE 205 \nin \nthe  \npits \nI \nasked \nhim \nif \nhe’d \nfollowed \nme. \n“No,” \nhe  \nsaid. \n“I \nneed \ngas \nmask \n— \ntoo \nmuch \nrubber \nsmoke!” \nMcCoy's rear-end slides aren’t subtle like Micky D’s, they’re wild and \nglorious and they seem to  work. ‘With speedway, you're sideways all \nthe way in, just washing off  speed, you don’t even touch the  throttle \nuntil halfway though a turn. You start off at half throttle and just play \nwith it from there, it’s  a  feel and experience thing. In  roadracing it’s \ndifferent at every track, at  every corner and sometimes from one  lap to \nthe  next. It depends on  the  type of turn, whether you’re alone or  with \nother riders, all that kind of stuff.’ \nDespite the extremity of  McCoy’s slides, he  initiates them like \nDoohan, with corner speed rather than throttle. ‘It  starts when you're \ncarrying a lot  of corner speed and the  rear starts washing out. The real \nbuzz is  getting the rear loose as  I back it  into the turn, keeping it \nsideways all  the  way through and all  the  way out. But I never —  and I \nknow I shouldn’t say this —  feel  out  of control with the rear. If I’m  going \nto  crash I always feel like I’m  gonna crash with the  front.’ \nMcCoy’s antics do indeed look crazy —  especially in 2003 when he was \nracing Kawasaki's MotoGP bike on  Dunlops —  but  there’s a method in his \nmadness. ‘Once the  rear is loose I spin it up  to  help get  the  bike turned \nand then I can also adjust my  corner exit line with the  throttle. If I’m \ngoing to run wide, I give it more throttle, if  I want to  go wider, I use  less \nthrottle. I use  it on  some turns more than others. If it’s  a corner followed \nby a long straight, I’ll want to  get more drive so  I don’t use  it so  much.’ \nMcCoy has  found that perfecting the  sideways art  isn’t just a matter \nof riding style —  bike set-up and tyre choice are  also crucial. ‘When I \nstarted riding the  500  it would spin up but we  didn’t have the  set-up to \nmake it work with spin. The rear will spin easier with a hard spring but \nyou don’t get  drive, so  we've just kept going progressively softer ever \nsince.’ \nMcCoy \nalso \nuses \ndifferent \nignition \nmapping \ncompared \nto \nfellow \nYamaha \n500 \nriders \nlike \nMax \nBiaggi, \nbecause \nhe \nlikes \na \nsharper \npower \ndelivery to  keep the  rear nice and loose. \nIntriguingly, \nMcCoy’s \nstyle \nmakes \nhis  \nrear \ntyre \nrun \ncooler \nthan \nhis \nrivals’, \nwhich \nmeans \nhe  \ncan \nrun \nmuch \nsofter \ncompounds, \nbut \nhow \ncan \nthis \nbe \nwhen \nhe \nappears \nto \nbe \ngiving \nhis  \nrear \nso  \nmuch \ngrief? \nIt’s  \nbecause \nthe \ntyre \nis \nspinning \nrather \nthan \ndigging \nin, \nso \nwhile \nsurface \ntemperature \nis \nhigher \nthan \nnormal, \nthere’s \nnot \nso \nmuch \nheat \ndriven \ninto \nthe \nall- \nimportant core of the  tyre. \n\nCHAPTER 30 \nHow DUCATI HUMBLED \nHAMAMATSU \nMarch 2003 \nThis is where Ducati’s MotoGP legend began -  during the winter \nof 2002/2003. Even back then it was obvious that the Bolognese \nhad what it takes to  beat the Japanese \nJerez IRTA tests, late February 2003: Suzuki MotoGP star  Kenny Roberts \nJunior is  standing outside the Ducati Marlboro Team pit, jealously \neyeing Troy Bayliss’ Desmosedici V4. ‘Looking at  that thing, you \nwouldn’t think it’d  go around a racetrack, but...’ his voice trails off and \nhe  shakes his  head in  disbelief. A few feet away Suzuki team-mate \nJohn Hopkins’ body language speaks of  similar envy, the young \nAmerican recounting how Bayliss had earlier rocketed past him on  the \nmain straight, like ‘they’ve got  a  Ferrari engine in there,’ and how the \nItalian V4 had drive, traction and bullet-like acceleration where Hopper’s \nJapanese V4 was all over the  shop. \nEven if Roberts isn’t moved by the  Duke’s swoopy, retro styling and \nits  ancient-looking steel chassis, everyone is  impressed by  the \nDesmosedici’s speed, and with good reason. Consider what this tiny \nItalian factory has done —  they’ve built their first proper race bike in \n30-odd years and are  bang on  the  pace, pretty much right out  of the \nbox. With no  changes to  engine architecture and no  major chassis \ntransformations they topped official pre-season testing, posting the \nfastest-ever top  speed recorded by a  racing motorcycle —  203.9mph at \nCatalunya, Spain. Compare this feat to  some of  their Japanese rivals: \nSuzuki, who have built a brand-new bike from the lessons learned from \na  full season in  MotoGP, but  are  still struggling to  find front-running \npace; or  Kawasaki, who have been racing their ZX-RR in various guises \nfor a full  year, but  are  even further behind; or  even Yamaha, who went \nthrough a  myriad of important engine and chassis alterations before \nthey got  their Ml up  to  speed. Honda, it  seems, are  the only other \n\nHow DvucaTI HUMBLED HAMAMATSU 207 \npeople who know how to  get  their concepts spot on  from the  drawing \nboard up. \nSo  why are Ducati so  good at  getting motorcycles to  go  around \nracetracks so  fast, so  quickly? Just  how are  they making some of their \nMotoGP rivals look just a little second rate? \nThe marque’s amazing run of  success in  World Superbike —  nine \nriders’ titles and 11  manufacturers’ crowns in a dozen years —  suggests \nthat the men from Bologna know what they’re doing. But  it was always \neasy to  attribute much of their Supers’ success to  the  WSB rule book, \nwhich gave 1000cc v-twins fundamental superiority over 750cc fours. \nAnd anyway, some people would argue that the Japanese have never \ntaken Superbikes that seriously, because, however futuristic Japan \nmight appear, it’s  also a temple to tradition, so  the  55-year-old GP  series \nalways takes precedence over the Johnny-come-lately Superbike series. \nThe Desmosedici V4  is fulsome proof that Ducati haven't just been \nenjoying the easy life  in  World Supers, it proves that they really do \nknow what they’re doing, better than just about anybody, whether \nthey’re building a  street-based racer or  a  full-on GP  prototype. ‘Ducati \nhave had the  best Superbike for many years, even though Honda were \ntrying very hard,’ says one  paddock insider, a technical partner to Ducati \nand several Japanese factories. ‘In  2002 I think the  998 was a better \nbike than the  Honda, the  only thing that lost them the  title was Troy’s \nAssen crash.’ \nDucati Corse boss Claudio Domenicali refutes any suggestion that \nHonda gave them an  easy run  in Supers. ‘Some of the Japanese factories \ndeveloped \nvery \nexotic \nSuperbikes. \nAlso, \nwe \nshare \nsome \ntechnical \nsuppliers \nwith \nthe \nJapanese, \nand \nthey \ntold \nus \nthat \nHonda \nwere \nspending \nmore \nmoney \nin \nSuperbike \nthan \nin \nGPs \nduring \nthe \nyears \nof \nthe \nRC45 project.’ \nMoney, \nof \ncourse, \nis \none \nof \nthe  \nbiggest \nfactors \nin \nachieving \nracetrack \nsuccess. \nBut \nwhile \nDucati \nare \na  \nmuch \nsmaller \nconcern \nthan \ntheir \nJapanese \nrivals, \nthey \ndon’t \nnecessarily \nsuffer \nfinancially. \nDucati \nCorse \nis \na \ntight-knit \nindependent \ncompany, \nwhich \nquite \nprobably \nutilises \nits \nbudget \nmore \neffectively \nthan \nsome \n_ \nsprawling, \nmany-headed \ncorporations. \n‘Our \nMotoGP \nproject \nis \nwell \nfunded,’ \nadds \nDomenicali, \nwho \nwon’t \nreveal \nthe \nMotoGP/Superbike \nsplit \nin \nDucati’s \n£20 \nmillion \nannual \nrace \nbudget. \n‘Thanks \nto \nthe \ncommitment \nof \nour \ncompany \nand \nof \nour \nsponsorship \npartners, \nwe've \nbeen \nable \nto \nfind \na \ngood \nbudget. \nFive \n\n208 THE FAST STUFF \nyears ago we  couldn’t have done this, because our  company was smaller, \nwe  were just in  the early stages of  our turnaround, and from an \nengineering point of view we  didn’t have enough experience to  tackle \nthe  MotoGP challenge.’ \nSo,  if booming sales of  the 916 and its  successors resolved what \nshould be  Ducati’s one major disadvantage against their Goliath-like \nrivals, what might be the  advantages of being small? In fact, smallness \nin itself is the  major bonus of being small. It means a  tight-knit team \nof engineers, short lines of communications and quick decision making. \nAnd since speed off  the  track is  vital for  speed on  the track, Ducati \nCorse have a very crucial advantage over the  corporate giants. \n‘If we  have a problem with something that we  don’t understand, we \nphone Loris (Capirossi) and he’s at  the  factory half an  hour later, and \nthe next day we  start designing a  new part,’ explains Ducati’s chief \nMotoGP engineer Corrado Cecchinelli. ‘I think the only other difference \nbetween us  and the  Japanese is that we  design the  bike and race the \nbike, while it looks to  me  that with them, maybe someone designs the \nbike and someone else races it.”  Domenicali adds: ‘With Ducati, the \nsame people who are  at  the  race on  Sunday are  back in  the  office on \nMonday, so  we  are  more like an  F1  car  team than a \nbike race team, which means we  can  be very quick in \n‘Ducati’s racing making improvements.’ \nphilosophy: This is the kind of thing that can  have a huge effect \nsimplicity, not on  a  rider’s state of  mind and his  results. Colin \ndaring too  much, Edwards has noticed a  big  difference since joining \nand doing what’s in Italian factory Aprilia at  the  end of 2002, after years \nour  tradition as  a  factory Honda and Yamaha Superbike rider. \nbecause we  know ‘With Aprilia, you ask  for  something and you've got \nwhat we're good at’ it. With HRC, you give them lots  of ideas, but  they’ve \ngot plenty of their own. It takes time to  filter in your \nown stuff, so  it might be three or  four months before \nyou get  something. With the  Japanese, everything seems to  take time, \nlike, the  Honda I had at  the  end of 2002 was the bike we  wanted at  the \nstart of 2001. With the  Italians it’s  more of a free for all.’ ) \nOf  \ncourse, \nthere’s \nmore \nto  \nDucati \nthan \nits  \nhumble \ndimensions. \nCecchinelli \ndescribes \nthe \nfactory’s \nbasic \nracing \nphilosophy \nthus: \n‘simplicity, \nnot \ndaring \ntoo  \nmuch, \nand \ndoing \nwhat’s \nin  \nour \ntradition \nbecause \nwe  \nknow \nwhat \nwe’re \ngood \nat  \nand \nwe  \nknow \nit \nworks.’ \nIn \nother \n\nHow DUCATI HUMBLED HAMAMATSU 209 \nwords, it’s  the old KISS principle —  ‘Keep It Simple, Stupid!’, beloved of \nJeremy Burgess, the  man who guided Valentino Rossi, Mick Doohan \nand Wayne Gardner to  premier-title glory. It’s  all  about assembling a \ngood crew of young and open-minded engineers who can work together, \nthen letting them get  on  with it, rather than making the  mistake that \nmany enterprises make these days —  trying too  hard and out-thinking \nthemselves, because they've failed to  understand the  basics of what’s \nrequired to achieve their goal. \nWhich explains why Ducati are  steadfastly sticking to  what they \nknow best. True, they had to  ditch plans to  build an  oval-pistoned \nv-twin MotoGP bike, because even a  super-trick twin wouldn’t make \nenough power, but they’re still flying in  the face of  conventional \nMotoGP wisdom with a desmodromic 90-degree V4 housed in a tubular- \nsteel frame. This is significant because no  one has  ever made a  success \nof doing things differently to the Japanese in the premier class. The last \nnon-Japanese factory to win in  500s was Cagiva, who achieved success \nby building a Yamaha YZR clone. And yet Aprilia have proved that you \ndon’t need to  slavishly copy the Japanese to beat them —  the little Noale \nfactory dominates the 250 world championship, using their unique \ndisc-valve 250  to  defeat Honda’s and Yamaha’s reed-valve bikes. \nIn  MotoGP Honda, Suzuki and Proton have all  gone for  much \nnarrower Vs  than Ducati —  60  to  75  degrees —  citing compactness as \ntheir motivation. And yet  the  90-degree Desmosedici motor looks tiny, \nmaybe even smaller than the  998/999 y-twin (though no  one  has  so  far \nmanaged to  infiltrate their MotoGP pit with a  tape measure). Ducati \nwere determined to  stick with their right-angled configuration because \nit keeps their MotoGP tool within the  Ducati tradition, which is why \nthey \nsometimes \ncheekily \nrefer \nto \nthe \nmotor \nas \ntheir \n‘super \ntwin’, \nAnyway, \nthe \n90-degree \nlayout \noffers \nintrinsic \nengine \nbalance, \nwhich \nmeans \nminimal \nvibration \nand \ngood \nmechanical \nefficiency, \ncrucial \nfactors in a motor that revs to  over 16,000rpm. \nDucati’s \nunique \ndesmodromic \nsystem \n—  \ncreated \nby \nfabled \nengineer \nFabio \nTaglioni \nway \nback \nin  \nthe \n1950s \n—  \nis  \nanother \nelement \nof  \ntheir \nheritage \nthat \nabsolutely \nhad \nto \nbe \na \npart \nof \nthe \nMotoGP \nbike. \nThe \nsystem \nuses \nrockers \nto \nclose \nas \nwell \nas \nopen \nthe \nvalves \nfor \nsuper-accurate \nvalve \noperation, \nwhatever \nthe \nrpm, \nand \nminimum \npower \nloss. \nStrange \nthat \nthe \nJapanese \nhave \nnever \nbuilt \ntheir \nown \ndesmo \nmotors, \nmost \nprobably \nbecause \nit \nwould \nbe \ntoo \nmuch \nof \na \nrip-off. \n\n210 THE FAST STUFF \nBut  it is in the  chassis department that Ducati have really gone their \nown way. While rivals stay faithful to  the  ubiquitous aluminium beam \nframe pioneered in  the  early 1980s by Yamaha’s 500  GP  bikes, Ducati \nprefer to  stick with an  apparently archaic concept —  welding together a \nfew lengths of tubular steel. Once again, it’s  a  tradition thing. ‘We are \nconfident with this kind of frame, it’s  our  tradition,’ says Cecchinelli. \n‘Plus it’s  light enough and it’s  stiff enough, so  why go with something \nelse? I’m  sure we’re better staying with what we  know.’ \nAlthough Ducati’s ultra-minimal steel frame looks old fashioned, \nthere’s plenty of evidence to  suggest that it might actually be  superior \nto  a chunky beam chassis. Stiffness is not  everything in bike racing — \nengineers want their frames to  flex in certain situations, most crucially \nmid-corner, where ultra-high lean angles prevent the  suspension from \nworking effectively, contributing to  chatter, and on  corner exits, where \nthe  right amount of flex can smooth out  a rear-tyre slide. \nYou only need to  examine the  wacky twin-shock Yamaha M1 from \n2002, complete with ‘anti-chatter’ dampers, to  realise that the Japanese \nare  heading up  some weird alleys in their efforts to  sort chatter and flex \nproblems. There seems to be a fundamental contrast in philosophy here: \nwhile Ducati keep it dead simple, maybe Yamaha are  thinking too  hard. \nIt would be easy to  slump into national stereotypes here, suggesting \nthat the  Italians are  more intuitive in  their approach to  racing, while \nthe Japanese are  deeply scientific, maybe too  scientific. But  that would \nbe nonsense —  Ducati are  every bit  as  scientific as  their Japanese rivals. \nAnd yet  maybe their engineers are  more pragmatic or  more down to \nearth than some Japanese engineers, whose obsession with pushing \nthings forward can sometimes lead them up  development cul-de-sacs. \nPragmatism might not  be considered a  typical Latin characteristic, but \nDucati have definitely got  it,  and they’ve blended it well with their \nItalian passion and love of heritage. \nOf  course, we  are talking slightly out of  turn here, because the \nDesmosedici has yet to  turn a  wheel in  anger. Testing isn’t racing, \nhowever many lap  records you break, and Ducati are  very aware of \nbeing over-confident at  this stage. As  Cecchinelli says: ‘Always \nremember, you only get  points at  races! I think we’ve done well to  be \ndoing such good lap times so  soon, but  I’m  not  surprised because our \naim was to  be  competitive as  soon as  possible. We  want to  fight for \npodium results but this  season won’t be easy —  there are  so many factory \n\nHow DucaTI HUMBLED HAMAMATSU Dial \nbikes \nand \nso  \nmany \ngreat \nriders \nthat \nyou \ncan  \nbe \njust \na \nfew \ntenths \nslower \nthan \nthe \nfastest \nguys \nand you’re \n12th.’ \nDomenicali predicts a  rollercoaster ride for  the  reds: ‘We will have \nsome ups  and some downs over the next few months because we  don’t \nknow many of the  GP  circuits, so  sometimes we’ll find the  optimum \nbalance and sometimes we'll miss that. Racing is  all  about how \neverything fits  together, it’s  about work, dedication and a little luck.’ \nDuke of balance: How Ducati adapted from WSB to MotoGP \nThe Desmosedici is Ducati’s first full-on, big-bore racing bike in  three \ndecades. Ever since the 1970s the Bolognese have made their name \nwith street-based racers, from the  GT750-based Imola winner of  1972 \nto  the World Superbike-conquering 916. Racing MotoGP prototypes \nshould be a very different deal but MotoGP engineer Corrado Cecchinelli \ndoesn’t believe there’s such a great difference between Superbikes and \nMotoGP machines. \n‘I  wouldn't say, for  example, that the  MotoGP bike brakes harder,’ \nsays Cecchinelli. ‘Because braking is  down to  geometry, even many \nstreetbikes have enough braking power to  lift  the  rear wheel, so  it’s  a \ncase of how low  you can  get  the bike. The only real difference between \nMotoGP carbon brakes and Superbike steel brakes is that the  carbons \nare  lighter. \n‘The difference is  that MotoGP bikes are  lighter and much more \npowerful, so  the game is to exploit all the  advantages from having such \na big amount of horsepower. You can  do everything with chassis set-up \nin  search of more acceleration, but  then maybe the  bike won’t handle \nany more, so  that’s the  compromise you have to  make.’ \nIn  fact Ducati don’t believe in  incorporating too  much adjustability \ninto their race chassis, rather like Honda. They reckon that large changes \nto a bike’s set-up only makes its handling unfamiliar to  the rider, which \nmeans he won’t know what to  expect, which means he won't have the \nconfidence to  push to  the  very edge. \n‘It’s better to  think deeply about what you are  doing, find a  good \ncompromise, \nand \nleave \nit \nlike \nthat \nall \nseason,’ \naffirms \nCecchinelli. \n‘The \ngeneral \nconclusion, \ngoing \nfrom \nthe \nsuccess \nof \nHonda \nand \nourselves, \nis \nthat this is the  right way.’ \nCecchinelli \nconsiders \nthe \ncurrent \nDesmosedici \nto  \nbe  \nextremely \nconventional \n— \na \nstrong \npoint \nat \nthis \nstage \n— \nbut \nit \nwon’t \nstay \nlike \nthat \n\nDD THE FAST STUFF \nforever. ‘We  are  certain that we  haven’t yet fully exploited the  traditional \nareas, so  we  want to be  100  per  cent with that before we  start work on \nelectronics and space-age materials. I think electronics will become more \nand more involved, everyone’s already talking about Aprilia’s ride-by- \nwire throttle, and maybe Yamaha using electronic suspension control. \n‘So  far  we  aren’t working on  traction control or  an  active slipper \nclutch —  our  clutch system is exactly the  same as  our Superbike, only \nthe dimensions are different. But traction control will become important, \nbecause in MotoGP you have too  much engine, so  you have to  use as \nmuch of it as  possible. But  we  are  far from having any such device, for \nnow we  just pay  good riders to  do that!’ \nHe’s not  wrong —  the  awesome-sounding Duke is  so  loud that you \ncan  easily hear Bayliss and Capirossi battling wheelspin from trackside, \npretty much out  of every corner; Capirossi more so  because he  likes a \nfront-end-loaded bike which costs him rear-end grip. ‘Loris likes the \nbike more loaded on  the  front, while Troy likes it lighter. Troy can  ride \nwith a  bike that moves around more, which gives him more traction, \nwhile Loris wants the  front right there, he  likes a  stiffer bike.’ Their \ndifferent demands almost certainly stem from where they started their \nrace careers —  Bayliss on  soft and wobbly proddie bikes, Capirossi on \nsuper-taut 125  GP  machines. \nDucati’s racing history \nDucati announced its  decision to  contest the new four-stroke-based \nMotoGP World Championship at  the  Spanish GP  in May 2001. Already \nthe  dominant performer in World Superbike, Ducati was attracted to  the \nnew championship because, unlike the streetbike-based Superbike series, \nMotoGP demands prototype machines, allowing engineers to experiment \nwith avant-garde technology that will help Ducati maintain its edge as  a \nhugely successful manufacturer of high-performance streetbikes. \nSince the 1970s Ducati has been renowned for  its  range of v-twin \n(with L-shaped configuration) desmo sports machines that have won \nfans all-over the  world. Created by celebrated engineer Fabio Taglioni, \nDucati’s early 750GT and 900SS v-twins scored unforgettable successes \nin  the  Imola 200 and the  Isle of  Man TT.  In  the  late 1980s the  air- \ncooled, two-valve v-twins were replaced by a liquid-cooled, four-valve \nv-twin, designed by Massimo Bordi, which scored victories at  Daytona \nand in the  inaugural World Superbike event. \n\nHow DUCATI HUMBLED HAMAMATSU 213 \nThe latest incarnations of this lineage—the 916, 996 and 998 Testastretta \n—  have been the  dominant force in World Superbike during much of the \nlast  few years, their user-friendly power and  easy handling making them \ndifficult machines to  beat. Following the  decision to  extend its  racing \nactivities into MotoGP, Ducati initially considered creating an  all-new \nv-twin prototype for  the  class, but  engineers eventually opted for  a  V4, \nmaintaining the  marque’s trademark 90-degree cylinder configuration \nand desmodromic valve actuation system. \nThe all-new Desmosedici V4  made its  track debut in August 2002 at \nMugello, Italy, ridden by Vittoriano Guareschi. Full-time MotoGP riders \nTroy Bayliss and Loris Capirossi joined the Desmosedici testing \nprogramme in November, the  bike breaking its  first lap record at Jerez, \nSpain, in December 2002. \nEpilogue: Ducati’s racing philosophy has  done them well. Four and a \nhalf years after I wrote this story they were MotoGP world championships \nfor  the first time, winning both the constructors’ championship and \nthe  riders’ title with Casey Stoner. \n\nCHAPTER 31 \nZEN AND THE HEART OF \nMOTORCYCLE RACING \nJune 2003 \nIt’s  more important than a ten  horsepower engine boost, more \nimportant than a  super-sticky rear slick, and it’s all  in  your \nhead... It is the Zen-like psychological state of grace that every \nracer craves \nWhen you peel away the  layers that make up  the  sport of motorcycle \nracing, you go  through a  lot  of  flesh and metal —  engine power, \nsuspension set-up, tyre choice, riding technique, physical fitness and \nbravery, all of them quantifiable to  some extent. Then, if you look deep \nenough, you'll sometimes find something else, something much hazier, \nless easy to  define, let  alone quantify. Some people call it mystical or \nZen-like, some top riders believe it to  be  spiritual. \nIt  is  the  innermost core of the  rider’s being, the  very centre of the \nmental force that Mick Doohan reckons is 90 per  cent of what racing is \nall  about. You might almost suggest that it is the  rider’s soul at  work. \nWhat we're talking about is the psychological condition called ‘flow’, or \n‘in  the  zone’ as  some Americans prefer to  call it.  Flow is  an  almost \ntranscendental state of  mind experienced by many sportsmen on  all \ntoo  rare occasions, during which the  individual’s normal capabilities \nare  effortlessly surpassed —  everything seems to  go right, you're riding \nfaster than ever and if you make a mistake you seem to have corrected \nit before you even made it. The world around you seems to  slow down, \ngo quiet, and you're operating in an  altered state of consciousness, the \nthinking part of your brain shutting down while the  intuitive part fires \nup.  It’s  pretty weird, believe me. ; \nNot surprisingly, this is the  state of mind that professional sportsmen \nattempt to  enter each time they compete. But flow isn’t like that —  it \ncomes of its own accord, when various factors mysteriously gel together. \nPlenty of serious research has been done into the  subject over recent \n\nZEN AND THE HEART OF  MOTORCYCLE RACING 215 \ndecades but it’s still nebulous in  the extreme. There are certain \nprocedures \nyou \ngo \ncan \nthrough \nin \nan \neffort \nto \nencourage \nflow \n— \nmost \nnotably meditation and visualisation —  but they’re far from guaranteed, \nfor normal mortals at  least. As  sports psychologists say  of the  zone: ‘It \nis indeed a place, but a map won’t get you there’. \nI experienced flow maybe three times during my  ten-year racing \ncareer, and each of those episodes is still vividly clear in my mind. They \noccurred at Brands Hatch, Spa Francorchamps and the Island, and each \ntime I was riding effortlessly beyond my normal limits. British Superbike \nchampion Steve Hislop reckons he  may feel the  flow three times a \nseason, while five-time 500  king Doohan reckons he had it pretty much \nevery time he raced. So was it the  Aussie’s ability to  feel  the  flow that \nmade him arguably the  greatest racer of all time? Perhaps. \nHislop describes his  flow experiences thus: ‘You have those moments \nwhen you think “Fuckin’ hell, I’m  on  it here”, but  it’s  cool, it’s  dead \nrelaxing and peaceful. You're just spot on,  faster than ever and you're \nnot even breaking into a  sweat. It’s  a  nice feeling when you get  it, if \nthey could only bottle the  stuff so  you could guzzle it...’ \nDoohan’s great rival Wayne Rainey also enjoyed some flow moments. \nIn  fact Mike Sinclair, the engineer who fettled Rainey’s Marlboro \nYamahas, reckoned that Doohan and Rainey were the  only ones who \ncould ‘get in  that headspace where they are  100  per  cent fast. Some \nguys don’t have a  problem getting there every time they ride, guys like \nWayne and Mick, others find it harder.’ Sinclair wasn’t aware of flow at \nthe time, but he  knew something spooky was going on  inside these \nguys’ heads. \nRainey still has  memories of flow, bright as  a button in his  mind, one \nof which manifested itself as  an  out-of-body experience. This is nothing \nunique —  Fl  legend Ayrton Senna reported a  similar experience at \nMonaco in  ’88. ‘I won over 20  GPs and there’s only a  few that stand \nout,’ says Rainey, 500 champ in  1990, ’91  and ’92. ‘Some were really \nstrange, some were a lot  of fun and some were a lot  of work. But the \nones \nthat \nreally \nstand \nout \nwere \nthe \nones \nthat \nwere \njust \nodd. \nAt \nSuzuka \nin \n93 \nI \nhad, \nlike, \nan \nout-of-body \nexperience. \nIt \nwas \nlike \nI \nwas \nlooking \ndown \nat \nmyself \ngoing \ninto \nthe \nfast \nright \nbefore \nthe \nhairpin \nand \nlaughing, \nsmiling \nand \ngiggling. \nIt \nwas \nso \nodd, \nI \nremember \nthinking \nin \nthe \npost- \nrace \npress \nconference: \n“there’s \nno \nway \nI \ncan \nsay \nsomething \nabout \nthat \nor  they won't let  me  do the  next race”. \n\n216 THE FAST STUFF \n‘That moment is  so  clear to  this day. I don’t know-how or  why it \nhappened, but  I know it did  happen. That race was awesome, the  best \nI’d  ever done, I think I was having so  much fun on  the  bike, really \nenjoying what I was doing, probably more than ever in my  career. \n‘I'd  gotten a bad start, Schwantz was riding good and was leading. I \nwas thinking: “Man, he’s gonna take off!”, then I caught him, passed \nhim and pulled out  a  bit. I was the  only guy on  Dunlops and my tyres \nwent off a little, so  I was able to  slow down some, cool the tyres off, drop \nback to  fourth, then make another charge towards the  end. Normally \nyou can’t do  things like that in  a  race, you’re normally flat  out  all  the \nway, but  I was able to  exploit the  advantage I had with the  tyres, and \nthat’s what won me  the  race. I knew I had a  performance advantage \nwith the  tyres, just from the  way I could manoeuvre the  bike, put  it in \ndifferent areas of the  corner and kinda intimidate everybody and enjoy \nthat. It was like turning around and sticking your tongue out  at  them, \nthat’s the way I felt. When you  can  think that way and you're in a world \nchampionship race, when there’s so  much on  the  line, I was just feeling \nlike  a kid. I was thinking: “This is not  meant to be this much fun!” \nRainey’s Suzuka experience tallies with research by  psychologist \nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the  man who first investigated flow in  the \nearly 1970s. He  surmised from thousands of interviews that flow is ‘a \ncommon subjective experience of pleasure, interest and even ecstasy, \nderived from activities that perfectly match one’s skills with the \ndemands for  performance’. Rainey’s talents were obviously entirely \nmatched to what he was required to  do. \nDean Miller, Rainey’s trainer during his  GP  years, recalls another \nmoment of Rainey flow. This was at  the  ’93  Czech GP.  the  race which \npreceded the crash that ended his career. ‘Very inexplicably Wayne took \noff,  passed everybody and won by six  or  seven seconds,’ says Miller. \n‘Afterwards he couldn’t remember anything that had happened during \nthe  race, he  talked about music and tunes going through his  head, all \nthese strange processes going on,  and the  race came so  easy. It was a \nvery strange race to  him, but  very successful, very satisfying and very \nethereal, in a kinda “out there” way. That’s the so-called Zen-like feeling \nyou get  in  the zone. Flow can also happen in  training, I call them \n“golden days”, when you can  run  forever and you don’t get  tired.’ \nSo  extreme is  the sensation of  flow that Rainey found it  slightly \ndisconcerting recalling these moments for  this story. ‘Thinking about \n\nZEN AND THE HEART OF  MOTORCYCLE RACING 207, \nthis \nis \ngoing \nto  \nscrew \nup \nmy \nwhole \nday,’ \nhe \nsaid. \n‘I \ncould \nget \na \nlot \nmore \ndeep \nand \nspiritual, \nbut \nit \ndoesn’t \nmean \nthat \nmuch \nto \nme \nno \nmore.’ \nOf  course, flow doesn’t feel spiritual to  everyone. Doohan has \nexperienced flow, even an  out-of-body moment, but  he’s more prosaic \nabout it  in  his  archly down-to-earth Aussie way. ‘People talk about \nRainey and Senna having those out-of-body moments, and it’s  exactly \nWhat you feel, you definitely visualise yourself from the outside,’ \nDoohan says, going on  to  explain his  theory behind the saved-the- \nslide-before-you-even-had-it feeling. ‘I  think it’s because you've \nbasically gone through the  turn before you've actually gone through it, \nso  you’ve imagined what could happen before you come across it,  so \nyou're well prepared for,  say, the  front to  push. You think the  front’s \ngoing to  push because of  how much speed you're carrying going in \nthere, or  you think the  back’s going to  break away mid-turn because \nyou're carrying a bit too  much momentum in the  middle of the  corner. \nSo  you catch the  slide as  it’s  happening, because you’re well prepared \nfor it, you basically know it’s  going to  happen. You're that far ahead of \nthe  game that everything is in  slow motion, but it’s  not  even in  slow \nmotion, your thought processes have just gone through what’s going to \nhappen or  what could happen.’ \nNow you know why Doohan was so  astonishingly good —  he  had \neverything worked out  in advance. ‘Putting a  lap together is all  about \nbeing prepared for  the  next corner before you approach it.  It’s  not  so \nmuch visualisation, you just know what’s coming up,  you know what \nneeds to  be done. Flow happened most of the  time to  me. Whenever I \nwas on  top of  it,  things would seem to  slow down, but that’s just \nbecause I was in the  rhythm and riding all the  time, so  it seemed slow. \nIf  I were to  hop on  a  motorcycle now, everything would happen about \nfive times quicker!’ \nBut  while Doohan tends to dismiss any  otherworldly explanations of \nthese \nstrange \nforces, \nhe \nworked \nhard \nduring \nhis \ncareer \nto \nutilise \nthem \nto \nhis \nadvantage. \nDuring \nGP \nweekends \nhe \nwas \nknown \nto \nbe \ndistant \nand \nuncommunicative, \nalmost \nto \nthe \npoint \nof \nrudeness. \nThis \nwas \nsimply \nhim \ndoing \nwhat \nmost \npro-sportsmen \ndo \nto \nget \nin \nthe \nzone—concentrating \non \nhis \nown \nlittle \nworld \nwithin \nwhich \nhe \nwas \nrelaxed, \ncalm, \nself- \nconfident \nand \nfocusing \non \nbike \nand \ntrack. \nAny \nother \noutside \ndistractions \n— \njournalists, \nfans, \npretty \nmuch \nanyone \n— \nwere \nunwelcome. \n‘From \nthe  \ntime \nI \narrived \nat  \nthe  \ncircuit \nit \nwas \nall  \nabout \nthe  \nrace, \njust \n\n218 THE FAST STUFF \ngetting your head together for  that moment,’ he  adds. ‘Most of  the \ntime I’d arrive on  Thursday afternoon; some riders seem to love getting \nthere earlier but  it’s just too  hard to remain so  focused for that long.’ \nRainey also spent entire GP  weekends focusing on  Sundays, working \nto get his brain into that state from which the flow might just spill forth. \nHe  remembers his  pre-race preparations —  designed to  encourage flow — \ntaking on  a  scary intensity. ‘As  my career went on  I was just waiting for \nSunday,’ he recalls. ‘Friday and Saturday were a waste \nof time, I was always building to  Sunday. I had a little \n‘I'd sit there, ritual before the  race, if you want to  call  it that, or  a \nfocusing on  the routine, that would get me  into the right state of mind. \nfeeling of wanting to I'd get myself into this  once a weekend, I’d be dancing \nspit nails and rip the around my motorhome, kicking my leathers, or  I’d sit \nhandlebars off the there, focusing on  the  feeling of  being excited and \nbike. It was like wanting to  spit nails and rip  the  handlebars off  the \ngoing out  to fight’ bike. It was like going out  to fight. The music depended \nOe eg et on  the  mood I was in,  maybe a bit  of country, or  it \ncould’ve been pop or  rock ‘n’  roll. It  was never the \nsame, but when I left  the  motorhome I was always ready. \n‘If people had come into the  motorhome they’d have thought I was \nnuts, they’d have said: “Man, you  better take a break!” I always looked \nforward to the preparation; it was one  reason I raced. Basically I’d think \nabout the race completely, so when I got on  the bike I was pretty relaxed. \nIt was much more intense getting ready. I enjoyed that part of my career \n—  those one  or  two hours before the  race by myself. It was very intense \nand very exciting. But it was also a lot  of work, a lot of commitment, a \nlot  of dedication and desire. You give up  a whole lot  for  that.’ \nRainey isn’t the only rider to  have psyched himself up  on  his \nmotorhome hi-fi. This is  Hislop: ‘You’ve got  to  get  away from people \nprior to  racing. I use  dancey-type music, really get  myself buzzing. It’s \nquite funny, if you go  along the  line of motorhomes before a  British \nSuperbike race, you'll hear music blaring out of  most of  them as \neveryone tries to  pump themselves up.’ \nAll good racers have their own pre-race rituals, none more conspicuous \nthan Valentino Rossi’s. Like many riders’ systems of preparation, the \nworld champ’s routine allows him to  slip into an  almost dream-like \nstate, so  he can  maintain his  focus and maybe enter the  zone, because \nhe doesn’t need his  consciousness to  do anything. Perhaps this dream- \n\nZEN AND THE HEART OF  MOTORCYCLE RACING 219 \nlike state also calms nerves and blocks out  those little distractions that \nmight jog him out  of that peaceful frame of mind. In racing, the  tiniest \ndiversion can disrupt your whole mental state —  like  losing a glove and \npanicking for  30  seconds while you look for  it —  which is why Rossi \nalways keeps his  leathers, helmet and gloves in  the  same place, and \nwhy he  keeps the  same breakfast, lunch and dinner schedule. It’s  all \nabout the  routine. ‘If  I know exactly where my  things are  it gives me  a \nfeeling of calm and security, so  I can think only about the  bike,’ says \nRossi, whose crew chief Jerry Burgess has  seen it all before. ‘Valentino’s \nmethod of operation is the  same all the  time, just like  any  professional \nsportsman’s should be,’ says JB.  ‘Mick used to  do it, he used to  spend \nminutes and minutes putting his  gloves on, it  was a  concentration \nthing, leaving one world behind and preparing to  enter another.’ \nMiller adds: ‘Valentino’s record is superb, because he’s never changed \nanything. He  still stays up late, still turns up for morning practice with \nhis  hair all  matted and sideways, just like Schwantz used to,  but  he’s \nconsistent, he keeps the  same pattern of behaviour.’ \nMiller believes that no  one  has ever been better at pre-race visualisation \nthan three-time 500  champ King Kenny Roberts. And he  should know — \nhe’s worked with some of the greatest riders of the past two  decades, from \nmultiple 500 champs Roberts Senior, Rainey and Eddie Lawson to 250 and \nSupers champ John Kocinski and one-time 500 champ Roberts Junior. \nKing Kenny was a genius at the visualisation process —  riding the  track in \nhis mind, so  he’d already done it all before he even got there. Miller recalls \none episode particularly clearly -  when Yamaha brought Roberts out  of \nretirement to  contest the  1985 Suzuka Eight Hour race aboard the brand- \nnew FZR750 Genesis. It was Roberts’ first four-stroke roadrace. ‘We were \nstruggling about a  second and a half off  pole,’ recounts Miller. “So  one \nlunchtime \nKenny \nsays: \n“let’s \ngo \nback \nto \nthe \nhotel”. \nHe \ntold \nme \nnot \nto \nlet \nanyone \nknock \non \nthe \ndoor, \nhe \ndidn’t \nwant \nanyone \nbothering \nhim. \nSo \nhe’s \nlaying \nflat \non \nthe \nbed, \ndoing \nlap \nafter \nlap \nafter \nlap \nfor \nabout \n50 \nminutes, \nthen \nhe \ngets \nup \nand \nsays \n“I’ve \nfound \nit, \nI’ve \nfound \nhalf \na \nsecond \nhere \nand \na \nsecond \nthere”. \nWe \ngo \nback \nover \nto \nthe \ntrack \nand \nhe \nqualifies \non \npole, \njust \nlike \nthat. \nKenny \ncould \nvisualise \nbetter \nthan \nanyone.’ \nVisualisation \nis \na \nkind \nof \nmeditation; \nit’s  \nlike  \npractising \nin \nyour \nmind, \nas \nMiller \nexplains: \n‘If \nyou \nthink \nabout \nsomething \nlong \nenough, \nit’s \ngoing \nto \nhappen’. \nMaybe \nmost \npro \nracers \ndon’t \nprepare \nfor \nraces \nin \nthe \nlotus \nposition \nbut \nthey \nall \nhave \ntheir \nown \nmeditation \nrituals \n— \nRainey \n\n220 THE FAST STUFF \ndancing around his motorhome, Doohan fiddling with his  gloves, Rossi \nfingering his  earring. \n‘Everyone has their own way,’ Miller continues. ‘Some guys put the \nleft glove on  first and their helmet goes on in a certain way. Or you watch \nbasketball players and some of them have to drink a special kind of water \nfrom a  special kind of bottle. You get  these crazy situations where guys \nare  trying to put themselves in that zone. Rossi’s process obviously works \nfor him, it’s  repetitive and it’s  in his best interests not  to change it. \n‘Racers have a whole lot of anxiety and pressure to deal with, especially \nsitting on  the grid. Everybody attacks that anxiety differently. If you look \nat  Kenny Junior he sits  on  the  line with his  arms folded, sunglasses on, \nearplugs in, head down —  he’s in a  focus zone, visualising something in \nhis  mind, which may include the  first lap. Whatever he  does works for \nhim, because he always gets a good start based on  that visualisation. \n‘Wayne listened to  rock ’n’  roll  to  engage himself and gear himself \nup. Eddie Lawson was a  little different, he’d sit  in  his darkened \nmotorhome and prepare his helmets; anybody who went in there would \nthink he  was a  caveman sitting in  the dark, but that was just his \nvisualisation process. Then there was John. People used to  think he \nwas a little crazy, which he was with his obsessive compulsive behaviour, \nbut all that cleaning was the way he alleviated his  anxiety to do his job. \nIt’s  all  about having a  specific routine before you do  whatever you’ve \ngot  to  do,  some sort of an  ambience going on.’ \nOf course, it’s  not  quite as  simple as  that. The process of preparation \ntakes much, much longer than an  hour or  two before the race. ‘It’s also \nyour background,’ continues Miller. ‘Your entire life goes into that \nprocess to get where you're at.  And it all comes together in one  moment \n—  that’s a lot of laps, a lot of practice, a lot of braking, a lot of cornering. \nAnd if it works, it just flows. It’s  an  ethereal situation of everything \ncoming together from everything you’ve ever accomplished and \neverything you’ve ever worked for.’ \nIn  other words, you only get  there through absolute commitment to \nthe  cause, withering self-discipline and total concentration. There’s no \nfast track, easy route to  the  realms of flow, it takes a  lifetime of honing \nyour \nskills. \nDoohan, \nhowever, \nwarns \nof \ntrying \ntoo \nhard, \nbecause \nflow \nis \n_ \nall \nabout \nthat \nperfect \nmatch \nof \ntalent \nand \ntask: \nsimply \nforcing \nyourself \nto \ntry \nharder \nwon't \nwork. \n‘I’ve \ndone \nit \nmyself,’ \nhe \nsays. \n‘When \nyou're \nunder \npressure \nyou \ntry \nto \ndo \ntoo \nmuch, \ninstead \nof \ntrying \nto \ndo \nwhat \nyou're \n\nZEN \nAND \nTHE \nHEART \nOF  \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACING \nen \ncapable \nof \ndoing. \nI \nthink \nthat’s \nthe  \nbiggest \nthing, \nconvincing \nyourself \nthat \nyou're \nnot \ngoing \nto \ngo \ntoo \nfar, \nbut \nat \nthe \nsame \ntime \nyou \nhave \nto \ngo \nto \na \npoint \nwhere \nyou \nfeel \nno \none \ncan \ndo \nany \nbetter.” \nDoohan \nwas \nalways \na \nmaster \nof \nthat \nkind \nof \npsychology \n— \nconvincing \nyourself \nto \ndo \nthe \nimpossible \nwithout \nallowing \nyour \nbrain \nto \nthink \nit’s \nimpossible. \nBut if flow is so  crucial to  accessing a higher state of consciousness \nthat can  help riders go faster than ever before, why don’t riders do even \nmore to  get  themselves into the  zone? Why, when sports psychologists \nare  so  much in  demand from top  golfers and tennis players, isn’t the \nMotoGP paddock crawling with go-faster shrinks? \nMiller believes he  has the answer. ‘Guys like Rossi, Doohan and \nKenny Junior have grown through a system, they’ve developed a system \nthat’s successful for  them. I don’t think a  sports psychologist could \nmake any difference to  these guys because they’re already at  such a \nlevel, so  I don’t think there’s one person in our  paddock who needs a \nsports psychologist, and that includes John Kocinski. Back in  1990 \nKenny (Roberts, who successfully guided Kocinski to  that year’s 250 \nworld title) brought in  a  psychologist to  work with John because he \nthought the  kid  had a  problem with obsessive compulsive behaviour. \nThis guy  also said he thought John had a problem and I said: “Well I’m \nunder the impression that John’s here to  race motorcycles and he’s \nwinning everything and now you've alerted the  guy to  the  fact that \nhe’s got  a  problem”. So  I fired him. Kenny wanted to  know what was \ngoing on,  so  I told him: “I  know you think John’s strange but  did  you \never see  yourself lay down in a  motorhome and do  the  things you did \nto  prepare for  a  race? People would’ve thought you were crazy, just like \npeople would’ve thought Wayne was crazy if they’d seen him jumpin’ \naround listening to  music, just the  same if they’d seen the  way Eddie \ncleaned and prepared his  helmets in  the  dark.” Basically I think all \nthese guys are  crazy —  because they all ride motorcycles real fast!’ \nMaybe it’s  the innate danger of motorcycle racing that really keeps the \nsports \npsychologists \nout \nof \nbike \npaddocks. \nEmploying \nwell-used \nmental- \npreparation \nmodels \nto \nhelp \ngolfers \nto \nputt \nbetter \nor \ntennis \nplayers \nto \nserve \nharder \nis \none \nthing, \nbut \ngetting \ninto \nthe \ndarkest \nrecesses \nof \na \nracer’s \nbrain, \nwhere \nthe \nrider \nhas \nto \nconfront \nthe \nnever-ending \ndangers \nof \nriding \non \nthe \ngiddy \nlimit \nis \nsomething \nelse \naltogether. \nAnd \ntrying \nto \nmess \naround \nin \nthere \nmight \nonly \ndestroy \nthe \nmagic. \nWhich \nis \nwhy \nthe \nsport \nof \nmotorcycle \nracing \nsometimes \nfeels \nlike \nmuch \nmore \nthan \nthat... \n\n222. THE FAST STUFF \nMotoGP Mutterings: July 2003 \nMotorcycle racers aren’t the only guys who feel ihe need, the \nneed for  speed. Which could mean some big-buck sponsorship \nopportunities for MotoGP... \nSo,  coalition fighter pilots are  popping speed pills to  help them stay \nawake during military operations in  the  Middle East. Pretty mad, eh? \nSome guy, buzzing off his nut, scything across the  sky at mach two and \ncarrying enough munitions to  flatten a  small town. Gives a whole new \nmeaning to  the  phrase ‘war on  drugs’. \nBut  there’s no  cause for concern. Just so  long as  these knights of the \nsky are  administered the  correct dose of amphetamines, it’s  perfectly \nsafe, say the USAFE In  no  way whatsoever are these jet  jockeys \ncompromising their ability to  carry out  their duty, though this whole \nstory arises from an  Afghan campaign friendly-fire incident in which \nfour Canadian soldiers were killed by a  laser-guided bomb unleashed \nby an  F16 pilot who was on  USAF-administered amphetamines. The \nfact that it’s  illegal to  imbibe this drug at,  say, a Saturday night house \nparty, is irrelevant. As  is the  fact that dextro-amphetamine, the USAF’s \nusual stimulant of  choice, ‘may impair the ability of  the patient to \nperform potentially hazardous activities such as  operating machinery’. \nAnd, you'll also be  happy to  hear that speed is  only administered to \nrelieve pilots’ tiredness; the  drug is  absolutely not intended to  raise \ntheir aggression levels, although dextro-amphetamine’s known side \neffects do include agitation, irritability and moodiness. \nAnyway, this has got me thinking (always a  risky business). If \namphetamines make fighter pilots perform better, surely this  gear has  got \nto be good for motorcycle racing. Currently, performance-enhancing drugs \nare  banned from most sports, but  in the light of USAF evidence aren’t we \nperhaps being a little old-fashioned? A  few years back Fat  Boy Slim \nproclaimed better living through chemistry, now we  have (apparently) \nbetter bombing through chemistry, so  why not  better racing? \nI feel there’s every reason that MotoGP racing should take the  lead \nhere, since GP  bikes have so  much in  common with jets, as  Warren \nWilling, engineer to  500  world champ Kenny Roberts Junior once said: \n‘Dynamically, a bike is more like  a fighter plane than a car’. And doesn’t \nevery bike racer or  R1  rider half think he’s a jet-fighter pilot? And wasn’t \nthe first-ever 500  world champ —  Les  Graham —  a World War II pilot? \n\nNEED FOR SPEED 223 \nThe \nparallels \nare \nundeniable, \nbut \nhere’s \nthe \nreal \nclincher: \npharmaceutical \ncompanies \nare  \nsome \nof \nthe \nworld’s \nrichest \norganisations \n(the \nworld’s \ntop \nfive \ndrug \ncompanies \nhave \ntwice \nthe \nGDP \nof \nall \nsub- \nSaharan \nAfrica), \nand \nMotoGP \nracing \nwill \nsoon \nneed \na \nserious \ncash \ninjection, \nbecause \ntobacco \nsponsorship \nis \nabout \nto \nget \nthe \nchop \nthroughout \nEurope. \nThe \nsponsorship \nopportunities \nwith \nthe \npharmaceutical \nindustry \nare \ndizzying; \nindeed \nI’ve \nalready \nlined \nup \nmeetings \nwith \nthe \npeople \nfrom \nSmithKline \nBeecham \n(manufacturers \nof \nDexedrine), \nBayer \nand \nPfizer \nbecause \nthey’ve \ngot \nshitloads \nmore \ncash \nthan \nthe \ntobacco \nindustry. \nI \nsee \nSmithKline Beecham Honda, Bayer Yamaha and ‘Pharmaceutical \nPfizer Aprilia, all  the  teams vying with each other to companies are  some \ndevelop the ultimate pre-race stimulant —  a  whole of the world’s richest \nnew dimension to racing technology. organisations and \nThen next month I’m heading to  South America MotoGP needs a \nfor a   fact-finding tour, investigating further serious cash \nsponsorship possibilities, should MotoGP’s governors injection’ \nconsider further deregulation. I'll  be  spending a fair ee \namount of  time in  Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, \nworking on  future deals for teams and various MotoGP events. I foresee \nlavish hospitality opportunities with, say, Team Medellin Honda — \nchampagne, lap dancers and wraps of  the finest Bolivian marching \npowder available to  all  VIPs and members of the  media in  the  team’s \npaddock hospitality area. And I see  terrific marketing opportunities for \ntrackside white lines, which I feel have been foolishly overlooked up \nuntil now. \nAnd once I’m done down there, I’m heading to  eastern Europe to \npursue yet  more marketing opportunities for  MotoGP’s twinkly bright \nfuture. Much of the  world’s Ecstasy originates from factories behind \nthe former Iron Curtain, and I’m keen to  discuss brand-promotion \ndeals with these guys too. I can  see  it now: the  White Dove German GP, \nor  maybe the Mitsubishi British GP  (that’s Mitsubishi as  in the pill, not \nthe  motor, dumbo). \nI'd  \nlike \nsome \ninput \nfrom \nyou \nthe  \nreaders \non  \nthis \nproject, \nbecause \nI \nwant \nit  \nto  \nwork \nfor  \neveryone \ninvolved \n—  \nriders, \nteams, \nsponsors \nand \nyou, \nthe \npaying \npublic. \nFor \nexample: \ndo \nyou \nreckon \nthat \nindividual \nriders \nshould \nstick \nto \ntheir \nown \nteam’s \npharmaceuticals, \nor \nshould \nthe \nentire \ngrid \nbe \ntreated \nwith \nthe \nsame \nproduct, \nperhaps \nthat \nof \nthe \nevent \n\n224 THE FAST STUFF \nsponsors? Not as  easy a  question as  you might think —  because if we \npopped a Mitsubishi tab  down each rider’s neck before the  British GP, \nthe action might be somewhat limited. I suspect it would mostly involve \nriders lying down on  the  grass by the  grid, almost certainly with grid \ngirls, and making gentle rhythmic movements. But it could be  worth \na try. \nFinally, I have an  abiding vision etched in my mind apropos this jets/ \namphetamines business which I really want to share with you. It involves \nan  F16 pilot of  the  future, his  flying mask cleverly adapted, leaning \nforward over the dash (do Fl6s have dashboards?) and snorting a big, fat \nline as  he  pushes the  joystick forward, anxiously fingering the  rocket \nrelease button and shouting: ‘Yeeehaaaaa! Die  you  motherfuckers!’ \nPeace, dudes! \n\nCHAPTER 32 \nHAYDEN: HOW HE  LEARNED TO \nWIN THE MOTOGP CROWN \nSeptember 2003 \nNicky Hayden made the kind of steady forward progress during \nhis  debut 2003 MotoGP season that suggested he just might be \nthe new Steady Eddie Lawson. Okay, so  he  may never win four \nworld titles like Lawson but at  least he  went on  to  wear the \ncrown once \nNicky Hayden is GP  racing’s new paddock pin-up. Swooning PR  girls \nsecrete photos of  him on  their laptops, captioned ‘truelove’, female \nDorna employees collapse into fits of  girlish giggles whenever the \nKentucky Kid wanders into view and a  red-faced Spanish journalist \nmisuses a  Repsol Honda press conference to  ask the  22-year-old US \nSuperbike champ if he’d accept his  daughter’s offer of a  date. Hayden \ndefinitely got a  lot  of  attention from the ladies in  his  debut world \nchampionship campaign, but, like most things in  life, the kid from \nKentucky seems to  take it all in his  shambling, loose-limbed stride. \nNot that his  attractiveness to  the  opposite sex  matters to anyone but \nhim, but what does matter is  that Hayden is  more than GP  racing’s \nnew pin-up, he  might just be GP racing’s new Eddie Lawson. Obviously \nit’s  way too early to  compare Hayden with Steady Eddie, the most \nsuccessful premier-class racer of  the 1980s, but there are  promising \nsimilarities. Like Lawson, Hayden is American, like Lawson he  started \nout in  dirt track and like Lawson he  came to  GPs wearing the US \nSuperbike crown. But the  crucial likeness is Hayden’s steady approach \nto  racing that sets him apart from most thrusting youngsters. \nDespite the  pressure of riding for  GP  racing’s best team, aboard the \nbest bike and with Valentino Rossi for  a  team-mate at  Repsol Honda, \nHayden \nwas \nprepared \nto \ntake \nhis \ntime \nin \n2003, \nnever \ntrying \nto \nrun \nbefore \nhe \ncould \nwalk. \nSounds \neasy \nenough \nbut \nall \nthe \nevidence \nsuggests \nthat \nit’s \nnot \neasy \nfor \ntalented \nyoung \nracers \nwho \nhave \na \ndepressing \nhabit \n\n226 THE FAST STUFF \nof trying too  hard too  soon, crashing their brains out  and thus losing \nthe  confidence they need to  exploit their talent. By the  very nature of \ntheir profession, racers have little or  no  patience, they want to  get \nwherever they're going —  whether it’s  to the  next corner or  to  their first \nworld championship —  as  fast as  they can, and damn the  consequences \nof getting it wrong. \nHayden sensibly used his 2003 MotoGP apprenticeship to  gain \nconfidence one step at  a  time: build some confidence, go  a bit  quicker, \nbuild some more confidence, go  a bit  quicker and so  on.  It’s  the  same \nstrategy that Lawson used when he came to GPs in the early 1980s, and \nthough it  doesn’t grab overnight headlines, it  has created a  solid \nfoundation on  which Hayden should be  able to  build in  subsequent \nseasons when he  know the tracks, the bikes and the tyres. True, \nHayden’s 2003 results aboard the RC211V weren’t as  strong as  Lawson’s \ndebut season aboard Yamaha YZR500 in 1983, but GP racing is different \nthese days. Back in  Lawson's day there was just a  handful of factory \nbikes, now they’re all  factory bikes, with the  top  ten separated by less \nthan a  second. That’s why Hayden didn’t set  MotoGP on  fire, but  those \nin the  know were impressed by his  slow-burn campaign, because they \nlooked deeper than mere results, noting that his  race pace was often \nwithin half a  second of Rossi’s during the  closing stages of the  season. \nAt  Motegi, where he  scored his  first top-three finish, he  finished just \nfive seconds behind winner Max Biaggi. \nAnd unlike most quick kids, he  doesn’t crash. Hayden fell just four \ntimes in 2003, despite having to  learn his  way around a new bike, new \ntracks and new tyres. Compare that record to  Nori Haga (15  crashes), \nJeremy McWilliams (11), Alex Barros (10) and Marco Melandri and \nTroy Bayliss (9). As  Rossi’s crew chief Jeremy Burgess says: ‘Hayden is \nthe  stand-out guy this year. He’s not  shown me  anything that suggests \nhe won’t make it all the way to  the  top. He’s a little bit not  right on  his \ncorner entries but  he’s got  good machine control. He’s impressive.’ \nOff-track, Hayden’s and Lawson’s parallel lines peter out. Whereas \nLawson never appeared to enjoy his racing, from the outside at least, and \nresented the  media big-time, Hayden had the  time of his  life during the \nsummer of 2003 and doesn’t mind talking about it. His  is a new attitude \nthat pervades the GP paddock; the latest generation of pro-GP racers like \nHayden, Rossi, Bayliss, Edwards, Gibernau and Co  take their racing just \nas  seriously as  men like  Lawson, but  they’re having a lot more fun. They \n\nHAYDEN: \nHOW \nHE  \nLEARNED \nTO  \nWIN \nTHE \nMotoGP \nCROWN \n227 \nseem \nto  \nhave \ngot  \ntheir \nprofessionalism \nin  \nperspective \nwith \nthe  \nrest \nof \ntheir \nlives, \nwhich \nsome \n1980s \nheroes \nnever \nmanaged \nto \ndo. \nNicky, you  come from a real racing family, right? \nYup, my elder brother Tommy (24) races 600s for Kawasaki in the  States, \nmy  little brother Roger Lee  (20) races for Erion Honda and my dad  was a \npro  dirt tracker. Even my  mom raced in local ‘powder \npuff’ races, that’s like chicks’ racing, and my elder sister \ntoo.  My little sister is the only one  who’s never raced. ‘Even my  mom \nraced in local \nYou  started out  in  dirt track, how come you switched to ‘powder puff’ races, \nroadracing? that’s like  chicks’ \nI quit doing dirt track full-time when I was 13,  but racing, and my  elder \nI’ve  still  been doing it some all the way up until right sister too’ \nnow; this is the  first year that I don’t do it any  more. i f \nI love dirt  track and I think it helps make me a better \nrider, but once I started roadracing I just liked it better, plus there’s a lot \nmore of a future in roadracing —  unfortunately dirt track is pretty lame \nin America right now, it ain’t goin’ anywhere. \nTell us about the time you and your brothers monopolised the podium at a Grand \nNational dirt meet... \nYeah, we  got first, second and third in a  Grand National in Springfield, \nTennessee, last fall  against (Jay) Springsteen, (Chris) Carr and all  the \ntop American dirt trackers. It was such a  shocker! \nYou've had a slow-burn rookie GP season, while many youngsters are  in so much \nof a hurry... \nIt'd be  nice to  have just dropped in  at  the  front but that’s not  what \nhappened. Even when I first started AMA roadracing I didn’t just kill  it. \nHonda pretty well told me  they wanted me  to  learn, they didn’t want me \ntearing \nup \na \nlot \nof \nequipment \nand \nthey \nwanted \nme \nto \nstay \nhealthy. \nBut \nnow \nit’s \nstarting \nto \nfeel \nright \nand \nhopefully \nwhen \nit \nclicks \nI'll \nbe \nthere. \nThey’ve \nnot \nput \nany \npressure \non \nme, \nthe \nonly \npressure \ncomes \nfrom \nmyself. \nWhen did it start to feel right? \nAt \nAssen. \nI \nreally \nliked \nAssen \nbecause \nit’s \ngot \nbanked \ncorners \nthat \ngave \nme \na \nlot \nof \nfeel \nfrom \nthe \nfront. \nI \nfelt \nsooooo \ngood \nthat \nweekend \nand \nI \n\n228 THE FAST STUFF \njust kept building from there. Everyone said Assen isso hard to  learn \nbut  I got up  to  speed quick and got  a real good feeling. There’d been a \nfew races I hadn’t done a lot,  so  I had a little talk with myself and I’ve \ndefinitely picked it up  since then. I’m  excited about the  last  few races; \nhopefully Ill  start stringing them together. \nHave there been moments when you've thought: I’m  in too deep here? \nNot  to that point. Sure there’s been a couple of times where I’ve  thought \n‘man, I’ve got  to  get  it together’, like  when I qualified 18th at  Mugello, \nbut  I’ve never been to  the  point where I wished I was back home. I’ve \nhad to  prove I’m serious, that I’m  not  going to  lay down just because a \ncouple things didn’t go my way. I just kinda regrouped, I decided I’ve  got \nto have more fun riding and not  be so  hard with myself —  just go out  and \ndo the best I can. That was on  Friday night at Barcelona. I lay in bed  and \nthought it all over, and from there each race has  been better and better. \nAt the beginning of the year I was really lucky to have so many people \nhelping me  but  maybe it caused me  to  think too  much. Tady (Okada) \nand Mick (Doohan) were helping me, and I was just thinking about it \ntoo  much, instead of going out  and doing what I do and just ride. That’s \nwhat I do now —  I’m  still serious, I’m  still focused, but  sometimes you’ve \njust got  to  do what comes natural and let it rule. \nHow have Tady and Mick helped? \nWhen I was struggling those guys were really cool about not  being too \nhard on  me, just being honest. Also, they’ve helped at  some of  the \ntracks I’d  never been to, just telling me  what to  expect, what to watch \nfor.  Like at  Assen, it started raining on  race day and I only got  one lap \nin the  wet before the  race. They were like  ‘Hey, this track’s good in the \nwet, you can  push, but  it does puddle here or  there’. So  they’ve helped \nwith that kinda thing. \nDo you  have access to Valentino's set-up? \nA little bit.  I’m  sure if it came to  it I could maybe get  everything but \nthat’s not  how my  team works. Sometimes if I’m not sure what tyre \nI’m  gonna race on;  I'll  be like ‘What’s happening here?’ to  JB  (Jeremy \nBurgess, Rossi's crew chief), ‘What does Valentino think about this or \nthat tyre?’ but I’ve hardly done that any. The team’s got a good chemistry, \neveryone gets along good, works hard, there’s a good morale. \n\ni. - \n— \nsia \n~<a \nHAYDEN: \nHOW \nHE  \nLEARNED \nTO  \nWIN \nTHE \nMoTOGP \nCROWN \n229 \nWhat do you  make of the other riders? \nAbout what I expected. I raced World Superbike at  Laguna last year, so \nI got  a  good idea where those guys are  at  and I knew MotoGP was \ngoing to  be  even more, with even more guys. I knew that racing at \nworld level wasn’t going to  be  easy, just seeing how hard these guys \npush for the whole race, and it’s been even more than I expected. I'd be \ndisappointed if it wasn’t like  that. These guys are  the world’s best, I’ve \na lot of respect for them. In America the pace starts out  really good but \nthen guys drop off —  but  look at  Brno, Rossi’s fastest lap was the  last \nlap. They’re just really good and steady. \nHas anyone amazed you? \nMaybe I’ve thought that but  I wouldn’t say  it to  myself, it’s  not  going \nto  do  me  any good to  sit  in  the  motorhome and think these guys are \nunreal! Sure I’ve seen some stuff, I mean Biaggi is so  smooth, even on \nhis  fastest laps he’s just glass. There’s a lot  of guys, but  one guy  who’s \nreally impressed me  is Bayliss. No  matter where he qualifies he goes to \nthe  front quick and just stays there, he’s impressive. \nHave you  learned anything, riding-wise? \nYeah, I’m a lot  different now. At  the  beginning of the  year I was still \nriding it like a Superbike, keeping high corner speed. Now I’ve learned \nto  get  the  bike stopped and turned, so  I can then really use  200-plus \nhorsepower. On  the  SP-2 your line just follows the corner, on  the  RC211 \nyou go  deeper and square it  off. I’ve learned other stuff too. In \nAmerica I  ran Dunlops and we’d have two or  three tyre choices, \nwhile now I have to  test more tyres, so  I’m getting better at  picking \nstuff up  quicker. \nWhy don’t you  use  high corner speed on  the RCV? \nThe \nSuperbike \ndoesn’t \nhave \nthe \npower, \nso  \nyou  \ncan  \ncarry \nthat \nhigh \ncorner \nspeed \nand \nstill \nopen \nthe \nthrottle \ncoming \nout \nof  \nthe \ncorner \nwith \nthe \nthing \non \nits \nside, \nwhereas \nwith \nthis \nthing \nyou \ngotta \nhave \nit \npicked \nup \nso \nyou're \non \nthe \nfatter \npart \nof \nthe \ntyre. \nI’m \nstill \nworking \non \nthat. \nAlso, \nin \nAmerica \nthe \ntracks \nare \nnarrow, \nso \nwhen \nI \ngot \nto \nsome \nof \nthe \nwide \nGP \ntracks \nI \nwasn’t \nusing \nall \nthe \ntrack \nI \ncould. \nAnd \nin \nAmerica \nyou \ngotta \nstay \noff \nthe \npaint, \nif \nyou \nhit \nthe \npaint \nit’s \nnot \ngoing \nto \nbe \npretty, \nbut \nhere \nyou've \ngot \nto \nhave \nthe \nconfidence \nto \nrun \nout \nonto \nthe \npaint. \n\n230 THE FAST STUFF \nAre you surprised by how badly some of the other factories are  struggling? \nI don’t know, I’ve not  thought too  much about it, I just ride the  bike. \nPeople struggle, you know. \nYou  must be happy you didn’t end up riding for Yamaha. \nYou said it, not  me! \nWhat was  it like getting back on  a Superbike at the Suzuka Eight Hours? \nIt was enjoyable, but not  nearly as  fast and not  as  much feel. I enjoy the \n211  because it’s  more fun  to  ride. \nYou seem very  happy-go-lucky. \nThat’s my  style, the way I’ve  always been. I’m  the kind of kid  that likes \nto  have fun. And to  be  here is awesome! The two-week break before \nthis race (Estoril) was too  long for  me, I just wanted to  start racing \nagain. But that’s just me  in  general —  I like to  kick it and have fun, \nthat’s when I ride my best. \nWhat kind of race face do you put on? \nI’m  not the  kinda guy who’s got  to  get  himself motivated before the \nrace. I’m  already too  excited, so  I’m  trying to relax, just chilling out  and \nnot  getting nervous, I’m  on  the  grid laughing because, hey, it’s  the best \npart of the  weekend. Qualifying has been my  weak point, practice is \ncool but  I can’t wait for  the  race, that’s when you get  to  go for it. \nWould you  call yourself aggressive? \nUm, I don’t really know, I don’t think about it.  I’ve never really felt \nwhat I would call  myself. Maybe there’ve been some riders who've felt \nthat, but  not  in a bad  way. \nWhat about your qualifying, how have you  stepped it up? \nIt’s  always been one  area where I’ve  been weak. I grew up in dirt track \nwhere you don’t qualify, you just have scratch heats, so  even when I \nstarted roadracing in  AMA I was never a  great qualifier. Sometimes \nwhen I put  on a soft tyre I don’t really go  any faster, while a  soft tyre \nreally helps some riders. More than anything I think it’s  knowing the \nlimit —  the Michelins I’m  using are  really good, especially the  front, but \nwhen I want to  go  that little bit  quicker, I don’t know how hard I can \n\nHAYDEN: \nHOW \nHE  \nLEARNED \nTO  \nWIN \nTHE \nMOTOGP \nCROWN \nPHI \nreally \npush. \nI \njust \nhaven’t \ndone \ngood \nin \nqualifying \nand \nI \ndon’t \nhave \nany \nexcuses, \nbut  \nI’ve \nworked \nat  \nit \nand \nmy  \nlast \nrace \n(Brno, \nwhere \nhe \nmade \nthe \nsecond \nrow \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime) \nwas \nmy \nbest \nqualifying. \nIt \nmay \nsound \nsilly \nbut \nduring \nthe \nsummer \nbreak \nI \ntook \nmy \nlap \ntimer \nhome \nso \nwhen \nI \nwas \nriding \nmy \nmotocross \nbike \nor my \nflat-track \nbike, \ninstead \nof \ndoing \nmotos \nand \nstuff \nwith \nmy \nbrothers, \nwe \nhad \nour own \nqualifying \nsessions, \njust \ngoing \nfor \none \nhot \nlap, \nand \nI \nthink \nthat \nhelped. \nWhat are your strengths as a rider? \nI think I’m  better in a race. When the race comes I always seem to find \na little bit of speed. This year I’ve  been getting really good starts which \nhas helped me a lot.  But I don’t think I excel in  one area, like on  the \nbrakes or  whatever, I just try to  learn a bit  of everything. \nWhat do you  make of Europe? \nI didn’t know what to expect, so  I didn’t really draw any  pictures in my \nmind that’d tell  me  it'll  be  this or  that. I just came here with an  open \nmind to  see  how it goes. It’s  been cool, the  first two races in  Japan and \nSouth Africa were pretty good but  when we  came to  Europe everyone \nstepped it up even more, so  I had to gas  it up and try to raise the pace to \ntheir level. You know, these guys don’t play, plus I’ve  had a lot to learn — \nbikes, tracks and that. I’ve just had to  find some speed and get faster. \nWhat do you get up to between races? \nI stay back in Belgium where the  race shop is.  I always find something \nto  do —  go  motocrossing, do  some training, go  to  the  gym, go  running \nin  the  parks. I just kinda kick it, just try  and have fun. One week I \nstayed in England with one of my  English mechanics, another time we \nwent to  a world motocross round, but  pretty much I’m  just waiting for \nthe  next race. \nDone any sightseeing? \nI’ve been travelling my  whole life  so  I guess I take it for  granted, but \nsometimes I make myself see  stuff. Like I drove from Belgium to  Le \nMans with a  buddy, so  we  weren't going to  drive past Paris without \nseeing \nthe \nEiffel \ntower, \nso \nwe \nwent \nthere \nand \nhad \ndinner. \nBack \nhome \nchicks \nask \nme: \n‘Did \nyou \nsee \nthis \nor \ndid \nyou \ngo \nthere?’, \nso \nI \ndo \na \nlittle \nbut \nnot \na \nlot. \nIt \nmay \nsound \nboring \nbut \nI \ndo \na \nlot \nof \nthe \nthings \nI \ndo \njust \n\n232 THE FAST STUFF \nbecause I know that one day I'll be sitting on  a rocking chair thinking \n‘Why didn’t I take advantage of being over there?’ \nHave you  made friends in the GP paddock? \nIt’s  different to what I’m  used to  in America, because I’ve  known a lot \nof the  people there since I was a kid  and my brothers are  there. In GPs \nI don’t really know a lot of people other than my team, so  I pretty much \nhang out  with my  team and the  guys at  the  Repsol Honda hospitality, \njust getting away from the racing. But  as  far as  the riders go,  not  really. \nI mean they’re friendly, when I see  ‘em it’s  ‘Hey what’s up? What’s \nhappening? And what about this and what about that?’, but as  far  as \ngoing to play golf or  hanging out, no. \nAnd with Valentino? \nWe  get along good, I have a lot of respect for him, but as  far as  hanging \nout, I don’t really hang out  with him. \nYou've had a couple of close shaves with Max on  track... \nA couple of times on  Friday morning he came past way closer than he \nneeded to be, when I didn’t even know where the track goes. But  it’s all \ngood, I like that part of it really, I think it’s  fun. \nYou  mean it gives you  something to go for? \nYeah! \nYour family has been over for a lot of races; did you  ask  them to come over? \nMy  mum and sister came over for  the  back-to-backs, while my  dad’s \ncome to  quite a  few, just because he wanted to.  They’ve never been to \nEurope, so  they wanted to  come and check it out. \nDoes it help to have them around when you're so far from home? \nIt \ndoesn’t \nhurt, \nit \nmakes \nit \nnice. \nPlus \nmy  \nparents \ngave \nup \na \nlot  \nto  \nhelp \nme  \nrace \n—  \nthey \ncould’ve \nspent \nmoney \non  \nthemselves \ninstead \nof \nbuying \nme \ntyres, \nso \nI \nwanted \nthem \nto \ncome. \nSo you get homesick? \nNot \nreally. \nWhen \nthe \nEuropean \nraces \nstarted \nin \nMay \nI \ndid \nstruggle \na \nlot. \nMy \nresults \nweren’t \ngoing \nthat \ngood, \nand \nyou're \nnot \ngoing \nto \nbe \nhaving \n\nHAYDEN: \nHOW \nHE  \nLEARNED \nTO  \nWIN \nTHE \nMOTOGP \nCROWN \n233 \nfun when your results are  bad. I’ve  been home a couple of times in the \nbreaks. I live  on  the  east coast, it’s not  like  coming from California, it’s \na  smaller time difference and four or  five hours less flying time. \nYou  said a  while back that you reckon all  the  paddock VIP hospitality is a \nbit OTT... \nYeah, when I first came here I was more impressed by the  run-off on \nthe  tracks. Some of the  tracks in America are a bit  scary. They’re really \non  it here, it’s  so  much more organised, you don’t see  bikes laying in \nthe  gravel traps for  a  whole session like back home. That’s impressed \nme  more than how good the  food is. \nHave you  been surprised by how little partying there is? \nI didn’t really come in with any expectation of that but  it’s  pretty laid \nback. In America they get a little wild on  Sunday night, some races you \nbetter look out  because some people get pretty crazy! Racing paddocks \nare  serious places but  that’s the way it is and I like to see  people focused. \nBut here everyone seems to  know how to  relax in  the evenings, it’s \npretty mellow, Sunday night everyone goes their own way but that’s \ncool. I’m not  really a partier, I don’t really drink. \nWe  heard a story about you  and your brothers getting so  rowdy on  a plane that \nthey had  to land the thing... \nIt was landing anyway, the story got out  of hand just like they do, it wasn’t \nnear as  big a deal as  it got  made out. There was a  bunch of racers on  the \nplane, and it was just racers the way they are  sometimes, I guess, you've \nmet enough, any of the fast ones have a little bit of an  edge to them. It was \nreally rough as  we  were coming into land, so  my  little brother put  his \nhelmet on  and  the steward didn’t think that was funny. But  my mom was \non  the plane and she wouldn’t let us  do anything out  of hand. \nWhat about the girls over  here? \nI don’t have a girlfriend, I’m  pretty much single, but  there’s a lot of hot \nchicks \nin \nEurope, \nthere \nwas \ndefinitely \na \nlot \nof \ntalent \nin \nthe \nItalian \npaddock, and in Czecho. \nIt doesn’t distract you? \nNo,  I wouldn’t say  it distracts me. \n\n234 THE FAST STUFF \nSo they've not been throwing themselves at you? . \n[After much laughter] Well, I mean I’m just a 22-year-old guy, what do \nyou think? \nWho were your heroes as  a kid? \nMy main guy was Bubba Shobert [the three-time AMA Grand National \nchamp whose career ended in his  debut GP  season after a freak accident \nat  Laguna Seca]. He was the  guy who did  dirt track then roadracing, he \nhad a big future till he got hurt. When I was a kid  I went to  a pro  race, I \nwas in the  pits and he  took extra time with me  and my  brothers, even \nthough he didn’t know who I was, so  from there on  out  he was my  guy. \nI try to remember that when I see  kids and fans, I always try to be nice. \nDo you  have a grand plan? \nYeah, my  plan is  to  be  world champion, and more than once, pretty \nsimple really. I’m  trying to  put  the  pieces together, to  understand the \nlife, to  understand the  circuits and the  bike, and I know it’s  not  going \nto be easy. \nEpilogue: you know the story. Hayden did get  it  together and did \nbecome world champ. \nMotoGP Mutterings: september 2003 \nThere’s more money than ever in  MotoGP right now but not \neveryone has turned into arses. Hard to  believe, I know... \nBreathe in and relaaaaaaaaaaax... Time to  head back into the  primal- \nscreaming MotoGP paddock, where Machiavelli would find the  going \ntough and where trophy girlfriends paddle ankle-deep in  testosterone \nas  they prowl from pit lane to VIP hospitality suite. But  we’re giving all \nthat a wide berth today; instead we're wandering along the millionaire’ s \nrow of motorhomes, looking for  some nice people to hang with. \nThey do  exist in  MotoGP, believe me, and the  good guy count has \nblown up  this year, thanks to  the arrival of  three new riders: Troy \nBayliss, Colin Edwards and Nicky Hayden. These three former Supers \nstars are  the total opposite of the biggest ‘stronzo’ (Italian for something \nwe  can’t mention here) on  the  MotoGP grid, who I won’t name. Oh, \n\nNOT EVERYONE HAS TURNED INTO ARSES 23D \nokay, I’ll  give you a  clue, he wears a  goatee. I mean, Bayliss, Edwards \nand Hayden actually treat people like me  as  fellow human beings, \nrather than some kind of untouchable. One senior figure in  MotoGP \ncalls us  journalists ‘The Scum’, although I can’t imagine why. \nAnyway, let’s kick things off by knocking on  the  door of the  Bayliss \nwagon. Inside it’s  kiddie chaos —  kids Mitchell and Abbey are  larking \naround with McWilliams’ boys and some other random paddock urchins. \n‘Hey Mitchell, it’s  a  disaster in  here, can you tidy up  some of  those \nGameboy things,’ pleads Bayliss reasonably, though this is just minutes \nafter he’s dumped his  Duke out  of sixth place in the Italian GP. \nBayliss is super cool. He’s got fewer airs and graces than the pit-lane \ntoilet attendant —  a genuinely normal bloke with a very abnormal talent \nfor  thrashing a  motorcycle half to  death. But boy, can he  be  intense, \nwith big burning eyes just like Mick Doohan’s. In  fact that’s Bayliss — \nhe’s Micky D with a big cheesy grin. At  the  2003 German GP  he went \nskinhead purely to  cheer up  a pissed-off Ducati cook \nwho'd had his head shaved, against his will, by fellow \nteam members. His rock-solid attitude may have ‘You take a  bull, you \nsomething to  do  with the  fact that he  understands cut off its balls, you \nthe  realities of life  —  he  spray-painted motors for  a dangle them in front \nliving until his late 20s. Of course, he’s got his quirks, of its face, then you \nlike he gets a bit  dark when things aren’t going right climb on  its back’ \nand he’s one of those riders who hates talking about \nbike set-up, because he’s paranoid about his  rivals \ndiscovering his  secrets. Tech chats with Bayliss tend to  go  like this: \n‘Troy, what’ve you been working on?’ ‘The bike, mate.’ ‘What areas \nexactly?’ ‘All of it.’  ‘Front or  rear?’ ‘Ah Jeez, the  front.’ ‘Suspension, \ntyres, what?’ ‘Ah, just the  whole front, mate.’ \nWhen it  comes to  talking about his  motorcycle, Edwards is  the \nopposite; \nhe’s \nhappy \nto \nget \ninvolved \nin \ndeep \ntechnical \nchat \nwhile \nwife \nAlyssia \nchanges \nbaby \nGracie’s \nnappies \non \nthe \nnext \ncouch \nin \ntheir \nmotorhome. \nAnd \nno \none \nknows \nhow \nto \nget \ntheir \npoint \nacross \nbetter; \nthis \nis \nhow \nhe \ndescribes \nwhat \nit’s \nlike \nto \nride \nhis \nAprilia \nMotoGP \nbike: \n‘You \ntake \na \nbull, \nyou \ncut \noff \nits \nballs, \nyou \ndangle \nthem \nin \nfront \nof \nits \nface, \nthen \nyou \nclimb \non \nits \nback’. \nJust \nlike \nhis \nold \nWorld \nSupers \nrival, \nEdwards \nis \nfor \nreal, \nhe’s \nfar \ntoo \nmuch \nof \na \nreasonable \nhuman \nbeing \nto \nlet \nhimself \nbecome \na \nMotoGP \narse. \nMost \nimportantly, \nhe \ndoes \nlike \na \nbeer \nor \nfive \nwhen \nhe’s \nnot \nriding. \nAt \nthe \n2002 \nValencia \nGP \n(some \ntime \n\n236 THE FAST STUFF \nafter he had wrapped up  his  second Supers title) he  spent most of his \ntime in Rossi’s Nastro Azzurro hospitality unit, taking full advantage of \nthe sponsor’s product and talking with anyone who happened by. \nAgain, that ain’t normal practice in GP  racing. Bayliss likes a drink too \n—  he’ll even sink a  couple of glasses of wine the  night before practice: \n‘Just to help me  sleep, mate’. \nI don’t really know Hayden that well but he’s having fun, which is the \nmain thing. He  greets people with a hip hop handshake and a ‘How you \ndoin’, dude?’, says ‘Dang!’ a lot and reckons everyone in the  paddock is \ncool, with one exception. ‘I haven’t had a  problem with anyone, other \nthan Biaggi,’ says Hayden. In  fact, Hayden has had a  problem with \nsomeone else in the  paddock. Me. I gave the  guy a bit  of a  scare a  few \nweeks back; not  my  fault really, more the  fact that I used to  go out  with \na  girl called Nicky. You see, she  was on  a  group email Id  sent, at  least I \nthought I’d  sent it to  her, but  I must’ve been half asleep when I hit  the \n‘send’ button, because the  message went to  Nicky Hayden, not Nicky \nWalters. Oh, the dangers of modern technology, like a USAF ‘smart’ bomb \ngone awry. So what was in the email? Hmmm, it was an  invite to a music \nfestival, which a  gang of us  were planning to  attend. The email went \nsomething like this: ‘Hey Nicky, fancy getting fucked up  in a field in \nWales in August?’ I explained the ghastly error to  Nicky the  next time I \nsaw him. He  laughed. Nervously. \n\nCHAPTER 33 \nDIRTY TRICKS OF  THE \nRACETRACK \nSeptember 2003 \nRacing is  all  about going fast but sometimes there’s a  rider in \nyour way. So what do you do then? Get dirty. Mick Doohan, Niall \nMackenzie and King Kenny Roberts discuss the dirty tricks \nemployed by desperate racers \n‘Motorcycle racing,’ as  Max Biaggi once famously said after a  rival \naccused him of dodgy riding, ‘isn’t ballroom dancing.’ Pretty obvious, \nreally, but bike racing is  much nastier than that, and probably more \nbitchy too. It’s more like high-speed rollerball, though more subtle. \nThere’s not  a  half-successful racer in  the  world who doesn’t get  up  to \nsome kind of mischief in his  quest for glory (though in researching this \nstory I quickly realised that it’s  only retired riders who'll talk about this \nkind of stuff), while the  more evil riders commit truly heinous crimes \nthat risk rivals’ lives. \nThere’s the standard dirty tricks that everyone does —  like gently \nmoving a rival off line when braking into a corner, or  easing an  opponent \naway from the grippy line mid-turn. Then there’s the nastier tactics —  like \nshutting the  throttle halfway through a  corner to  force someone into \ntaking drastic avoiding action, thus losing them vital time. And then \nthere’s the  seriously dangerous stuff — like  running a rival onto the  grass \nat  high speed, or  deliberately colliding with them, or  hitting their kill \nswitch, or  shutting their throttle, or  punching or  kicking them. \nEven legends like King Kenny Roberts and Mick Doohan happily \nadmit to  getting dirty. It’s just what goes on,  it’s  a war out  there. Like it \nor  not, bike racing is  a  ferocious game of  testosterone-charged \nheavyweight \nboxing \nwith \nhigh-powered \nengines \nattached. \nMaybe \nit'd \nbe \ncool \nif \nit \nwas \nall \nnice \nand \ngentlemanly \nbut \nthat’s \nnot \nhow \nit \nworks. \nEven \nback \nin \nthe \nso-called \nchivalrous \ndays \nof \nthe \n1950s \nand \n1960s \nthere \nare \ntales \nof \nbe-goggled \nracers \ngobbing \nat \neach \nother \nmid-race! \nAnd \nif \n\n238 THE FAST STUFF \nthese revelations make you watch bike racing with a more cynical eye, \nso  be it. If you want peace and love, there’s always Songs of Praise. \nRoberts wasn’t one of the  really bad guys. He  insists that he  never \nknocked anyone off when he was doing GPs, but  the hard-knocks dirt- \ntrack scene in  the  States was different. ‘One time going through this \nturn I felt this guy’s clutch lever on  my right foot, so  I just gassed it and \nflipped him off,’ says the  King who won a  heap of dirt-track crowns \nbefore taking back-to-back 500 titles in  1978, \"79  and ’80. ‘He came \nover after and wanted to  know why I'd  knocked him down and I said, \n“Well, the  reason I knocked you down is that you put your clutch lever \non  my  foot”, so  he  started shouting that I’d  knocked him down and I \nsaid, “Yeah, and next time you do that I’ll knock you down again”. You \nknow, it’s  just one of the  things, if anyone does something like that to \nyou, well, sorry... But normally it’s  the  guys who aren’t so  quick who \nhave all  the  tricks, the  quick guys don’t need them so  much. Like me \nand (Barry) Sheene were real clean, we  never did anything and we \nnever had to.  I never even thought about it, other than that time Freddie \naced me  off the  track in Sweden (an infamous move that won Spencer \nthe  1983 500 title). I thought about doin’ something the  next race but \nI still couldn’t allow myself. Every guy has  his  style, every guy has  his \nbag of tricks, and when you race them enough you start to  learn who \ndoes what.’ \nFive-time 500 champ Doohan, who ruled the  mid-1990s GP  scene \nwith a pitiless talent, was renowned as  much for his ruthless aggression \nas  for  his  awesome skill. ‘I wouldn’t say  I’ve knocked people off  the \ntrack but  I’ve maybe “lifted” them off  the  track,’ he  says. ‘Like when \nsomeone thinks they can go  around the  outside, you just pick up  and \nmodify your line. They’re already committed, so  there’s only one place \nleft  to  go,  and that’s normally off  the  track. I guess it’s  a  good way to \nbring cocky people back to earth, just to let them know that it’s not  like \nthis is your first race.’ \nDoohan had a  couple of  famous run-ins with a  young Anthony \nGobert in ’97.  Goey had made the  mistake of goading Mighty Mick in \nthe press and he paid the price on  track. ‘As  much as  everyone thought \nGoey \nwas \nso \ngreat, \nhe \njust \nhad \nno \nracecraft \nback \nthen,’ \nDoohan \nrecalls. \n‘You'd \ndo \nquite \na \nclean \nmove \non \nhim, \nthen \nhe’d \ncome \nat \nyou \nfrom \na \ndifferent \nangle, \nso \nit \nwas \nlike, \n“Hello \nstupid, \ntry \nthis!”, \nand \nthe \nnext \nminute \nhe’d \nbe \noff \nthe \nracetrack. \nThen \nhe’d \ncome \nin \ncomplaining \nabout \n\nDIRTY TRICKS OF  THE RACETRACK 239 \ndirty riding, but I wouldn’t try  to  intimidate somebody when I’m  not \nup  to  their speed and have nowhere near as  much racecraft.’ \nEven former British champ, GP nearly man and all-round nice guy Niall \nMackenzie had his  moments of  malevolence, like Snetterton BSB '98, \nwhen he rammed team-mate Steve Hislop off the  track. ‘Steve had some \nkind of effect on  me,  maybe because he’d done something to me  earlier in \nmy career, so  I had no  problem running into him and compromising \neveryone’s’safety,’ he  says, laughing at the  madness of it all, as  racers do. \n‘It  was the  last  lap and I'd  considered doing it at  the  Bomb Hole but  I \nwasn’t close enough, so  I did  it at  the  chicane. I just ran  into the  side of \nhim, we  both ran  off the  track and it cost us  first and second, which Rob \n(McElnea, their team manager) wasn’t too  impressed about! I frightened \nmyself thinking about it driving home that night, because if I’d done it at \nthe Bomb Hole we'd both have been in hospital.’ \nEarlier in  his career, Mackenzie remembers competing in  the \nEuropean final of the  infamously crazed Yamaha 350LC Pro-Am series \nat  Hockenheim and dealing with a  much-feared French rival in \nhomicidal style. ‘The Brits ganged up  on  this guy,’ he remembers. ‘Me, \nRay Swann, Graham Cannell and Kenny Irons decided he was a bit hot, \nand he was little, so we  knew he'd be really fast down the long straights, \nso  we  bullied him. We took turns during practice —  you get  in  a  big \nslipstream thing there, you get  to  the  front of the  queue, then you get \nslipstreamed, so  every time it was his  turn we'd just run him off  the \ntrack.’ The Frenchman returned to  the  pits in  tears and didn’t cause \nany problems on  race day. \nI remember similar stuff going on  at  the  Isle of Man TT  —  the  last \nplace you'd expect riders to threaten each other's lives. Perhaps thinking \nhe  was still riding Pro-Am on a relatively safe short circuit, Cannell \ndrafted \nby \nme \nand \ncut \nacross \nmy \nfront, \nthe \nrear \nend \nof \nhis \nbike \njust \nmissing \nmy \nfront \nwheel. \nThe \nidea \nof \nthis \ntrick \nisn’t \nnecessarily \nto \nknock \na \nrival \ndown, \njust \nto \ncost \nhim \nsome \ntime \nand \nscare \nhim \nwitless. \nI’ll \nleave \nMackenzie \nto \nexplain \nhow \nthe \nfront-end \nchop \nworks: \n‘That \ngoes \non \na \nlot, \nstill \ndoes. \nThe \nguy \nbehind \nhas \nto \nback \noff \nbecause \nthe \nrear \nof \nthe \nbike \nis \nso \nsolid, \nso \nwhen \nyou \nget \na \ncollision, \nit’s \ngoing \nto \nbe \nthe \nguy \nbehind \nwho \ngoes \ndown.’ \nAnd \nin \nendurance \nracing, \nthe \nfunny \nguys \nat \nthe \nBol \nd’Or \nwould \nhit \nyour \nkill \nswitch \nas \nthey \ndrafted \npast \nyou \ndown \nCircuit \nPaul \nRicard’s \nlong \nMistral \nstraight. \nAll \nvery \namusing, \nunless \nthere’s another rider just behind. \n\n240 THE FAST STUFF \nEveryone always used to say that Mackenzie was too  nice to be world \nchampion. But  what about someone like Loris Capirossi, who won the \n98  250 world title by ramming Aprilia team-mate Tetsuya Harada off \nthe  track at the last but  one  corner of the last race? Capirossi is just like \nMackenzie —  sweet as  pie  off  a  bike, transmogrified on  track. That’s \nracers for  you —  it’s  a  Jekyll & Hyde deal. ‘Unless you’ve been a rider \nyou don’t understand the  red  mist thing,’ explains Mackenzie, who \nreckons the  Capirossi collision wasn’t premeditated. ‘He  could see  the \nchampionship going, so  he took a chance, sometimes there’s no  time to \ncalculate the consequences. At worst he probably thought they’d collide, \nrun wide and it’d  be  a  scramble to  the  finish line but the  red  mist \nconfused his  judgement. I don’t think it was a  desperate attempt to \ntake out  Harada.’ \nDoohan reckons he  was more victim than villain during his  career. \n‘I’ve been done by guys who put  you off  the  track even in a straight \nline,’ he  says. ‘They draft you and when they’re beside you they lean \ninto you, put  you on  the  white line, so  you’ve got  to  shut down, or  go \non  the  grass. (Wayne) Gardner did  that to  me  down the  front straight \nat Phillip Island in 1990, at around 290kays. He drafted past and started \npushing me  over. I had to  throw my  foot off the  inside ‘peg, it was the \nonly way to  shift some weight to  stop me  going off the  track. That was \npretty blatant. And (Luca) Cadalora ran  me  onto the  grass coming out \nof a  six-gear right-hander at  Shah Alam once, just ran up  beside me \nand actually pushed me  off  the track. I’d  never go  that far. I’d  say \nGardner, Cadalora and Biaggi were the  three worst guys I raced with. \nBiaggi even tries to  intimidate people on  slowdown laps.’ \nGardner angrily refutes Doohan’s version of events at  Phillip Island: \n‘To  suggest that I was a  dangerous rider is a  complete insult. I didn’t \ncome anywhere near him, I passed him fair and square, but  that’s when \nI had the  broken fairing, which was dragging on  the  road, and I had a \nbroken wrist, too. I remember quite clearly the bike wanting to  steer to \nthe left  down the hill. Maybe the  draft was bigger than normal because \nthe  fairing was half off,  in  fact I think they were thinking of black- \nflagging me  at  the  time.’ \nIntimidation is  the real deal. These mad stabs aren’t just about \nwinning a  position there and then, they’re about establishing a \nreputation with other riders. If everyone knows you're a nutter, they’re \nmore likely to get out  of your way, so  next time you’re on  track together, \n\nDIRTY TRICKS OF  THE RACETRACK 241 \nyou're going to have an  easier time overtaking them, and they're going \nto be more wary of overtaking you. ‘Intimidation is what it’s  all about,’ \nagrees Doohan. ‘If you do that kind of stuff enough, it gets to the point \nwhere people know as  soon as  they see  you: ‘I may as  well shut down \nnow because it’s not  like  he’s going to do me  any favours’. Sure, there’s \nplenty of times I scared the  hell out  of people, and if they ran  off  the \nracetrack that was their problem, but I’ve never intentionally put \nanyone off the  racetrack. It’s just a matter of keeping your position on \nthe  track, and perhaps modifying your position from where you'd be if \nthere was no  one else there, for  no  other reason than to  intimidate \nother guys and mess with their heads. Luca established his  reputation \nwith me  by pushing me  onto the  grass at  Shah Alam, so  I knew that if \nI came up on  him again, I'd have to pass him fairly swiftly or  he might \nput me  in a position I didn’t want to  be in.’ \nMackenzie again: ‘You need to  establish your \nreputation from day one. You’ve got  to  stamp your \nauthority and make everyone believe that you’re not ‘I scared the hell out \ngoing to  back off, because if you do  back off, next of people, and if they \ntime they’re not  going to  let  you in.  If someone like ran  off the  track \nTroy Bayliss shows you a  wheel, you know he’s that was their \ncoming through. And in   car racing, Michael problem, but I’ve \nSchumacher has definitely got  that respect, and he never intentionally \nknows that they know he’s there.’ put anyone off \nOf course, racers live  by the  sword and die  by the the track’ \nsword; you  try and intimidate the other guy, but if he’s \nbigger and badder than you are, maybe you'll regret \nhaving had a  go  next time you come across each other. ‘You definitely \nremember \nwho \ndid \nwhat \nto \nyou,’ \nsays \nRoberts. \n‘It’s \na \nhighly \ndangerous \nsport \nbut \nyou \nhave \na \nzone \nyou’re \ncomfortable \nwith, \nthen \nyou \nhave \naggression \nand \nthen \nyou \nhave \nanger. \nSo \nit’s \nlike: \nI’m \nnot \ngoin’ \nto \ngive \nthat \nasshole \nan \ninch \nbecause \nhe \ndidn’t \ngive \nme \nan \ninch \nlast \ntime”.’ \nSchumacher \nhas \nbeen \ndisciplined \nby \nF1 \nbosses \nfor \noverdoing \nhis \nking \nof \nthe \ntrack \nact, \nbut \nofficial \nretribution \nis \nrare \nin \nbike \nracing, \nmaybe \nbecause \nsqueezing \nrivals \nis \nso \nroutine. \nOccasionally \nriders \ndo \nget \nnailed, \nlike \n125 \nhard-nut \nManuel \nPoggiali, \nwho \nwas \ndisqualified \nfrom \nMay’s \nSpanish \nGP \nfor \nbrazenly \nknocking \ndown \nfellow \nteenage \nheadbanger \nAlex \nde \nAngelis. \nOr \nperhaps \nthey \ncop \nan \nofficial \nreprimand, \nlike \nwhen \nBiaggi \nran \nValentino \nRossi \nonto \nthe \ndirt \nas \nthey \nswept \nonto \nthe \nstart- \n\n242 THE FAST STUFF \nfinish straight at  Suzuka in 2001. In fact both riders were censured for \nthat incident, because Rossi shouldn’t have been so  naive as  to  believe \nthat Biaggi would give him the space to  run past on  the  outside. In \nother words, this  is motorcycle racing —  you should know you're not  the \nonly maniac on  the track. Following that clash, FIM president Francesco \nZerbi wrote an  open letter to  the pair: ‘to reproach you  both, in order to \ninvite you to  more attentively and correctly control your actions and \nreactions, without taking anything away from your fighting instinct, \nyour desire for victory, your skill, your courage and the sporting qualities \nthat a  true champion shows to  all  the world.’ Yeah, right. Ten \nweeks later Rossi and Biaggi were boxing each other’s lights out  at  the \nCatalan GP... \nInvariably riders get  let  off  the  hook because most of  the  crimes \ncommitted on  track are  so  subtle, and because they’re very much a part \nof bike racing. After all,  it’s  the  ducking and diving, the  feints and the \nparries and the scary moments that make the  sport so  exciting to watch. \nFor  example, what Biaggi did  to  Rossi at  Suzuka is an  everyday ploy in \ntight situations. ‘Sometimes you don’t get  a  good drive out  of a  corner \nbut  you casually use  all  the  track even if you don’t need it,’  explains \nMackenzie. ‘You know the  guy behind may get  a  good drive and try to \ngo  round your outside, so  you use  all  the  track and the  kerb, because \nthere’s no  way they’re going to want to use the  grass.’ \nRiders use  a similar tactic on  the way into corners. Mackenzie again: \n‘You brake a little longer than normal, so  the  guy behind can’t turn in \nwhere he  wants to,  because you're still there braking. You just slow it \nall down, hit the apex as  normal, and the other guy has  to file in behind \nor  run  off the  track.’ \nSome riders do the  same kind of thing mid-corner —  just ease off the \nthrottle, so  whoever’s following has to  back off, run off  line and, er, \nmaybe crash. ‘I was never really guilty of that,’ says Mackenzie. ‘  But I \nknow a lot  of people who did  do it. Gardner definitely did, and I know \n(Eddie) Lawson gave him a  few warnings, told him the  next time he \ntried it he was going to be in big trouble. I remember Gardner doing it \nat  the  last  turn at  Laguna Seca because it’s  so  slow. You  just get off the \nthrottle and then get  back on  it,  the  bike pretty much stops and the \nother guy has to  pick up. It’s  not hugely dangerous but it  can cost \nwhoever a lot of time because they get off line and then they’re probably \nin too  tall  a gear. It’s  a dirtier tactic, I didn’t use  it because I felt  like  it \n\nDIRTY TRICKS OF  THE RACETRACK 243 \ncould cost me  time, and it’s  definitely risky because the  guy could run \ninto you and you'll both be down. But  it’s  very effective if it works.’ \nShifting rivals off  line is  even more effective nowadays, because \nroadracing has  become like  dirt  track, with a narrow grippy line, beyond \nwhich there’s little traction. ‘The thing is that bikes have got  a lot more \ngrip now, so you don’t get the variation in lines that you used to,’ explains \nRoberts. ‘You used to  be able to watch at  a chicane and say,  “That guy’s \ngot the right line and that guy  hasn't”, but now everyone’s got the  same \nline because they’ve all  got  so  much corner speed. So  there’s only one \npart of the  track being used —  maybe a metre or  a metre and a half —  and \nthe rest of the track isn’t so  grippy. So it’s like dirt track, where you've got \nthe  grippy notch. You see  a  guy coming and you just move out  to  the \nedge of the notch, and that leaves them nothing.’ \nAnd if that doesn’t work you can let  a  rival come alongside on  the \nstraight and just shut his  throttle. Sounds crazy, but the  late Kenny \nIrons (who died in a freak accident at Cadwell in ’88) once did just that \nto  250 rival Pete Hubbard at  Brands. Hubbard’s bike was quicker, so \nIrons took his left  hand off the handlebar as  they approached the finish \nline and grabbed Hubbard’s right hand, easing the throttle shut. \nMackenzie and Irons were big mates and the  Scot remembers the Luton \nrider’s \ntactics \nwith \ngreat \naffection. \n‘He \ndid \nsome \nscary \nstuff \nto \nme \nbut \nhe \nalways \ndid \nit \nwith \na \nsmile \non \nhis \nface, \njust \nfor \na \nlaugh.’ \nRacers \nare \nstrange people, with a  strange sense of humour... \nInsane \nin \nthe \nbrain, \ninsane \nin \nthe \nmembrane \nYou \nwouldn’t \nbelieve \nthe \noff-track \npsychological \ntorture \nthat \ngoes \non... \nMost \nracers \ndon’t \neven \nwait \nto  \nget \non  \nthe  \nracetrack \nbefore \ngetting \nup  \nto \ntheir \ntricks. \nPsychological \nwarfare \nis \na \nmajor \npart \nof \nmotorcycle \nracing \nand \nit \ntakes \nall \nforms. \nWhen \nJohn \nKocinski \nled \nthe \nearly \nstages \nof \nthe \n‘94 \n500 \nworld \nchampionship, \narch-enemy \nKevin \nSchwantz \nput \nup \na \n$10,000 \nbounty \nfor \nanyone \nwho'd \nsleep \nwith \nKocinski’s \ngirlfriend. \nMaybe \nSchwantz \ndidn’t \nexpect \nanyone \nto \ngo \nfor \nit, \nbut \nhe \nknew \nword \nwould \nget \naround \nthe \npaddock \nand \ndestabilise \nhis \nrival. \n‘Kevin \nwas \nquite \ngood \nat \nthat \nkind \nof \nthing,’ \nremembers \nMackenzie. \n‘He’d \nalso \nsay \nsubtle \nstuff, \nknowing \nthat \nKocinski \nwould \nread \nit. \nHe \ndidn’t \ndo \nit \nmaliciously, \nbut \nwith \na \nsort \nof \nair \nof \nintelligence.’ \nSubtlety \nis \neverything \nin \nthe  \noff-track \npsych-out. \nRiders \nwho \ntell  \nthe \n\n244 THE FAST STUFF \nworld that they’re going to kick ass  on  race day only inspire their rivals \nto  try  harder, which is  why you don’t often hear that kind of  talk. \nDoohan was a master of keeping a low profile off track: ‘People who say \nshit only drive people to beat them even more. I always found it best to \nbe emotionless, then no  one’s got any more desire to  beat you. I guess \nI was fairly radical about the way I went racing. I was there to do a job, \nI wasn’t really interested in any of the  other garbage going on,  because \nthere’s a lot of that going on  in the paddock. I probably came across as \nfairly cold and emotionless and I never used to  say  a  lot,  which kept \npeople guessing as  to what I was thinking. With some other guys there’s \nnot  a lot of guesswork, but  I wanted it so  that people never really knew \nwhere I was at.  I was just a bit of an  oddball really...’ \nMackenzie was probably Doohan’s closest mate when they were doing \nGPs together. ‘Mick was really aware of how Gardner would come out \nwith whatever he  thought, which would fire Mick up  even more. He \nknew what motivated him, people winding him up  made him dig  in \neven more, so  he was really conscious of not  doing it to anyone else.’ \nMackenzie’s own brand of race psychology required him to be nice to \neveryone, whether he  was racing GPs or  BSB. ‘There’s two ways of \ndealing with rivals —  you either don’t speak to  them or  you’re mates. \nSomeone like John Reynolds wouldn’t be  rude but he  wouldn’t \ncommunicate, he’d just go away and get in his little shell. Now I’m  not \nracing he’s my  mate but  he  told me  recently that when we  were racing \neach other he couldn’t befriend me. I was the opposite, I’d be everyone’s \nmate so  they didn’t hate me, a  bit  like Mick. Maybe Mick wouldn’t \nmake an  effort to  be  friends with anyone but  I was quite happy to  be \nfriends with everyone. [James] Whitham told me  that when we  were \nteam-mates in  '96, he  used to  try  and dig  deep to  hate me, but he \ncouldn’t hate me  enough to get more motivated. I was aware of that —  if \npeople were my  mates they wouldn’t be so  desperate to beat me.’ \nThat’s your motorcycle racers for you —  a  lovely bunch of two-faced \nvicious bastards. Which is why we  love ‘em. \n\nCHAPTER 34 \nTHE COOLEST RACERS IN  THE \nWORLD, EVER \nSeptember 2003 \nTen racing icons with more than pure speed going for them \nHow to  define cool? In  a  motorcycle racer? First things first —  the \nguy’s got  to  be  seriously fast, obviously. Beyond that he’s got  to  have \nan  aura, an  attitude, which is  more difficult to  define than mere \nspeed. It’s  all  about the  way he  carries himself, the  way he  looks, the \nway he  acts, the  company he  keeps, how much fun he  can handle. It \ndoesn’t necessarily matter what clothes he  wears or  which ladies he \nhangs out  with, but  the  right gear and the  right girl can make all  the \ndifference. Basically, he’s got to be the kind of guy  you’d want to  spend \na  night out with, the  kind of person who spreads a little fun around \nthe  place. \nHe  needs charisma, he’s got  to  be bright and funny, he’s got  to  have \nballs and he’s got  to  do  things his  own way —  simpering, sponsor- \nfriendly rentamouths don’t get a look-in here. He’ll require a love of the \ngood things in life —  partying, ladies, that kind of thing —  and he’ll need \nto  be  passionate about what he  does, not  robotic. Finally, he  needs a \ncertain I-don’t-give-a-fuck air  about him, and a  few bad habits will \nhelp as  well, but  that doesn’t mean he’s got to be an  asshole. So there’s \nno  specific template, some of these riders are  cool because they’re bad, \nother because they're good, others because they’re nuts, others because \nthey’re funny and a  few  because they’re a  bit  of everything. \n1 -  Barry Sheene \nBarry \nSheene \nwasn’t \nmerely \na \nworld-title-winning \nbike \nracer, \nhe \nwas \na \n1970s \nicon \nalong \nwith \nfellow \nsportsmen \nPele, \nMuhammad \nAli, \nGeorge \nBest \nand \nJames \nHunt. \nLike \nthem \nhe \nwas \na \nsign \nof \nthe \ntimes \n— \nbrash \nand \nbrave, cheeky and captivating. \nHe \nwas \nthe  \nLondon \nboy \nmade \ngood, \nwho \nraced \nlike \na \ndemon, \npartied \nlike \nhell \nand \nran \noff \nwith \nthe \nwife \nof \na \ntop \nfashion \nphotographer. \nYou \n\n246 THE FAST STUFF \ncouldn’t have made it  up.  Even his  name sounded \n‘Sheene had it all unreal, like  bike racing’s own David Bowie. \ndown: the attitude, Sheene had it all  down: the  attitude, the  mouth, \nthe mouth, the girl the  girl, the  gear and the  motor —  he  shunned boy- \nand the motor — he racer stuff like Ferraris in  favour of  Rollers. Proper \nshunned boy-racer geezer. And he  definitely had a  bit  of  the  bad boy \nstuff like  Ferraris in about him. Sheene’s reputation as  a  hard-partying \nfavour of Rollers. gossip-column regular did  sometimes distract from \nProper geezer’ his  talent for racing motorcycles at a time when they \nwere recalcitrant beasts, and when death really did \nstare riders in  the  face. Sheene will almost certainly \nforever have his  place in  history as  the  winner of the  fastest-ever GP, \nwhich is pretty damned cool. He  won the 1977 Belgian 500 GP  at  an \naverage speed of  135mph, and this- was around the terrifying Spa \nFrancorchamps street circuit, threading his  way between trees, hedges \nand rusting Armco on  a fickle two-stroke that might lock solid at \nany moment. \nSheene’s career peaked at  a moment when sport and serious money \ncollided for  the  first time, and, like  many wealthy young sportsmen or \npop stars of  his  generation, he  was an  engine for  social change — \nbreaking down barriers of English snobbery by walking into posh hotels \nwearing little more than a pair of cut-off denim shorts, refusing pleas \nthat he dress suitably. He was a captivating character like Best, Ali, Pele \nand Hunt. These men played hard by day and even harder by night — \ntheir like will not  be  seen again. \nYears in top level racing: (1971-1984) \nBikes ridden: Suzuki 50,  Suzuki 125, Derbi and Yamaha 250s, \nSuzuki and Yamaha 500s \nGreatest achievements: 1976/1977 500  world champ \nWhere is he now: died from cancer March 2003 \n2 -  Gary Nixon \nGary Nixon was always in  the  running for  the  top  ten, just because \nwe'd heard a lot  of hilarious stories about the  guy. And then we  met \nhim. After five minutes he was definitely in. After a couple more drinks \nwe  were serious considering sticking him in  the  top  five. We’ve never \nmet another racer who’s so  funny, not even Kenny Roberts. \n\nTHE COOLEST RACERS IN  THE WORLD, EVER 247 \nNixon raced and partied with the  best of them in the  1970s, and he \nstraddled that era  when four-strokes were getting overtaken by the \nstrokers. In fact he represented that age  of change more than any other \nrider, because one moment he  was racing British-made Triumph four- \nstrokes, the  next Japanese-built Kawasaki two-strokes. \nNixon used to  hang out  plenty with Sheene, who used to  call  him \n‘Nickers’. He was a hugely fast  racer, and  would’ve won the ’76  Formula \n750  world title if there hadn’t been a major FIM cock-up. But  it seemed \nlike the  prime motive throughout his  career was less racetrack success \nand more off-track fun. By  all  accounts, the American was pretty \nsuccessful on  both counts, but more so  the  second. He also broke masses \nof bones —  several of his crunching crashes suffered at  the handlebars of \ndodgy two-strokes that locked solid at  150-ish and pitched him into \ntrackside trees. Like many of his  peers he  developed a certain fondness \nfor  medication during lengthy hospital spells —  he  once racked up  a \n60-hour phone bill while lying in  hospital in  the UK, phoning his \nAmerican girlfriend on  morphine. And how did he look? Like Krusty the \nClown but  effortlessly cool at  the  same time. Big respect, Mr  Nixon. \nYears in top level racing: 1963-1979 \nBikes ridden: Harley dirt trackers, Triumph dirt trackers and \n1000 triples, Kawasaki, Suzuki and Yamaha 750s \nGreatest achievements: 1967 Daytona 200 winner, 2nd 1976 Formula \n750  world championship \nWhere is he now: occasional classic racer/MotoGP gofer \n3 —  Kenny Roberts \nKenny Roberts is  a  bit  of a  redneck, and rednecks ain’t cool, so  how \ncome the  King gets into this list? Cheeky of you to  ask, but  Mr  Roberts \nis \nthe \nworld’s \nmost \nopen-minded \nredneck, \nsomeone \nwho’s \nmanaged \nto \nleave \nthe \nprejudices \nof \nthat \ncowboy \nworld \nway \nbehind \nhim \nand \ncome \nto \nterms \nwith \nlife \nin \nthe \nreal \nworld. \nOf \ncourse \nhe’s \ndone \nmuch \nmore \nthan \ncome \nto \nterms \nwith \nthe \nworld, \nhe’s \nruled \nit. \nRoberts \nwas \nthe \ndon \nof \nthe \nHicksville \nworld \nof \nUS \ndirt \ntrack, \nbefore \nhe \ntravelled \nto \nEurope \nrelatively \nlate \nin \nhis \ncareer \nto \nlift \nthe \n500 \nworld \nchampionship \nat \nhis \nfirst \nattempt \nin \n’78, \nnicking \nthe \ncrown \nfrom \nSheeney. \nHe \nwent \non \nto \nwin \nthree \nback- \nto-back \n500 \ntitles, \nthen \nmoved \ninto \nteam \nmanagement, \nwinning \nseveral \nworld \nchampionships \nbefore \ntiring \nof \nworking \nwith \nthe \nJapanese \nand \n\n248 THE FAST STUFF \nbranching out  to build his  own motorcycle. In  fact he’s now built two. \nThe breadth of  these achievements surely makes him the greatest \nmotorcyclist in history, which in itself is totally cool. \nThe King doesn’t rack up  coolness points for  his  style (except when \nhe  steps out  in  his  English country gent garb), his  cool comes from \nsomething deeper than that —  his  total commitment to  the  world of \nmotorcycling, especially racing. The man should’ve packed his  boots \nand headed for a rocking chair years back, but he didn’t, he’s still living \nin Banbury, England (The King lives in English suburbia!), making his \nlife a kind of living hell while giving his undyingly faithful Team Roberts \ncrew a  great reason to  live. No  other racer has ever done what he’s \ndone. (Sure, Fogarty has  built a bike but  Roberts is the very core of the \nProton project, while Foggy had his  deal handed to  him on a plate.) \nAnd Roberts is one of the  few people in  the  modern-day GP  paddock \nwho’s brave enough to  get  properly drunk and say  stuff he  shouldn’t, \neven if he’s plenty more polite than he used to be. \nYears in top level racing: 1975-1983 \nBikes ridden: Harley dirt  trackers, Yamaha 250, 500, 750 (road \nand dirt), FZR750 \nGreatest achievements: 1978/1979/1980 500  world champ \nWhere is he now: Staying up  all night doing KR5 dyno runs \n4 -  Valentino Rossi \nValentino Rossi is  the  shining light of 21st-century motorcycle racing. \nHe’s turned more people onto bikes than anyone since Sheene, though \nthat doesn’t necessarily make him cool. What does make Rossi cool is \nhis \nsublime \nriding \ntalent \nand \nthe \neffortlessness \nin \neverything \nhe \ndoes, \nboth on  and off the  racetrack. \nRossi derives a  huge amount of  enjoyment from racing, and his \ninfectious \nchild-like \nenthusiasm \nis \nstill \nthere, \neven \nif \nthe \nweight \nof \nhis \nfame \nhas \ndulled \nthat \nfamous \nsmile. \nThe \ntruth \nis \nthat \nRossi \nis \na \nbit \nof \na \nhippy, \njust \nlike \nhis \ndad, \nso \nhe \nlikes \nhaving \nfun, \nwhich \nexplains \nthe \nsometimes \ndaft \nvictory \ncelebrations \nthat \nendeared \nhim \nto \nmillions \nearly \nin \nhis \ncareer. \nBack \nthen \nhe \ncould \nnever \nhave \nguessed \nthat \nfame \nwould \nengulf \nhim \nas \nit \nhas \ndone, \nwhich \nis \nwhy \nhe \noften \nlooks \na \nlittle \nshell- \nshocked \nthese \ndays. \nLike \nany \nglobally \nfamous \ncelebrity, \nRossi \nhas \nsold \na \nportion \nof \nhis \nsoul \nto \nthe \ndevil, \neven \nif \nhe \ndid \nso \ninadvertently. \n\nTHE \nCOOLEST \nRACERS \nIN  \nTHE \nWORLD, \nEVER \n249 \nOf \ncourse \nhe \nworks \nhard \nat  \nhis  \nracing, \nbut  \nhe’s \none \nof \nthose \npeople \nwho \nworks \nin \nan \neffortless \nway \n— \nyou \nnever \nsee \nhim \nlooking \npained \nin \nthe \npits \nor \ngiving \nshit \nto \nhis \ncrew. \nAnd \nonce \nthe \nracing \nis \nover, \nhe \nlikes \na \nparty. \nAnyone \nwho \nhas \nseen \nhim \nin \naction \nat \nvarious \nseason-ending \npiss-ups \nat \nValencia \nrealises \nthat \nRossi \nknows \nhow \nto \ncut \nloose. \nThese \ndays \npro-racers \ndon’t \nget \nto \nparty \nlike \nthey \nused \nto \n— \nfor \nall \nkinds \nof \nreasons \n— \nbut \nwe’ve \nno \ndoubt \nthat \nif \nRossi \nhad \nbeen \naround \nin \nthe \n1970s, \nhe’d \nhave \nbeen \npartying \nlike \nit was \n1979. \nYears in top level racing: 1996-now \nBikes ridden: Aprilia 125, Aprilia 250, Honda 500, RCV and \nSP-1, Yamaha YZR-M1 \nGreatest achievements: 1997 125  world champ, 1999 250  world champ, \n2001 500 world champ, 2002/2003/2004/2005 \nMotoGP world champ \nWhere is he now: On  your telly \n5 —   Jarno Saarinen \nLike most of  the other riders in  this top ten, Jarno Saarinen had \nsomething effortlessly cool about him —  you only need to  see  photos of \nhim fixing his  Yamaha TD250’s clutch to realise that he had a  touch of \nSteve McQueen, a touch of James Dean about him. Saarinen was super \nfast, very bright and always funny in  an  age  when motorcycling took \nno  prisoners. He was killed in a multiple pile-up at Monza in  1973. Just \nlike James Dean, his  burgeoning talent was snuffed out  in what might \nbe called glamorous circumstances. \nSaarinen was a wonderful motorcycle racer. He  started out  doing ice \nspeedway in  Finland, bringing a  new style of  riding to  the  world of \nroadracing —  he was super smooth but he slid his tyres and was probably \nthe first man to  get his knee down without crashing. His riding \ntechnique inspired Kenny Roberts. He  was a  good mechanic as  well, \nalways happy to  get his  fingers dirty even after he’d become the  star of \nthe  Yamaha factory team. And he  knew what he was doing, so  he  was \nquite capable of taking a  grinder to  a  cylinder in  the  search for  more \nhorsepower. \nHe \nknew \nhis \nbikes \ninside \nand \nout. \nHe \nhad \nalso \nan \ninnate \nsense \nof \nstyle \nand \na \ngreat \neye \nfor \ndetail, \nso \nhis \nclothes \nand \nhis \nleathers, \nhis \nhelmets \nand \nhis \nmotorcycles \nalways \nlooked \nvery, \nvery \nright. \nHe  \nlost \nhis  \nlife  \nin  \na \n250 \nGP  \nwhile \nhe \nwas \nrunning \naway \nwith \nthe  \n500 \n\n250 THE FAST STUFF \nworld championship. If he’d won that year’s 500 crown he  would’ve \nbecome the  first man to win the premier title on  a  Japanese-built bike. \nThere’s not  many bike racers who died so  long ago who are  still deeply \nmissed by the  sport, and that probably tells you all you need to  know. \nYears in top level racing: 1970-1973 \nBikes ridden: Yamaha 250, 350  and 500 \nGreatest achievements: 1972 world champ, winner of two 500  GPs \nWhere is he now: killed during 1973 Italian 250 GP \n6 —  Anthony Gobert \nOkay, so  most race bosses hiss with disdain at  the  mere mention of \nAnthony Gobert’s name —  which on  its own is just about enough to  get \nhim in this list. Goey’s everything a racer shouldn’t be —  a proper loose \nunit —  invariably unreliable, sometimes rude and he  likes to  party way \ntoo  much. But  hey, bike racing’s wildest child is super-bloody fast when \nhe  can be  bothered. A  few years back Goey used to  derive immense \npleasure from disappearing on  benders between US  Superbike rounds, \nreappearing with an  impressive beer gut to  grab pole position at  the \nnext race, baffling his  rivals who’d been sweating down the  gym for \nfive hours, every day. Okay, so  the  gut would do for him in the  race, but \nby then he’d already made his  point. Kind of. \nGobert has won fans and made enemies wherever he’s raced —  in \nWorld Supers, US  Supers, 500 GPs and British Superbikes. He’s been \nsacked by more teams for a greater range of misdemeanours than most \nriders have had deals. And maybe he’ll never quite harness his  talent \neffectively enough to  prove just how good a rider he  really is.  Which \nwill be a real shame. But  anyone who erects a  10-foot square swimming \npool outside his  motorhome in  the  GP  paddock and parties well into \nSunday night, long after his rivals have been chauffeured home to their \nMonaco residences, has  done enough to  get  into our  top  ten. Which is \nmuch more important than any lousy world title. Honest. \nYears in top level racing: 1994-2001 : \nBikes ridden: Suzuki 500, Honda and Kawasaki 750s, Ducati \n998, Bimota 1000, CBR900 \nGreatest achievements: his problems stopped him fulfilling his  potential \nWhere is he now: God only knows \n\nTHE COOLEST RACERS IN  THE WORLD, EVER 251 \n7 —  Mike Hailwood \nMost \npeople \nin \nthe  \nknow \nbelieve \nthat \nMike \nHailwood \nwas \nthe  \ngreatest \nmotorcycle \nracer \nthe \nworld \nhas \never \nseen. \nHe \nhad \na \nmagical \nnatural \ntalent \nthat \nallowed \nhim \nto \nachieve \nthe \nimpossible, \nbut \nhe \ncarried \nhis \ntalent \nlightly, \nnever \ntaking \nhimself \ntoo \nseriously, \nalways \nup \nfor \na \nlaugh. \nIn fact \nit \nseems \nthat \nhe \nbarely \nrecognised \nhow \ngifted \nhe was; \nmaybe \nit \nall \ncame \ntoo \nnaturally \nto him, \nso \nhe \ncouldn’t \nbegin \nto imagine \nwhy \nhe \nwas \nany \ndifferent \nfrom \nanyone \nelse. \nHow \ncool \nis \nthat? \nHailwood wasn’t even desperately ambitious, it was his  millionaire \nfather that pushed him into the big time, and he certainly knew nothing \nabout motorcycles —  he’d just climb aboard and give it heaps. He  was \nproudly technophobic, with zero interest in  the  complexities of set-up. \nOnce asked by one of his  engineers: ‘What gear are  you in through turn \nfour?’, Hailwood replied: “I don’t know, how many gears has  it got?’ An \napocryphal tale  perhaps, but  certainly indicative of the man’s attitude. \nAlthough he was polite and good-natured, Hailwood was afraid of no \none. When he signed to Honda in ’66, he flew to Japan to test  the factory’s \nevil-handling 500 four. Appalled by the  bike’s wayward behaviour and \nunable to  properly explain his  feelings to  the  engineers, he  grabbed the \nbike’s rear shocks and lobbed them into the lake behind the  Suzuka pits. \nIn  his  later years Mike the  Bike had a  dash of loucheness about him, \nlike the rich man’s son  gone partying, which brought with it a spectacular \nfashion sense. But  while he  liked a  party he  wasn’t your typical alpha- \nmale roadracer. Hailwood was a genuinely nice guy  in a vicious sport. \nYears in top level racing: 1959-1967 (comeback 1978/1979) \nBikes ridden: Ducati and EMC 125s, Mondial, NSU and \nDucati, Honda 250s, Honda 350, Honda, MV \nAgusta, Yamaha and Suzuki 500s, BSA, Yamaha \n750, Ducati 900 \nGreatest \nachievements: \n250 \nworld \nchamp \n1961/1966/1967, \n350 \nworld \nchamp \n1966/1967, \n500 \nworld \nchamp \n1962/1963/ \n1964/1965 \nWhere \n1s \nhe \nnow: \ndied \nin \na  \nroad \ncar  \ncrash \nin \nMarch \n1981 \n8 —  Giacomo Agostini \nGiacomo \nAgostini’s \ncool \nflows \nfrom \na \nvery \ndifferent \nkind \nof \nblood \nthan \nfills \nthe \nveins \nof \nmost \nmotorcycle \nracers. \nAgo \ncame \nfrom \nwealthy \nnorth \n\n52 THE FAST STUFF \nItalian stock (more classy than Hailwood’s upmarket-spiv dad), but  his \nfamily didn’t bankroll his  bike-racing ambitions. In  fact, like many \nparents of motorcycling kids, they did  the  opposite: they tried to  bribe \nhim to give it all up with the offer of a brand-new sports car.  Rich kid  or \nnot, Ago was determined to get his  two-wheel kicks, so  he turned down \nhis parents’ offer and used to  sneak out  of the house to compete in local \nhill climbs. In other words, he had the  coolness deep within him. \nA few years later he  was signed by Count Domenico Agusta to  ride \nfor  the  renowned MV Agusta marque. Ago and the  Count were the \nepitome of pre-summer-of-love 1960s cool —  a talented, smart-dressing \nyoungster funded by a  mega-rich aristocrat. And, of course, Ago was \ndesperately handsome, the  ladies swooning at  his  feet from Milan to \nthe  Isle  of Man. His  good looks and bravery won him massive fame in \nItaly, so  it was only a matter of time before some Italian director asked \nhim to play the  heartthrob in a couple of movies. Ago never made it to \nHollywood, but  then again, he didn’t need to. \nThere will probably never be  a  more successful racer than Agostini. \nHe lorded it over his rivals for years, riding his beloved MVs to  14 world \nchampionships. And when everyone said he couldn’t win without MV, \nhe went and won the  1975 500  world title on  a Yamaha, becoming the \nfirst man to win biking’s biggest prize on  a two-stroke. \nYears in top level racing: 1964-1977 \nBikes ridden: Morini 250, MV Agusta 350, MV Agusta, Yamaha \nand Suzuki 500s \nGreatest achievements: 350 world champ 1968/1969/1970/1971/1972/ \n1973/1974, \n500 \nworld \nchamp \n1966/1967/1968/ \n1969/1970/1971/1972/1975 \nWhere is he now: retired from team management and living in \nItalian splendour \n9 -  Graziano Rossi \nIt  \nwould \nbe  \nwrong \nto  \nstick \nValentino \nRossi \nin  \nthe \ntop \nten  \nwithout \nincluding \nthe  \nracer \nwho \nbegat \nhim. \nEven \npeople \nwho’ve \ndecided \nthat \nit’s \ntime \nto start \nhating \nracing’s \ncurrent \ngolden \nboy \nfind \nit \ndifficult \nto \nreally \nloathe \nthe  \nkid, \nand \nthe  \nreason \nthey \ncan’t \nsummon \nup  \nthe  \nodium \nis \nthat \nValentino \nis \nthe  \nson  \nof \nhis  \nfather. \nIn \nother \nwords, \nhe’s \na \nlikeable \nhuman \nbeing \nand \nthus \ndifficult \nto \nhate, \nwhich \nis \ncool. \n\nTHE COOLEST RACERS IN  THE WORLD, EVER 253 \nGraziano was what most racers aren’t —  an  educated intellect with a \nhippy’s attitude to  life. Dad Rossi cheerfully admits that he was never \nworld champ because he was too  soft. He was the  archetypal too-nice- \nto-be-world-champion racer, always tempted to stop and offer assistance \nwhen someone crashed in front of him. Not that he was soft  when he \nwas racing, Jeez, he was so  crazy he even scared Kenny Roberts. \nLike several other riders in  this list, Graziano is one of those people \nwho cuts a-dash wherever he goes, not  because he attracts attention but \nbecause he’s got  that sweet-natured glow about him. He’s one of those \npeople who spreads brightness, which is  why Valentino is  the well- \nadjusted human being, while his biggest rival (Max Biaggi) is  the \ndesperate try-hard. \nGraziano still comes to  a  lot  of  GPs, but he’s quiet and in  the \nbackground; he  doesn’t get  off on  his  kid’s success, so  he  doesn’t stay \nin flash hotels, in fact he  doesn’t stay in hotels at  all.  He  drives an  old \nBMW \nestate \nto \nraces \nand \nsleeps \nin \nthe \nback. \nAnd \nit \ndoesn’t \nget \ncooler \nthan that. \nYears in top level racing: 1978-1982 \nBikes \nridden: \nfactory \nMorbidelli \n250, \nMorbidelli, \nYamaha \nand \nSuzuki \n500s \nGreatest \nachievements: \nwinner \nof \nthree \n250 \nGPs \nin  \n1979 \nWhere \nis \nhe \nnow: \nhanging \nout  \nbehind \nRossi's \npit \n10 —  Johnny Cecotto \nJohnny \nCecotto’s \nstar \nshined \nbright \nand \nbriefly \nin \nmotorcycle \nracing. \nAt \nthe  \nage \nof \njust \n19  \nthe  \nVenezuelan \nemerged \nfrom \nnowhere \nto  \nwin \nthe \n1975 \n350 \ntitle, \nmaking \nhim \nthe \nyoungest \nworld \nchamp \nuntil \nLoris \nCapirossi \nlifted \nthe \n1990 \n125 \ncrown, \naged \n17. \nCecotto \nwas \nyoung \nand \nhad \nthe \nwhole \nworld \nat \nhis \nfeet, \nbut \nhe \nmessed \nthe \nwhole \nthing \nup. \nHe \ntook \nthree \n500 \nGP \nvictories \nover \nthe \nnext \nfew \nyears \nand \nthen \nleft \nthe \nscene \nas \nquickly \nas \nhe \nhad \narrived, \nwhich \nis \npretty \ncool. \nDuring \nhis  \nsix  \nseasons \non  \nthe \nworld \nchampionship \nstage, \nCecotto \nexhibited \nthe \nkind \nof \nnatural \ntalent \nand \nflair \nyou'd \nexpect \nfrom \na \nLatin- \nAmerican \nracer, \nwhile \nalso \nappearing \nsomewhat \nunbothered \nabout \nusing \nthat \nskill \nto \nfull \neffect. \nHe \ngains \nbig \npoints \nfor \nthis \n— \npossessing \nexcessive \ntalent \nplus \na \nlack \nof \ndesperation \nto \nprove \nthat \ntalent \nis \nvery \ncool, \nunlike \nhaving \nlittle \ntalent \nand \ntrying \ntoo \nhard \nto \nimpress, \nwhich \nis \nvery \nuncool. \n\n254 THE FAST STUFF \nAside from the  racing, Cecotto had the  cool thing nailed down. Like \nhis  mate Sheene he  was motorcycling’s own little bit  of the  1970s jet \nset,  possessing all  the  accoutrements that went with that world. But \nhere’s the  clincher —  Cecotto is possibly the  only afro in history to have \nwon a GP.  Okay, so  it wasn’t a real afro, but  at one point of his  career it \npretty much looked like one, and it certainly wasn’t a  bad effort for  a \nhonky. Only one  black mark against the  guy, he moved into car  racing. \nNot so  cool. \nYears in top level racing: 1975-1980 \nBikes ridden: Yamaha 250, 350, 500  and 650s \nGreatest achievements: 1975 350 world champion, winner of  three \n500 GPs \nWhere is he now: retired \nThe nearly super cool: Wayne Rainey, Loris Capirossi, Angel Nieto, \nCarlos Lavado, Marco Lucchinelli, Scott Russell, Niall Mackenzie and \nTom Herron. \n\nCHAPTER 35 \nIF \nYOU’RE \nNOT \nCRASHING, \nYOU’RE \nNOT \nGOING \nFAST \nENOUGH \nNovember 2003 \nThe only things certain in life are  income tax and nurses, they \nsay, but not if you’re a racer —  better add crashing to that list \nThe race is into its  closing stages, just a few laps of Donington remain \nto  catch that guy in  front who’s been bugging you for  the  last few \nminutes of your life. It’s  the  difference between a  gong (or  a MotoGP \npodium slot, if you fancy some proper dreaming) or  no  gong. \nYou've been having a  bit  of a  bungee race with the  bloke: catch him \none lap, lose a  couple tenths the  next, win a  few yards, lose a  few, and \nthe  laps are  running out. But your rear tyre is shot, so  you can’t work \nany harder getting out  of the  bends, so  you're going to  have to  push a \nlittle harder on  the  front —  brake a little later, risk an  extra wisp of \nspeed into the  few corners where you think you might just get  away \nwith it. But, as  luck would have it, it’s the rear that lets  go first —  must’ve \nbeen more shagged than you thought. It smears sideways on  the exit of \nCoppice, then flicks back as  you shut the  throttle in  panicked reflex. \nFrom here it’s  like you’ve hit  the  button in  one of those hyper-speed \nskyscraper elevators —  sixth floor: haberdashery, household and men’s \nunderwear. Your outstretched right hand is the  first to  return to  earth. \n‘Fuck!’ Then your right shoulder. ‘Agghh, fuck!’ Lower back. ‘Fuck, \nouch!’ Both ankles. ‘Fuck, fuck, fuck!’ \nNow your head is  jerking this way and that as  you attempt to \ndetermine whether your once very trick motorcycle, now exploding \nsomewhere out  of your immediate sight, is heading your way. And then \nyou're stationary, well almost motionless. The bomb-like racket subsides \nuntil \nall \nyou \ncan \nhear \nis \nthe \nwail \nof \nbikes \nhurtling \npast \nfive \nfeet \nfrom \nyour \nleft \nfoot. \nYou \ncan \ntaste \nblood, \nlike \nsomeone’s \njust \npunched \nyou \nin \nthe \nface, \nyou’re \nswimming \nin \nan \nocean \nof \npain, \nyou \nwant \nyour \nmummy, \nyou hate motorcycles, like  really fucking hate them. \n\n256 THE FAST STUFF \nThere’s an  old  saying in  racing: if you’re not crashing, you're not \ngoing fast enough. Proof: The last rider to  win a world championship \nwithout crashing was Sito Pons, who lifted the  1989 250  crown without \nonce overstepping the  mark. And here’s another racing axiom, from \nthree-time 500  king Wayne Rainey: ‘If a  rider’s fast and he’s crashing, \nmaybe you can  stop him crashing, but if a rider’s slow, you’re not  going \nto  make him fast.’ In  other words, there’s no  racing without crashing. \nAnd if you ever go racing, you'll be crashing too. \nCrashes happens because racing is  all  about being faster than the \nnext guy, which means you’ve got  to  bend the  laws of physics to  your \nown will and thus exist on  the edge of  a  precipice. It’s therefore \ninevitable that you'll fall  over that precipice every now and again. \nBut what does crashing mean to a racer? Beyond the obvious physical \nagonies, what does it do  to  a  rider’s state of mind? And how do  they \nkeep coming back for  more while they’re still struggling with injuries \nand pumped full of painkillers? What follows is a veritable list of racing \nwreckers who really do  know what crashing is  all  about: 1987 500 \nchamp Wayne Gardner, former World Supers rider James Haydon, \n1960s pile-up legend Dave Croxford, MotoGP star  Carlos ‘Chuckitaway’ \nCheca and king of ’em all,  1993 500  champ Kevin Schwantz. \nWayne Gardner: the Digger who always dug deep \nSome racers are  always in the  headlines, sometimes for  all  the  wrong \nreasons. Wayne ‘Digger’ Gardner was one of  them —  if  he  wasn’t \ngrabbing daring 500 GP  victories, he  was usually incarcerated in  Dr \nCosta’s House of Pain, nursing another bunch of broken bones. That’s \nhow it went with WG: up  or  down, no  in between. \nGardner epitomises the rough-edged Antipodean racer —  frighteningly \nbrave, always up  for a fight and never one to  say  die. His  career peaked \nat  a  time when 500s were seriously nasty pieces of work —  horsepower \ndramatically outstripping tyre and chassis technology —  which kind of \nsuited his  give-it-heaps-and-hang-on-for-dear-life riding technique. \n‘The NSR500 was a  hunk of  shit in  the 1980s,’ says Gardner, who \nwon the  500 crown with Honda in  ’87. ‘The suspension wasn’t very \ngood, the  tyres weren’t that good and the  power came in  hard, so  it \nhighsided a  fair bit. There wasn’t a  lot  you could do.’ Not that this \nstopped him from giving it  big  handfuls: ‘You’re dedicated, you're \ncommitted, you're in that little world that all racers are  in, so  you have \n\nge ty ee ary \nyee, \nIF \nYOU’RE \nNOT \nCRASHING, \nYOU’RE \nNOT \nGOING \nFAST \nENOUGH \n257 \na  \ngo. \nSometimes \nI \nwas \njust \ntrying \ntoo \nhard, \nother \ntimes \nthere \nwere \nriders \nwho \nbrought \nme \ndown, \nother \ntimes \nI \nhad \nmachine \nfailures. \n‘You've \nalways \ngot \nto \nanalyse \nthe \ncrash \nand \nbe \nhonest \nwith \nyourself \n— \nwas \nit \nmy \nmistake \nor \nwhat? \nIf \nit’s \nyour \nresponsibility \nyou’ve \ngot \nto \naccept \nit \nand \nlearn \nfrom \nyour \nmistakes. \nYou’ve \ngot \nto \nbe \npragmatic \nand \nwork \nout \nwhy \nit \nhappened, \nso you \nFg   ecuse  rae \ndon’t \ntake \nyour \nconfidence \naway.’ \n‘I \nwas \nreally \nscared, \nBut \nthere \nwere \ncrashes \nthat \ndid spook \nhim. \n‘The \nI \nthought \nI \nwas \none \nthat \nreally \nshook \nme \nup \nwas \nthe \nUncini \naccident \nactually \ndying, \nthat \nat \nmy \nfirst \nGP [Assen \n‘83, when \nreigning \nworld \nreally \nfrightened \nme \nchamp \nFranco \nUncini \ncrashed \njust \nahead \nof Gardner, \ninside, \nthat \nwas \nthe \nwho \ncollided \nwith \nthe \nItalian, \nputting \nhim \ninto \na \ncrash \nthat \nbrought \ncoma]. \nI went \nto \nsee \nhim \nin \nhospital \nand he \nwas \nme \nundone.’ \nwriggling around in  a  coma, so  I was bawling my \neyes out saying: “Jesus, I’ve just nearly killed this \nguy”, so  I was quitting. Even though it wasn’t my fault I kinda accepted \nsome responsibility, but Franco got  better and I had to  get  back out \nthere and do my job, you've got  to  be cold blooded about it. \n‘The other one that really frightened the  shit  out  of me  was Assen in \n‘92. I was trying to  go round a slower guy into turn one and ran  out  of \nroad, crashed and went into a  post. I got  knocked out  and they carted \nme  away, thinking I’d broken my neck. They put me  in one  of those full \nbody scanner things, I was coming in  and out  of consciousness, I was \nreally scared, I thought I was actually dying, I didn’t know what was \ngoing on.  That really frightened me  inside, I mean mentally, and that \nconfirmed I was over the  whole bike racing thing —  that was the  crash \nthat brought me  undone.’ \nSix  weeks later at  the  British GP  Gardner announced that he  was \nretiring, then went out  and won the  race. He  quit bikes at  the  end of \nthat season. \nKevin Schwantz: the ultimate floored genius \nRevvin’ Kevin Schwantz was king crasher of  the  late 1980s and early \n1990s \n— \nthe \narchetypal \nfloored \ngenius \nwith \ntons \nof \ntalent \nand \na \ntouch \ntoo \nmuch \nenthusiasm. \nHe \nraced \nclip-on \nto \nclip-on \nwith \nWayne \nRainey, \nMick \nDoohan, \nEddie \nLawson \nand \nWayne \nGardner, \nand \nwas \ngenerally \nrecognised \nas \nthe \nmost \nnaturally \ngifted \nrider \nof \nthat \nremarkable \nera. \nBut  boy, did  he crash a lot. \n\n258 THE FAST STUFF \n‘I  remember ’89  was probably my worst year,‘ says the ‘93 500 \nchamp. ‘I was wearing Taichi leathers and I remember seeing racing \nsuit  number 19 —  so  I’m  guessing 20  to  25  crashes that season.’ \nSchwantz is the  first to  admit that he did  get carried away rather too \noften, but  his  machinery was also to  blame. For  nine years he  raced \nSuzuki's notoriously fickle RGV500 which was never the  quickest 500. \nNot only that, it had borderline chassis performance —  get it right and \nit was the  sweetest-handling thing out  there, but  go  racing two clicks \nout on  the suspension settings and it was a vindictive piece of machinery, \napparently hell-bent on  flinging its rider to  the  ground. \n‘Most times I crashed I was trying to  figure a way to  go  faster and it \njust snuck up and got me. I'd be having problems getting the bike to do \neverything I wanted it  to  —  to  handle right and to  finish the corner \nexactly the  way I wanted —  so  I might try and go  in a bit  deeper to  get \nthe sharper part of  the  turning done early.’ Cue front-end crash. ‘Or \nmaybe it wasn’t finishing the  corner, so  I'd try to  steer it with the  back \nwheel coming out.’ Cue highside crash. \n‘T only remember a few  races where things worked really, really well. \nBut for the most part it was such a fine line to get a grand prix motorcycle \nworking right that I had to  ride 100  per  cent pretty much every corner, \nevery lap.’ \nWhatever his  bike worries, Schwantz was always unwilling to  give \nin, which is why he was such a big hit with the  fans. ‘There were a lot \nof times when I was following somebody thinking: “God he’s getting \naway, I gotta come up  with something, I gotta figure something out”, \nthat can sneak up  and get  you too. You're tryin’ to  do  something \non  newish tyres, where you've not really got  to  the  limit and figured \nhow much you can push the  front or  spin the  rear. Then the thing \nspins, snaps sideways, snaps back and throws you  off.  I was just a little \nover-anxious.’ \nBut however much he  crashed, Schwantz never angered his \nbosses to  the  point where they gave him the  flick, simply because they \nrealised that no  one could ride a  motorcycle quite as  hard as  he  could. \n‘I’m sure there were people in  the  team who got  angry with me, but I \nthink they realised that slapping my hand and telling me that if  I \never fell  again I wasn’t going to  race any more wasn’t the  way to  solve \nthe  problem.’ \nAnd yet  inevitably there came a  time when the  accidents did  begin \n\nIF \nYOU’RE \nNOT \nCRASHING, \nYOU’RE \nNOT \nGOING \nFAST \nENOUGH \n259 \nto  \ngnaw \nat  \nhis  \nconfidence, \nthough \nit \nwas \na  \nsingle \ntumble \nwhich \nbegan \nthe  \nprocess \n—  \nthat \nscary \npile-up \nat  \nDonington \n1993 \nwhen \nan  \nout-of- \ncontrol \nDoohan \nclipped \nhim \nas  \nthey \nbraked \nfor  \nthe  \nesses, \nprecipitating \nSchwantz \ninto \na \n130mph \nend-over-end \nprang. \n‘That \nknocked \nmy \nconfidence \nto \nthe \npoint \nwhere \nI \nmay \nnever \nagain \nhave \nridden \nlike I \nwas \nriding \nbefore \nthat. \nThat \nseason \nI’d been \nbuilding \nthe \nchampionship \nlead \nover \nWayne \n(Rainey) \nand \nsuddenly \nthe \nlead \nhad \ncompletely \nvanished. \nFrom \na \nmental \nstandpoint \nit was \nmuch \nharder \nafter \nthat \nbecause \nI was \nbanged \nup \nand \nhad \nthat \nlittle \nbit of \ndoubt \nin \nmy \nhead. \nEven \nafter \na crash \nthat \nhas \nnothing \nto \ndo \nwith \nyou, \nit’s \nstill hard \nto \nget \nback \non \nthe \nbike \nand \ngo \nback \nto \nthat \nsame \nlevel \nof \nperformance.’ \nJust five weeks later came the spill that flicked the switch in \nSchwantz’s mind once and for  all.  ‘The one that scared me  the  most \nwasn’t even one of mine, it was Wayne’s. [Schwantz’s career-long rival \nRainey crashed at  Misano in  September ’93, sustaining injuries that \nparalysed the  Californian from the  chest down.] I didn’t see  it, I don’t \nknow what caused it,  but it  was the result. Wayne was someone I \nlooked up  to,  I used to  say: “Man, that guy never crashes and when he \ndoes fall  he’s always okay, he never gets hurt”, but  all  of a  sudden Mr \nInvincible was hurt. To me  that crash had the  biggest effect on  me.’ \nSchwantz continued racing until mid-1995 when lingering hip and \nwrist injuries forced him to  stop. He  had often raced hurt because he \nhas an enormous tolerance for pain, but he was only storing up problems \nfor later. (Doohan is the  same, once rejecting pain-relief injections with \nthe  immortal words: ‘I’m not  a painkiller type of person’.) \n‘T never really used anything for  pain, I think I was pretty good at \nblocking it,’  adds Schwantz. ‘I’ve just been to  the  doctor so  he  could \nlook at my recently broken hand. He  said: “You know what, I’m  pushing \non  this bone and you're not even hurting, most people would have \nflipped over on  the x-ray table by  now. Your tolerance for  pain is \nsomewhat different to  the  average person.” I don’t know if that’s a \ngood \nthing \n— \nI \nprobably \nrode \nsome \ntimes \nI \nshouldn’t \nhave, \nbut \nyou've \njust \ngot \nto \nget \nit \ninto \nyour \nmind \nthat \nit’s \na \n45-minute \nrace \nand \nyou've \ngot \nto \ntough \nit \nout, \nthen \nyou'll \nhave \nsome \ntime \nto \nheal \nand \nget \nbetter.’ \nThat’s \nwhat \ntop-level \nbike \nracing \nis  \nall  \nabout \n—  \nit’s  \nnot  \nonly \nabout \nriding \nblindingly \nfast \nwhen \neverything’s \npeachy, \nit’s \nabout \nriding \nblindingly \nfast \nwhen \nevery \ntwist \nof \nthe \nthrottle \nmakes \nyou \nwince, \nand \nnot \ngiving \na \ndamn, \njust \nkeeping \nit \npinned. \n\n260 THE FAST STUFF \nDave Croxford: ol’ rubber bones \nDave Croxford was a  legend in  his  own launch time —  he  launched \nhimself into the barriers no  less than 203 times during a career that ran \nfrom 1962 to  ’76. Crox made his  name racing the  factory John Player \nNorton twin in an  age  when Yamaha’s scarily fast TZ  two-strokes were \nchanging the  face of racing. Remarkably he didn’t break a  single bone \nin those 14 seasons. That would be incredible these days, but back then, \nwhen riding gear was rudimentary and run-off often non-existent, it \nsmacked of some kind of God-given immortality, or perhaps a pact with \nthe  devil. No wonder fans called him ‘Rubber Bones’. \nNow well into his  60s, Croxford is very aware that he  got  off lightly \nat a time when fatalities were commonplace. ‘I’m one  of the lucky ones, \nno  aches or  pains, I’m  right as  rain,’ he  says, recalling that racers used \nto take the risks more lightly back then and damn the consequences. ‘It \nwas real good fun  in them days —  if it rained you sometimes popped in \nthe  bar  for a couple of pints of Guinness and then went out  to race.’ \nLike any racer, Croxford does have reasons for his  multitudinous get- \noffs, and not  all of them involve the consumption of intoxicating liquor. \n‘The TZs were coming out  then and they had loads of power, but the \nhandling wasn’t right, while the  Norton was great in corners but  slow \non  the  straights, so  I was always trying to make up  ground.’ \nMany of Croxford’s tumbles were comedy events. ‘I crashed at Brands \nwhile battling with Bazza (Sheene), I was sliding along on  my arse \nwaving at him, and he was waving back.’ Or one of his  two TT  crashes: \n‘This bloody great big pig comes out  and it’s  running alongside me...’ \nOf course, Crox lost plenty of mates who weren’t as  blessed as  him, \nbut somehow he  managed to  blank it  all  out. ‘Other blokes did get \nkilled, which made you  think “It  could be bloody me”, but  it’s  no  good \nbeing cautious because then you're not  going to  be up  the  front. No,  it \nnever used to  worry me, I lived for  racing, that’s all  I wanted to  do  — \nevery Wednesday I’d  bunk off  from work to  go  down to  Brands for \npractice. Sure, there’s many times it could’ve happened to  me  and I’d \nthink ’God, I was lucky there”, but  I’d just pick meself up,  bow to  the \ncrowd and that was that. Nah, don’t think about it —  just get  back on \nand ride. And if Derek [Minter, famed Brands Hatch ace] crashed in \nfront of me, I’d  think: “Oh great, some extra prize money!” \nCroxford \nis \nstill \nbig \ninto \nhis  \nbikes \n—  \nhe \nrides \nhis  \nVFR \nmost \ndays \nand \nloves \nwatching \nracing \non  \nthe  \ntelly. \n‘I \nthought \nI \nwas \nthe  \ndog’s \nbollocks \n\na \nIF \nYOU’RE \nNOT \nCRASHING, \nYOU’RE \nNOT \nGOING \nFAST \nENOUGH \n261 \nwhen \nit \ncame \nto  \ncrashing, \nbut  \nI \ntell  \nyou \nwhat, \nthey \ncrash \nmore \nthan \nI \ndid. \nI \nthink: \n‘God \nXaus, \nyou’re \nworse \nthan \nme!’ \nPoor \nguy, \nhe  \ndoesn’t \nseem \nto \nknow \nhow \nto \nride \nany \nmore \nbecause \nhe’s \ncrashed \nso \nmuch.’ \nDespite \nhis  \nrock-hard \nattitude, \nthe  \nwest \nLondoner \nknows \nvery \nwell \nhow \ntoo \nmuch \ncrashing \ncan \nmess \nwith \nyour \nhead, \neven \nif \nfear’s \ngot \nnothing \nto \ndo \nwith \nit. \n‘I \nused \nto \nfeel \nsorry \nfor \nthe \nmechanics. \nI \ncrashed \nfour \ntimes \nin one \nmeeting \nand \nFrank \n(Perris, \nlegendary \nNorton \nracer \nand \nteam \nboss) \nwas \nsaying: \n“Crox, \ncan’t \nyou \nplease \ntry \nand \nstay \non?” \nSo \nI \nsaid: \n‘I \npromise, \nI \npromise!’, \nbut \nof \ncourse \nyou \ndon’t \nenjoy \nyourself \nwhen \nyou've \ngot \nto \nstay \non.’ \nCarlos Checa: clank, crash, here comes careless chucker \nCarlos Checa’s Yamaha MotoGP mechanics sometimes did  a  kind of \nJohn Wayne swagger when they walked through the paddock, shouting \n‘Clank, clank, clank!’ as  they went on  their way. In  other words —  the \nguy’s got balls of steel, very big balls of steel. \nThe Spaniard was one  of MotoGP’s bravest hoons. In  1998 he crashed \nheavily during British GP  practice and was helicoptered to  hospital \nwhere he  suffered a  relapse —  lying blind and partially paralysed for  15 \nhours. His  surgeons told him they weren’t sure whether he’d recover, \nbut six  weeks later he  was racing, and crashing, again. The following \nseason Checa quit Honda and joined Yamaha, falling 27  times before \nthe year was out; an  impressive achievement, but even more remarkable \nwas his  ability to  limp back to  the  pits, take his  number-two bike and \ncontinue at  the  same pace, or  even faster. Checa was unique in  this — \nmost riders begin to  ease the  throttle shut after a  dozen or  so  crashes. \nWell, you would, wouldn’t you? \nSo what was different about Checa? ‘I get a  good feeling by fighting \nthe  limits within myself and breaking down barriers,’ he  says. ‘When \nyou do  that and get  a  good result, you feel great. I know that crashing \nis part of my  job, so  if you want to  make it in  this sport you've got  to \nreally want to  win, so  you can fight with your rivals, with your bike’s \nlimitations, with your own mind, and if you do  crash and get  injured, \nyou \ndon’t \ncare, \nyou'll \nrecover. \nYou \nhave \nto \nhave \nthat \ninstinct. \nWhen \nI \ncame \nback \nfrom \nmy \nDonington \ncrash \nI \nwas \nhonestly \nscared, \nbut \nI \nfought \nagainst that feeling. \n‘I  \nused \nto  \ngo  \nskydiving, \neven \nthough \nmy  \ncontract \nforbids \nthis, \nbut \nskydiving \nisn’t \nrisky, \nwell \nyou \ncan \ndie  \nbut  \nyou \nwon’t \nget  \ninjured, \nwhich \n\n262 THE FAST STUFF \nmakes things simpler. Anyway, when I was ready to jump and saw the \nground so  far away I had that really scary feeling, but  I fought against \nit. Then, after you’ve jumped many times you lose the  fear and start to \nfeel  many things you didn’t feel  when you  were scared.’ \nOf  course, Checa knows there are  other consequences of  crashing \nbeyond inner feelings. ‘Crashing is shit for you, shit for the bike, shit for \nthe mechanics and shit for the set-up. It’s  a signal that you’re heading in \nthe  wrong direction. You want to  win but  crashing is the  opposite. It’s \nlike being in  France when you want to  go  to  England and when you \ncrash you go to  Spain. That way you'll never get to England!’ \nCheca admits that he  has been freaked by some crashes. ‘All riders \nhave scary moments, except when you're on  a  confidence high. When \npeople talk about riders losing confidence it’s  just that scary feeling \naffecting you, it’s chemicals in your brain. The worst crashes are  the ones \nyou can’t explain —  because then you don’t know what to change. If you \nknow you braked too  deep into a turn, then you can  change that, or if the \nfront end’s wrong, you can change that, but if you don’t know what \nwent wrong, it’s  hard to  get  back on  and go  to  the  limit again.’ Checa \nblames most of his  crashes on  his  Yamaha’s tendency to  lose the  front \nmid-corner. ‘You get off the  brakes and go  to  open the  gas, which shifts \nweight to  the rear tyre and suddenly you’ve got no  front-tyre contact.’ \nJames Haydon: ‘There’s been times I’ve over-ridden a bike’ \nJames Haydon was one of those riders with a  bit  of a  reputation for \ncrashing too  much, and like  most other riders who carry the  stigma, he \ndoesn’t think he really deserves it. \n‘I’ve crashed a bit but  I’ve  rarely been on  the  best equipment, which \nmeans you've got  to  push a  bit  harder,’ explains the  former BSB, WSB \nand 500  rider. ‘Riding like that might’ve caused me  a  few crashes but \nit’s  also given me  a  few wins I wouldn't otherwise have had. The only \ntime I’ve  had a bike that matched everything else out  there was the  Red \nBull Ducati in  2000. Getting on  that thing was like “Wow!”, I didn’t \nhave to  over-ride it, so  I hardly crashed it at  all.’ \nHaydon cheerfully admits that he’s one of those riders who doesn’t \nknow when to let his  discretion get the better of his valour. ‘I don’t like \ngetting beaten, but  sometimes you've got  to  use  the  clever bit  in your \nhead, so  if you’re struggling to  stay with someone because they’ve got \na better set-up or  a faster bike, maybe you should see  that and settle for \n\nIF \nYOU’RE \nNOT \nCRASHING, \nYOU’RE \nNOT \nGOING \nFAST \nENOUGH \n263 \nwhat \nyou've \ngot, \nrather \nthan \nkeep \ntrying \nto  \noutdo \nthem \non  \nthe  \nbrakes \nor \nwhatever. \nBut \nwhen \nthe \nbike \nyou're \nriding \nis \n35 \nkays \ndown, \nlike \nthe \nFoggy \nPetronas, \nyou’ve \nno \nchoice. \nIf \nyou \ndon’t \ntry \nand \ntake \nfive \nbike \nlengths \non \nthe \nbrakes, \nyou’re \nnowhere, \nso \nby \nthe \nvery \nnature \nof \nthe \npackage, \nyou’re \nmore \nlikely \nto \ncrash.’ \nNot everyone is like this. Former 500 champ Kenny Roberts Junior \nand double 250 champ Luca Cadalora are  well known for  their lack \nof  interest in  pushing their luck on  below-par machinery. It’s not \ndifficult to  see  their logic: after all,  what’s the  point of risking your \nneck to  finish 11th instead of  12th? ‘Maybe guys like that are \nmore clever than me,’ adds Haydon. ‘I want to  do  the  best I can, so \nthere’s been times I’ve over-ridden a bike, but  now I’m  starting to  look \nat  it differently.’ \nHaydon had two crashes in  his  last few years of racing that alerted \nhim to  his  own mortality —  a crunching highside at  Silverstone in 2001 \nand a terrifying get-off at Oschersleben in June 2003. ‘The Oschersleben \ncrash was absolutely petrifying, the worst I’ve ever had, just amazingly \nscary. I had a  gearbox problem and went off  at  the  fastest part of the \ntrack. The worst thing was that I knew I was going to  crash, I was \nheading towards this barrier, my  brain judging all  the  distances, and I \nknew I was definitely going to  hit  it. What made the  crash really scary \nwas that I was still on  the  bike and it seemed like  an  eternity, knowing \nI was going to go down, so I just had to jump off.’ Haydon hit the gravel \ntrap at  120mph, sustaining neck injuries and a displaced disc. \nThere’s nothing worse for a racer than crashes caused by mechanical \nproblems —  they take a  rider’s destiny away from him, leave his  life  in \nthe  lap of the  gods. And while most riders can bounce back from the \nworst of tumbles and injuries, even the strongest-minded racer struggles \nto  get  back on  dodgy equipment and ride his  hardest. \nAs  Haydon says: ‘It  all  depends on  you knowing what happened in \nthe crash —  if I know I was a bit early on  the  throttle or  I got in a bit hot, \nthat’s not a  problem at  all,  because I know what to  do  to  make sure it \ndoesn’t \nhappen \nagain. \nThe \nmechanicals \nare \nthe \nreally \nscary \nstuff.’ \nSome guys bounce better than others \nThere’s \nno  \ndoubt \nthat \nsome \nracers \nget \nhurt \nmore \noften, \neven \nif \nthey \ndon’t \nfall \noff \na \nlot.  \nBut  \nwhy? \nQuite \nsimply, \nsome \nguys \nbounce \nbetter \nthan \nothers, \nas \ninjury-hit \nKevin \nSchwantz \nexplains: \n‘I \nthink \nsome \nriders \nhave \nsomething \n\n264 THE FAST STUFF \nabout them that allows them to tumble better. I think a taller person like \nmyself, with longer arms and legs, has more opportunity to get a leg or an \narm in a  bad position and maybe break it, whereas a  shorter person is \ngoing to bounce a little bit better. I think there’s definitely a technique to \nfalling —  you've got to try and stay flat and not  tumble. And when you hit \nthe  ground you’ve got to make sure that you’ve come to  a complete stop \nbefore you  try and stand up,  that stops a lot of injuries.’ . \nGP  medic Dr  Claudio Costa has plenty of  theories on  the  subject. \n‘Some riders learn to crash well,’ he says. ‘But much of it has  to do with \nthe  type of crash —  if you lose the  front, maybe you just slide off, but  if \nyou lose the  rear, you may highside, and highsides are  always bad.’ \nCosta’s Clinica Mobile is staffed by a team of physios who attempt to \nminimise injuries before crashes even happen, administering daily \nmassages to  riders, ensuring their bodies are  as  flexible as  possible. \n‘The human body is  a  machine —  a  thermodynamic machine,’ Costa \nadds. ‘So we  need to prepare riders just like  mechanics prepare bikes.’ \nMotoGP Mutterings: December 2003 \nAdmit it, you’ve always wanted to  know the truth about brolly \ngirls... \nDo  you  ever wonder where brolly girls come from? Because I think it’s \ntime you got  told. MotoGP brolly girls are  chosen by a  panel of five or \nsix  top riders —  Rossi, Biaggi, Gibernau, etc  —  during a secret pre-season \nselection process that lasts several days and takes place in a flash hotel \nin the  Swiss Alps. This is an  increasingly controversial event —  there’ve \nbeen plenty of rumours of, er,  palm greasing in recent years —  and some \npeople want it stopped. Anyway, the  chosen few  are  then contracted to \nthe MotoGP series for a full  season, during which time they get ferried \naround Europe in a mirror-windowed tour bus, all white-leather sofas \nand glass-topped tables. This vehicle is never parked within the paddock, \nfor  obvious reasons, until Sunday morning when it deposits each girl \noutside the  back door of her  respective pit... \nI’m  lying, of course, but  from now on  I'll be straight up.  Most brolly \ngirls are  either local lasses desperate for  their 15  seconds of  fame or \nprofessional models, usually taken from the  books of local modelling \nagencies. I know two girls whose job  it  is  to  choose grid talent for \n\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT BROLLY GIRLS 265 \nseveral of the  top  teams. They contact modelling agencies looking for \ntrick Sheilas who are  happy to stand on  the grid in bikinis, even though \nthe nearest beach is 200 miles away. These women are  usually gorgeous, \nbut sometimes not gorgeous enough, or  at  least not  mucky enough. \nJust recently some MotoGP teams have been complaining that they \ndesire raunchier flesh next time around, so  the  two girls I know now \nsurf porno websites to  find the  right chicks for the job. Shocking, eh? \nBut  nothing new. Back in the late 1970s there was an  Italian 500  GP \nracer called Walter Migliorati. He  was a  privateer, so  he  never won \nanything big, but his  presence dramatically increased interest in  the \nback row of the  grid, where he’d sit awaiting the  start, flanked by two, \nsometimes more, topless prostitutes. You couldn’t get  away with that \nkind of  behaviour these days, what with global TV  feeds and all. \nMigliorati was a bit  of a  player: he  liked to  race bikes, party and hang \nout with whores, and he  always wore a  pair of ho’s panties (panty \nhoes?) under his helmet. No  really, straight up. His racing career \nended early when he went down in a major-league cocaine bust. Proper \nbad boy. \nYou may wonder what got me round to  thinking about sex and \nmotorcycle racing, because obviously they’re not subjects that occupy \nthe same head space. At  the  2003 Czech GP  I got \ninvited to  the launch of the  International Roadracing \nWomen’s Association, presumably an  organisation ‘Migliorati was a bit \nthat had been established to  look after the  interests of a player —  he \nof \nthe \ngrowing \nnumber \nof \ngirls \nworking \nin \nMotoGP, \nalways \nwore \na \npair \nmost \nof \nthem \nin \npaddock \nPR, \ncatering \nand \nhospitality. \nof \nho’s \npanties \nunder \nI \nimagined \na \nfew \nladies \ndiscussing \nhow \nto \nturn \nthe \nhis \nhelmet’ \nmacho-centric paddock into a  more lady-friendly \nplace.

(She recently published a  racy novel —  called Leathers — \nbased upon her paddock experiences.) And I know it  still goes on, \nbecause I’ve done some middle-of-the-night-creeping-down-hotel- \ncorridors myself (okay, it  was only once), and a  few weeks back a \nMotoGP team manager told me  of  a  3am fire alarm that had him \nleaping out  of his  hotel bed during British GP  weekend. He  emerged \nfrom his room to find several semi-naked couples, who weren’t supposed \nto  be  couples, sprinting down the  corridor with bath towels hurriedly \nwrapped around their torsos. It’s a wonder any racing gets done at  all. \n\nCHAPTER 36 \nTHE MADDEST RACERS IN  THE \nWORLD, EVER \nMay 2004 \nYou don’t need to  be  mad to  race motorcycles but it definitely \nhelps, as  these men bear testament \nWe  should begin this top ten  by reminding everyone that all motorcycle \nracers are  nutters, if only because ‘normal’ society tends to regard them \nas  such. But some are  bigger nutters than others, and this lot,  we \nreckon, are  the  nuttiest of  them all.  Each of  these ten  riders has a \nreputation for  some or  all  of  the  following: crashing a lot,  T-boning \nrivals on  a  regular basis or  just generally riding out of  control like \nthey’re totally immortal. Above all,  they just scare the  hell out  of us. \nOf  course, these men are  more than just nutters. If all  bike racers \nare  a  wee bit  crazy, those who make it  all  the  way to  the top  have \nother stuff going for them. While every racer requires a  certain \ndisregard for  his  own safety and for  the  safety of others if he’s to  race \ncompetitively, he’ll need the following characteristics and more to \nexalt himself beyond the ranks of  club and national racing: riding \ntalent, determination and intelligence (of a kind). \nPerhaps we  could distil those attributes down to genius and bravery, but \nwe  all  know that genius is  closely allied to  madness, as  bravery is  to \nstupidity. All  these riders have those four qualities in  the  mix. Kevin \nSchwantz was maybe three parts genius and  four parts bravery to two  parts \nstupidity and one  part madness, Christian Sarron perhaps four parts bravery \nand five parts madness to four parts stupidity and three parts genius. \nFinally, an  important word of advice: never share a  rentacar with a \nbike racer. \n1 -  Dave Croxford \nEven \nCarlos \n‘Chuckitaway’ \nCheca \ndoesn’t \ncrash \nas \nmuch \nas \nDave \nCroxford \nused \nto, \nand \n‘Crockers’ \nraced \nin \nthe \ndays \nwhen \nthe \nArmco \nwas \n\n268 THE FAST STUFF \nbare and rusty and body armour was something you found in the Tower \nof London. \nLike Checa, 1960s and 1970s nutter Croxford was one of those riders \nto whom it never occurred that slowing down might be a bit of a plan. He \njust kept on  crashing, from Brands Hatch to  the  Isle of Man, cheating \ndeath and broken bones in  more than 200 tumbles. Sometimes he \nbounced well because he was pissed, other times it was just sheer London \ngeezer luck. And Crox was always in the midst of any post-race piss-ups, \nwhich were very much the norm on  Sunday nights back then. \nBut he was also known as  a decent development rider. And he reckons \nhe  asked Norton to  make a slipper clutch three decades before they \nbecame the must-have accessory on  any race bike or  supersports bike. \n‘That Cosworth Norton, it was so  over-bored, with such a  short stroke \nthat it used to lock up the rear  whenever you  shut the throttle,’ he recalls. \n‘I told them something was wrong, but they said ‘no, it’s fine Crox”. So we \nwere testing at  Snetterton and it was pissing down with rain. I told them \n“right, you  stand by the  pits, I’ll come past, take my hand off the throttle \nto  show I’ve  shut the  throttle, then you  can  see  what it’s  like’. So  I come \nalong, take my hand off the throttle, the wheel locks and I crash. I get back \nto the pits and  say “there, told  you  so”,  but  they did nothing...’ \n2 -  Christian Sarron \nThe  maddest racing nutters always inspire fear and loathing from their \nrivals. Christian Sarron did  just that during the  late 1980s and early \n1990s when he was the  only European 500  rider to regularly hassle the \nex-dirt trackers from the  USA and Australia. \nEddie Lawson and his ex-dirt-tracking peers hated racing with Sarron \nbecause (a)  he  was nuts and (b)  his  old-school riding style didn’t fit \nwith theirs. While they would enter a  corner focusing on  a  rapid exit, \nSarron would career up  the  inside on  his  Gauloises Yamaha, trying to \nmake all his  time on  the way in, with predictable consequences. And on \nthe  way out  of corners he was an  accident waiting to  happen, for  this \nwas the heyday of highsides. Sarron, who won the  1984 250  title before \ngraduating to  500s, went over the top countless times, invariably \nknocking himself out  in the  process. \nFellow former 500 rider Niall Mackenzie remembers him well: \n‘Christian didn’t mean to  be dangerous, he just was. He’d come flying \npast, \nthen \ncrash \nat \nthe \nnext \ncorner. \nOnce \nhe \ncrashed \nin \nfront \nof \nme \nat \n\nTHE \nMADDEST \nRACERS \nIN  \nTHE \nWORLD, \nEVER \n269 \nImola \nwhen \nI \nwas \ncatching \nhim. \nI \nthought \nI’ll \njust \nrun \nover \nhim \nand \nthen \nthis'll \nnever \nhappen \nagain. \nIf \nyou \never \nspoke \nto \nhim \nafter \na \nrace \nhe \ncouldn’t \neven \nrecall \nwhat \nhad \nhappened \n— \neither \ntoo \nfocused \nor \ntoo \nmany \nbangs \non \nthe \nhead.’ \n3 —  Gustav Reiner \nNot the most famous of our  top ten, but without doubt nuts enough to \nqualify, Gustav Reiner was one of  the  leading 500 privateers of  the \n1980s who occasionally got  the  chance to  terrify a factory rider on  his \nHonda RS500. It was Arian blond Reiner who originated the  fabulous \nracing saying: ‘Rostrum or  hospital’. \nAnd he  wasn’t joking. The wild-eyed German was a regular in  the \nClinica Mobile throughout his GP career, quite capable of crashing both \nhis  bikes in one practice session, to  the  chagrin of lone mechanic Steve \nBlackburn who went on  to  work with the more restrained Nicky \nHayden. And yet  Reiner never made the  podium in a  GP his best was a \nfourth-place finish in the  riders’ strike-hit ’79  Belgian 500  GP. \n‘Reiner would be in Costa’s after pretty much every practice session,’ \nremembers fellow 500 rider Niall Mackenzie. ‘He  was hard and pretty \nmad, though he  was another one of  those guys on  uncompetitive \nmachinery.’ And he was dead scary off a  bike too: “You wouldn’t want \nto  meet him in a dark alley,’ adds Mackenzie. \nReiner’s wonky knees and mangled knuckles told his  story as  he \nhobbled around the  paddock doling out  insults to  his  English mates. ‘T \nhate you fucking English,’ he used to say.  ‘You killed my dad  in the war. \nOkay, so  he was drunk and fell  out  of a  lookout tower...’ \n4 —  Kevin Schwantz \nOur only nutter to  have won the 500 world championship, Kevin \nSchwantz \nspent \nmuch \nof \nhis \neight-year \nGP \ncareer \nbattling \nhis \ncrashing \ndemons. \nBut \nlike \nmost \nracers \nhe \nwas \nmaddest \nin \nhis \nearly \nyears. \nHis \nearliest \nBritish \noutings \n— \nin \nthe \n1986 \nand \n1987 \nTransatlantic \nseries \n— \nwere \nunforgettable \ndisplays \nof \na \nburgeoning \nriding \ntalent \npumped \nto \nbreaking \npoint \nby \ndangerous \namounts \nof \nit’ll-never-happen-to-me \nlunacy; the  old  genius/madness interface. \n‘He \nwas \ndefinitely \na \nbit \nmental \nearly \non,’ \nremembers \nformer \nrival \nand \nteam-mate \nNiall \nMackenzie. \n‘Again, \na \nlot \nof \nit \nwas \njust \npushing \nso  \nhard \non \nuncompetitive \nmachinery.’ \n\n270 \n‘There was blood \neverywhere, but we \nwere all drunk so  we \ndidn’t feel any pain’ \nTHE FAST STUFF \nLike most nutters, Schwantz>surfed a  wave of \ntestosterone that didn’t stop flowing when he climbed \noff the  bike. He  was famous for  being king of aprés- \nrace excess —  half-drowning himself in  a  fountain \nduring the notorious end-of-season party that followed \nthe 1992 South African GP  crashing Porsches into \nditches or  playing knuckles with Mackenzie. ‘There \nwas blood everywhere,’ Mackenzie grins. ‘Kevin always came up  with \nthese painful games, but we  were all drunk so we  didn’t feel  any pain.’ \n5 —  Carlos Lavado \nIt  takes a  very special brand of nuttiness to  lead a  race by a  country \nmile, then fall  off.  Kevin Schwantz and Graziano Rossi were good at \nthis but  nowhere near as  good as  Carlos Lavado (Careless Bravado to \nhis  mates), winner of the 1983 and 1986 world 250 titles. Clutching \ndefeat from the  jaws of  victory was Lavado’s specialist subject —  he \ntumbled out  of first place three times in  ’84  alone. But that’s not all, \nLavado could do better than that, he  could even lead a  race, crash, get \nback up  with the  leaders and then crash again. No  one ever picked up \na fallen bike quicker, but  then he had a lot of practice at it. \nThe lovable Venezuelan was certainly a  nutter but he  was also \nastonishingly talented, almost as  if the bikes and tyres of his  era  hadn’t \ncaught up with his  riding ability. In  1985 Lavado gave Freddie Spencer \na  seriously hard time in the  250  world championship, even though his \nYamaha was way slower than Spencer’s Honda. Spencer rarely admitted \nto  the  skills of his  rivals, but  he  was moved to  say  that he  was really \nquite scared of Lavado. \nIt  should also be  noted that it was Lavado who began the  paddock \nfashion for wearing your helmet atop your head and backwards, a style \nnow adopted by London scooter kids. \n6 —-  Ron Haslam \nThis is not  Ron Haslam the elder statesman of British roadracing whom \nwe  all  know and love. This is Ron Haslam the  long-haired loony from \nLangley Mill who put the fear of God into the British racing establishment \nduring the  late 1970s. \nHaslam was a greasy, fearless teenager when he burst onto the  scene \nin 1974, riding ratty, metalflake silver Pharaoh Yamaha TZ750s belonging \n\nTHE \nMADDEST \nRACERS \nIN  \nTHE \nWORLD, \nEVER \nPOI \nto  \nwell \n‘ard \ncar  \ndealer \nMal \nCarter, \nfather \nof \n250 \nGP  \nwinner \nAlan \nand \nformer \nspeedway \nworld \nchamp \nKenny. \nMick \nGrant, \nthen \na  \nKawasaki \nfactory \nrider, \nremembers \n‘wild \nyoung \nRon \nupsetting \nthe \nold \nschool, \nbarging \ninto \nme \nand \nBarry \n[Sheene] \nat \nCadwell’. \nHaslam \nwas \nindeed \nterrifying \nto \nbehold \nas \nhe \ncrashed \nand \nburned \nhis \nway \nto the \ntop \non \nCarter’s \nTZs. \nThe \nPharaoh \nYam \nset-up \nwas \nfrom \nanother \nage \nof \nBritain, \nwhen \nmen \nstill \ngot \ndirty \ndown \nthe \npits \nand \nserious \nglamour \nwas \na \none- \nweek \npackage \nholiday \nin \nTorremolinos. \nHaslam was so  lairy that his  decision to  race the  deadly Isle  of Man \nTT  circuit in  1978 was greeted with horror by some, though by that \ntime he  had been signed. by Honda Britain. The factory-backed team \nsmoothed off  Haslam’s rough edges, eventually propelling him into a \nreasonably successful career in 500  GPs. \n7 -  Jeremy McWilliams \nJeremy McWilliams carved a  career out of  racing uncompetitive \nmotorcycles in  the world’s most competitive racing class, so  it’s  not \nreally his  fault that he’s in this top ten. If McWilliams had been blessed \nwith more horsepower during his  ten  years in GPs, he might have been \nable to  channel his  undoubted talents into perfecting a  smooth and \ngracious riding style. Instead he  had no  alternative but to  develop a \ntechnique that’s the  racing equivalent of a  military full-frontal attack \n—  frighteningly late braking that occasionally employs rivals and/or \ntheir motorcycles as  extra deceleration aids. \nWe  can  barely imagine what it’s  like to  be  at  the  receiving end of a \nMcWilliams onslaught, but  fellow MotoGP rider John Hopkins got  a \ntaste during their hard-fought duel in  the 2002 Australian GP. \n‘McWilliams is an  evil  little rascal, some of the  moves he pulled were a \nbit heavy,’ said Hopper, with a tinge of understatement in his  voice. \nMcWilliams’ total commitment to  winning the  racing line, whoever \nmight be in his  way, has  won him great respect from those people who \nappreciate riders with oversized crown jewels, like the  Italians, which \nis  why Aprilia were always keen to  give him a  job, and the  hard-to- \nimpress King Kenny Roberts for whom McWill rode in 2002 and 2003. \n8 —‘Omobono’ Tenni \nTomasso ‘Omobono’ (Italian for ‘good man’) Tenni was a nutter back in \nthe  days when world war seemed a reasonable way of proving that you \n\n272 THE FAST STUFF \nwere bigger and tougher than the next guy. In  other words, he must’ve \nbeen seriously frightening. \nTenni made his  name during the  interwar years, dazzling fans with \nhis  fearlessness. They nicknamed him Death Defying Man but it didn’t \ndo  him any good, for  he  was killed in  an  accident during practice for \nthe  1948 Swiss grand prix. \nFrom a poor peasant background, Tenni started racing and winning \nas a teenager, quickly gaining a reputation for riding with total abandon. \nAfter landing a  factory Moto Guzzi ride he  terrified the  British on  his \nTT debut. While the Italians loved his fearless, wall-grazing riding style, \nthe  more uptight Brits found it all too  much and gave him yet another \nnickname: ‘Black Devil’. Nevertheless Tenni became the  first Italian to \nwin a TT when he  triumphed in the  1937 Lightweight TT.  He  also won \nthree Italian 500 titles and two Milan—Naples roadraces, losing two \ntoes in another attempt at  Milan—Naples victory. \n9 -  Noboru Ueda \nRacial stereotypes dictate that Japanese riders are  inscrutable, obscure \nand scary. Noboru Ueda was definitely scary but he  was neither \ninscrutable nor obscure. Nobby —  as  his  European fans liked to  call \nhim -  rarely stopped grinning during his  decade on  the GP  scene, \napart from those occasions when he  was gnashing his teeth after \nthrowing away another likely victory with another impossible \nmanoeuvre gone wrong. \nUeda was the  first breath of Japan’s storm from the  east that swept \nthrough 125  GPs during the  early 1990s. Within a  few years riders like \nUeda, Kazuto Sakata, Haruchika Aoki, Takeshi Tsujimura, Tomomi \nManako, Masao Azuma, Masaki Tokudome and  Youichi Ui made Japan \nthe  third most successful nation in  125s, most of them also reinforcing \nthe  kamikaze stereotype on  account of their out-of-control riding. \nUeda stayed faithful to  the  proper nutters’ class throughout his  GP \ncareer, probably substantially contributing to  profits at  the Honda \nMotor Company as  he demolished one Honda RS125 after another. He \ncame close to winning the  125 world title in 1994 and 1997; and suffered \nnasty hand injuries the  following year that would’ve put lesser hard \nnuts out  of racing for  good. Instead Ueda had a special bionic glove \nmade for his right hand with spring-loaded fingers, because he couldn’t \nopen the  hand once he had clenched it. \n\nTHE MADDEST RACERS IN  THE WORLD, EVER 278 \n10 -  Toni Elias \nToni Elias would be  the  Tony Montana of bike racing, except that he \nseems a much nicer guy than Scarface. It is Elias’ swarthy Latin looks, \nmonobrow and don’t-give-a-fuck riding style that liken him to \nScorsese’s seriously nasty cocaine baron, but  Scarface never grinned as \nmuch as  Elias does. Then again, maybe Elias’ cheery complexion is that \nof the  grinning maniac —  he’s just looking forward to  the  next time he \nstuffs someone really badly when he’s out  on  the  track. \nElias established his  hard-man credentials early on,  bashing fairings \nwith 125  rival Manuel Poggiali in 2001 and proving that he was quite \nprepared to  sort things out  back in the paddock when he felt he’d been \ndone over. \nIn 2002 Elias won his  first 250  GP victory with an  inspired final-turn \nmanoeuvre over Marco Melandri that was five parts genius, two parts \nmadness. In 2003 he trashed his  title hopes with a berserk last-lap attack \non  Poggiali at Rio  that was more like six parts madness, ten  parts bravery \nand zero parts genius. But  at least the  boy gave it a go. We  advise you  to \nlove this  kid because he’s a huge laugh and he’s going far. \nDishonourable mentions: Wayne Gardner, Ruben Xaus, James \nHaydon, Alan Carter, Paul Lewis, Yvon DuHamel and anyone else who \nrode in the  Yamaha Pro-Am series. \nMotoGP Mutterings: May 2004 \nCelebrating 25  years of getting away with it \nFour \nthirty \nin  \nthe  \nmorning, \nboth \nof \nus  \nstill  \npissed, \nstill  \nstinking \nfrom \nthe \nnight \nbefore. \nPushing \nthe \ntwo  \nratty \nRD400s \nup \nthe \nbuilder’s \nplank \nand \ninto \nthe \nrusting \nTransit \nvan. \nThat \nbleary \ndrive \nto \nSnetterton \nin \nbleakest \nearly \nMarch, \nwondering \nhow \nthe \nsnide \npistons \nI’d \njust \nfitted \nwould \nhandle \na \nSaturday \nand \nSunday \nof \nheavy-handed \nabuse. \nOf \ncourse, \nthey \nwouldn't \neven \nlast \nthrough \npractice, \nbut \nwe \nwere \nshockingly \nnaive \nback \nin \n1979. \nThings \nwere \ndifferent \nwhen \nI \ngot \ninto \nbike \nracing \n25 \nyears \nago, \nlife \neven \nsmelt \ndifferent. \nThe \nmate \nwith \nwhom \nI \nshared \nthat \nTransit \nwas \njust \nstarting \nout \nracing, \nlike \nme, \nso \nhe \nused \nto \nget \na \nbit \ntoo \nnervous \nwhile \nwaiting \non \nthe \ngrid \nand \nend \nup \npissing \nhimself. \nI \ncan \nstill \nsmell \nthe \ndrive \nhome \n— \npiss-stained \nleathers \nhanging \nin \nthe \nback \nof \nthe \nvan. \n\n274 THE FAST STUFF \nOh yes, how things have changed.

But \nnot  quite. While your average modern-day MotoGP star is wondrously \ntalented and laser-guided by his  management team, we  were a bunch \nof  terrifyingly inept morons, happy enough to  spend our weekends \ncharging into turn one, fuelled by  a  dangerous mix of  blundering \ninnocence, testosterone, punk rock and Harp lager. Getting stupidly \ndrunk was all  part of  the  deal, so  we’d crash out  on  the  floor of the \nTransit at  3am Sunday morning, gobble down a full English in  the \npaddock canteen at  nine and be on  the  grid for  the  first race at  ten. \nJesus Christ, what on  earth were we  thinking? \nNo  wonder we  crashed a lot.  I distinctly remember a  250 proddie \nrace at  Snetterton that claimed more than half the  grid in just six  laps, \nthat’s about 20 crashes in less than seven minutes, after two restarts. I \ndidn’t even make it beyond the  first corner, tumbling out  in a  six-man \npile-up that smeared tyre marks across my  helmet. My  own personal \nrecord was four crashes in a  weekend at  Brands Hatch, two at  Druids \nhairpin within an  hour of each other. I lay the  blame for  this kind of \nbehaviour firmly at  Yamaha’s front door. By  manufacturing the  250 \nand 350LC they sent half of  Britain’s biking youth barking mad, \nlaunching a thousand racing careers and causing god knows how many \nthousands of broken bones. I’m sure the  LC  racing boom of the  early \n1980s was largely responsible for  getting the  NHS into such a  mess — \nwe  clogged up  hospitals from Norwich to  Nottingham for years. \nThey \ncalled \nus  \nthe \nheadbangers \nand \nwith \ngood \nreason. \nWe \nwere \nNorthern \nnutters \nand \nLondon \ngeezers, \nfighting \npitched \nracetrack \nbattles \nacross \nthe \ncountry \nas \nfiery \nriots \nraged \nfrom \nBrixton \nto \nToxteth. \nThere \nwere \ndodgy \nEnfield \ntypes \nwho \nfinanced \ntheir \nracing \nby \nnicking \nbikes \nand \nDurham \nminers \nwho \nkept \ngoing \nby  \nclaiming \non  \ndodgy \ninjury \ninsurance \npolicies. \nI \nwas \nthe  \nodd-one-out \npublic \nschoolboy \nbut  \nI \nwas \nas \ncrazed \nas  \neveryone \nelse \nso  \nthat \nwas \nokay, \nI \ndidn’t \nget  \nany \nhassle. \nThings \nwere \nno  \nless \nout  \nof \ncontrol \nat  \nhome. \nI \nshared \na \nhouse \nin \nwest \nLondon \nwith \ntwo \nracing \nmates, \nwhich \ncaused \nall \nkinds \nof \ntrouble \nwith \nthe  \nsuburbanites. \nBikes, \nvans \nand \ncaravans \nlittered \nour \nstreet, \nmates \nturned \nup \nto \ngive \nus  \nimpromptu \nwheelie \ndisplays \non  \nZ1300s, \nand \nwhen \n\n25  YEARS OF  GETTING AWAY WITH IT 275 \nwe  \npainted \nthe  \nhouse \nin \nteam \ncolours \nthe \nlocals \ngot \nup \na \npetition \nto \nget \nrid  \nof \nus,  \nclaiming \nwe  \nwere \nrunning \na  \nquasi-commercial \nrace \nteam \non \nthe \npremises. \nWhen \none \nneighbour \ncomplained \nthat \nthe \nrusting \ntruck \noutside \nour \nfront \ndoor \n‘wasn’t \nvery \naesthetic’, \nwe replied: \n‘What \ncolour \nwould \nyou like \nit \npainted \nthen?’ \nOf  course, we  were too  young to  give a  fuck, though an  Interpol \npolice raid did  sober us  up  for a while. One of our  gang had lent a bike \nto a mate who was touring Europe, but  the guy got busted trying to get \nheroin into Sweden. Oops. \nIf we  shared anything with today’s MotoGP stars it may have been a \ndemented belief in our  own immortality. But that youthful conviction \ntends to  fade as  reality bites. So just as  MotoGP got more serious after \nDaijiro Kato’s death in  2003, so  did  we, as  mates and loved ones fell \nvictim to  our foolish mania for  going absolutely as  fast as  possible \nwherever we  were. During less  than a decade I lost  six mates (including \nHoward Lees and Dave Chisman, with whom I'd  shared that London \nhouse) and my brother. Cheating death stops being fun  once it’s  death \nthat’s doing the  cheating. \nHoward and Dave were the prime movers behind Team Bike, a quasi- \ncommercial race team (okay, so  we  can admit it  now) named after \nBritish magazine Bike that started off  as  an  excuse to  get  pissed in \npaddock bars across Britain and ended up  as  an  excuse to  get pissed in \npaddock bars from the  Nurburgring to  Suzuka. We  were a  bunch of \nmiddle-class hoodlums who spent our summers driving around the \nContinent doing the  Bol  d’Or and Le Mans 24 hours, fuelled by a heady \nmix of  cheap French wine, strong weed and a desire for world \ndomination. We  had a habit of getting into trouble. \nDuring the  Barcelona 24  hours we  triggered a  mini-riot that ended \nwith rifle-toting cops herding several of us  into vans and off to  prison. \nAnd after the  Bol  d’Or a  gang of our  maddest supporters got  nailed by \ncops getting nasty with CS  gas and truncheons; more broken bones and \nconcussions. I’m  not  proud, but  it did  seem funny at  the  time. \nI tend not  to  get  into trouble with the  cops any more. Instead I take \nmy  luncheon in  fancy MotoGP VIP suites, surrounded by sponsorship \nfixers, \nCEOs \nand \nattorneys, \nmaking \ncivilised \nconversation \nwith \nPR \nflunkies \nand \nsmiling \nhospitality \ngirls. \nThings \naren’t \nany \nbetter \nnow \nand \nneither \nare \nthey \nany \nworse, \nthey’re \njust \ndifferent. \nAnd \na \nlot \nquieter. \nThank fuck. \n\nCHAPTERS 7 \nTHE YEAR THAT CHANGED \nRossl!'S LIFE \nJuly 2004 \nArguably the greatest rider of  all  time, Valentino Rossi came \nof  age as  a  racer and a  personality during the 1997 GP \nseason. Rossi, his  mates and his  rivals recall how he  became a \nsuperstar overnight \nValentino Rossi was just another crash-happy teenage GP  rider when \nhe  commenced the 1997 125  world championship. The kid  had won \njust a  single race in his  rookie ’96  GP  season, so  back in  the  spring of \n‘97  no  one had any idea of the  greatness that lay ahead for  the  girlie- \nlooking Italian. However, by the  end of that year there was no  doubt \nthat Rossi was a bit  special —  at  the  age  of just 17  he  was already 125 \nworld champion and a bona fide superstar. \nDuring ‘97  he won 11  GPs from 15  starts on  his  factory Aprilia 125, \nall  the  while developing the  talent that would allow him to  go  on  to \ndominate every GP  category —  from 125s to  250s and from 500s to \nMotoGP. \nBut what really grabbed everyone’s attention that summer were \nRossi’s hilarious post-race theatrics. One weekend he  would take a \nblow-up doll for  a  ride on  his  victory lap, the  next he’d arrive on  the \npodium dressed like superman. These comic displays made him much, \nmuch more than just another fast  man on  a motorcycle. They turned all \nkinds of people on  to Valentino Rossi, ultimately transforming him into \nthe biggest bike racing star the world has  ever known. \nThus the  1997 season made Rossi the  man he  is today. Here we  look \nback at  that crucial year with the  help of  six  witnesses: Rossi himself, \nNobby Ueda, Rossi’s main rival for  the  '97  125  title, former Aprilia race \nboss Carlo Pernat who in 1995 had signed Rossi to a three-year deal, Uccio \nSalluci, Rossi’s best mate and constant companion since they were five \nyears old,  dad  Graziano, a three-time 250  GP winner in 1979 and myself. \n\nTHE YEAR THAT CHANGED ROsSsI’S LIFE Pili] \nGraziano: 1997 was a fantastic season, Valentino’s first with a factory \nmachine. There were ten  or  12  very fast riders in  125s, so  he  had to \nfight very much. There were some very beautiful races. \nValentino: In  96  my  bike was very slow, I had many good races but \nalso some big, crazy mistakes. For  ‘97  I had a  good bike, so  I knew in \nmy  heart I could win the  championship, though winning 11  races and \nnot  making too  many mistakes was a surprise. \nPernat: I signed Valentino the  first time I watched him ride in  ’95. \nGraziano had been a  friend for  many years and he  told me  ‘my son  is \nvery strong’, so  I went to  see. Unbelievable. I made a contract that day \nfor  three years —  ‘96, ‘97  and '98  —  and I signed it with his  father and \nmother because Valentino was only 15,  too  young to  sign. We  put  him \nin a  team with Mauro Noccioli as  his  engineer, because Mauro is very \ngood with young riders. \nUeda: I already knew Rossi when he was 11  because I lived only one \nkilometre from him in  Italy. On  weekend nights we’d go  to  minimoto \ncourses and enjoy racing together. I wasn’t as  fast as \nhim. When he  started GPs in  ’96, he  stayed at  my \nhouse in Japan. At  first my  friends thought he was a ‘A  rider like \ngirl but I  told them he  would be  the next world Valentino is born \nchampion. Before ’97  his  riding style was so  wild, he every 20 years —  he’s \ncrashed \nmany \ntimes. \nI  \nthink \nhe  \nwas \nstudying \nthe \nsimilar \nto \nguys \nlike \nlimit \nand \nhow \nhe  \ncould \ncontrol \nhis  \nmachine \n100  \nper \nPele, \nMcEnroe, \ncent. \nBy \n’97  \nit \nwas \nvery \ndifficult \nto  \nbeat \nhim. \nMuhammad \nAli \nor \nMaradona’ \nOxley: It was obvious that Rossi was really good, but \nthere’ve been plenty of great 125 racers who never \nmade \nit \nin \n250s, \nlet \nalone \n500s \nor \nMotoGP. \nIt \nturned \nout \nthat \nhe \nwas \nway, \nway \nbetter \nthan \nmost \nof \nus \nrealised, \nin \nevery \npossible \nway. \nPernat: \nA \nrider \nlike \nValentino \nis \nborn \nevery \n20 \nyears. \nFor \nme  \nhe’s \nsimilar \nto  \nguys \nlike \nPele, \nMcEnroe, \nMuhammad \nAli \nor  \nMaradona \n—  \npeople \nwho \ntower \nover \ntheir \nsports. \nTwo \nqualities \nmake \nhim \nspecial. \nFirst, \nhis \nsense \nof \nbalance \non \nthe \nmotorcycle \nis \nunbelievable; \nI’ve \nnever \nseen \nanything \nlike \nit. \nSecond, \nhe \nhas \nfun, \nhe \namuses \nhimself \nby \nracing, \nthat’s \nall \nhe \n\n278 THE FAST STUFF \ndoes, he  amuses himself. His other big  skill is  finding the limit so \nquickly. While most riders have to  get  there step by step, his  sense of \nbalance allows him to get there so  quick. At first he crashed a lot trying \nto  find the  limit too  fast, he was lucky not  to  get injured. \nUeda: His riding skill is  about controlling his  weight on  the bike — \nthrough the  footpegs, the  seat, the  tank, the  handlebars. He  moves so \nwell, it’s  like  he’s dancing on  the bike. This allows him to move traction \nbetween the front tyre and rear tyre, depending where he is in the corner, \nand  it also helps turn the bike, especially when the  tyres are  finished. He \ncan  find side grip especially at the end of races by shifting backwards and \npushing on  the  outside ‘peg to put weight on  the  rear tyre. \nHe  was fun  to  race, he  never cut  me  up,  but  I knew I couldn’t play \nwith him, so  I just gave gas  all the  time. The  race I remember best from \n‘97  was Austria, because I won! He  made a  small mistake at  the  last \ncorner and I passed him just before the  finish line. \nSalucci: We  have been friends since we  were five. We  used to race each \nother on  minimotos, but  I stopped after that and started going to  races \nwith him. I always knew he was very fast but I never imagined the future. \nIn ‘97 we  were too  young to notice that he might be a really good rider. \nOxley: Rossi ran  away with the championship. He won two of the  first \nthree GPs and  would’ve won round two at  Suzuka if he hadn’t crashed \non  the  last  lap. That was when I first noticed he was a bit  special as  a \nperson —  he  didn’t pull a  strop, but  limped back to  the  pits, grinning \nand waving, then told us:  ‘At  first I thought I could win, now I just \nthink I’m an  idiot’. He  made us  laugh. It  was a  breath of  fresh air \nbecause GPs were pretty dull back then, Doohan was  breaking everyone’ \nballs in 500s and the paddock was so  serious, like  working in an  office, \na nightmare. The fun  really started at Mugello. \nValentino: Mugello is always crazy. Up on  the  hill  it’s  another world, \nthe  crowd is coming crazy: drink, naked people on  motocross bikes... \nIn  ‘97  I went up  in  the  evening and it was very dangerous, everyone \njumping on  me, shouting ‘Rossi! Rossi!’ There was this big  wall of \npeople and only one way out, through the  shower block, so  I rode my \nscooter through the  shower block. \n\nTHE YEAR THAT CHANGED RosSsI’S LIFE 279 \nOxley: Rossi won the  race, then ripped the  piss out  of Biaggi by riding \nhis victory lap with a blow-up doll called Claudia Schiffer. A few months \nearlier Biaggi had been putting it about that he  had shagged Naomi \nCampbell but  no  one really believed him. The display had everyone in \nhysterics —  we  wondered what he’d think of next. \nGraziano: These gags weren’t so  much for  the fans, they were \nmore for  ‘his friends and for  his fan club, the people who were \nbehind him, the  people who loved him. I always knew what gags they \nwere planning. My favourite was Jerez ‘98  when he  won the 250 \nrace, then climbed inside a  marshal’s Portaloo halfway round the \nvictory lap. \nValentino: When I came to  GPs all  the  riders were very, very serious. \nSo  when I started winning, me  and my  friends decided we  should try \nto  make some big fun. \nSalucci: I was one of ten  people who would meet on  Tuesdays before \nraces to organise the gag. Then I would arrive at the track on Wednesdays \nto  find a  nice place to  do  the  gag. We  bought the  material for  the \n‘Superfumi’ cape and made it  ourselves for  Assen, but for  Mugello \nwe  rang someone from the fan club to  buy a  blow-up doll from a \nsex  shop. \nPernat: Valentino doesn’t like Biaggi. They are  different characters — \nValentino doesn’t like hanging out with movie stars, Biaggi is  the \nopposite, he likes to  be with famous people. \nValentino made a lot  of theatre at  this time —  he  entered the  hearts \nof \nordinary \npeople \nwho \nwant \nto \ndream. \nAnd \nit \nwas \nthis \nthat \nhelped \nbike \nracing \nappeal \nto \nthe \nwhole \nfamily: \nthe \nkids, \nthe \nmothers, \nthe \ngrandfathers, the  grandmothers. \nBut \nValentino \nis  \nclever, \nwhile \nhe  \namuses \nhimself, \nhe  \nalways \nhas \na \ngoal \nin \nmind. \nSome \npeople \nsay \nhe \nhas \nless \nego \nthan \nother \nriders \nbut \nI \nthink \nhe \nhas \na \nbigger \nego. \nHe \nis \nvery \nclever \npsychologically. \nBiaggi \nwas \nalways \nso \nmentally \nstrong \nagainst \nany \nenemy \nbut \nValentino \nis \nstronger. \nFor \nfour \nor \nfive \nyears \nthey’ve \nhad \nthis \npsychological \nwar. \nValentino \nhas \nwon \nit \nbecause \nhe \nhas \nfun; \nBiaggi \ndoesn’t \nhave \nfun, \nhe \njust gets angry. \n\n280 THE FAST STUFF \nOxley: Valentino was totally unique. Not  only did he do all this comedy \non  the  track, he’d also spend Sunday evenings in  the  media centre, \nchatting and joking with journalists. No other rider does that. Sometimes \nit was hard to get any work done! Of course, he doesn’t do it any more, \nthese days he needs to get away from the  media. \nIt was at Imola ’97  that I realised he’d become a superstar —  his  fans \ncovered half the  hillside on  the  pit  straight, so  he  was already more \npopular than Doohan and Biaggi. You’d go  to  his  motorhome and \nthere’d be  20  teenage girls hanging around outside, even though he \nhad a girlfriend at  the  time. \nSalucci: We  really enjoyed having so  many girls around! Maybe some \ntop riders or  superstars worry ‘Is this girl coming to  see  me  because I’m \nfamous or  does she really like me?’, but Valentino didn’t think like that, \nhe always said ‘I don’t care why she’s coming to  see  me, I’m just happy \nthat she  is coming!’ \nPernat: I’ve never seen so  many girls around a  rider, maybe \nSheene or  Lucchinelli but  never so  many. Valentino doesn’t like to  stay \nwith a  girl  more than two or  three months. He  lived like a  kid then \nand he  lives like a  kid now, with the same friends, the same way \nof  life. After the racing is  finished it’s impossible to  find him, \nno one knows where he  goes, maybe he’s in  London, maybe \nhe’s in  a  disco with some friends he’s known since he  was a  boy. He \nnever changes, he  doesn’t want to  be  famous, he  doesn’t want a \nmovie star girlfriend, he  doesn’t want to  be  in  the papers with \nfamous people. \nUeda: Frankly speaking, I feel sorry for him now, his  life  is too  busy — \ntoo many fans come to  see him, too many journalists, too many \ncameramen. He just loves riding bikes, otherwise he wouldn’t continue. \nAt the end of 97 I went to the Milan bike show and was surprised there \nwere so  many girls after him. He  had seven or  eight security around \nhim —  big macho men —  otherwise he wouldn’t have been able to move. \nI was on  the  stand of one of my  sponsors, who also sponsored Rossi, \nand he  arrived saying ‘Incredible, what can I do? I want to  get  away.’ \nSo  I went out  front to  sign autographs until there was a  crowd, so  he \ncould escape out  the  back. \n\nTHE \nYEAR \nTHAT \nCHANGED \nRoOssI’S \nLIFE \n281 \nSalucci: \nValentino \nhated \nthe  \nsecurity \nguys, \nso  \nat  \nthe  \n98  \nBologna \nbike \nshow \nhe \nwore \na \nwig, \ndark \nglasses \nand \na \nbaseball \ncap. \nHe \nwas \nso  \nhappy \nthat \nhe \ncould \ncheck \nout \nthe \nbikes \nwithout \ngetting \nmobbed. \nOxley: He  wrapped up  the  title at  Brno in  August, then announced \nhe’d move up to 250s in 98.  He  didn’t see  the point of hanging around \nto  pose with the number-one plate the next year. He  was world \nchampion at  17,  and still driving around Europe with his  dad in a  tiny \ncamper van. \nGraziano: | was very happy for him, my feeling was more joy than pride, \nI’m  not  a proud person. Valentino didn’t change inside during '97 but by \nthe end of the season we  had seen too  much of each other. We  shared this \ncamper all  summer and were always fighting. It was terrible because he \ncannot go to bed before one  o’clock, it’s impossible for him —  then I had to \nwake him up in the morning, the most difficult job in the world! I had to \nwake him once, twice, three times. In the end  I got his engineer to do it. \nValentino: Maybe the  best thing about going to  250s in ’98  was that I \ncould get out  of bed later. I had to  get up  at  seven for  125  practice, and \nthat was a big problem. In  250s I could stay in bed until nine. \nSalucci: As  ‘97  went on  I was amazed at what was happening. We  had \nnever imagined how big  our  adventure would become, but I was also \nvery happy that Valentino had realised his  dream. To  this day our \nrelationship has  never changed, but he has  changed in the way he relates \nto  the  media, the  fans, the  people who aren’t around him all the  time. \nOxley: \nValentino \nwas \nsuch \na \nlaugh \nin \n’97  \nthat \nit \nwas \neasy \nto \nforget \nhow \nbrilliantly \nhe \nwas \nriding. \nAnd \nwe \nwere \nonly \nseeing \nthe \nvery \nbeginnings \nof \na \ntalent \nand \na \ncharacter \nthat \nhas \nstill \ngot \nus \ntransfixed. \nIt’s \ndifficult \nto \nwonder \nwhat \nhe \nwill \ndo \nnext, \nhe’s \nalways \nout \nfor \nnew \nchallenges. \nHe \nnever \nwants \nto \ntake \nthe \neasy \noption \nand \ncount \nthe \nquids, \nhe’s \nalways \nsearching \nfor \nsomething \nnew \nto have \na \npop \nat. \nPernat: \nEvery \ntime \nValentino \ndoes \nsomething \nnew \nhe  \nsurprises \nus  \nand \nprobably \nhimself. \nEven \nhe \ndoesn’t \nknow \nhow \nfar \nhe \nmight \ngo. \nI \nactually \nthink \nthat \nno \none \nknows \nhis \nabsolute \nlimit. \n\nCHAPTER 38 \nRIDE LIKE \nTHE GODS \nJuly 2004 \nValentino Rossi may well be  the best motorcycle rider ever to \nhave walked this earth, so  who better to  ask for  a  few riding \ntips? And for good measure Mick Doohan, Kevin Schwantz, \nKenny Roberts Junior, Garry McCoy and Jeremy McWilliams \nexplain a few of their riding secrets \nValentino Rossi is  a  man in  love with motorcycles. The seven-time \nworld champ is  arguably the  greatest bike racer in  history, but that’s \nnot  all.  While most pro  racers shirk road riding, claiming that it’s  too \ndangerous, Rossi is a regular on  the  streets, especially in his home town \nof London where bikes rule. The Italian bubbles over with enthusiasm \nwhen talking about street riding, just as  he  does when he  talks about \nriding on  the  track. So  who better to  ask  for  advice about how to  get \nmore out  of your motorcycle, whether you're riding to  work or  getting \nyour knee down at  a  track day? \n‘T  still ride on  the  road always, I enjoy it but for  sure it’s  not the \ntrack,’ says Rossi. ‘The problem with the  road is it’s  full  of “stupids”, \nespecially in cars, and also you never know the  grip of the  asphalt, so \nyou need to  stay a little bit  slower than on  the  track.’ \nMental focus \nMental focus is  everything when you're on  a  motorcycle, no  matter \nwhether you’re on  the track or  the street. There is  nothing more \nfundainental to  good riding than focusing on  the task in  hand and \nbeing aware of what’s going on  around you so  you can  be prepared to \nexpect the  unexpected. \n‘When you ride you should try  and forget everything else,’ says \nRossi. ‘Don’t think about the  rest of your life  or  the  rest of the  world. \nTry  to  forget all  that and think only of the  road or  the  track and the \n\n— \nRIDE LIKE THE GODS 283 \nbike. It’s  not  always easy to  stay focused on  the  bike, sometimes you \nfeel that one part of the brain rides the bike; thinks about the tyre, sees \nthe  road, but maybe the  other part is  thinking about a girl, a  friend, \na  song.’ \nBreathing \nRiding a  motorcycle is a  strenuous activity, and the  faster you go,  the \nmore strenuous it  becomes. Breathing is  therefore vital, to  provide \nenough oxygen for  brain activity and muscle movement. This may \nsound obvious but many riders tense up  when they’re on  board, \nwhich reduces their oxygen intake, just when they need to  increase it. \nAs  a  hugely experienced racer, Rossi’s breathing technique comes \nnaturally, but he  still wears athlete’s nostril flares to  improve his \noxygen intake. \n‘On the  bike you need to  stay concentrated and relaxed, and to  do \nthat you need to  have enough air  for  the  brain.’ \nLooking ahead \nLooking and planning ahead are  also fundamentals to  fast, effective \nand safe riding, wherever you are. Racers usually think one corner \nahead; you should use  a  similar technique on  the  road. \n‘When you ride a  big, fast bike, everything happens very fast so  you \nneed to  stay 100 per cent concentrated on  what is  going to  happen \nnext. You  need to ride with your mind a little bit in front of the bike. On \nthe  track I’m  always thinking about the  next corner.’ \nKeeping it smooth \nThe \nbest \nracers \nand \nriders \nwork \nsmoothly \non  \ntheir \nbikes, \nbecause \ngetting \nvicious \nwith \nthe \nthrottle, \nbrakes \nand \nsteering \nmakes \nyou \nslower, \nnot \nfaster. \n‘Riding \nis  \nvery \nmuch \nabout \nall  \nyour \nmovement \non  \nthe  \nmotorcycle. \nThe \nbike \nfeels \nevery \nmove \nyou \nmake \n— \nthe \nbraking, \nthe \nthrottle \nand \nyour \nmovement \nto \nsteer \nthe \nbike. \nTo \nhave \neverything \nunder \ncontrol \nis \nbetter \nto \nride \nsmooth. \nMaybe \nwith \nlittle \nbikes, \nlike \n125s, \nit’s \npossible \nto \nbe \nmore \naggressive. \nBut \non \nmore \nheavy \nbikes \n— \nlike \na \nMotoGP \nbike \nor \n1000cc \nstreet \nbike \n— \nyou \nneed \nto \nride \nsmooth \nby \nmaking \nall \nyour \nmovements \nvery \nsmooth. \nIf \nyou \nride \ntoo \naggressive \nyou \nwill \nlose stability.’ \n\n284 THE FAST STUFF \nMaking mistakes \nEveryone makes mistakes, even Rossi. But  how to make sure you don’t \nmake them again? When you're riding or  racing, you’re thinking about \nso  many things that it’s  not  easy to  alert yourself to  any cock-ups you \nmake. Rossi has  a simple way to  ensure he knows he’s made a mistake \n—  he talks to himself! \n‘Yes, I very much talk to  myself when I am  on  the  bike. If I brake a \nlittle early for  a  corner and lose some time, I will say  to  myself ‘Fack! \nBrake a little more deep next time!’ I talk to  myself more on  the  track \nthan on  the  street. On  the  street I am  always a little more nervous, \nbecause a car  can  exit from a  street at  any  moment, so  you  need to  be \nmore relaxed.’ \nMan-machine relationship \nWorking as  one with your machine is  vital. You need to  know your \nmotorcycle, so  you can  understand what you can  do  to  ride faster and \nmore safely. \n‘The rider is a big part of the  motorcycle, so  you need to  understand \nthat you are  a  part of the  bike. It’s  not the  bike and the  rider —  both \nneed to  be  like one thing. You also need to  think about having a \ngood relationship with the  bike and making a direct rapport with it. \nTry to  understand what she wants from you, so  you can ride \nthe bike differently, especially if  you want to  make good of \ndifferent settings, different tyres and other modifications. You always \nneed to  arrive at  this situation step by step. If you think well and go \nstep by step, you should be  able to  have a  100 per  cent feeling with \nyour bike.’ \nThrottle control \nWhen it  comes to  machine control, nothing is  quite as  important \nas  throttle control. Working the throttle doesn’t just make your \nmotorcycle go  faster or  slower, it  also affects how the bike steers \nand handles. \n‘For sure throttle control is  the most important part of  riding a \nbike. It’s  very difficult with a  big bike, like a MotoGP bike or  1000cc \nstreetbike, because you can  spin the  rear tyre even in the  dry. The only \nway to  learn throttle control is  experience, riding as  many bikes as \npossible in  as  many conditions as  possible. A  few years ago I made \n\nRIDE LIKE THE GODS 285 \nsome training with a motocross bike with enduro tyres on  tarmac, just \nto  slide easy and to  understand the  slide. I think the  dirt is the  best \nplace to  start this training. \n‘But basically you need to  make many kilometres because you need \nto  understand the  power delivery of the  bike. When you understand \nhow and when the power arrives, it  becomes more easy with the \nthrottle. When I’m racing, the  slide can happen in  the  middle of the \ncorner when I’m  on  the  edge of the  tyre. If you open the  throttle when \nyou don’t have enough tyre on  the  ground you can start to  spin and \nfrom that point you  control the  slide with the throttle. It’s better to stay \nconstant with the throttle, don’t open, then shut when you get  the \nslide, then open again because the  bike becomes unstable. You need to \nfeel the  bike and stay with the  throttle.’ \nChoose your gear \nChoosing the  right gear for  the  corner is  crucial. Many riders tend to \nuse lower gears than they need, making the  bike unstable going into \nthe  corner and also coming out. \n‘If  I need to  decide between a  lower gear or  a  higher gear, I always \ngo  for  the  longer gear. It’s  better to  be  in a slightly taller gear than a \nslightly lower gear. The important thing with the choice of  gear is \nthat you need to  stay where the  engine has  the  best torque, not  before \nand not  after.’ \nBraking \nBraking \nis \na \nvery \ndifferent \ndeal \non \nthe \nracetrack \nand \non \nthe \nroad. \nWhereas \nracers \ncan \nuse \nthe \nfull \nperformance \nof \ntheir \nfront \ndisc \nbrakes \nthanks \nto \nslick \ntyres \nand \nultra-grippy \nracetracks, \nroad \nriders \nhave \nto \nbe \nmuch \nmore \ncircumspect \nwhen \nbraking. \nUltimately \nit \nall \ndepends \non \nthe \nroad surface. \n‘ \nalways \nbrake \nvery \nmuch \nwith \nthe  \nfront, \nroad \nor  \ntrack. \nI \nwould \nsay \nI \nuse \n80 \nper \ncent \nthe \nfront \nand \n20 \nper \ncent \nthe \nrear. \nReally, \nyou \nonly \nstop \nthe \nbike \nwith \nthe \nfront \nbrake, \ndoesn’t \nmatter \nif \nyou’re \non \nthe \ntrack \nor \nthe \nroad. \nYou \nuse \nthe \nrear \njust \na \nlittle, \nto \nkeep \nthe \nbike \nstable. \nThe \ndifference \nbetween \nthe \ntrack \nand \nthe \nroad \nis \nthis \n— \non \nthe \ntrack \nyou \ncan \nuse \nthe \nfront \nbrake \nall \nthe \nway \ninto \nthe \ncorner. \nBut \non \nthe \nstreet \nyou \nneed \nto \nrelease \nthe \nbrake \nbefore \nyou \nstart \nto \nflick \nthe \nbike \ninto \na  turn.’ \n\n286 THE FAST STUFF \nUsing the tyres \nYour tyres’ footprints vary according to  how much lean you're using. \nGenerally, the  further you're leaned over, the less rubber you'll have on \nthe  road, which is why racers work very hard to  lift  up  their bikes as \nquickly as  possible as  they come out  of a  turn. \n‘If you have very much horsepower, you need to put more tyre on  the \nground for when you open the  throttle. I didn’t really do this so  much \nin  125s but  I started using the  technique a lot  in  250s, and the  more \npower you have, the more important it becomes, so  I use  this very much \nin 500s and also in MotoGP. You need to put some weight on  the outside \nfootpeg, work the  handlebars and also use  your body weight to  lift  up \nthe bike.’ \nFeeling for grip \nRacers usually have a  predictable amount of grip to  deal with —  they \nknow how grippy the  tarmac should be.  But  it’s very different for street \nriders who are  constantly changing from one tarmac to  another. \n‘When I am  on  the  street, I also use the  rear brake very much to \nmake the  rear slide so  that I can understand the  level of grip. But be \ncareful where you do  this!’ \nUsing your body \nSome of Rossi's racing rivals reckon that he  makes the  difference on \nthe track by using his  body weight more cleverly than other riders. \nRossi understands that you can  increase traction at the  front or  back of \nthe bike by adding weight accordingly. Likewise, you can  reduce traction \nat  either end if  you need to.  Perhaps this isn’t so  vital for  street \nriding, but  shifting your weight also affects the  way your bike handles \nand steers. \n‘Moving on  the  bike is very, very important to  weight the  front and \nadd traction to  the  rear. When braking you move over the  front of the \nbike to  weight the front, but not too  much because then the rear \nend comes up.  In  the  middle of  the  corner you need to  keep some \nweight \nup \nfront, \nso \nyou \nstay \nover \nthe \nfront. \nThis \nhelps \ntraction \nand \nhelps \nthe \nbike \nto \nturn. \nComing \nout \nof \nthe \ncorner, \nwhen \nthe \ntyre \nstarts \nto \nslide \nunder \nacceleration, \nyou \nneed \nmore \ntraction \nat \nthe \nrear, \nso \nyou \nneed \nto \npush \nback \ninto \nthe \nback \nof \nthe \nseat \nand \nalso \npush \non \nthe \noutside footpeg.’ \n\nRIDE LIKE THE GODS 287 \nChanging direction \nBeing \nable \nto  \nchange \ndirection \nfast \nis  \nan  \nimportant \npart \nof \nmachine \ncontrol, \non \nroad \nor \ntrack. \nYou \nmay \nnot encounter \nmany \nchicanes \non \nthe \nstreet, \nbut you \nhave \nto \nwork \nyour \nway \nthrough \na \nlot \nof \nroundabouts, \nand \nthe faster \nyou \ncan \nswitch \nfrom \nleft \nto \nright \nor vice \nversa, \nthe \nmore \ntime \nand \neffort \nyou can \nput \ninto \ncornering. \n‘You use  everything you've got to change direction —  counter-steering \non  the  ‘bars, weighting the  footpegs and using your body weight. But \nit is important to  move your body before the  bike moves, don’t follow \nthe way the  bike moves, lead the way the bike moves. You’d don’t have \nto  move very fast either, just be smooth and ahead of the  bike.’ \nSome more riding secrets \nGarry McCoy: highside to get through chicanes quicker \n‘There’s some esses or  chicanes where I actually like to  get  the  thing to \nhighside me  halfway through, to help me  get steered into the next turn \nas  fast as  possible, because that’s the  kind of place you can  make up \nhalf a tenth or  two. If it’s  a left-then-right esses, I get the rear spinning \nup  out  of the  left, then shut the  throttle a  bit  sharpish, which makes \nthe  tyre grip suddenly and flicks me  over the  highside, laying the  bike \ninto the  right, fast as  you like.’ \nMick Doohan: the do-it-yourself slipper clutch \n‘I  always liked using the  rear brake, which came from dirt tracking, \njumping on  the  brake to  get  the  rear kicked out  into turns. Back then \nthe four-strokes didn’t have slipper clutches, so  I found the  engine- \nbraking a problem because I preferred to use  the  brake to slow the  bike. \nI'd  heard that Gregg Hansford (1970s Aussie GP  winner) used to \ndisengage the  clutch going into turns when he raced four-strokes and I \nthought it made sense. \n‘If \nyou \nsaw \nme  \ngoing \ninto \na  \nturn \non  \nthe  \nRVF \nyou'd \nhear \nthe  \nengine \nshut \ndown \nand \nthere’d \nbe  \nnot  \nmuch \nnoise \nat  \nall.  \nI’d  \nshut \nthe  \nthrottle \nand \nhave \nthe \nclutch \nin, \ninstead \nof \nhaving \nthe \nthing \nrpm-ing. \nInto \nthe \nturn \nthe \nclutch \nwouldn’t \nbe \nfully \nengaged \nnor \ncompletely \nout, \nthen \nonce \nthe \nbike \nwas \nsettled \nin \nthe \ncorner \nId \nstart \nto \nlet \nthe \nlever \nout, \njust \nsmooth \ntransition \nback \ninto \nengaged, \nthen \nget \non \nthe \nthrottle, \na \nsmooth, \nseamless \nprogression.’ \n\n288 THE FAST STUFF \nColin Edwards: how to save  a front-end slide \n‘Nowadays \nlosing \n‘Nowadays \nlosing \nthe  \nfront \nis \nnormal, \nI \nmay \nhave \na \nthe \nfront \nis normal, \nlittle \n“lose” \nevery \nlap and pick \nit \nup \non \nmy \nknee. \nI may \nhave \na \nlittle \nWhen \nyou're \npushing \njust \nover \nthe \nlimit \nyou’re \nready \n“lose” \nevery lap \nand \nfor it, \nso \nyou’ve \ngot \nyour knee \non \nthe ground \nto \npick \npick \nit \nup \non \nmy \nit back \nup \nwhen \nyou \nget \ninto a turn \na \nlittle \ntoo hot. \nknee’ It’s  like you've already seeing it  happen before it’s \nie happened, so  you're ready. \n‘It  means you can go  past the limit and not \ncrash, which is  cool! When you're on  a  bike that can do  that it’s \nbeautiful, and a  lot  less expensive! The M1l’s front end is  good, \nso  it’ll tuck but it  doesn’t extend [when the forks extend during \na  slide, taking too much weight off  the front tyre, the point of \nno  return has been reached]. You just put your knee on  the ground \nand save it,  the M1 is  probably the best bike I’ve ever ridden \nfor that.’ \nMick Doohan: do-it-yourself traction control \n‘Back when I was racing 500s we  didn’t have traction control. You had \nto  work out  your own way so  you didn’t get  chucked off,  so  my  right \nwrist was my  traction control, plus my  left  hand, too. On  the  way out \nof corners I’d  have a  finger on  the  clutch as  I got  on  the  throttle, so  if \nthe  rear started to  spin up,  I could pull some of the  power straight back \nout. The clutch is the  quickest way to pull power out  of the  bike, much \nquicker and safer than shutting the  throttle.’ \nKevin Schwantz: spinning to turn \n‘Back when I came into GPs the  thing that stood out  was steering with \nthe back tyre. Lots of times you’d do a corner good but it’d  start to push \nand run a  bit  wide, so  instead of  shutting off  or  staying on  neutral \nthrottle you’d pour the  coals on  it to  get  it to  steer with the  back and \nfinish the  corner. Any time the  bike’s not  steering the  way you want it \nto.and you  think you’re running out  of racetrack, you don’t worry about \nwhat more throttle will do,  you just stick it on  and make it  steer. It \ntakes a fair  bit of bravery to make yourself do that.’ \nKevin Schwantz: using the footpegs for grip \n‘Weighting the  outside footpeg was a little trick I learned when I was \n\nRIDE LIKE THE GODS 289 \ntrials \nriding \nwhen \nI \nwas \na \nkid. \nWhether \nI \nwas \non  \nan  \noff-camber \nhill  \nor \non  \na \ngreasy \npavement \nI'd  \nget  \nsome \nweight \non  \nthe  \noutside \n‘peg \nbecause \nit \nreally \nhelps \nthe  \ngrip. \nWhatever \nthe  \nscenario, \nif \nit’s  \nraining \nor  \nit’s  \nthe \nend \nof \nthe  \nrace, \nit’s  \nthe  \nthing \nto  \ndo \nwhen \nthe  \ngrip’s \nlesser. \nYou \ncan  \nuse \nthe \ninside \n‘peg \nfor \nthe \nopposite \nscenario, \nso \nif \nshe’s \npushing \nthe front \nyou \nget \nyour \nweight \noff \nthe \noutside \n‘peg \nand \nstomp \nit \non \nthe \ninside. \nThat \nshould \nmake \nthe \nrear \nslide \nand \ntake \nsome \nweight \noff \nthe \nfront \nto \nstop \nit \nfrom \npushing.’ \nGarry McCoy: using the footpegs for control \n‘If I’m  running wide and it’s  some place where I don’t want to use  the \nthrottle to get the bike steered, I'll weight the inside ‘peg to get the rear \nto  slide and tighten the line. Or  sometimes when the  bike gets so \nsideways, to where it’s  almost on  the  full-lock against the lock stops, I \nweight the inside ‘peg to  help it  spin a  little more, which stops it \ngripping and highsiding me. \n‘Any place I’m looking for  extra grip or  drive I weight the  outside \nfootpeg. Sometimes it’s  when I get  on  the  gas  mid-corner, when the \nbike starts to  wheelspin and I need a bit  of extra grip. Other times I'll \nweight the  ‘peg a little later in  the  corner when I’m  looking for  drive \ncoming onto a  long straight. Generally I  don’t get so  sideways \nthrough corners that lead on  to  long straights because I want to  get \nsome extra drive. ‘ \nKenny Roberts Junior: how to slipstream \n‘It’s a  good feeling because it’s  the easiest way to  pass someone. \nYou just line ‘em up  on  the straight and fire past. Once you're \nwithin three or  four bike lengths of  the  guy ahead, you get  into the \ndraft and you start closing in,  then you try  to  time your move when \nyou're about half a  bike’s length behind.

Everyone’s on  the  edge, with just an  element of control. \n\nCHAPTER 39 \nTHE FASTEST BROOD IN  THE \nWHOLE WILD WEST \nAugust 2004 \nIts midway through the 2004 MotoGP championship and there’s \nthree Roberts in the paddock —  King Kenny, his  elder son Kenny \nJunior and younger son Kurtis who’s riding for  dad’s MotoGP \nteam -  wouldn’t it be  comedy to  get  them together to  answer \nsome questions? \nKing Kenny Roberts &  Sons are MotoGP’s royal family. Gathering \ntogether the three of  them —  former 500 champs Kenny Senior and \nKenny Junior and former AMA Superbike winner turned Proton V5 \nrider Kurtis —  for  an  interview isn’t easy. And when we  do  get  them \ntogether, the  three of them are  chaos, a bit like  watching the  Simpsons \nin action. The comedy starts the  moment they gather in Homer’s front \nroom, sorry, the King’s luxury lounge on  the top deck of  the  Team \nRoberts paddock bus, the nerve centre of his  struggling Proton MotoGP \nsquad. There’s a non-stop torrent of wisecracks, cussing and dick jokes, \nmostly from the  King and Kurtis, while the more reticent Kenny Junior \nabsorbs himself surfing the  CNN website for  a  weather forecast. Then \nKurtis suffers a  minor panic attack when he realises someone’s cleared \naway the  plastic cup into which he gobs used chewing tobacco. \nThe quick-fire abuse that flows between them would embarrass the \nmore prudish onlooker but does suggest that they are  indeed a  happy \nfamily, confident enough in  each others’ love and respect to  know that \nthey can rip  the piss without anyone taking serious offence. Their \ncontrasting characters are  noticeable throughout, Kenny Junior always \nthe quietest, wearing an  amused, sometimes slightly embarrassed \ngrin at  his father’s and younger brother’s profane outbursts. And \nif Kurtis is the only one of the three who hasn’t won a world championship, \nhe  is definitely the  funniest, managing even to  out-wisecrack his  dad, a \nconsiderable achievement, and one  of which he should feel  very proud. \n\n292 THE FAST STUFF \nWho’s the most stubborn? \nSenior: I’m  easygoing \nJunior: Me  too. \nKurtis: I don’t know, I'll agree with the  other two. \nDo you  ever  think what would dad do tn this situation? \nKurtis: It  would depend on  the situation. If  it  was relationships \nprobably not, but  if it was riding a motorcycle, probably. \nJunior: It’s  such a loaded question. No. \nIsn't nepotism fantastic? \nJunior: What’s the  meaning of that? \nSenior: No,  it’s  not  at all fantastic, but  sometimes it’s  a necessary evil. \nKurtis: For  sure my  brother could’ve ridden for  other people when he \nrode for  dad and so  could I, and my  dad could’ve hired a  lot  of other \npeople, it’s  not  like it’s  all charity work here. \nHow competitive are you  as  a family? Have you  ever  come to blows over a board \ngame? \nKurtis: Yeah! \nJunior: Yup! \nSenior: I’ve had to  step into the  middle of it to  separate them, yes. \nJunior: We  were playing electric monopoly... \nSenior: And table tennis, and... \nJunior: I was selling Kurtis property. He  had the  game won but  I was \nmaking the  option go  up  on  Kurtis’ side by 10,000 bucks and he  was \nchoking the  heck out  of my  stepdad. \nKurtis: I was only ‘bout seven maybe... \nJunior: | mean like really choking, him until he couldn’t breathe. \nKurtis: Yeah, we've had some altercations. \nFathers always reckon they know best; is that true  in the Roberts’ household? \nSenior: Yes, absolutely. \nKurtis: Yeah. \nJunior: Sure. \nWould the family fortunes fare better moving into Superbikes? \nSenior: You what? \n\nTHE \nFASTEST \nBROOD \nIN  \nTHE \nWHOLE \nWILD \nWEST \n293 \nJunior: What are  Superbikes? \nWho’s run  up the biggest repair bill over  the years? \nKurtis puts his  hand up. \nSenior: I’ve wrecked a lot of shit  over the last  few years, but Kurtis has \nwrecked more sitting on  top of it. I’ve  scrapped a lot of stuff, just saying \n‘this is junk’, get rid  of it. \nWho's the safest rider on  the road? \nSenior: We  don’t ride much on  the  road. I probably am. \nKurtis: I’d  say Kenny Junior would be  the safest, especially when \nRochelle (his wife) is behind him. \nSenior: Little Kurtis can get  going a little bit  too  fast on  the  Harley \nsometimes. \nKurtis: I slide them around a little too  much. \nJunior: Yeah, I’ve never slidden a  Harley around a  roundabout \n(laughing)... But I hardly ride on  the  road now, the  more I do this  job \nthe  less time I have. \nWas it always inevitable that a  world champion racer would have kids who \nbecame racers? Didn't anyone ever  consider working in a bank? \nKurtis: I thought about robbing a bank! \nSenior: Yeah, robbing one. \nKurtis: No I  never thought about working in  a  bank but other \nstuff, of course. But I’ve been wanting to  race since I was real young, \nfour or  five, I  would always be  watching reruns of  dad forever, \nevery day. \nJunior: I had a  lot  of opportunity to  do all  types of things, all kinds of \nsports but never really got committed. Like in  high school I  never \nwanted to  get  hurt in  football because it never felt  like the  right thing \nto \ndo. \nBut \nafter \nI \nsaw \nJohn \nKocinski \nwin \na \nrace \nin \nSears \nPoint, \nthat’s \nwhen I decided I wanted to  race bikes. \nHow \nmuch \npressure \nis \nthere \nto \nlive \nup \nto \nthe \nRoberts \nname? \nAnd \nwho \nfeels \nit \nmost \n—  the kids or  the old man? \nKurtis: \nI’d \nsay \nus \nkids \nfeel \nit \nthe \nmost \nbecause \ndad \nstarted \nthe \nRoberts \nthing, \nso  \nthere’s \nnot \na \nlot  \nof \npressure \non  \nhim. \nSenior: \nThey \nhave \npressure. \n\n294 THE FAST STUFF \nKurtis: There’s quite a  bit  but  I’d  say  I put  more pressure on  myself \nthan anyone could put  on  me. \nJunior: Yeah, that’s the  thing, it’s  the  competitiveness inside yourself \nthat drives with you. \nSenior: I’m  always looking at  a glass that’s half full. Even as  much as  I \ncomplain about things at  the moment, I still wake up the  next morning \nthinking: ‘Okay, I’ve  got this shit, I’ve  got to fix it’. I’m  not  one to look at \nit and say I’m  done. That’s why I’m  still here. I’ve  been here a long time \nand I think you have to  have something built into you because you get \nkicked around a lot and especially if you have a name people automatically \nthink you should be  up  there racing Honda and we’re not. We  weren’t \ndoing that when we  had Junior in my  team and we  aren’t doing it with \nKurtis. We’re trying to cut  a whole new thing, and that needs money and \ntime and either you don’t have enough time or  you don’t have enough \nmoney. But  you know, we’re still here, trying to make it right. \nHow long before we  see  a  Roberts in  the  top five again? And that includes the \nmanufacturers’ championship. \nSenior: Right now the championship has never been so  clear cut \nequipment-wise. With the two-strokes, even with our little three- \ncylinder, at  times we  were very, very close to  the  podium, but  with the \nfour-strokes the equipment makes all  the difference. This is  a  new \nadventure for us.  We’re less than a year and a half into it, so  it’s  all new, \nwe're still  finding out  stuff we  should have known a year ago but we’re \nnot  Honda. There’s a lot of companies, even the  one Kenny’s riding for, \nthat should be a lot better than they are. It’s  going to  take another two \nor  three seasons before everyone gets to  grips with having everything \nthey need to  make them competitive. This year it happens to  be  tyres \nthat are  keeping us  back. [Team Roberts ran  Dunlops in 2004. ] \nJunior: Suzuki are starting to  narrow down some things that are \ncrucial \nto \nmake \nthe \nbike \ngo \naround \nthe \ntrack. \nWe’re \nalready \ngoing \nround \nthe \ncorners \nas \nfast \nas \nif \nnot \nfaster \nthan \nanyone \nelse, \nso \nif \nwe \ncan \nimprove \n10kmh \non \nthe \nstraight \nplus \nget \nthe \ntraction \ncontrol \nfixed... \nIt’s \nup \nto \nthe \ndevelopment \npeople, \nthe \nquicker \nthey \ncan \ndo \nit, \nthe \nquicker \nwe’ll \nbe \nup  there. \nKurtis: \nI \nwouldn’t \ndoubt \nmyself \nto  \nbe \nin \nthe  \ntop  \nfive \nif \nI \nhad \na \nHonda, \nmaybe \nthis \nyear, \nmaybe \nnot, \nbut  \nmore \nlike \nnext \nyear. \nI \nthink \nif \nKenny \nhad \na \nHonda \nhe’d \nbe \nwinning \nthe \nchampionship \nright \nnow. \n\nTHE \nFASTEST \nBROOD \nIN  \nTHE \nWHOLE \nWILD \nWEST \nDoS \nWho's \nhad \nthe \nmost \nsuccess \nwith \nthe \nladies \n—  \nin \ntheir \nsingle \ndays, \nof \ncourse? \nKurtis: \nSuccess? \nIs that \ngetting \nrid \nof them \nall? \nSenior: You can’t even count me  in this because I’m  so  much older. \nKurtis: Or is that having one girl for a long period of time? \nSenior: Both my marriages —  Patsy and Pamela —  were the  same, seven \nyears, So  Kenny would probably be the  guy. \nJunior: I guess I’ve been with Ro  [his childhood sweetheart and now \nhis  wife] nearly ten  years. \nKurtis: He’s not  a whore! \nSenior: Well, one  out  of three ain’t bad. \nWho gets most nervous before the start of a race? \nSenior: These days, probably me. As  a  rider I could sit  and have a \nhotdog, wait for the race, throw the hotdog away, push off... But  when \nyou're in charge there’s a lot more to  think about. | \nKurtis: How can you actually judge who gets the most nervous? \nSometimes I’m  very calm, when I have no  problems. \nSenior: It  depends how practice has gone, if the  thing runs and you \nfeel good on  it, those things make a difference... \nIs the endless chasing of lost causes a family trait? How do you  keep going? Are \nyou  mentally stronger than the average family? \n(Incredulous laughter from all, especially Kurtis) \nKurtis: I think you might have to  be  mentally strong to  be  in  our \nfamily. \nSenior: We  never met an  average family, we  don’t know any average \nfamilies. \nKurtis: Everyone’s idea of average is their own, I guess. \nJunior: What was the question again? Okay, if you’re saying that what \nI'm  doing is a  struggle, I’d  take it over most any other jobs, like  getting \nshot \nat \nin \nAfghanistan \nor \nIraq. \nI \nmean \nthere’s \na \nlot \nworse \nthings \nto \ndo \nin life. \nWhat \ndoes \nKenny \nSenior \nthink \nis  \nwrong \nwith \nthe  \nbig \nfactories? \nDo  \nthe  \nboys \nagree? \nKurtis: Their bikes are  too  fast. \nSenior: \nThere’s \nnothing \nwrong \nwith \nthe  \nbig  \nfactories, \nif \nyou're \na  \nbig \nfactory. \nI \njust \ndon’t \nbelieve \nin \nworking \nfor \nnothing \nfor \na \nbig \nfactory. \n\n296 THE FAST STUFF \n(Kenny senior walked out of  a  hugely successful, sometimes stormy \n25-year relationship with Yamaha at  the  end of 1996.) \nos \nsee \n‘Somebody needs to \nget everybody on  the \nsame tyres and start \nputting weight on \nthe bikes that are \nfaster. The racing \nwould be a  lot better’ \nKurtis: I was with Honda for a while and I had quite \na lot of friends there but sometimes it was a little too, \ner,  corporate for a rider. \nJunior: I'd  say  somebody needs to  step in and get \neverybody on  the same tyres and start putting weight \non  the bikes that are  faster. The racing would be a lot \nbetter. Take Sete [Gibernau] for  example, he was on \nthe Suzuki and he  was having poor results in  the \ngrand scheme of  things, then you throw him on  a \nHonda and he’s got a shot at this year’s championship. \nThink how much better the  sport would be if things \nwere more equal. I mean if he wasn’t Spanish, so  he  didn’t have that \nopportunity to  take the  Telefonica money with him, he’d still be with \nSuzuki riding around back down the  pack. J would like to  see  some \nkind of government in this sport. \nSenior: Instead of the  factories being the  government. Basically, he’s \nsaying he thinks Nascar is better than F1. \nIs Mick Doohan right that Kevin Schwantz could put the GSV-R on  the podium? \nOr is it right to decide not  to bust your arse for 13th place? \nKurtis: Mick’s probably not  right about a lot of stuff he’s said since he \nquit racing. \nJunior: I don’t know. It’s  an  impossible question to  answer. \nSenior: I never busted my  ass  for  13th place. You do what you can do \non  the bike on  the  day, then you go home and the next time you try and \ndo  it better. It’s  all  a  calculated risk, sometimes you've got  to  take a \ncalculated risk on  the last lap whether you’re seventh or  first \nbut  it’s  always a  whole lot  better when you're first. There’s obviously \nlittle things in  your brain that work different if  you’re racing for \nfirst place. \nWhat's more important for a rider: luck, talent or a factory Honda? \nKurtis: a factory Honda right now. \nSenior: All  three. \nJunior: All  three \nKurtis: All  three. \n\n\n\n298 THE FAST STUFF \n@Course motorcycle racer focused on  cornering speed \n@Air brake plates behind , ae \nright & left  wheel cowl. ~~ \nt J Naeem mlm alilemeemaeliene) melicaniiile) \nwhen accelerating and decelerating nose. ft \n@wWith controller independent \nfrom vehicle body, \nimprove load shift range \nof rideras sidecar race. \n@Start ainbra \nsecure tir \nOntbofiet & tiunido Sieting ig \nmoxorcycle drive — \nOthruternight & \npectored Nozze \nOWhen comering \nOUD Tan  MaICace CO CONN CTS lin   takeastopnightesatontt - \nABOVE AND BELOW: This is what Honda and Kawasaki would build if MotoGP was \na rule-free zone.

There’s things that break that aren’t \ntheir fault. \nSenior: No,  he’s not  bad to  the  guys. \nJunior: I’m  never rude intentionally. \nHow smart ts it to  try to apply car  thinking to bike racing? [King Kenny was \nalways big on  this, bringing F1 gurus like John Barnard into  his operation, but \nwithout any success. ] \nSenior: I think it’s  another avenue. If you think about bike racing \nthere’s not a  whole lot  of  avenues you can go  down, so  sometimes \nyou've got  to  pick on  the  car  people. It is all engineering. It may take a \nwhile to learn motorcycling engineering and to improve, but basically I \ndon’t see-any difference. \nWhat's Mrs  Roberts like? How does she cope with you  lot? \nKurtis: She’s nuts, no,  I’m joking, she’s nervous, with us  racing, of course. \nBut  she’s got to deal with what we're going to do because she doesn’t want \nto stand in our  way. It’s  our  life, we’ve got to live it, whatever happens. \nJunior: From the  safety side, sure, she has  to cope with stuff, but other \nthan that the  things she  copes with are  fairly standard I guess. \nSenior: I’m  saying fucking nothing. \nWho drinks the most when you go to a wedding? \nSenior: I get  totalled out  the  easiest. \nKurtis: He  gets the  loudest, does that count?

The man who won the  last  of his  three 500  crowns a \nquarter of a century ago  and scored his  last world title as  a team owner \nmore than a decade back still lives a high-stress lifestyle at  the  head of \nhis  struggling, Banbury-based Proton KR  outfit, which designs its own \nMotoGP bikes from the  ground up  in a hopelessly Quixotic attempt to \ncompete with Honda in the world’s fastest, richest bike racing series. \nBut then the  King always was a bit  crazy. He  is one of those weird \ndudes who get their kicks from attempting the  impossible, a have-a-go \nhero who’s not  afraid of anyone or  anything. That’s the way he was in \n1978 —  when he  won the 500 title at  his  first attempt against all \npredictions —  and that’s the  way he  is now. Maybe that’s not  quite it \nthough. The fact is that King Kenny is hopelessly addicted to  the  ritual \nof competition, even if nowadays that means weekly humiliation at the \nhands of  Honda, Yamaha and Co,  rather than more gongs and glory. \nAnd there’s something else too... \n‘Why am I still  here?’ he  ponders from behind mirror shades. ‘Well, \nobviously it’s a love of bikes —-  motorcycles have been a part of my life for a \nlong, long time.’ Now into his  50s, Roberts is still  a real  biker. When he’s \nnot  hooning on  his Harley, he’s thrashing around the dirt aboard a Bee  Em \nGS  or  motocrosser. And not  for  pure pleasure. ‘I still  can’t ride and just \nhave fun,’ he  says. ‘I’ve got  to  ride it to where it’s  skidding the  front and \nthe  rear. I’m  not  at  the  point where I can  ride around slowly. That’s why \nwhen I first came to  Europe I knew I would die  if I did  the  Isle  of Man. \nAnd it’s  still my problem. Someone watched me  ride  a motocross bike the \nother day and said “what the  fuck, you're going to  kill  yourself, crank it \ndown”, but  that’s the way I ride, I can’t crank it down.’ \n\nTHE \nFASTEST \nBROOD \nIN  \nTHE \nWHOLE \nWILD \nWEST \n307 \nIn  \nother \nwords, \nhe’s \na  \nsucker \nfor  \npunishment, \na  \nstress \njunkie, \nas \nunable \nto \nkick \nback \nand \nchill \nout \nas \nyou \nor \nI \nwould \nbe \nable \nto \nwin \na \nMotoGP \nrace. \nAnd \nRoberts’ \nlove \nof \nspeed \nand \ncompetition \nmeans \nthat \nhe \nsees \nbeyond \nthe \nmiserable \nresults \nrecorded \nby his \nMotoGP \nteam. \nDuring \nthe \nfirst \neight \nraces \nof \n2004 \nson \nKurtis \nand \nNobuatsu \nAoki \nscored \njust \nseven \npoints \nbetween \nthem, \nwhile \nValentino \nRossi \nscored \n139 \npoints. \nBut \nRoberts \ndoesn’t \nsee \nit \nin \nthose \nharsh \nterms \nbecause \nhe \nis \nstill \nfascinated \nby the \ntechnical \nchallenges. \n‘I’m still interested in the engineering,’ he continues. ‘This year we’ve \nbeen way under where I estimated we'd be in terms of performance but \nit’s  a  lesson, not the  end of  the  world. When I started this project I \ndidn’t draw a line and say  “okay, in two years we're going to be world \nchampions”. I had two choices when I stopped racing with Yamaha in \n‘96  —  quit racing completely or  build my  own motorcycle. I decided I \nwasn’t done yet, and it wasn’t a question of building my own motorcycle \nbecause I knew I could beat everybody, it was just that I couldn’t deal \nany longer with the  system that Yamaha had at  the  time.’ \nDuring 2003 and 2004 Roberts attracted some derision from within \nthe bike world for hiring a bunch of F1  car engineers who were supposed \nto  make the  team’s own V5-powered four-stroke racer competitive. In. \nfact Team Roberts is less competitive now than at  any stage since the \nKing built his  first bike, the  two-stroke Proton KR500 (née Modenas) \nin.  1997. \n‘Okay, so  I went the  F1  route. Now I’m looking at  evaluating what \nthat has done for me  and then I’m  going to  make another adjustment \nto  try and take it up  another level. When you're a  racer and you're not \nfast enough for a couple of years, you go and do something else, but  it’s \nnot \nthe \nsame \nin \nteam \nownership, \nI \nstill \nhave \n60 \npeople \nto \nemploy.’ \nAnd \nthat’s \nanother \nthing \nthat \nkeeps \nRoberts \nin \nMotoGP. \n‘I’ve \nbeen \nloyal \nto \na \nlot \nof \npeople \nin \nmy \ncareer \nand \nit’s \njust \none \nof \nthe \nthings \nabout \nme. \nThe \nfriendship, \nthe \ncamaraderie \nin \nracing, \nall \nthat \nstuff \nhas \na \nweight \nof \nsome sort.’ \nDespite \nhis \nresolutely \ngung-ho \napproach \nto \nracing \nand \nhis \nirrepressible \ndesire \nto \nhave \na \ncrack \nat \nthe \nimpossible, \nRoberts \nadmits \nthat \nthere \nis \none \nthing \nthat \nwill \nhave \nhim \nheading \nhome \nto \nMontana \nfor \na \nwell- \ndeserved \nretirement \n— \nlack \nof \nan \nadequate \nbudget. \nHis \nProton-backed \nsquad \nis \nalready \none \nof \nthe \npoorest \nin \nMotoGP \nand \nthe \nrecent \nfalls \nin \nthe \nvalue \nof \nthe \nUS \ndollar \nhave \nhit \nhard. \n‘The \ndollar \nhas \ndropped \n30 \nper \n\n308 THE FAST STUFF \ncent \n—  \nthat’s \ntwo \nmillion \ndollars \noff \nan  \nalready \nnot  \nso \nhealthy \nbudget,’ \nhe \nexplains. \n‘That \ncan  \nwear \nyou \ndown \n—  \nyou \nsee  \nshit \nthat \nneeds \nfixing \nand \nyou \ndon’t \nhave \nthe \nmoney \nto \nfix \nit, \nthat’s \nthe \nkind \nof \nthing \nthat \nwill \nsend \nme \nhome.’ \nThankfully \nthere \nare  \na  \ncouple \nof \nopportunities \non  \nthe  \nhorizon \nthat \nmight \nkeep \nthe \nKing \nin \nracing. \nFirst, \nRoberts \nhas \ntalked \nwith \nKTM \nabout \ntaking \nover \nits \nstillborn \nV4 \nMotoGP \nproject. \nAnd, \neven \nmore \nalluring, \nProton’s \nMalaysian \nparent \ncompany \n(which \nalready \nowns \nthe \nLotus \ncar \nbrand) \nhas \njust \nbought \nlegendary \nItalian \nmarque \nMV \nAgusta. \nNow \nthat \nwould \nbe \ncool \n— the \nKing \nat the \nhead \nof \na \nteam \nthat \nused \nto \nbe \nowned \nby \nan \nItalian \ncount. \nKind \nof \nmakes \nsense... \nEpilogue: King Kenny’s outfit struggled on  until the end of  2007, \nwhen it faded out  of MotoGP due to  lack of funds. \nMotoGP Mutterings: August 2004 \nForgive me, for I am  traumatised \nThe word on  the street is  that my favourite MotoGP event may be \nscratched from the  calendar. That’s right, the  Rio  GP  may be no  longer. \nBrazil’s world championship race is likely to be replaced in the  calendar \nby bigger, richer, ‘more important’ nations like China and the  USA. It \nalmost makes me  weep, thinking of  swapping Rio’s screaming chaos \nfor  the  anodyne charms of a  US  GP. \nI  love Rio because it’s  a  mess. It’s a  world away from the icy \nprofessionalism of the  European circuits, where you can  set  your watch \nto  the last  plug chop of 125  qualifying. You would never dare do that at \nRio. A few years back, moments after first qualifying had got underway, \nthe entire circuit was blacked out  by a power cut, forcing the organisers \nto  red  flag the  session. But this wasn’t some massive electricity blow- \nup,  it was the  local lekkie company cutting the  circuit’s power supply \nbecause they hadn’t been paid for  ages. Being Brazilian, they knew \nhow to  get  their cash —  they waited until the track’s only world \nchampionship event of  the  year had started, then pulled the  power. \nNeedless to  say,  they got  the  money. \nIn  2004 there was  a  power cut. In  fact there was a  bloody great \nexplosion when the media centre power supply went bang. We were all \n\nOe \nFORGIVE ME, FOR I AM  TRAUMATISED 309 \nevacuated \nthrough \nchoking \nsmoke, \nwaiting \noutside \nwhile \na \nfleet \nof \nfire \nengines \nrolled \nup, \njust \nin \ncase \nthe \nbuilding \nwent \nup \nin \nflames. \nIt \ndidn’t, \nso \nwe \nwere \nallowed \nback \ninside \nto \ncontinue \nfabricating \nour \nlies \nand \ndeceits. \nTo \nmake \nsure \nthere \nwas \nno \nrepeat \nof \nthe \nmeltdown, \nthe \norganisers \nplaced \nan \nelderly \nlocal \nelectrician \nat the \nback \nof \nthe \npress \nroom \nwhere \nhe \nhovered \nover \nthe \nfuse \nbox \nfor \nthe \nremainder \nof \nthe \nweekend. \nEvery \ntime \nthe system \nglowed \nred \nhe’d \ntrip \na \nfew \nfuses, \nextinguishing \nhalf \nthe \ntelevision \nmonitors \nuntil \nthings \nhad \ncooled \ndown \na \nbit. \nOf  course, most paddock people abhor Rio  for  the same reasons I \nlove it.  Where I see  its  down-at-heel allure and smell its  wanton party \natmosphere, all  they see  is  dirt and muggings and all  they smell is, \nwell, the  smell. And, jeez, does the  joint stink. But Rio’s fetid stench \nisn’t enough to  stop some paddock people from sneaking out  of their \nhotels under cover of darkness to indulge themselves in the local ladies \nof the  night. For  every dark tale of another MotoGP mugging (they’re \nsurely asking for  it by promenading down Copacabana in team shirts) \nthere’s another story of  shocking night-time debauchery. Like the \nfactory MotoGP rider who had to wake his  favourite mechanic from his \nslumber to  ask for  assistance in,  erm, entertaining two hookers in his \nhotel room. (Obviously, I’m  not  advocating this kind of behaviour, but \nI do believe that racers are  meant to  live  fast —  it’s  their job.) \nPlease don’t be appalled, for MotoGP is, after all, little more than an \nofficially sanctioned home for testosterone-charged problem youngsters, \nneatly packaged to  flog consumables via  television. You see, that’s why \nI love Rio because it perverts the all-pervading corporate professionalism \nthat will, eventually, turn MotoGP into another Formula One: all multi- \nmillion-dollar deals, private jets, big-business wank and absolute zero \ntolerance for  anyone even thinking about having some fun. \nNot so  long ago every GP  used to be like  Rio —  racers, groupies, parties \n— \ntotal \nchaos \non \na \nSunday \nevening, \nriders \nliving \non \nthe \nedge \nby \nday, \ntipping \nover \nthe \nedge \nby \nnight. \nNowadays \nMotoGP \nis \ntoo \nprofessional \nfor \nall \nthat, \nat \nleast \nuntil \nthe \n747 \nscreeches \nto \na \nhalt \nat \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \nRio \nrunway \nand \neveryone \ndeplanes, \nsniffs \nthat \nfetid \nair \nand \nrealises \nthat \nthey \nare, \nafter \nall, \nvery \nmuch \nalive, \nso \nit’s \ntime \nto \nwork \na \nlittle \nless, \nplay \na \nlittle \nmore. \nAs \nBritish \nauthor \nJohn \nFowles \nonce \nwrote \n(during \na \nfrenzied \nattack \non \nHollywood): \n‘The \nabsence \nof \nleisurely \namateurism, \nfrom \nwhich \nall \ngreat \nart \nfinally \nsprings, \nis \nthe \nmost \nfrightening \nthing \n\n310 THE FAST STUFF \nhere’. That’s what frightens me  about MotoGP —  too  many paddock \npeople renouncing everything leftfield and anti-establishment that \nbikes are  about (or  is  that just me  fooling myself?) and prostrating \nthemselves inside MotoGP’s cosy bubble of corporate overkill. What’s \nneeded is less professionalism, not more. \nThe other reason I love Rio is that it gets back to racing’s fundamentals \n—a  bunch of riders and mechanics, some bikes, a  racetrack and a big \npot of pasta in a Portakabin —  there’s none of the  suffocating corporate \nhospitality that has swamped the European paddocks, leaving little \nspace for what really matters. \nBut amidst MotoGP’s shameless headlong rush into full-on corporate \ncocksucking there are  a  few paddock people striving to  keep it  real, \napart from the aforementioned anonymous star. Stand up  Kurtis \nRoberts, younger son  of The  King, currently enduring a miserable debut \nGP  season on  dad’s Proton KR5. I’m glad to  say  that Kurtis is brash, \nbonkers and very badly behaved, in other words a  carbon copy of his \nfather as  a young man. Before telling this next tale, I should explain \nthat Max Biaggi owns a  Smart car  which his  motorhome driver uses to \ntravel from the  paddock to  his  hotel each night. Fair enough, but the \nself-styled Roman Emperor’s Noddy car  is  sprayed up  in  Camel blue \nand yellow and emblazoned in  huge Max logos. In  other words it’s \nasking to be done over. And, please forgive me  Lord, I’ve  been tempted \nmyself, but  Kurtis beat me  to it at Mugello, turning the  thing on  its roof \nand spinning it round and round. Then when a bike cop  rolled up  to \ninvestigate, he jumped aboard the  cop  bike and rode a couple of laps of \nthe  paddock, blue lights flashing, siren wailing. Proper behaviour for a \n25-year-old bike racer. \nSo please join me  in proposing a toast to  Kurtis Roberts Esquire and \nsaying a  fervent prayer to  the Big G  that Rio may be  spared from \nMotoGP’s death row. It’s  because it’s  worth it... \nEpilogue: obviously Dorna didn’t hear my  prayers —  they did  indeed \naxe  Rio. \n\nCHAPTER 40 \nWHEN MEN WERE MEN AND  THE \nMAFIA FIXED RACES \nSeptember 2004 \nFrom Triumph dirt trackers to  Kawasaki KR750s, hell-raising \nAmerican Gary Nixon raced across continents, decades and \nracing eras. And he  would’ve won a  world title if the mafia \nhadn’t stitched him up \nGary Nixon’s career straddled two great eras of  motorcycle racing — \nfrom the  good old  days of rattling, belching Harleys and Triumphs to \nthe bad old days of  Japan’s malevolent, stinking 750 two-strokes. \n‘Nickers’, as  his  mate Barry Sheene used to  call  him, achieved success \non  them all  in  a  career that spanned three decades. He  was a  tough \nracer, who experienced more than his  fair share of hard knocks, and a \nhard partier, renowned for  his  nightlife exploits with Sheeney &  Co. \nAmazingly, he was still  racing at the  time of this interview, well into his \n60s  and competing in veteran races here and there. \nNixon won his  greatest successes in  the  late 1960s when he  rode \nfactory-supported Triumphs to  back-to-back titles in  America’s multi- \ndiscipline Grand National championship. And he  would’ve won the \n1976 F750 world title on  Erv  Kanemoto-tuned Kawasaki triples if the \nmafia hadn’t stitched him up... \nA  funny, rambling raconteur, Nixon has fond memories of  both \nperiods of his  career, though his  memories of racing those seize-prone \n750 Kawasaki and Suzuki two-strokes are  tinged with terror. He would \nalmost certainly have become a  500 GP  star in  the mid-1970s if he \nhadn’t got badly smashed up while testing Suzuki's brand-new RG500 \nsquare four in Japan. \n‘I rode a lot of great bikes,’ he says. ‘The Triumph 500s were great, the \nTriumph \nCub \nwas \ngreat, \nthe \nbike \nthey \nbuilt \nme \nwhen \nDoug \nHele \ncame \nover \nin \n67 \nwas \ngreat \nand \nso \nwere \nthe \ntriples \nthey \nbrought \nover \nin \n’70 \nand \n‘71. \nAll \nthe \nbikes \nthat \nErv \nbuilt \nme \nwere \nspecial \ntoo, \nbut \nthe \nKawasaki \n\n312 THE FAST STUFF \nthey gave me  in ’72  was junk. The mechanic was a nice guy but  he had \narthritis and couldn’t tighten the nuts and bolts. Shit, the exhaust fell off \na couple of times, the gear shift lever too, the handlebar \ncame loose, the engine sprocket... Fuck, you were shell \n‘The mechanic was a shocked riding around on  that thing!’ \nnice guy but he had Born in Oklahoma in 1941, just months before Pearl \narthritis and Harbor brought the  United States into World War II, \ncouldn't tighten the Nixon first got into bikes a full half-century ago, while \nnuts and bolts’ barely a  teenager. ‘I wanted to  be  a  sports star, but  I \nwasn’t big enough for football, wasn’t tall enough for \nbasketball and I’d  got hit  in the  head with a baseball \nbat, so  I figured I better find something else,’ he says, recalling the events \nthat led to his first bike ride in the summer of 1954. ‘My sister’s boyfriend \nhad motorcycles, I used to  steal them and ride around the  block when \nthey went to  the  movies, then I conned my  dad  into getting me  one.’ \nNixon’s first bike was a Harley 125, and pretty soon he was taking it \nto  the  local drag strip. Weighing less than eight and a half stone at  the \ntime, he won his  first drag race title at the  age  of 15,  started scrambling \non  a  Triumph Thunderbird the following year and commenced his \nprofessional career in  1958, aged just 17. \nHis  early years on  the  pro-dirt track circuit were anything but high \nrolling. Nixon lived a  Kerouac-style life  on  the  road, barnstorming his \nway from one town to  the  next, relying on  the  charity of rivals to  get \nthrough. ‘I used to go to races and  borrow two dollars to  sign on,  when \nyou  have to  do that you're fuckin’ broke,’ says the  man from Maryland \nwho hooked up  with AMA legend Dick Mann and fellow racer Neil \nKeen for much of his  travels. ‘If my engine blew, Dick would lend me  a \nspare and I’d  give him half my  prize money. If it hadn’t been for  him \nand a few other guys, I wouldn’t have made it through the early sixties. \nThat’s all  I was doing —  racing to  put  food in my  tummy.’ \nThe AMA circuit was indeed punishing in those days: ‘One August I \nrode 31  events.’ Nixon would clock up  50,000 street miles in  a  season \n—Yacing, driving, racing, driving, racing —  Sante Fe  one night, Granite \nCity, Illinois the  next, someplace else the  next —  sleeping in his  trailer, \nin the workshops of friendly bike dealers or,  on  a good night, in a cheap \nmotel. The money was anything but great, Nixon would have to  wait \nfor the  1970s for TV  coverage and serious sponsorship to kick in before \nhe could enjoy some real octane-fuelled glamour. \n\nWHEN \nMEN \nWERE \nMEN \nAND \nTHE \nMAFIA \nFIXED \nRACES \n313 \n‘I \nmade \n600 \nbucks \nmy \nfirst \nGrand \nNational \nyear. \nWhen \nI \nwon \nmy \nfirst \nAMA \ntitle \nin \n’67  \nI \nmade \n38,000 \nbucks, \nas  \ngood \nas  \nan  \naverage \nbaseball \nplayer, \nyou \ncould \nbuy \na  \nhouse \nfor  \n30  \ngrand \nin  \nthose \ndays. \nI \nbought \na \nbrand-new \nShelby \n500GT \nMustang \nthat \ncost \nsix \nthousand; \nGod, \nthat \nmotherfucker \nwould \nbe \nworth \n200 \ngrand \nnow. \nBut \nmy \nbest \nwas \n’76, \nI \ndid \n70 grand \nthat \nyear.’ \nOf \ncourse, \nthose \nearnings \nare \nchickenfeed \ncompared \nto \na \nmodern-day \nracer’s \nincome. \n‘Shit, \nRossi \nmakes \n15 \nmillion \nbucks \nnow. \nBut \nmaybe \nthey \ndon’t \nhave \nsuch \na great \ntime \nas we \ndid, \nthey’re \ngoing \ntoo \nfuckin’ \nfast \nto party. \nWe \ndidn’t \nused \nto do \nall \nthat \ntraining \nshit. \nWe \nwere \ndrivin’ \nall the \ntime.’ \nBack in the days when Americans only raced two  kinds of motorcycle \n—  Harleys or  Limeys —  Nixon started out  on  Harleys but made his name \non  Triumphs. As is usually the case in racing, he didn’t make the switch \nfor  any other reason than pragmatism —  Harley were talking about \noffering him parts, Triumph a whole lot more. At first he raced for West \nCoast Triumph dealers, but  in  the  winter of ’62  he  headed east to  be \ncloser to the Triumph importers, TriCor. It wasn’t good timing: ‘I loaded \nall my  shit up  and moved up  there just as  the  Cuban missile crisis was \nhappening. There I was driving towards Washington DC, right where \nthey would’ve bombed if it’d  happened.’ \nOnce the threat of  imminent nuclear conflagration had subsided, \nNixon focused his mind on  getting his career together as a fully fledged \nfactory Triumph rider. In  ’63  he  won his  first national, lapping the \nentire field, including second-placed Dick Mann. Third overall in  the \n‘65  AMA series and second in ’66, Nickers finally got  his  hands on  the \nnumber one plate in  ’67, retaining it the  following year. In  67  he  also \nwon the Daytona 200. (Closest rival and team-mate Dick Hammer \nmight have beaten Nixon in  the  Florida classic but  was slowed after a \nmid-race pit  stop, when a  wiping rag got sucked into one of  his \nT100’s Amals!) \nNixon’s success on  his  sweet-handling T100 infuriated Harley bosses, \nespecially race director Dick O’Brien who raged: ‘We have the best \nmachines, spend the  most money... and that little red  head comes out \nand blows off all of us,  with 15  less horsepower.’ Nixon’s success on  his \nLimey \ntwin \ndidn’t \nmeet \nwith \nthe \napproval \nof \nfiercely \npatriotic \nUS \nfans \neither, \nnot \nthat \nit \nbothered \nhim: \n‘They’d \nall \nboo \nand \neverything, \nbut \nat \nleast they were thinking about me.’ \nOf \ncourse, \nthese \nyears \nwere \nthe  \nbeginning \nof \nthe \nend \nfor \nfour-strokes. \n\n314 THE FAST STUFF \nEver the  pragmatist, Nixon started racing a Yamaha TDIC 250 in  ’64, \nbecause it allowed him to  contest 250 races as  well as  big bike events \nand because ‘Yamaha gave me  1000 bucks a race when Triumph were \ngiving me  300’. At  the  time it must have seemed like danger money — \nthe TDIC seized not  infrequently, throwing Nixon to the ground on  one \noccasion and breaking the  thumb on  his  throttle hand. ‘One day we \ngot through seven crankshafts.’ Only Nixon’s remarkable ability \nto  withstand pain allowed him to  keep racing towards his first \nAMA title. \nIn  ‘69  Nixon suffered the  first of several seriously injurious crashes, \nbut  this time a  rinky-dinky two-stroke wasn’t to  blame. He  was riding \na Triumph dirt  tracker at one  of the  many West Coast horse tracks that \nwere ‘converted’ for  bikes. ‘This thing didn’t have any midrange, so  I \npunched it  down a  gear and ran it  wide open, missed a  gear and \nhit  a  four-by-four post. They didn’t have any hay bales. I remember \nmy femur bone sticking out of my leather pants, blood \nsquirting everywhere.’ \nNixon never won another national dirt track race, that injury forcing \nhim to concentrate on  roadracing because his left leg, now held together \nby  an  18-inch steel nail, didn’t like going round in  anti-clockwise \ncircles. His  full-time move to  the  hard stuff was completed when he \nsigned to  Kawasaki. \nKawasaki's early H2  750s were evil  pieces of equipment. Their fragile \nair-cooled motors required riders to  focus much of their attention on \nengine noise, nervously listening for warnings of an  imminent seizure \namongst the  cacophony of open spannies. And when the  motors were \nrunning, they screeched out  more power than their flexi frames and \niffy tyres could handle. \n‘Hell, they were scary,’ Nixon admits. ‘But it was just something you \nhad to  do.  You're a  racer, you're out  there trying to  go  faster, and the \nTriumphs were running 150mph when the  two-strokes were running \n180. That’s a big difference. But  that Kawasaki would wobble so  bad at \nDaytona that Yvon [DuHamel] told me: ‘Well, just cut  an  inch or  two \noff  the  bars’. The thing still wobbled but  your hands didn’t go  so  far \nback and forth.’ \nNixon’s career on  these Grim Reaper two-strokes was saved by Erv \nKanemoto. \n‘Everybody \nwas \nsaying \n“that \nol” \nNixon \nis \na \nhas-been’, \nthen \nI \nsigned \nwith \nErv \nand \nI \nwas \nAMA \nroadrace \nchamp \nthe \nnext \nyear. \nBut \n\nWHEN \nMEN \nWERE \nMEN \nAND \nTHE \nMAFIA \nFIXED \nRACES \n315 \nthen Kawasaki offered me  5000 bucks for ’74 and  gave Yvon 100  grand, \nso  I said “stick it up your ass” and rode for  Suzuki.’ \nNixon’s two years running Kanemoto-fettled Suzuki 750s might \nhave turned him into a  500  GP  star if it hadn’t been for a horror crash \nat the factory’s Ryuyo test  track. Sheene had talked Suzuki into entering \nNixon in the ’74 Dutch TT, aboard one  of the factory’s brand new RG500 \nsquare four. On  his way to Europe Nixon stopped in Japan to test some \nTR750 chassis mods he wanted Suzuki to  adopt. \n‘Our 750  was running a 24 degree head angle, their 750 was 30 or  31. \nFirst lap  out Ken Aroaka (Suzuki's test rider) comes by me, and me \nbeing a dumb ass  I passed him back. Going into this fifth gear corner I \nbacked the throttle off and the thing seized. Ken clipped my back wheel \nand I went down. I woke up,  noticed my  arm was all  bent over, then \nthe  pain hit.  They put me  on  a workbench on  the back of a pickup with \na little Jap guy on  top of me  so  I wouldn’t fall  off. I was screaming and \nyelling till  they shot me  up  in  the  hospital. A few hours later I heard \nloud screams —  Ken’s on  the little bench next to me  with one of the Jap \ndocs pulling his  broken leg, while the  other guy’s got  a  foot-long drill \ngoing through his  knee...’ \nNixon broke both arms, three ribs and an  ankle in that accident, but \nhe  still wasn’t finished. In  ‘76  he  moved back to  Kawasaki to  have a \ncrack at  the  inaugural F750 world championship, riding a KR750 that \nhad been heavily breathed upon by Kanemoto. ‘I guess the ’76 Kawasaki \nthat Erv  built me  was the  start of what they have nowadays —  it had \ncantilever shocks, chrome-moly frame, the right head angle, all  the \nstuff like that.’ \nNixon made a great start to  the series —  taking second to  Johnny \nCecotto \nat \nDaytona \nand \nwinning \nround \ntwo \nat \nSan \nCarlos, \nVenezuela. \nOr \nso \nhe \nthought. \n‘The \nrace \nwas \nsponsored \nby \nthe \nlocal \nYamaha \nimporters, \nso \nthey \nfixed \nSteve \nBaker’s \nlaps \nso \nhe \nwon \nit \non \nhis \nYamaha. \nI \nfound \nout \nlater \nthat \nthe \nrace \nwas \nrun \nby \nthe \nMafia, \nso \nI \nwas \njust \nfuckin’ \nlucky \nI \nwas \nstill \nalive.’ \nThe \nrow \ndragged \non \nall \nyear, \nthe \nFIM \neventually \ndeciding \nto \npretend \nthe \nVenezuelan \nrace \nhad \nnever \neven \nhappened. \nIf \nthings \nhad \ngone \nNixon’s \nway, \nhe \nwould’ve \nwon \nthe \nworld \ntitle \nby \na \nsingle \npoint. \nNixon \nraced \nhis  \nlast  \nserious \nrace \nin  \n1979, \nafter \na \ncouple \nof \nreasonable \nyears \non  \nKanemoto-prepared \nYamaha \nTZ750s. \nSince \nthen \nhe’s \ncarried \non \nwith \nhis \nmotorcycle \nparts \nbusiness, \nmore \nrecently \ncreating \nhis \nown \nwebsite \nthat \nflogs \nthe \n‘Gary \nNixon \nEnterprises’ \nT-shirts \nmade \nfamous \n\n316 THE FAST STUFF \nby  Sheene, who never raced without a  Nixon tee after surviving his \nhorrific ‘75  Daytona smash while wearing one. ‘Shit, if I’d  crashed \nwearing that I wouldn’t have worn it any more,’ Nixon opines, with \nsome logic. ‘I would’ve thought it’s  unlucky but  I guess Barry thought \nhe  was lucky he  didn’t get  killed. The guy did  so  much for  me, some \nstuff I can’t even tell people. We just hit  off, we  had some good times.’ \nIn  recent years Nixon has  returned to  the  tracks and still isn’t to  be \nmessed with —  he  can  still make the  podium at  Daytona on  his  classic \nHonda CB750: ‘We had it running good and I was running right along \nwith Springer (Jay Springsteen, a  recently retired AMA dirt track \nlegend), I was screwing with him and he was screwing with me...’ And \nthere’s no  plans to  retire just yet: ‘If people like to  watch me, I’ll  keep \ndoing’ it.  I just go as  fast as  I can  without crashing.’ \nTo  keep his  aching body moving between races, Nixon gets himself \nalong to the occasional MotoGP race to help look after Honda star Nicky \nHayden. He’s known the  Hayden clan for  years. ‘I  used to  race with \nNicky’s dad  in the  1960s, though I don’t remember him. Then I ran  into \nhis  dad when Nicky and his  brothers were first racing. I remember \ntalking to  Nicky when he  was 12.  I asked him “how old  are  you?”, he \nwas like (Nixon raises his  voice several octaves), ‘sixteen!’ I saw him \ndoin’ a  dirt race or  two and I thought this kid  is unbelievable. Then he \ngot on  a roadracer, and when he got on  a good bike he just took off.  He’s \na  great kid. At  dirt  track I’d  say  to  him “You look a little high here or  a \nlittle low there”, then when he started roadracing I’d go out  to comers to \nwatch him. About the  only real  thing I ever said to him was “Hey, get all \nthe money before you start drinking and partying”. But he goes to church, \nhe lives life right, he’s just concentrating on  being world champion.’ \nMotoGP Mutterings: January 2005 \nSome of the world’s greatest minds also get off on  a  good blast \nof speed \n‘Speed, it seems to  me, provides the  one genuinely modern pleasure,’ \nwrote Aldous Huxley back in  1931. Arguably the  greatest mind of the \n20th century, Huxley knew what he was talking about. During his  life \nthe  author of Brave New World tried all kinds of different intoxicants in \nthe pursuit of pleasure, having decided that modern man was going to \n\nSPEED —  THE ONE GENUINELY MODERN PLEASURE SyIE7/ \nneed some kind of special buzz to make it worthwhile getting up every \nmorning, whether it  be  a  capsule of  brain-bending mescaline or  a \n150mph blast down your local bypass. \nAfter mph and mescaline Huxley tried LSD and God knows what \nelse in  his  ultimately unsuccessful quest to  find the  perfect source of \nindustrialised happiness. (If you’re looking for the  epicentre of today’s \nlet’s-get-out-of-it-to-make-life-bearable culture, Huxley’s your man, \nthough his  own intentions were honourable; he was no  binge drinker, \nhe consumed all his  drugs in precisely measured quantities, then noted \ndown the  effects in full  detail.) \nHuxley was very impressed with the effect that straightforward miles \nper hour could have on  the brain, at least until he discovered the warp- \ndrive effects of  designer drugs. ‘The inebriating effects of  speed are \nnoticeable at  about 20  miles an  hour,’ he  wrote, \nexplaining to  his  readers that 72mph is the  speed at \nwhich life  starts to get a bit  scary: ‘One begins to feel ‘lam a slave to \nan  unprecedented sensation —  it grows intenser with speed. On  my \nevery increase of  velocity.” And Huxley was proper tombstone they will \nscared of going much faster than that: ‘I have never carve: It never got \ntravelled at  much more than 80mph, but  those who fast enough for me’ \nhave drunk a  stronger brewage of  this strange sy ee z \nintoxicant tell me that new marvels await anyone \nwho has the  opportunity of passing the  hundred mark. At  what point \nthe  pleasure turns into pain I do  not  know, but  two hundred miles an \nhour must be absolute torture.’ \nThirty years after Huxley wrote those words a  good chunk of \nhumanity was already addicted to  speed, none more so  than American \njournalist \nHunter \nS. \nThompson, \nauthor \nof \ncult \nnovel \nFear \nand \nLoathing \nin \nLas \nVegas, \nwho \nrates \nspeed \nas \n‘one \nof \nmy \nfinest \naddictions’. \n‘I \nam \na \nslave \nto \nspeed,’ \nhe \nonce \nwrote. \n‘On \nmy \ntombstone \nthey \nwill \ncarve: \nIt \nnever got fast enough for me.’ \nOf \ncourse, \nspeed \nalone \nhas  \nnever \nbeen \nenough \nfor \nThompson; \nhe \nalso \ngot  \noff  \non  \nhandguns, \nhigh \nexplosives, \ndrugs, \nbooze, \npolitical \nintrigue \nand \nunder-age \nsex. \nWhile \nHuxley \nworried \nabout \nthe \nhorrors \nof \nton-plus \ntravel, \nThompson \nspent \nmost \nof \nhis \nlife \nlooking \nfor \na \npracticable \nequivalent \nof \nbeing \nloaded \ninto \nan \nApollo \nrocket \nand \nblasted \ninto \nspace, \nwhether \nit \nmeant \npopping \npills \nin \nan \narmchair \nback \nhome \nin \nAspen \nor \nriding \nfast \nmotorcycles \ndown \nhis \nfavourite \nmountain \nhighway. \n(The \n\n318 THE FAST STUFF \nWoody Creek Perverse Environmental Testing Facility, as  he liked to call \nit.) Which is probably why a few years ago  some sicko at American bike \nmag Cycle World had the bright idea of  offering the gun-totin’ acid \ncasualty a  Ducati to  road test. That’s a  bit  like asking some blingin’, \ntooled-up rapper from So  Solid Crew to  test drive the  latest Ferrari on \na zigzagging Alpine road. Just asking for trouble. \nAt  least Thompson did  fully understand the  dangers involved in \nriding bikes too  fast. ‘The final measure of any rider’s skill,’ he wrote in \nsumming up  the  big  red  Duke. ‘Is  the  inverse ratio of  his  preferred \ntravelling speed to  the  number of bad scars on  his  body.’ He  did  nearly \ncrash the  v-twin, of course: ‘I felt  nauseous and I cried for  my  mama, \nbut  nobody heard... This motorcycle is simply too  goddam fast to  ride \nat  speed in  any kind of normal road traffic unless you’re ready to  go \nstraight down the centreline with your nuts on  fire  anda silent scream \nin  your throat.’ He  also found the  bike’s ergonomics unsuited to  his \nsubstance-abused body: ‘I  was hunched over the  tank like a  person \ndiving into a pool that got  emptied yesterday’. \nBut however much Thompson suffered for  his  speed addiction you \njust know that the world’s number-one expert on  growing old \ndisgracefully never went soft and bought a  steady old  Harley: ‘Some \npeople will tell  you that slow is good —  and it may be,  on  some days — \nbut  I am  here to  tell you that fast is better. I’ve  always believed this, in \nspite of  the  trouble it’s  caused me. Being shot out  of  a  cannon will \nalways be  better than being squeezed out  of a  tube. That is why God \nmade fast motorcycles, Bubba...’ \nYears before HST, years before Huxley even, another literary genius \nwas getting into the joys of speed. Irish author James Joyce wrote these \nwords a whole century ago, after watching a road race rattling into the \nstreets of  Dublin: ‘Rapid motion through space elates one; so  does \nnotoriety; so  does the  possession of money’. That sentence blows me \naway, in  15  words written in  1905 Joyce exactly describes the  forces \ndriving every MotoGP star: speed, fame, money. In the  same chapter of \nThe Dubliners he  adds (referring to  a  big, blue Citroén racer): ‘The \njourney laid a magical finger on  the  genuine pulse of life and gallantly \nthe machinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses \nof the  swift blue animal.’ So  nothing’s changed —  all  racers and road \nriders make themselves feel  more alive every time they yank open the \nthrottle and challenge their nerves to  keep up. \n\nIt’s \nA \nFUNNY \nOLD \nWORLD \nAND \nA \nFUNNY \nOLD \nWORLD \nCHAMPIONSHIP \n319 \nMotoGP Mutterings: February 2005 \nAll  the world’s a  stage, or  in our case, a racetrack... \nIt’s  a  funny old  world and it’s  a  funny old  world championship. All \nhuman life  is  right there in  the  MotoGP paddock; there’s good guys \nand there’s bad guys, a  microcosm of  the  world itself. Except that \nmotorcycle racing tends to  attract the  more extreme forms of homo \nerectus, and the most extreme form of  motorcycle racing tends to \nattract, well, some serious nutters. \nI’ve known a  few in  my  time, though not all  MotoGP riders are \nnutters. There’s all  kinds, driven by all  kinds of inner forces. There’s \nthose racked by insecurities and a  wretched desperation to  succeed \nand, at  the  opposite end of the  racers’ psychological spectrum, there’s \nthose who just happen to  be  very, very good at  doing something they \nreally, really love. Over the years you tend to fall  out  with the arseholes \nand maintain a distant respect for the nice guys, trying your best not  to \nbe  their mate because there’s nothing worse than a  journalist who \npretends the  riders are  his  mates. \nSo who are  the  arseholes and who are  the good people? I never really \ngot  on  with former world 250 and Superbike champ John Kocinski. JK \n(or  the  ‘little shit’, as  his  team boss King Kenny Roberts sometimes \nreferred to  him) was a  very weird racer. His attitude to  life  was as \nobsessively compulsive as  his attitude to  winning. You’d end up \ninterviewing him while he painstakingly picked the lint  from his  socks. \nDuring his time with Team Roberts he  was banned from using a \nmotorhome because he’d be  up  half the  night polishing the  kitchen \nfittings, \nso \nhe’d \nbe \nworn \nout \ncome \nrace \nday. \nOn \nreturning \nhome \nto \nthe \nStates \none \nsummer \nKocinski \ngot \narrested \nfor \nhoovering \nhis \nthree-piece \nsuite \non \nhis \nfront \nlawn \nat \n3am. \nNot \nlong \nafter \nhe \nhad \nbeen \nspurned \nby \nGP \nracing \nhe \naccused \nme \nof \nhaving \nbeen \npaid \nto \ndestroy \nhis \ncareer. \nHell \nJohn, I'd  have done it for  free if anyone had asked... \nI \nhad \na \nfew \nrun-ins \nwith \nMax \nBiaggi \ntoo. \nYears \nback \nI \nworked \nfor \none \nof \nhis \nsponsors \nand \nthe \nself-styled \nRoman \nEmperor \nalways \nmade \nmy \nlife \nas \nunpleasant \nas \npossible, \njust \nlike \nhe \ndid \nfor \nmost \npeople \naround \nhim. \nHe \nwas \nalways \nagonisingly \ndesperate \nto \nwin \nand \nwanted \neveryone \nworking \nwith \nhim \nto \nbe \nsimilarly \ntortured, \nwhich \nis \nwhy, \nin \nthe \nend, \nno \none \nin \nMotoGP \nwanted \nto \nwork \nwith \nhim, \neven \nthough \nhe \nis \nstill \na \nvery \nfast \nrider. \nTo \nbe \nhonest \nI \nfelt \nsorry \nfor \nthe \nguy, \nhis \nmum \nleft \nhim \nwhen \n\n320 THE FAST STUFF \nhe  was a  kid, so  maybe it’s  no  surprise that he  doesn’t seem like a \nhappy person. Then again, it was hard to  feel sympathy for  someone \nwho used to  hire a  couple of muscled Roman gladiators to  follow him \naround at  the  Italian GP. \nThen there’s Eddie Lawson. The guy once threatened to  set  his \nattorneys on  me  after I’d written some story about his  defection from \nYamaha to Honda in  1989. In fact the  four-time 500  champ hated most \nof the  press. I was never really sure what to  make of him until I read \nsomething he  said a  few months ago: ‘I’ve always had the utmost \nrespect for the  US  military’. That made up  my mind. \nLawson seemed to  feed on  his  dislike for  people, using its  heat to \npower him on  the racetrack. That’s not  uncommon in racing. Valentino \nRossi certainly had more fire  in his  belly in 2004 and 2005, stoked by \nhis burning desire to make his  former Honda bosses look like fools. But \nI’ve no  doubt that Rossi is  a  reasonable human being, though he’s \ndefinitely got  a  dark side which he  betrays so  easily that it’s  funny. \nWhen Rossi gets the  hump his  face darkens, his  eyes seem to  sink into \nhis  skull and you know it’s  time to  get out  of his  way. We  saw him get \nnasty on  Sete Gibernau at the end of 2004 after he accused the  Spaniard \nof behaving like  a classroom sneak, getting Rossi sent to the back of the \ngrid at  that year’s Qatar GP. \nAt least Rossi and Gibernau behave like  normal human beings when \ngiven half a chance (though you don’t see  them getting drunk te:ether \nany more). They are  able to  compartmentalise their racing selves from \ntheir non-racing selves; which is the  whole point, you need to  be  evil \non  the  track, not  off it.  Some riders never get  the hang of that concept. \nYour ultimate MotoGP or  WSB Jekyll and Hyde would have to  be Troy \nBayliss. A total animal on  the motorcycle, Bayliss is  a charming family \nman in  the  paddock. I’ve found him in  his  motorhome, five minutes \nafter crashing out  of a GP,  quietly mucking about with his  kids, calmly \nsuggesting \nthey \nmight \nclear \nup \ntheir \nbombsite \nof \ntoys. \nAnd \nhe \nlikes \na \nbeer or  ten  on  Sunday nights, too. \nBayliss \nis  \nfunny \nwhen \nhe’s \npissed \nbut \nthe  \nbest \nBayliss \nmoment \nis \nSunday \nmornings, \nwhen \nyou'll \nfind \nhim \nin \nthe \nteam \nVIP \nunit, \naddressing \nthe  \nbreakfast \nbuffet, \nselecting \na \nbowl \nof \nmuesli \nand \nsome \ncroissants \nto \ntake \nback \nto \nhis  \nmotorhome \nwhere \nhe \ngives \nhis \nwife \nKim \nher  \nbreakfast \nin \nbed. \nNow \nthere \ncan’t \nbe \nmany \nblokes \nwho \nfix  \ntheir \nwives’ \nbrekkie \non \ntheir \nway \nto \nwork. \nA \nproper \nfamily \nbloke \nfor \nsure, \nBayliss \nis \nvery \naware \n\nIt’s \nA \nFUNNY \nOLD \nWORLD \nAND \nA \nFUNNY \nOLD \nWORLD \nCHAMPIONSHIP \n321 \nthat \nhe’s \ngot  \na  \nraging \nanimal \ninside \nhim, \nwhich \nis \nwhy \nhe’s \nrecently \nfound \nhimself \nin \na \ndilemma. \nHim \nand \nKim \nhad \ntheir \nthird \nchild \na  \nfew \nyears \nback, \nso \nBayliss \nhas \nbeen \nconsidering \ngetting \nthe \nsnip, \nonly \nhe’s \nterrified \nthat \na \nvasectomy \nmight \nrob \nhim \nof \nhis \nRottweiler-style \naggression, \nlike \nsome \ncastrated \ndog \ntransformed \nfrom \nsnarling \nbeast \nto \ncringing \nmutt. \n‘So \nI \nwon't \nget \nthe \nsnip \ntill \nI \nretire,’ \nhe \nfinally \ndecided. \nI’m \nguessing \nBayliss \nnever \nbothered \nwith \nbiology \nclasses \nat school \nbut \nsomehow \nI couldn’t \nbring \nmyself \nto \ntell \nhim \nthat \nvasectomies \ndon’t \ninvolve \nhaving \nyour \nbollocks \nchopped \noff... \nMotoGP Mutterings: March 2005 \nDo we like speed for its  own sake or  are we chasing after \nsomething more complex than that? \nWe  love speed. You, me  and  Valentino Rossi are  the  same in this  respect — \nwe all get a kick out of moving rapidly through space, from feeling ourselves \nrocketing across the landscape like  some master of the universe. \nBut  is it really as  simple as  that? Is it purely the  miles per  hour that \ngets us  going or  is  it  something more complex than that? Rossi says \nthis about going really fast on  a motorcycle: ‘At  high speed everything \nbecomes more difficult and more beautiful’. Obvious enough maybe, \nbut the  world’s greatest bike racer is  suggesting that it  isn’t merely \nspeed that turns him on,  it’s  the  difficulty of achieving a certain speed \nthat delivers the  real buzz. \nMy own personal take on  the speed thing is  that it’s  degrees of \nthrottle opening that really count, on  the street at  least, rather than \npure miles per  hour. Seventy miles per  hour can  be a yawn or  a  scream, \ndepending on  what you're riding and how you’re riding it. When speed \ncomes too  easily, on  a  mere whiff of throttle, it’s  not  so  much fun, but \nwhen every mph is hard won at  the  end of an  over-stretched throttle \ncable, you really begin to  enjoy the  sensation. So  70mph on a ‘Blade \ncan \nbe \nseriously \nunderwhelming \nwhile \n70mph \non \na \nknackered \n125 \nis \nteetering \non \nthe \nbrink, \nabout \nas \ntricky \nand \ntherefore \nas \nrewarding \nas \nattempting \nto \nre-enter \nthe \nearth’s \natmosphere \nin \nan \nApollo \nrocket. \nIt’s \nlike \nanything \nin \nlife, \nreally, \nthe \nmore \nyou \nput \ninto \nsomething, \nthe \nmore \nyou get  out  of it. \nOkay, \nI \nguess \nthis \nmeans \nI’m  \ngoing \nto  \nbe  \nsinging \nthe  \npraises \nof \ncrap \n\n322 THE FAST STUFF \nmotorcycles here. Consider this: if  you want to  regain the careless \nrapture of  your first teenage rides, don’t go  out and buy a brand- \nspanking new RI,  go  out  and buy a  CG125 with a  bent frame and an \nintermittent misfire. With a cracked, quirky machine like that you will \nbe able to rediscover that long-lost sense of adventure on  wikis journey \nyou take, indeed on  every corner you take. \nMy own personal crock of  biking shite is  a  dirty, four-year-old \nBurgman 400 (okay, so  it’s  a scooter but don’t tell anyone) which rarely \nfails to  make me  laugh, or  at  least snigger, whenever I ride it.  It isn’t \nthat fast but  it is fast enough to  hurt. This hideous hunk of steel and \nplastic can surpass 90mph and when you go into a corner at that speed \nyou really feel  like  you're living, though you feel even more alive when \nyou make it out  the  other side. You see, that same corner taken on  a \n‘Blade or  a  999 would be  a  non-event —  in  and out, no  doubt. On  the \nBurgman it can  make you feel like Valentino. You’re heading into the \nturn, feeling the  under-damped suspension seesawing back and forth, \ntransferring too  much force to  the  pressed-steel frame which begins to \ntwist and flex like a  drunken lap  dancer. You’re holding your breath, \nwary that you  may be about to push things an  nth  too  far, your muscles \ntautened and ready to do whatever it takes if she  does get too  far out  of \nshape. So it’s  up to your skill, talent and judgement to keep this floating \nmarshmallow hovercraft on  the  road. Brilliant. \n(And not  only that, because the  enjoyment I derive from riding this \nsorry mess is multiplied by my lack of concern for the thing —  I can  park \nit anywhere without a moment’s worry because I don’t really care if it \ngets scratched or  nicked.) \nNow you may think that wrestling an  ill-handling heap through \ncorners is a  perverse way of getting your motorcycling thrills but I’m \nnot  the  only one who feels this way. Rossi is the  same: he  knows that \nyou get  what you give, that’s why he  quit Honda for  Yamaha. During \n2003 Rossi had found racing Honda’s RCV too  easy, too  boring, and if \nhis  YZR-M1] isn’t exactly a bent, misfiring CG125, it certainly required \nthe world champ to dig a little deeper into his  goldmine of talent. Rossi \nlikes to  dig  deep, to  accept challenges from which others might shy \naway because he’s man enough to  know that going out  on  a  limb can \nbe  a  whole lot  of  fun and he  realises that the  risks of failure are  far \noutweighed by the  rewards of success. ‘I knew that if I could win on \nthe Yamaha it would bring me  great joy,’ Rossi said. ‘That overcame any \n\nDO  WE  LIKE SPEED FOR ITS  OWN SAKE? 323 \nfears and doubts I’d  had about making the  move.’ It’s  the  same with \nmy  Burgman, honest. \nOf  course, back on  the  streets there are  some pleasures that a  crap \nmotorcycle can  never provide. If the  proliferation of Gatsos, speed traps \nand nobbers in cars ensures that you're never able to keep your RI,  Blade \nor  whatever pinned for  more than a  few  brief moments, it doesn’t really \nmatter because those few seconds are  all  that’s required to  have you \nmainlining enough adrenalin to keep you  high for the next 45 minutes. \nThat’s the true attraction of  modern superbikes —   they’re so \noutlandishly fast that it’s  possible to  achieve the  most disgracefully \ninappropriate speeds in the shortest of distances, in between the Gatsos, \nif necessary. It’s  these little moments of madness that can make any \ntwo-hour ride worthwhile and memorable, the  fizz of  adrenalin still \ntrembling through you as  you sit  on  the  kitchen floor taking off your \nleathers. Even so, I still reckon that every garage should contain at least \none crap motorcycle. \n\nCHAPTER 41 \nTHE HARDEST RACERS IN  THE \nWORLD, EVER \nApril 2005 \nMost racers are hard by normal standards. But some defy the \nrules of medicine and good sense to  force their battered bodies \nback into the saddle and ride just as  fast as  they did before. It’s \ntime to pay homage to  bike racing’s hardest men \nMotorcycle racing is populated by hard nuts. There’s a good reason for this \n—you don’t get far in bikes if you can’t shrug off bone-crunching, stomach- \nchurning pain like  you or  I might shrug off a  mild cold. Pain is such an \ninevitable part of  a  racer’s life that he  must learn to  live with it,  or  as \nlegendary racetrack medic Claudio Costa believes, make it his friend. \n‘By mutating pain’s dimension the  rider can  make it his  friend and \ncarry it  with him into the  race to  complete his  enterprise,’ says the \nItalian doctor who has spent the last few decades putting broken \nMotoGP and WSB riders back together. \nBut what drives racers to  torture their bodies so?  What made King \nKenny Roberts defend his  500  crown with a broken back, Mick Doohan \nreturn to  racing with a  leg  bent like a  banana or  British Superbike \nchampion John Reynolds start the 2005 BSB series just 38 eye-watering \ndays after breaking a  leg? Money and machismo, mostly, the  lust for \ngongs, gold and glory... \nReynolds amazed many people when he  began his  title defence at \nBrands Hatch in April 20005, just five weeks after breaking his  right leg \nwhile testing at Valencia in February. But all he was doing was continuing \na rich tradition of motorcycle racers overcoming the medical odds. \nRacing injured is the dark side of bike racing, when it all starts getting \na bit  ugly. Really, you shouldn’t be racing but  you're out  there because \nyou're scared of losing your crown, scare of losing your ride, scared of \nlosing your income. To a racer, ignoring the  agony of injury is  simply \nthe  flipside of quaffing the  ecstasy of success. \n\nTHE HARDEST RACERS IN  THE WORLD, EVER 325 \nReynolds \nknows \nthe  \ndeal, \nwhich \nis  \none \nreason \nhe  \nraced \nat  \nBrands, \nseven \nweeks \nearlier \nthan \ndoctors \ndeemed \nreasonable. \n‘If you’re \ngoing \nto \nrace \nbikes \nyou've \ngot \nto \nbe \naware \nthat \nyou're \nnot \nalways \ngoing \nto \nbe \nracing \npain \nfree,’ \nsays \nReynolds, \nwho \nturned \n40 \nhalfway \nthrough \nthe \n2005 \nseason. \n‘A \nlot \nof \nthe \ntime \nyou're \nracing \nin \npain \n— \nthere \nwere \neight \nor \nnine \nguys \nriding \ninjured \nwhen \nI came \nback \nat \nBrands. \nMost \nof \nthe \ntime \nI’ve \ngot \nthe \nbest \njob \nin \nthe \nworld \nbut \nsometimes \nit’s \none \nof \nthe \nworst, \nlike when \nyou're \non \nthe \nthird \nrow with \n35 \nhungry \nriders \naround \nyou, \nwhen \nyou \nknow \nyou're \ngoing \nto \nget \nswallowed \nup and you \nknow \nyou've \ngot \na \nbroken \nleg. \nIt’s \nnot \npleasant, \nmentally \nand \nphysically \nit’s \nhard \nto get out \nthere.’ \n. \nReynolds scored two ninth-place finishes at  Brands for  his  pains, \neven though he’d been uncertain of his  ability to  control a  bike. ‘The \nfirst two sessions I was making mistakes, running wide, scaring myself, \nbecause it was the  first time I’d  ridden more than a  few laps in  anger \nsince October. In  the  races I was riding 99  per  cent but  my  right boot \nwas dragging on  the  floor, that was the  biggest issue with lap times.’ \nAnd yet Reynolds doesn’t think he’s hard or  heroic. ‘I’m no  hero, it’s \njust grit and determination. And I’m not  hard, like I don’t go  around \nthe  streets looking for  fights. But I am  hard on  myself because if I say \nI'll  do  something for  someone, I'll  give 100  per  cent to  make sure the \njob’s done and Id  agreed to  do a job for  Rizla Suzuki.’ \nBut  what really drives Reynolds to  do these things? It can’t all be for \na  pat  on  the  back from his  team. ‘I wouldn’t want people to  say  I’m  a \nwuss,’ he  says, possibly getting to  the  crux of  the  matter. ‘If  anyone \never told me  I’m a scaredy cat  I’d  be  devastated.’ And what about the \nmoney? \n‘If \nyou \nstart \nthinking \nabout \nmoney, \nit’s \ngame \nover.’ \nThen \nhe \nthinks \nagain. \n‘In \nfact \nmoney \ndoes \nmatter, \nracing \nis \nmy \nliving, \nbut \nmoney \ndoesn’t \nmake \nyou \ngo \nfaster, \nit \njust \nmakes \nyou \nwork \nharder \nat \nit.’ \nOn  \nthis \noccasion, \nworking \nharder \nat  \nit \nmeant \nthrice-weekly \nsessions \nlocked \nin \na \nhyperbaric \nchamber, \nfollowed \nby \nlaser \nand \nmagnetic \ntreatment. \nAnd \nit \nmeant \nracing \nat \nBrands \nknowing \nthat \nanother \ncrash \ncould \nfinish \nthe \nleg. \n‘I’ve \noften \nwondered \nhow \nmuch \nslower \nI'd \ngo \nif \nI \nrode \naround \nnaked, \nand \nthat’s \nhow \nI \nfelt, \nvery \nvulnerable. \nEvery \ntime \nI \nwent \ninto \na \nfast \ncorner \nI \nwas \nthinking \nI \ndon’t \nwant \nanything \nto \ngo \nwrong \nhere.’ \nReynolds \nadmits \nthat \npain \nwasn’t \na  \nproblem \nwith \nthis \ninjury, \nbut  \nhe \ncouldn’t \nhave \nridden \nwithout \nhis \ntailor-made \nAlpinestars \nboot, \nfeaturing \n\n326 THE FAST STUFF \na rigid carbon-fibre inner that straps to  the  shin, taking weight off the \nstill-healing tibia and fibula. ‘The only problem was that the  boot cuts \nof the blood supply, so  I got pins and needles. Riding wasn’t so  painful, \nmore clumsy than anything. I didn’t have to go through a massive pain \nbarrier, even though I had no  painkillers because the  boot strapping \nwas so  good, comfy and tight. \n‘It  would’ve been so  easy to  sit  at  home watching Brands on  TV, \nthinking I’ll race when I’m fit, but if you want to defend a championship \nyou've got  to  be  out  there doing it. At  the  end of the  year I may need \nthose points, so  I’m  pleased I rode.’ [In fact he  didn’t need the  points, \nbecause six  months later he was an  ex-racer. Reynolds decided to  quit \nimmediately after smashing himself up  at  Brands in October, breaking \na collarbone and four ribs and puncturing a lung. ‘When I hit the barrier \nit was like a  switch in  my  head flipped,’ he  said. ‘Instantly I knew it \nwas time to  stop.’ ] \nJR’s story is enough to make your normal bloke on  the  street squirm \nand wince, but  it’s  nothing out  of the  ordinary in the  cruel, hard world \nof bike racing. The list  is as  long as  a  badly broken arm... \nKing Kenny Roberts is probably the  only racer to  have won a world \ntitle with a broken back. The American claimed his  second 500 crown \nin  1979 despite a  massive smash during testing at  Yamaha’s lethal \nFukuroi track (or  in  this case ‘Fuck you, Kenny’). \nAfter slamming into a  barrier at  90mph he  felt the \n‘Daytona wasn’t so numbness flow through him. But he  was racing \nbad but Silverstone again nine weeks later. A  few years before that \nwas major —  my  left Roberts had an  agonising motocross crash after \nleg was hanging on which surgeons removed one of his  testicles. Three \nby the femoral weeks later he was racing at Daytona, with a hole cut \nartery’ out  of  his  Yamaha’s seat to  relieve pressure on  his \nEIEN \nstill-tender \nscrotum. \nKing \nKenny \nalso \nhas \na \nbullet \nlodged in his  left  leg from a  shooting accident. \nRoberts’ former sparring partner, the  late Barry Sheene, was famous \nfor  three things —  winning two 500  world titles, shagging a  top  model \nand returning, Lazarus-like, from prangs that would’ve ended any \nnormal \nhuman’s \ncareer. \nAs \nDr \nCosta \nsays: \n‘Barry \nhad \nso \nmany \naccidents \nthat \nhe \nbecame \na \nwalking \nencyclopaedia \nof \ntraumatology \nfor \nmy \nstaff’. \nSheene \ntook \njust \nsix \nweeks \nto \ncome \nback \nfrom \nthat \nnotorious \n1975 \nDaytona \nsmash \nthat \nleft \nhim \nwith \na \nbroken \nfemur, \nwrist, \nforearm, \n\nTHE HARDEST RACERS IN  THE WORLD, EVER 22 \ncollarbone, \nsix  \nribs \nand \ncompression-fractured \nvertebrae. \nAnd \nhe \nreturned \nfrom \nan  \neven \nmore \ndisastrous \npile-up \nat  \nthe  \n1981 \nBritish \nGP \nafter \nwhich \nsurgeons \nused \n28 screws \nto \nfix \nhis legs. \n‘Daytona \nwasn’t \nso \nbad \nbut \nSilverstone \nwas \nmajor,’ \nSheene \nsaid \nlater. \n‘My \nleft \nleg \nwas \nhanging \non \nby the \nfemoral \nartery.’ \nIf that makes you feel a little bit  icky, Mick Doohan’s tales of pain \nand suffering have made grown men weep. The teak-tough Aussie was \nnotorious for  his  ability to  withstand the  most horrendous agonies. \nAfter breaking a  finger during qualifying for  the 1995 German GP \nMighty Mick refused pain-killing jabs with the  immortal words, ‘I’m \nnot a  painkiller type of person,’ then went out  to  grab pole position. \nBut  that was the least of it. In ’92,  Doohan nearly lost  his right leg after \na crash at Assen. Dr  Costa sewed his  legs together to  save the  mangled \nlimb and he  was racing again within seven weeks, narrowly missing \nout  on  that year’s 500 title to Wayne Rainey. \nThe next winter Doohan bent the  still-mending bone while training too \nhard but was winning GPs again within a  few months. Surgeons later \nfitted an  Ilizarov gantry to  straighten the  leg. All  Ilizarov patients take \nmorphine, except Mick who existed on  an  over-the-counter painkiller. \nCalifornian surgeon Kevin Louie says: ‘Mick took so  little pain medication, \nit’s  almost superhuman, it’s  like  he’s reset his pain thermostat.’ \nRacers are  used to  dealing with physical injuries —  breaking bones, \ntearing flesh, getting so  beat up  it’s  like they’ve been badly done over \noutside a nightclub —  but brain damage is something that strikes fear into \nevery one  of them. Perennial World Superbike runner-up Aaron Slight had \nalready bounced back from his fair share of knocks —  including a deforming \nhand injury —  when he  suffered a  stroke before the  2000 World Supers \nseason. \nHe \nwas \nrushed \ninto \nhospital \nwhere \nneurosurgeons \nfixed \na \nburst \nblood \nvessel \nin \nhis \nbrain. \nMedics \nsaid \nhe \nmight \nnever \nrace \nagain \nbut \nthe \nKiwi \nwas \nback \non \nboard \nhis \nCastrol \nHonda \nwithin \ntwo \nmonths. \nEven \nmore \nscary \nwas \nCarlos \nCheca’s \ncomeback \nfrom \na \nlife-threatening \naccident \nat \nthe \n1998 \nBritish \nGP. \nCareless \nChucker \nwas \nMotoGP’s \nmost \ncrash-happy \nracer, \nonce \ncrashing \n27 \ntimes \nin \none \nseason, \nbut \naccidents \nnever \nslowed \nhim \ndown. \nAt \nDonington \nhe \ncrashed \nat \nCraner \nCurve \nat \n120mph, \nstaggered \nback \nto \nhis \nmotorhome \nand \ncollapsed \nwith \nmassive \ninternal \nbleeding. \nHe \nwas \nhelicoptered \nto \nhospital \nwhere \nsurgeons \nremoved \nhis \nspleen. \nBut \nCheca \nsuffered \na \nrelapse, \ngoing \nblind \nand \npartially \nparalysed \nfor \nmore \nthan \n15 \nhours. \nSeven \nweeks \nlater \nhe \nwas \n\n328 THE FAST STUFF \nracing, and crashing, again. ‘Honestly I was scared,’ he  recalls. ‘But I \nfought against that scary feeling to  prove to  myself that I was well \nagain.’ Not as  easy as  it sounds. \nCarl Fogarty was famous for  gritting his  teeth during the  years he \nbattled for  his  four World Superbike crowns. But Foggy had already \nbeen through the  mill before he’d even made it onto the  world scene, \ntwice breaking his  right femur while racing 250s in  Britain. In  fact \nthat’s why he moved to  Supers, because he could no  longer fit on  a 250. \nBut  his  hardest day’s racing came at  Sugo in  1995 when he came back \nfrom a  stratospheric race-one highside to  win race two. Only later did \nx-rays reveal that the  crash had broken bones in  his  right hand and \nankle. After that the  Italian media nicknamed Foggy ‘Lionheart’. \nThe list  goes on  and on  and on:  Supers hero Chris Walker, always an \nace at  crashing in  race one and winning race two, 1987 500 champ \nWayne Gardner, the man who narrowly avoided semi-castration after a \nnasty tankslapper at  Suzuka and Kevin Schwantz, who rode half his \ncareer with broken bones. Nutters! We  salute you all... \nThe science of pain -  do heroes really exist? \nPain exists for  a  reason. It’s  there to  tell  you to  stop doing whatever \nyou're doing or  risk damaging yourself. The hard racer ignores those \nwarnings —  he feels pain from his  broken wrist, forces himself to ignore \nit and insists on  racing next Sunday. He  can  race despite stinging pain \nbecause he’s desperately determined, because he’s high on  dopamine \n(the body’s natural painkillers) and maybe because he’s undergone a \ncourse of pain-killing injections. \nOf  course, the tricky thing about pain is  that it’s impossible to \nquantify objectively. We  all  feel it  differently, so  the  exact same pain \nmight leave one  victim whimpering in the  corner while another shrugs \nit off with ease. \nBut what’s the difference between a wuss and a hero? Genetic make- \nup,  if recent research is  to  be  believed, which means that Schwantz, \nDoohan, Reynolds et  al  may not be  heroes after all, they’ve just got \ngenes \nthat \nmake \nthem \nless \nsensitive \nto \npain. \nIt’s \nall \ndown \nto \nhow \nmany \nmu \nopiate \nreceptors \nyou've \ngot, \naccording \nto \nneuroscientist \nDr \nGeorge \nUhl: \nif \nyou \nhave \nloads \nof \nmu, \nyou've \ngot \ngood \nresistance \nto \npain, \nif \nyou \nhaven't, \nlife’s \ngonna \nhurt. \nThen \nthere \nare \nthe \nresearchers \nwho \nbelieve \nthat \npain \nis \na \nbio-psycho-social \nphenomenon \n(ouch!), \ninfluenced \nby \n\nTHE HARDEST RACERS IN  THE WORLD, EVER Sy) \nfactors ranging from neuroanatomy to  social and economic issues. But \nit would hurt all of us  too  much to  go any deeper into that. \nOne final question —  are  today’s racers harder or  softer than their \npredecessors? Difficult to  say,  but  there’s probably no  difference. Racers \nwill always be  racers and the hard nuts will always do  just about \nanything to win. \nBut some things do  change. Motorcycles are  much more physical \ntoday than they were 10, 20  or  30 years ago. They have sharper brakes, \ngrippier tyres, better chassis and more powerful engines, which means \nfar  greater stresses and strains on  an  injured body. And modern \ntechnologies, like special boots or  special brakes, can allow riders to \nride when they never could have done a few decades back. Just as  well \nthat pain-killing technology has  come on  some too. \nTricks for the sick —  how racers race when they should stay home \nPapa's left-hand throttle \nThere are times when a racer’s determination becomes desperation, \nand so  it was with Italian 500  rider Marco Papa at  the  1994 Malaysian \nGP.

As  MotoGP champ \nValentino Rossi says: ‘I have very much fear of the mesotherapy needle.’ \nEach course requires dozens of micro-injections around the  injury. The \nadvantage of mesotherapy is that it’s  locally very effective but  doesn’t \ndull the  rider’s brain, as  do many painkillers. \nOther therapies \nApart from straightforward physio, riders can speed their recovery by \nundergoing laser and magnetic treatment. These therapies accelerate \nbone growth by increasing blood supply and decreasing inflammatory \nreactions. Very much the  rage these days, hyperbaric chambers help \noxygenate the  blood supply to  speed healing. Brian Simpson’s Ipswich \nhyperbaric has been used by  many racers including Reynolds and \nMotoGP rider John Hopkins. \nMotoGP Mutterings: May 2005 \nMotoGP is haulin’ ass, but where to,  exactly? \nPlease excuse me  for  being the  prick who bursts the  MotoGP bubble. \nYou think I’m  crazy, I know. Surely, no  bike race series has  ever looked \nbetter than MotoGP: lairy, scary 210mph four-strokes, Valentino Rossi, \nlive BBC coverage, global corporations apparently hosing cash at  the \nchampionship? Yup, the sun  is shining on  Valentino and his  supporting \ncast but  I see  dark clouds gathering on  the  horizon. \nSome day soon MotoGP may just become a victim of its own success. \nJolted into action by the championship’s booming popularity, the larger \nfactories are investing big, triggering a  desperate technology race. \nSounds great but isn’t. What do you  really love about MotoGP? Perhaps \nenjoying the  sight of riders wrestling 250 horsepower motorcycles into \nsubmission? Not for  much longer. You may already have noticed that \nyou don’t see  many MotoGP riders backing it  into turns or  getting \ngloriously crossed-up on  fistfuls of throttle anymore. And in a few years \nyou  won't see  any  of that. \nThe quickest way around a racetrack isn’t sideways, so fast-improving \nelectronic engine-braking and traction-control systems will consign the \n\nMOTOGP Is  HAULING ASS, BUT WHERE TO, EXACTLY 331 \nrip-snortin’, tyre-burnin’ MotoGP bike to  extinction, replacing human \nability with computer trickery. As Marlboro Ducati rider Loris Capirossi \nsays: ‘A few years ago  the rider was 70 per  cent important and the bike \nmaybe 30  per cent, now it’s  more like 55  per  cent and 45  per  cent. \nThere’s more electronic cables on  the  bikes than engine: I think it’s \ntoo  much.’ \nCuriously enough, we've already seen this happen. F1  car  racing has \nbeen headed down this road for some years, with the most terrifying of \nconsequences —  worldwide outbreaks of narcolepsy every other summer \nSunday afternoon. Less and less fans truly respect F1  drivers, because \nthey're perceived as  overpaid PlayStation operators, not cavalier risk \ntakers sticking the pedal to the metal and sawing at the  steering wheel. \nAnd MotoGP isn’t so  much lurching blindly down this same alley as \nhooning down it  at  full throttle, cackling maniacally into a  howling \n210mph gale. \nThe problem is  this: MotoGP is  effectively run by Japanese factory \nbosses, who treat the  championship as  an  R&D laboratory rather than \nas  an  entertainment arena, so  when the  four-stroke \nrules were originally thrashed out, no  one  wanted to \nban electronic rider aids. That would’ve been Luddite ‘Call me  a prophet \nheresy. ‘For us  MotoGP is an  experimental field, we of doom, but I see \ndon’t \nwant \nany \nrestrictions,’ \nsays \nHRC \nboss \nSuguru \nMotoGP \nbecoming \na \nKanazawa. \nWhich \nmeans \nthat \nbefore \nlong \nMotoGP \ntwo-wheeled \nFI’ \nriders will also be enjoying the  benefits of automatic \ngearboxes, semi-active suspension and god knows \nwhat \nelse. \nThe \nhi-tech \ngenie \nhas \nbeen \nlet \nout \nof \nthe \nbottle \nand \nthere's \nnot  much chance of putting it back. \nThere’s \nanother \nproblem. \nMotoGP \nbikes \nmay \none \nday \nbecome \ntoo \nrider-friendly \nbut \nthey \nare \nalready \ntoo \nfast, \nknocking \non \n220mph \nnow, \nso \nthe \nfactories \ndecreed \nthat \nfrom \n2007 \nengines \nwould \nbe \nshrunk \nfrom \n990cc \nto 800cc. \nIndeed \nMotoGP \nhas  \nalready \nstarted \nlimiting \nperformance: \nbikes \nmust \nnow \nrun  \nwith \n10 \nper \ncent \nless  \nfuel \nthan \nthey \nhad \nin \n2004, \nbut, \ninevitably, \nthey \nare  \nalready \nfaster \nand, \nironically, \nharder \nto  \nride. \n‘They're \nmore \naggressive \nbecause \nwe're \nrunning \nleaner \ncarburation,’ \nexplains \nworld \nchamp \nRossi. \n‘So \nthey \naren’t \nmore \nsafe, \nthey \nare \nmore \nunsafe.’ \nExcellent, \nI \nhear \nyou \nsay, \nso  \nwe  \nwill \nget  \nto  \nsee  \nRossi \nand \nhis  \npeers \nseriously \nsideways \nagain, \nafter \nall!  \nNah, \nengineers \nwill \nquickly \nfix  \nthat \n\n332 THE FAST STUFF \nwith more traction control. In the longer term, the 800cc motors will be \nmuch more peaky than the grunt-tastic nine-nineties and thus \nmassaged into usability by yet more electronic controls. They may also \nend up  being slower than Superbikes, to  begin with at  least. And the \nhigher-revving 800s —  18,000 or  19,000rpm perhaps —  will be  more \nstressed than the  990s and thus require replacing much more often, \nadding dramatically to  MotoGP’s already frightening costs. \nThese two factors —  ever-increasing complexity and spiralling costs \n—  will only benefit the richest and most clever factories, in other words, \nHonda. So  far  Yamaha is keeping up,  largely thanks to  the  genius of \none young man, Ducati too, but Suzuki and Kawasaki are still unable \nto  attract serious sponsorship because they show no  signs of  even \nbeginning to  trouble Honda. Meanwhile Aprilia has  been forced out  of \nthe series and Team Roberts is  down to  a  one-rider team and still \nstruggling. \nCall me  a prophet of doom, a techno-reactionary or just a balding ol’ \nfool, but  I see  MotoGP becoming a  two-wheeled Fl.  Which isn’t good. \nEpilogue: Told you so... \n\nCHAPTER 42 \nMAINLINING THE GREATEST DRUG \nKNOWN TO  MANKIND \nJune 2005 \nThe Isle of Man TT.  Nothing like it. In  1985 I jumped on  a Honda \nNS250R and won the 250 proddie TT, thanks in  part to  some \nclever tactics (skulduggery, if you prefer) \nUntil yuppie City traders on  six-figure bonuses arrived, the  1980s were \npretty skint in  Britain, which is  why production racing was British \nracing’s mania of the  moment. The traditional 250  and 500  GP  classes \nhad become too  costly, while Superbike, Supersport and Superstock \nhad yet  to  be  introduced, so  bog-stock racing made sense, especially \nsince the  race-replica craze had just kicked off. \nThe 1980s was the age of  the R:  Suzuki’s GSX-R750 and 1100, \nYamaha’s FZR750 and 1000, Kawasaki's GPz900R and Honda’s VFR750, \nbig  four-strokes that were built as  much for  the  racetrack as  for  the \nroad. And then there were the GP replicas, for the 1980s were \nsimultaneously the golden age and the last hurrah of  the high- \nperformance two-stroke, bikes like Suzuki’s RG250 and 500, Honda’s \nNS250R and NS400R, Kawasaki's KR-1, Yamaha’s TZR250 and \nRD500LC, all  following Yamaha’s 250 and 350 LCs that had taken \nbiking by storm in  1980 and 1981. \nFor  once the  Auto Cycle Union (UK racing’s governing body) had its \nfinger on  the  pulse, announcing the  return of production racing to  the \nIsle of Man TT  in  1984, a  decade after Triumph’s Slippery Sam Trident \ntriple had won the last proddie TT.  Production bikes on  the Island \nseemed a  perfect fit:  the world’s fastest road bikes on  the world’s \ngreatest road circuit. \nDuring \nthe  \nspring \nof \n’84, \nwhen \nI \nwas \na  \nspotty \nMotor \nCycle \nNews \nroad \ntester \nand \nPro-Am \nracer \n(Pro-Am \nwas \nan  \ninsane \nYamaha \nrace \nseries \nfor \nup-and-coming \nBritish \nyoungsters), \nI \nwas \nsummoned \ninto \nthe  \neditor's \noffice. \n‘We're \nsponsoring \nthe  \nproduction \nTT,  \nfancy \na \ngo?’ \nNo,  \nI \nsaid. \nTwo \n\n334 THE FAST STUFF \nheroes of my  teenage years —  Pat  Hennen and Tom Herron —  had been \ndone in by street circuits (Hennen suffered career-ending head injuries \non  the  Island while Herron died in  Ireland’s North West 200), plus I \nwas a bit of a crasher. Then J thought about it, two  weeks on  the Island, \nall  paid for  and not  much work... I got  on  the  phone to  Suzuki and \nblagged one of their latest RG250s. I wanted something nice and  slow \nbecause I’d  already decided that all  big bikes are  too  fast for  the  TT  — \nimagine full-throttling a  GSX-R1100 down your favourite mountain \nroad, in  sixth gear —  and that full-blown racers with lightweight this \nand that aren’t engineered to  be jumped off  humpback bridges at  80 \nmiles an  hour. \nI headed to  Douglas, the  Isle of  Man’s capital, a  few days before \npractice began, driving endless laps of the  38-mile course in a van with \nmy TT  tutors, fellow journalist Mac McDiarmid and classic racer \nAnthony Ainslie. With over 200  corners to learn, most of them fast  and \nlethal, with zero run-off, you need all the help you can  get because your \nfirst mistake will most likely be  your last. To  be \nhonest, the  place terrified me. I didn’t want to  race, \n‘My first sun-blessed so  I decided I’d  do  one practice lap, then go  home. \nearly morning But my  first sun-blessed early morning practice had \npractice had me me  hooked. Flat in top through a sleepy little village? \nhooked. Flat in top Just superb! \nthrough a sleepy I finished that year’s race in  third, behind winner \nlittle village? Just Phil Mellor’s suspiciously quick power-valve 250LC. \nsuperb!’ When I returned in ’85  I’d  used MCN clout to  secure \none of  a  batch of  Japanese-market-only NS250Rs \nthat Honda UK  had imported for  the  race. It was a \nbig leap forward from the  RG  and  RD  but  the competition was intense, \nwith Robert Dunlop (Joey’s brother), Gary Padgett and other young \nhotshots also on  NSRs. In  an  effort to  find an  advantage we  all  rode \nPro-Am-style, in  other words, pretty much out of  control. The 250s \nwere too  slow to allow you to make up time through the fastest sections, \nbecause you were already flat  out, chest bruised blue by the  fuel tank, \nso \nyou \nmade \nthe \ndifference \nscratching \nthrough \nslower \ncorners. \nOr \njumping the  infamous Ballaugh Bridge at  speeds that had the  local \ncommentators complaining that we  were being too  dangerous. \nOf  \ncourse, \nthere \nwere \nsome \nquick \nareas \nwhere \nyou \ncould \nmake \na \ndifference. \nI’d  \nmentally \nprepare \nfor \nthese \nmiles \nahead, \nknowing \nthat \nif \nI \n\nMAINLINING \nTHE \nGREATEST \nDRUG \nKNOWN \nTO  \nMANKIND \nBaD \ngot  \nthrough \nwithout \neasing \noff  \nI’d  \ncarry \nthat \nextra \nspeed \nfor  \nthe  \nnext \nmile \nor  \ntwo. \nRhencullen \nwas \nthe \nbest \n—  \nthe \nbuzz \nof \ngetting \nthat \njust \nright, \nflat \nin \nsixth, \nfront \nwheel \nairborne, \nhedgerow \nto \ndry-stone \nwall, \nwas \nwhat \nthe TT \nwas \nall \nabout. \nMainlining \nthe \ngreatest \ndrug \nknown \nto \nmankind. \nThen I found another way to  gain an  advantage. Most of us  felt  the \nNSR wouldn’t make the  three-lap race without a fuel stop. None of the \nother riders tried three laps in  practice because they were busy with \nother bikes, but  I had a go  and hatched a dastardly plan. We  filled the \nfuel tank upside down, through the tap aperture to ensure it was totally \nfull, then refitted the  tap. I rode three flat-out laps, stopping as  I came \ndown from Creg-ny-Baa for the third time, pretending I’d run  dry. Then \nI completed the lap at speed, as  if I’d begged some fuel from a spectator. \nThe news went round that the  NSR couldn’t make three laps, but  back \nin  our Douglas shed we  discovered I'd  still got  two litres left. It was \nworth the  risk. \nI led the  early stages of the race but  slowed too  much for a downpour, \nmy  old  Pro-Am rivals Padgett and Graeme Cannell (on  a  Yamaha RD) \nsneaking past as  we  headed up  the mountain. Both had started ten \nseconds behind me, so  my  hopes seemed doomed (the TT  course is  so \ndangerous that riders are  started at ten-second intervals, with race results \ndecided on  corrected time). We  spent another lap together, colliding once \nor  twice, Cannell’s riding verging on  the  homicidal. Usually these hard \nnuts beat me on  short circuits, but that day I had something in  me. I \npulled ahead on  the final lap, despite nearly losing it  when the NS \nsnapped sideways on  a damp patch at the  33rd, banked hard left, flat out \nin  sixth gear. Cannell finished ten  seconds down, Padgett (who hadn’t \nfallen for my  fuel ruse) crashed at  Governors’ Bridge. \nPost-race celebrations were a  panic. I’d  planned to  skip the  podium \nceremony \nbecause \nI \nhad \na \nflight \nto \ncatch. \nI \nhad \na \nroad \nbike \nparked \nby \nthe \npits \nto \nride \nto \nthe \nlocal \nairport \nto \nfly \nover \nthe \nIrish \nSea \nto \nLiverpool, \nwhere \nI’d \nparked \na \nGSX-R750 \nto \nride \nto \nLondon’s \nHeathrow \nairport, \nthen \nfly \nto \nMilan, \nwhere \nI \nwas \ncompeting \nin \nthat \nweekend’s \nMonza \nSix \nHours \nrace. \nBut \nI \ncouldn’t \nresist \nthe \npodium \nwhere \nme, \n750 \nwinner \nMick \nGrant \nand \n1300 \nvictor \nGeoff \nJohnson \nwere \ngreeted \nby \nleather-clad \ntarts \nfrom \nsoft-porn \nmag \nClub \nInternational. \nClassy. \nThen \nI \nlost \nmy \ntrousers \n(nothing \nto \ndo \nwith \nthe \ngirls). \nI \nwas \nlate \nfor \nthe \nflight, \nbut \nthey \nkindly \nheld \nthe \nplane. \nI \nsat \ndown, \nthe \nair \nhostess \ngave \nme \na \nglass \nof \nchampagne \nand \nI \nstarted \nblubbing. \nThe \nwhole \nthing \nhit \nme, \nmy \nbrother \n\n336 THE FAST STUFF \nJulian had died a  few weeks earlier and I’d  promised myself that if I \ndid win I’d  dedicate it to him. But I forgot. Twat. \nI was back again in ’86,  this time on  a TZR250, with promises of fat \nwin bonuses from bike manufacturers and tyre companies. The proddie \nTT had got big because success sold a lot of bikes and tyres. I was wined \nand dined at  the Island’s smartest restaurants by  marketing types \nanxious for  me  to  use  their stuff. People were taking the  racing much \nmore seriously, so  riders were riding harder, taking more risks. \nI never got close to winning in ’86 or  ’87,  then rode my last TT in 89, \ncontesting the new supersport 400 class, riding a  reverse-cylinder \nTZR250 with factory expansion chambers. The jetting was all  over the \nplace. Coming into Ramsey, my  mind occupied with the  carburation \nconundrum, I ran  way too  fast into the  Schoolhouse left-hander, wheels \nin  the  gutter, heart in  my  mouth. Nothing unusual, but the  sense of \ninvincibility that had stayed with me  since my  first TT  evaporated. \nThere and then I realised I didn’t want to  do this any  more. A few days \nlater I was at  the  Salzburgring, covering the  Austrian GP  and listening \nto  news of  the  Tianenmen Square uprising, when someone told me \nthat Mellor and Steve Henshaw had been killed in the  1300 production \nrace. And that was the  end of TT proddie racing. \nMotoGP Mutterings: July 2005 \nRubbing shoulders with the Shanghai glitterati on  the eve of \nthe first-ever Chinese MotoGP race \nBattered by  the Desmosedici’s demented roar, the crowd jostles for \nposition at  the  side of the racetrack, peering over each others’ shoulders \nfor a glimpse of the first contender. And here she comes, up the steps and \naround the slow right-hander, keeping it  tight and looking oh-so- \nstunning in a Ducati leather jacket, denim mini-skirt and Manolo Blahnik \nstilettos. The crowd screams its approval. Nope, this isn’t a MotoGP race, \nthis is  the launch party for  a  high-rolling’ Ducati clothing outlet in \ndowntown Shanghai on  the eve  of China’s first-ever bike GP. \nWe're stood on  the top floor of  a  glittering fashion emporium, \ngawping at  a  skyline that’s straight out of Bladerunner and watching \nmodels \nparading \nalong \na \nmini-racetrack \nthat \ncurves \naround \nthe \nterrace, \nsashaying \nto \na \npounding \nsoundtrack \nlaid \ndown \nby \na \nrenta-cool \nDJ, \nwho \n\nRUBBING \nSHOULDERS \nWITH \nTHE \nSHANGHAI \nGLITTERATI \n337 \nmixes \nDesmo \nsnarls \nwith \ndope \nbeats. \nWe're \nERs \na \nsurrounded \nby \nfashionistas, \nfat \nfinanciers \nand \n‘We're \nstood \non  \nthe \nferociously \nfit \nfemales. \nFactory \nDucati \nriders \nLoris \ntop \nfloor \nof \na \nCapirossi \nand \nCarlos \nCheca \nhave \nlong \ndeparted \nfor \nglittering \nfashion \ntheir \nhotel \nrooms. \nThe \nair \nis \nfilled \nwith \na \ncurious \nemporium, \nwhiff \n— \nthe \nseductive \nscent \nof \nChanel \nNo \n5 \nmixed \nsurrounded \nby \nwith \nthe \nstench \nof \nserious \nmoney. \nfashionistas, \nfat \nIn \ncase \nyou \nhadn’t \nalready \nheard, \nChina \nis \nboomtown. \nfinanciers \nand \nThe \ndragon \nhas \nawakened \nfrom \nits \nhalf-century \nferociously \nfit \nCommunist snooze to  strike terror into western females’ \neconomies.

It’s  like the \nStarship Enterprise, which would make Donington Park a  14-foot dinghy \nwith a leaky hull. The gargantuan grandstand/pit complex is a national \nstatement of intent: check us  out, see  what we  can do:  ‘Look on  my \nworks, ye Mighty, and despair’. \nSo  China has a  world-class racetrack and tens of millions of rinky- \ndink motorcycles. Next is  a MotoGP bike. China’s Zongshen factory is \nnow planning to enter MotoGP with its own V4. One of the most go-ahead \nnames in China’s dynamic bike industry, Zongshen produces 1.2  million \nmotorcycles annually and is soon to launch its  first hi-tech streetbike. \nThe \nman \nbehind \nthis \nheadlong \nrush \ninto \nbike \nracing’s \nbig  \ntime \nis, \ncuriously \nenough, \na  \nFrenchman. \nMichel \nMarqueton \ncame \nto  \nChina \nten \nyears \nago \nafter \nmarrying \na \nChinese \nlady \nwho \njust \nhappens \nto \nbe \na \nsenior \nofficial \nin \nthe \nmilitary. \nAn \nendurance \nracer \nin \nEurope, \nhe \nwas \nsoon \nspectating \nat \nillegal \nChinese \nstreet \nraces \n— \nwild \naffairs \ninvolving \nserious \ngambling, \nrider \nfatalities \nand \nthe \ninevitable \narrival \nof \ntruncheon- \nwielding \ncops. \nItching \nto \nget \nback \ninto \nthe \nsport, \nMarqueton \nadopted \nthe \nquickest \nstreet \nracers \nand \ntrained \nthem \non \ngo-kart \ntracks \nuntil \nthey \nwere \nunbeatable \nin \nthe \nnascent \nnational \nchampionships. \nThe \nChinese \nMotorsport \nAssociation \ngot \ninterested \nand \nhelped \nMarqueton \nthrash \nout \na \nfour-stage \nplan \nfor \nworld \ndomination. \n~—— ee ee ee \n\n338 THE FAST STUFF \nStage one: establish a team to win China’s first world title. Job done \n—  Marqueton’s Zongshen-backed, GSX-R1000-equipped squad won the \n2002 world endurance crown with western riders. Stage two: create a \nChinese world champion. Marqueton currently has  a couple of teenage \nChinese contesting several 250 GPs. Stage three: build an  all-Chinese \nmotorcycle to  win MotoGP. Stage four: create a  Chinese world champ \non  the  same bike. \nAnyone who laughs at  these ambitions should recall how people \nguffawed at  Soichiro Honda’s little 125s when they first arrived on  the \nIsle of Man in 1959. And anything Japan can  do, China can  do better, not \nleast because its workforce is ten  times as  big. The economies of scale are \nobvious —  brand-new 50cc scooters were on  sale near our  hotel for £150. \nChina’s industry seems unstoppable. Globalisation was born to allow \ncorporations to shift money around the world in search of cheap labour, \nand since Chinese factory workers earn £15 a  week, why would a \nbusinessman build a factory in the west where he’d have to pay workers \n10 or  20  times as  much? Tragic as  it is, that’s why it’s  so  over for Rover. \nFor  many westerners globalisation will mean you can  buy a dirt-cheap \nmicrowave or  motorcycle, but you don’t have a job. \nAs  the  Ducati party reaches its climax, the  DJ  slips in a  few tunes of \nwhich the  Armani-clad new masters of the  universe wouldn’t approve \n—  some Sex  Pistols and Ian  Dury’s sex  and drugs and rock and roll. But \nthe  ex-pat bankers don’t seem to  notice, they've already got  their arms \naround the  local lovelies... \nMotoGP Mutterings: september 2005 \nIdiot racetrack designers are spoiling our enjoyment of racing, \nwhat to  do  about it? \n‘There \nare \nonly \nthree \nsports: \nbullfighting, \nmotor \nracing \nand \nmountaineering; \nall  \nthe \nrest \nare \nmerely \ngames,’ \nsaid \nhard-drinking \nwriter \nErnest \nHemingway. \nI’m  \nassuming \nthat \nthe  \noriginal \n20th \ncentury \nman’s \nman \nwould’ve \nincluded \nbikes \nwithin \nmotor \nracing \nbecause \nbike \nracers \nare  \nat  \nleast \nas  \nrough \n‘n’  \ntough \nas  \nmatadors, \nmountain \nclimbers \nand \nmotor \ncar \nracers. \nHemingway's \nwords \ncame \nto \nme  \nduring \nMotoGP’s \nlong-awaited \nand \nmuch-hyped \nreturn \nto  \nLaguna \nSeca \nfor  \nthe  \n2005 \nUS  \nGP.  \nLaguna \nis  \na \n\nIDIOT \nRACETRACK \nDESIGNERS \nARE \nSPOILING \nOUR \nENJOYMENT \n339 \nscary racetrack, way more dangerous than anywhere else that Rossi \nand Co  ply their trade. It’s  America’s Brands Hatch, plunging up  and \ndown like a rollercoaster, a proper Wild West ride in pretty Californian \nscenery, some of which is way too  close for  comfort. It’s  the  kind of \nplace where you  feel proper awe watching riders do their thing, because \nyou know the  consequences of a mistake would be very messy. Winner \nNicky Hayden was genuinely awesome to  behold through Laguna’s \nnotorious Turn One —  a  160mph left-hander over the  brow of a  hill  — \ndrifting both wheels at  full lean, regardless of  the cliff face a  few \nyards away. \nI feel a little uneasy that I’m  so  entertained by watching riders attack \nthat kind of  corner, which tests their skill and even more so  their \nbravery to  the  very limit. I hate to  admit it but  I find that much more \nfun than watching the  world’s fastest, most fearless riders perfectly \nexecute Valencia’s Turn Two, or  Three, or  Four, or  Five, or  Six, or  Seven, \nor  pretty much any other second- or  third-gear corner at  Losail, \nShanghai, Motegi, Rockingham, Oschersleben, Lausitzring or  any other \nrecently constructed glorified go-kart track. \nSo  what am  I on  about, taking the British GP  back to  the Isle of \nMan? Obviously not. But I reckon someone needs to  do  something \nbefore all  racetracks are soulless ribbons of  tarmac, dominated by \nidentikit slow-to-medium-slow corners that are merely a  game of \ntechnique and technology, rather than the  sport of balls and bravery. \nWhat do the  designers of these places think they’re doing? \nWell, the German architects who laid out Shanghai created the \ncircuit \nin \nthe \nshape \nof \nthe \nChinese \ncharacter \nShang \n(meaning \n‘above’, \nwhich \nis \nthe \norigin \nof \nthe \nport \ncity’s \nname, \nShanghai \nor \n‘above \nthe \nocean’). \nLovely \nconcept, \nguys, \nbut \nthey’ve \nended \nup \nwith \na \nmind- \nnumbing \nlayout. \nThere’s \nnot \none \ncorner \nat \nShanghai \nyou’d \never \nlook \nforward \nto \nriding \naround. \nSame \nwith \nLosail \n(in \nQatar), \nwhich \nthe \ndesigners \ncreated \nby \nlinking \ntogether \na \ndozen \ndifferent \ncorners \nfrom \nother \ntracks. \nAgain, \nnice \nidea, \nbut \nthey’ve \nbuilt \na \nsoulless, \nformulaic \ntrack \nwhere \nthe \ncorners \nare \nindistinguishable \nfrom \none \nanother. \nYou \ncan \nspend \na \nwhole \nweekend \nwatching \npractice \nand \nracing \nat \nLosail \nand \nstill \nnot \nrecognise \none \ncorner \nfrom \nthe \nnext. \nI \nfeel \nwe \nshould \ncondemn \nthese \npeople \nto \npurgatory, \nwhere \nthey \nshall \nride \nlaps \nof \ntheir \nown \nsorry \ncreations \nfor \neternity, \nforever \nforbidden \nto \ntake \na \nleak. \nIronically, \na \nlot \nof \nriders \nagree. \nThey \nwant \nsafety \nbut  \nthey \nalso \nwant \na \n\n340 THE FAST STUFF \nchallenge and a thrill, as  Neil Hodgson says: ‘I hate tracks like Valencia, \nplaces like that are  glorified car  parks.’ British 250 rider Chaz Davies \nalso likes ‘ballsy corners, the  stuff you’ve got  to  really grit your teeth \nfor, that’s what you  get the biggest adrenalin rush from.’ Mick Doohan \nwas the  same —  his fave corner was at the old  Salzburgring —  a daunting \n180mph_ right-left twister with zero runoff, Armco one side, \nmountainside the  other. ‘I know it’s  dangerous,’ he said. ‘But to me  it’s \neverything racing is about.’ \nYes, racing is about speed, which doesn’t mean a \nsecond gear corner, shift to  third and then fourth, \n‘I know it’s back to  second for  the next turn, up  to  third then \ndangerous, but to me back to  first for  the  hairpin. It means a  few slowish \nit’s everything racing turns, plenty of medium-to-fast corners and a  long \nis about’ straight. And shite racetracks aren’t just boring to \nz ride around, they also promote processional racing \nbecause they don’t have the  kind of  corners where \nriders can  stay close and they don’t have long enough straights to allow \nslipstreaming. You always get  the  closest, most exciting racing at  fast, \nopen and epic tracks like Phillip Island, Mugello, Catalunya and Sepang. \nThose last two are  both modern venues, designed in  the  ‘90s, which \nproves that inspired, intelligent track designers can still produce fast \nyet  safe layouts. Sadly I haven’t got  a  clue how we  stop this pox of \nhumdrum racetracks spreading across the  globe. Have you? \n\nCHAPTER 43 \nGOD’S GREAT \nLEVELLER \nNovember 2005 \nSome racers call it the great leveller —  when it pours, the rain \nlets some riders really shine. Here’s three of  the finest wet \nweather rides in bike racing history \nChristian Sarron sinks Fast Freddie, Hockenheim, 19 May 1985 \nWhen Christian Sarron beat Freddie Spencer in  the  rain-soaked 1985 \nGerman GP  it was a  big deal. Fast Freddie was at  the  top  of his  game, \non  his  way to  winning a  unique 250/500 title double and revered as \nsome kind of  riding god. On  the Continent they called him ET,  the \nExtra Terrestrial. \nSarron’s 500 career is  remembered for  that single victory and a \nmultitude of  scary crashes. The all-dominant Americans —  Spencer, \nEddie Lawson and Randy Mamola —  loathed him \nbecause he was so  dangerous. \nWet-weather racing is  more about risk than dry- ‘I couldn't see \ntrack \nracing, \nwhich \nis \nwhy \nSarron \nexcelled, \nthe \nnutty \nwhere \nI \nwas \ngoing \nFrenchman \nusually \nprepared \nto \npush \nfurther \ninto \nthe \nand \nsuddenly \ndanger \nzone. \nThis \nwas \nespecially \ntrue \nat \nHockenheim, \nI \nwas \non \nthe \ngrass. \nwhere \nblinding \nspray \nhung \nover \nthe \n190mph \nOops!’ \nautobahn-like \nstraights, \nunable \nto \nescape \nthrough \neg \nthe \nsurrounding \nforests. \n‘You \ncouldn’t \neven \nsee  \nwhere \nyou \nput \nyour \nwheels, \nyou \njust \nknew \nthe \ntrack \nfrom \npractice,’ \nrecalls \nSarron, \nwho \nhad \ngot \nhis \nusual \nbad \nstart. \n‘I \nwas \n24th \nand \nI \nwas \npassing \nguys \nwithout \neven \nseeing \nwho \nthey \nwere. \nI \npassed \nLawson \nwithout \nnoticing \nbut \nthere \nwas \nless \nspray \nup \nfront, \nthen \nthere \nwas \nFreddie. \nI \ncarried \non \nriding \nmy \nrhythm, \non \nthe \nedge, \nsliding \neverywhere, \nand \npassed \nhim. \nI \nsaw \nmy \npit \nboard \nand \nthought \n“is \nthis \nreally true?” \nOf \ncourse, \nSarron \nhas \nhis \nown \ntheories \nregarding \nhis \nwinning \nwet- \n\n342 THE FAST STUFF \nweather prowess. ‘The rider can  make more difference in  the  wet,’ he \nsays. ‘It’s always hard to  find the limit in the rain, you need to find the \nfront limit on  brakes and into corners. Most riders don’t have front \nconfidence, it’s  easy to  find the  rear limit.’ \nAt  Hockenheim Sarron also enjoyed a  tyre advantage because his \nstock Michelin wets were harder than Spencer’s trick development \ntyres, so  they didn’t get  shredded by the  long straights. \nA few weeks later Sarron pissed off Spencer again, too  keen to repeat \nhis  German GP  success at  a rain-lashed Assen. ‘I couldn’t see  where I \nwas and suddenly I was on  the  grass. Ooops, that’s bad. By the  time I \nwas back on  the  tarmac it was too  late for  the  brakes into the  next \ncorner. I took Freddie’s front wheel with my  footpeg. I was very cross \nwith myself. I’d been 20th at  the  first corner, then sixth after half a lap, \nmaybe it was a little crazy...’ \nRossi walks on  water, Donington, 24  July 2005 \nFor aman who once said ‘I don’t like riding under the water’, Valentino \nRossi usually makes a  pretty good fist of  walking on  the stuff. His \nwinning ride at the  2005 British GP was one of his most awe-inspiring, \nindeed he rates the race as  one  of the most difficult of his career, simply \nbecause conditions were so  appalling. Donington was so  badly flooded \nthat riders had to  deal with both ends aquaplaning. \n‘That race was not  like  riding a bike,’ says Rossi. ‘It was like riding a \nboat because there was a  lot  of  water between the  wheels and the \ntrack, so  always spinning the rear and locking the front.’ [See also \nChapter 53.] \nHis  secret was to wait for his rain tyres to warm up,  then suss out  the \nconditions before pushing to  victory. ‘Biaggi crashed in  front of  me, \nthen Gibernau, there were a lot of people making mistakes, also me, so \nI preferred to wait.’ At half-distance, after several scary moments of his \nown, Rossi put the hammer down, clearing off  from nearest rivals \nKenny Roberts Junior and Alex Barros by more than two seconds a lap \neven though he had no  tyre advantage. \nAlthough Rossi was a  ropey 250 wet-weather men he  got  much \nbetter when he  graduated to  500s, preferring the  bigger bikes’ fatter \ntyres and torque curves. Indeed he  scored his  debut 500 GP  win at  a \nwet Donington in  2000 and the  first-ever MotoGP race at  a  soaking \nSuzuka, 2002. Like everything else, he  puts it  all  down to  practice. \n\nGOD’S GREAT LEVELLER 343 \n‘Riding on  water is not  easy, to  go fast in that condition is important to \nhave a good feeling with the  bike. In one  year we  make almost 25,000 \nkilometres, maybe 24,500 in dry, maybe 500  in the wet, so  you need to \narrive step by step for have a better feeling with the  bike. \n‘At  the  start of 2004 the  M1  was a disaster in  the  wet, so  we  make \nsome practice, then the bike coming better and now we  are  fast. I don’t \nlike the  water but I’m a racer so  I need to  go fast in any condition.’ \nCrew chief Jeremy Burgess doesn’t reckon Rossi has any particular \nwet-weather skills: “What makes Valentino good in the wet is probably \nwhat makes him good in  the dry —  maybe his  reflexes and motor \nneurons are  quicker than the  other guys’.’ \nMichael Rutter makes a  splash with WSB podium, Brands, \n3 August 1997 \nWhen Brummie Michael Rutter turned up  for  the 1997 Brands WSB \nround he  was a little-known BSB rider. By  the  time he  left the  Kent \ncircuit he’d beaten Carl Fogarty and John Kocinski to  the  chequered \nflag in front of 100,000 fans, thanks to  a  British summer downpour. \nJust 24  at  the  time, Rutter had already gained a  reputation as  a  rain \nrider. ‘I enjoy the  rain because I know everyone else probably doesn’t, so \nit’s  like, great, it’s  raining!’ he  says. ‘My dad (multiple TT winner Tony) \nwas \nthe \nbiggest \nhelp, \nhe \nenjoyed \nthe \nwet \ntoo, \nso \nthat \nrubbed \noff \non \nme, \nplus \nhe \nhelped \nme \nset \nup \nthe \nbike \nso \nit’s \nnice \nto \nride, \njust \nmaking \nit \na \nlot \nsofter \nso \nyou've \ngot \nfeel. \nIt \nmoves \naround \nmore \nbut \nyou've \ngot \na \ngauge.’ \nRutter \nwasn’t \nexpecting \nmuch \nfrom \nBrands, \njust \nsneaking \ninto \nthe \ntop \nten \naboard \nhis \nV&M-prepped \nRC45 \nwould’ve \nbeen \nan \nachievement. \nHe \nfinished \nrace \none \nin \ntwelfth \nand \nwas \nin \na \nsimilar \nposition \nin \nrace \ntwo \nwhen \nthe \nheavens \nopened. \nThe \nrace \nwas \nstopped \nand \nrestarted, \nwith \nthe \neventual \nresult \nto \nbe \ndecided \non \ncombined \ntimes. \n‘After \nthe  \nrestart \nit \nwas \npissing \ndown. \nI'd  \nstarted \nfrom \nthe  \nthird \nrow \nand \njust \npicked \nmy  \nway \nthrough. \nIt  \nwas \nnice \npassing \nsome \nof \nthe  \nbig \nboys, \nthen \nI \ngot \nup \nbehind \nFoggy. \nThat \nwas \na \nfantastic \nfeeling \nbecause \nhe \nwas \na \nbit \nof \na \nsuperstar \nto \nme, \nbut \nI \nwas \nthinking \n“God, \nI \ndon’t \nwant \nto \ntake \nhim \nout”, \nso \nit \ntook \nme \na \nfew \nlaps \nto \npluck \nup \ncourage \nto \npass \nhim. \nAfter \nthat, \nit \nwas \ngood \nto \ndo \nKocinski \nbecause \nhe \nwas \non \nthe \nfactory \nRC45 \nand \nthe \nthing \nI \nwas \non \nwas \na \npiece \nof \nscrap.’ \nRutter \ntook \nthe  \nchequered \nflag \nin  \nfirst, \ncombined \ntimes \nputting \nhim \nthird, \nand \nhe \nlooked \noverawed \nas  \nhe \njoined \nFogarty \nand \nKocinski \non  \nthe \n\n344 THE FAST STUFF \npodium. ‘We were all using Michelin wets, though I didn’t get the  trick \nstuff they had. But maybe my  bike was better than theirs in  the  wet. \nAfter riding the  HRC Fireblade the  last  couple of years I reckon factory \nbikes are  bloody hard to  ride in  the  wet, just because they’ve got  so \nmuch power.’ \nRutter has  straightforward advice for wet-weather riding. ‘Be  smooth \nand relaxed, don’t hold on  too  tight, the  bike will move around but \nyou've just got  to  flow with it.’ \n\nCHAPTER 44 \n“RON WOULD ROCKET PAST, \nHANGING ON  FOR GRIM DEATH \nDecember 2005 \nLike a Phoenix arising from the ashes of the British motorcycle \nindustry, the JPS Norton rotary and riders like Ron Haslam \nscored some of the most unlikely successes in racing history \nWhen Imperial Tobacco returned to  bike racing in  the  late 1980s it \nswapped the  red  white and blue of  its  1970s John Player brand for \nJohn Player Special black and gold. The colours weren't as  patriotic but \nthat didn’t matter because the JPS  Norton rotary was a more successful \nmotorcycle than its  twin-cylinder predecessor. The bike won three \nBritish championships and dozens of races over four seasons, its success \nhugely magnified by the  fact that it was so  unexpected. \nWhen JPS Norton riders Trevor Nation and Steve Spray lined up  for \nthe  RCW588’s first serious season in  1989 the  British bike industry was \npresumed dead and buried. Nation, Spray and later Robert Dunlop, \nTerry Rymer and Ron Haslam proved otherwise and in doing so  brought \ncrowds thronging back to British circuits in a patriotic \nferment. Everyone, from the fans to  the riders, \nseemed touched by  the success of  this super-fast ‘I'd  never dreamed \nBritish underdog that ate Hondas, Suzukis, Kawasakis I'd  be racing a \nand \nYamahas \nfor \nbreakfast. \ncompetitive \nBritish \n‘Y’d \nnever \ndreamed \nthat \nI'd \nget \nto \nrace \na \ncompetitive \nbike \nbut  \nI \nwas \nand \ni \nBritish \nbike \nbut  \nI \ndid  \nand \nit \nwas \na  \nbloody \nbig \nthrill \n— \nwas \na  \nbloody \nbig \nI \nwas \nso  \nbloody \nproud,’ \nrecalls \nNation, \nwho \nwon \nthe \nthrill \n—  \nI \nwas \nso \nRCW588’s \nfirst \nbig \nrace \nin  \nAugust \n1988, \nshortly \nbloody \nproud’ \nbefore \nJPS \ngot \ninvolved. \n‘I \nremember \none \nof \nmy \nfirst \nqe \nwins \nat \nMallory. \nI’d \njust \ngot \nthe \nlead \nand \nas \nI \ncame \nthrough \nDevils \nElbow \nthe \nwhole \nflipping \nbank \nseemed \nto  \nmove, \neveryone \nwas \nshouting \nand \ncheering, \nthey \nall \ngot \nsucked \nalong \nby \nthe \nNorton, \nit \nwas \nsomething \nBritish. \nI \nmean, \nI \nhate \ncricket \nbut \nwhen \n\n346 THE FAST STUFF \nEngland are  doing well I watch, so  if you’re half interested in bikes and \nthere’s a British bike doing well...’ \nThe drama was only intensified by the fact that the JPS \nNorton seemed to  come out of  nowhere. British racing had been \ndominated by Japanese machinery for  almost two decades and all of a \nsudden Norton was winning again. The RCW588’s unlikely existence \nwas thanks to  the  vision of Brian Crighton, who joined Norton to  look \nafter its  rotary police bikes, the fruit of  a  licence bought from NSU \nin  1972. \n‘I  told Norton this engine could go  really well in  racing but they \nthought I was mad,’ says Crighton, who began tuning a  scrap police \nbike in  his  own time. ‘I  couldn’t get  anyone interested until it did \n170mph at  MIRA. It all went from there, they kicked the  caretaker out \nof his  house and let me  have that as  the  race shop.’ \nWith a  tiny budget from Norton’s new owner, investment banker \nPhilip Le  Roux, Crighton got  Spondon to build a chassis and, following \nthe  bike’s first victories, started hunting for  serious sponsorship. ‘We \nthought we’d try John Player because the  link was already there. They \ncame to  Brands when Steve won his  first two races on  the  bike, they \nsaw the  crowd go mad and that clinched the  deal.’ \nOver the next four years the JPS  Norton was British racing’s jewel in \nthe crown, even when it  wasn’t winning. Of  course, not everyone \nloved the  bike. There were various theories about how to  measure a \nrotary’s capacity, and plenty of rivals believed that Norton was cut  too \nmuch slack by  the ACU and FIM, who fully realised its  value to \nbike racing. \n‘It  was mental fast,’ remembers Yamaha rider Rob McElInea, who \nraced against the  rotary for  several years, beating Haslam to  the 91 \ntitle. ‘When you were racing you thought “that fucking thing shouldn’t \nbe \non \nthe \ntrack, \nit’s \nnot \nlegal”. \nYou’d \nbe \nsqueezing \nbehind \nthe \nscreen \nand \nRon \nwould \ncome \nrocketing \npast, \nhanging \non \nfor \ngrim \ndeath, \nlaughing \nlike \nmad. \nBut \nyou \nput \nup \nwith \nit \nbecause \nit \ndragged \nin \nthe \ncrowds. \nBritish \nracing \nwas \non \nits \narse, \nthen \nthe \nNorton \ncame \nalong \nand \ngot everybody into it again.’ \nIt \nwasn’t \njust \nthe  \nbike’s \namazing \nspeed \nthat \nmade \npeople \njealous \n— \nJPS \npumped \nin \nproper \nmoney \nand \nushered \nmodern-day \nsponsorship \npractices \ninto \nBritish \nbike \nracing \nwith \na \nvery \nglitzy \noperation. \nMcElInea \nagain: \n‘They \nhad \ndouble \nthe \nset-up \nanyone \nelse \nhad \nand \nthey \nput \nas \n\n“RON \nWOULD \nROCKET \nPAST, \nHANGING \nON  \nFOR \nGRIM \nDEATH \n347 \nmuch \nmoney \ninto \npromotions \nas  \nthey \ndid  \ninto \nracing. \nThey \nwere \nthe \nfirst \nto \nhave \nreplica \nbikes \nin \nspectator \nareas \nand \ntake \nthe \nwhole \nshow \nto \nshopping \nprecincts.’ \nSo  how much money did  JPS spend? It was certainly a  significant \ninvestment. ‘Their contributions more or  less kept Norton going, apart \nfrom the aircraft engine sales,’ reckons Barry Symmonds, who managed \nthe team from 1990. One source reckons Imperial Tobacco spent £1 \nmillion over the  first three years. \nUnfortunately, the  money didn’t always make for  a  happy, united \nteam. Crighton and Symmonds clashed badly, prompting Crighton to \nquit and develop other rotary racers. ‘The whole thing was tainted by a \nlot of silly squabbles,’ remembers Nation, who was dropped at  the  end \nof  1991. ‘I  always said what I thought and maybe I wasn’t tactful \nenough, but a spade is a spade —I don’t know what else you're supposed \nto call it. The worst thing was the converted Koni car  shock, I was never \na fan  of copying the  front of  a Formula Ford and sticking it on  the back \nof a motorbike.’ \nThe final 1992 Norton rotary was almost certainly the  most effective. \nIt used a  new motor from the  FI  road bike and was renamed NRS588 \n(for Norton Racing Services), for the  simple reason that Norton needed \na  logo that looked like JPS, because tobacco logos had been banned \nfrom the  BBC-broadcast British championship. \nJPS enjoyed massive media coverage from its  Norton adventure but \nmissed the rotary’s most famous victory. Island genius Steve Hislop \nsigned to  ride the  bike in  the  ‘92  TT  but  JPS weren’t involved because \nthey were frightened by the TT’s safety record. Hislop rode an  all-white \nNRS to  victory in the  Senior, Norton’s first TT  success since 1961. \nJPS pulled out at  the  end of ‘92. ‘The deal had run its  course and \nanti-tobacco \nrestrictions \nwere \ngetting \ntougher,’ \nsays \nSymmonds. \nImperial \nmay \nalso \nhave \nbeen \nconcerned \nby \nallegations \nof \nfraud \nwithin \nthe \nNorton \nMotors \ngroup, \nwhich \ntriggered \na \nDepartment \nof \nTrade \nand \nIndustry \ninvestigation \nthat \nresulted \nin \nconvictions \nfor \nLe \nRoux \nand \nseveral of his  coterie. \nDespite \nthe  \nmarque \nbeing \nsold \nonce \nagain \nin  \n1993 \n(and \non  \nmyriad \noccasions \nsince), \nthe \nNorton \nname \ncontinued \nto \nenjoy \nracetrack \nsuccesses, \nIan \nSimpson \nwinning \nthe \n'94 \nBritish \ntitle \non \na \nCrighton \nrotary. \nBut \nthe \nDuckhams-backed \nmachines \nnever \nexcited \nthe \nBritish \ncrowds \nlike \nthe \nJPS \nbikes \nhad \ndone. \n\n348 THE FAST STUFF \nMotoGP Mutterings: December 2005 \nWhat have Biaggi’s hairpiece, Gibernau’s voodoo curse, Phillip \nIsland and Led Zep got in common? \nAssen, as  you may know, used to  be  MotoGP’s fastest, most hallowed \nribbon of biking tarmac —  outrageously fast, totally challenging. But \nnot  any  more, not  since the  day after September’s World Supers round \nwhen bulldozers rumbled in  to  desecrate the  place, turning half the \nDutch track into an  entertainment mall and car  park. \nWay to  go,  dudes. \n‘Looks like we  need Which means Phillip Island is  now MotoGP’s \nto call Ghostbusters’ fastest venue and the best place in the world to watch \nmotorcycle racing. Perched off Australia’s south-east \ncoast, a  bit  like they took the  old  and insanely fast \nSilverstone and dragged it to  a clifftop on  the  north coast of Cornwall, \nPhillip Island is a wide-fucking-open primal scream of a racetrack. If it \nwere a  band it would be  The Ramones, Led Zeppelin and The White \nStripes all rock ’n’  rolled into one. Which would make the  emasculated \nAssen The Ramones unplugged, with Ronan Keating on  vocals. \nBike racers love Phillip Island because it’s  crazy fast —  just gas  it up \nand bank it over. As  Nicky Hayden says, ‘it’s  got a lot of fast corners and \nthat’s what we  like  to do —  go fast around corners’, while Colin Edwards \nadmits ‘it  scares the shit out of  you’. This year the place claimed \nCapirossi (chest injuries) and Roberts Junior (broken wrist) but \nValentino Rossi looked more relaxed than ever —  all tangly Medusa hair \nand bad-boy swagger —  because he  knows that this is  the  ultimate \nrider’s track and therefore his  track. No one  else stands a chance on  the \nIsland. Rossi has  won every year since 2001. \nIn  the  middle of  the  Island’s Portakabin paddock, we're in  one of \nRossi’s media chat sessions. We  get  to  asking him about the  curse he \nallegedly inflicted on  Sete Gibernau at  the 2004 Qatar GP where Honda \nnotoriously had Rossi sent to  the  back of  the grid, since when the \nSpaniard has  apparently lost  the  ability to win. At  first Vale hasn’t got \na  clue what we’re going on  about, he’s looking at  us  like we’re nuts, \nthen his  face brightens into a  big, evil grin as  he  mimics the act  of \nstuffing needles into a  voodoo doll. Poor Sete, what can he  do,  his \ndeadly rival isn’t just superhuman, he’s actually supernatural. No \nwonder Aussie fans call  him Sete GiveltUpNow. \n\na \nBIAGGI'S \nHAIRPIECE, \nGIBERNAU’S \nVOODOO \nCURSE \nAND \nLED \nZEP \n349 \nPersonally, \nI \nthink \nit \nmay \nhave \nhad \nless \nto  \ndo  \nwith \nwicked \nwitches \nand \nmore \nto  \ndo  \nwith \nhair \ncrimes. \nLike \nsome \nkind \nof  \n21st-century \nSampson, \nthe \nmore \nout \nof \ncontrol \nValentino’s \nhair \ngets, \nthe \nmore \ninvincible \nhe \nbecomes, \nwhile \nthe \nmore \n‘Hollywood’ \nGibernau \nand \nMax \n‘Roman \nEmperor’ \nBiaggi \npreen \nthemselves, \nthe \nslower \nthey \nbecome. \nBiaggi, \nfor \nexample, \nnow \nwears \na \nhairpiece \nto \nhide \nhis \nbalding \npate. \nI \nkid \nyou \nnot. \nAs \nfar \nas \nI’m \naware \nhe’s \nthe \nfirst \nGP \nracer \nwith \na \nrug, \nthough \nMike \nHailwood \ndid \nhang \nout \nback \nin \nthe \n’60s \nwearing \na hippie \nwig \nand \nLennon \nshades, \njust \nfor \na laugh. \nWhatever, Gibernau’s Tory boy locks may be a lesser tonsorial crime \nthan Biaggi’s rug but they have been punished mercilessly. His  2005 \nseason was an  accursed summer of  doom, less Hollywood, more \nHammer House of Horror. \nHe  crashed out  of  five races, which makes Kevin Schwantz at  his \nmost crash-happy seem steady and circumspect. And when Gibernau \nwasn’t eating dirt, he  seemed equally doomed. At Jerez Rossi rammed \nhim into the  gravel after he’d led  the  whole race. In  Germany he  lost \nthe  lead after being distracted by his  team extravagantly applauding \nhim from the  pit wall, with one lap still to  go.  At  Brno his  RCV ran  dry \non  the final lap  while he  contested the lead with his  tousle-haired \nnemesis. In Qatar he threw away victory with another gravel excursion. \nGibernau’s crew chief Juan Martinez knows something sinister is afoot: \n‘Looks like we  need to  call  Ghostbusters,’ he  says. \nSo  what killed Sete Gibernau GP  winner? Was it Rossi voodoo? Or \ndid  he just get  too  worked up  about needing to  beat his  bitterest rival? \nOr  did  his  head really go  to  Hollywood? Or  was it the  hair? Whatever \nthe  reason, Gibernau’s disastrous 2005 proves how easy it is for  riders \nto  lose that winning edge. Winning racers don’t stop winning because \nthey forget how to  ride, they stop winning because something’s \ndisturbed their psyche, destroying their mental focus. Only Gibernau \nknows what’s gone wrong in his  head, or  maybe even he doesn’t. \nEpilogue: \nIn  \n2006 \nGibernau \nhad \na  \nDucati, \nthe  \nfastest \nbike \nin \nMotoGP, \nbut \nhe \ngot \nhurt. \nAt \nthe \nfinal \nrace \nCasey \nStoner \nknocked \nhim \noff, \nbreaking \nthe \nSpaniard’s \ncollarbone \nagain, \nthen \nnicked \nhis \nDucati \nride \nfor \n2007. \nTough \nluck, \nhuh? \n\nCHAPTER 45 \nCROZ, LAST OF  THE GREAT \nALL-ROUNDERS \nMarch 2006 \nGraeme Crosby was the last racer to  successfully combine \nthe contrasting demands of GP  racing and the Isle of Man TT. \nHe  was also the man who introduced Superbike-style racing \nto  Britain. \nBack in  the  old  days, looking cool and going fast was all  about the \nracing tuck. You weren't part of  café-racing society unless you were \ncrouched over the  front, hanging onto a set  of low-slung clip-ons or  ace \n‘bars. At  least that’s the  way it was until New Zealand nutter Graeme \nCrosby turned up  at  Brands Hatch in May 1979. \nThe inimitable Croz turned British racing on  its  head, beating the \nnation’s best on  his ratty, US-style ‘sit-up-and-beg’ Moriwaki Kawasaki \nand showing British bikers a whole new way of going fast. Fans adored \nhim for his  speed on  the  track and his  devil-may-care antics off it. \nThe lairy Kiwi may have been Britain’s Superbike revolutionary but \nhe was so  much more than that. In an  international career that burned \nbright but  short, Croz became the only rider in history to win the  Isle  of \nMan, the  Daytona 200 and the  Suzuka Eight Hours. He  was also the \nlast  man to  successfully straddle the  increasingly different demands of \nTT  and GP  racing, winning TTs  and scoring GP  podiums within weeks \nof each other in  1981. And although he  never quite won a  500 GP.  he \nfinished second in  the 1982 world championship, ahead of  Freddie \nSpencer, King Kenny Roberts and Barry Sheene. And all  this while \nenjoying a  reputation as  a  carouser who could start a  party anywhere \nand strike terror into the  hearts of rentacar staff the  world over. \nOf course, Croz never planned to do most of this, his career just evolved \norganically. And when he  was at  the  height of his  powers at  the  end of \n‘82,  he went and quit. For  a naturally talented racer who just wanted to \nhave fun, the  sport’s icy new professionalism had no  attraction. \n\nEO ae \nCROZ, LAST OF  THE GREAT ALL-ROUNDERS 351 \nCrosby was an  overnight sensation at  Brands in  1979, driving into \nthe  paddock an  unknown, leaving as  the  talk of the  track. Fans could \nhardly believe what they’d seen —  some guy in  scuffed, oil-stained \nleathers hassling Ron Haslam’s pristine factory Honda and beating \neveryone else. \n‘I  think the British crowds were looking to  get  into an  underdog \naway from your Sheenes and [Mick] Grants,’ says Croz, who remained \na firm favourite with British fans until he tangled with Barry Sheene in \n1981. ‘But we  only had the high ‘bars because we  were aiming towards \nthe new Daytona Superbike race and because proddie racing was big at \nhome —  all clanging handlebars, scraping side covers and lots of crashes, \nthat’s what the audience liked. When we  turned up  at  Brands, Phil \nRead told me  he’d buy me a set  of clip-ons. I said I’d  rather have the \nmoney so  I could eat! \n‘That way of riding was so  natural to  me. I'd  look at  bikes like the \nP&Ms which were nice but they didn’t have that feral-ness for  short- \ncircuit scratching. The English set  up  their bikes \ntraditionally, so  they didn’t have that ability to  flick \nleft and right. Our bike was unstable towards top ‘I was the worst at \nend but more manoeuvrable at  lower speeds, so  it piss drinking and \nwas \nwell \nsuited \nto \nshorter \ncircuits.’ \npartying, \nI \ndon’t \nTypically, \nCroz \nhadn’t \neven \nplanned \nto  \nbe  \nin  \nthe \nknow \nhow \nSuzuki \nrace \nthat \nchanged \nhis  \nlife. \n‘I \ncame \nover \nto  \ndo  \nthe  \nIsle \nput \nup \nwith \nme’ \nof \nMan \nand \nthen \nsomeone \nsuggested \nI \ndo \nBrands,’ \nhe \neee \nae \nrecalls. \n‘I’d \nalways \nwanted \nto \ndo \nthe \nTT, \nit’s \nan \nicon \nrace. \nI \ndidn’t \nfeel \nit’d \nbe \ntoo \ndangerous \nbecause \nI’d \nalways \nbeen \nstreet \nriding \nand \nstreet \nracing. \nIt \nwas \nMike \nHailwood \nwho \nhelped \nus \nget \na \nstart. \nHe \nwas \nliving \nin \nNew \nZealand \nand \nused \nto \nwatch \na \nfew \nraces. \nI \nwas \njust \na \nhairy-assed \nkid, \nbut \nwe \nuse \nto \ngo \nto \nhis \nplace, \ntalk \nabout \nthe \nTT \nand \nspill \nred \nwine \nall \nover \nthe \ncarpets, \nmuch \nto \nhis \nwife’s \ndismay.’ \nCrosby \nfinished \nhis \nfirst \nTT \nin \nfourth, \nbehind \nAlex \nGeorge, \nCharlie \nWilliams \nand \nHaslam, \nbut \nahead \nof \nMike \nthe \nBike, \nthe \nman \nwho \nkickstarted \nhis \ninternational \ncareer! \nMany \nTT \nold-timers \nthought \nCroz \nwas \nriding \ntoo \nfast \nand \ntold \nhim \nso, \nbut \nhe \ninsists \nhe \nalways \ntreated \nthe \ncircuit \nwith \ngreat \nrespect. \n‘I \ndidn’t \nlearn \nthe \ntrack \nthe \ntraditional \nway, \nlining \nup \nthose \ntwo \nlamp \nposts \nand \nso \non, \nI \ngot \nto \nknow \nwhere \neveryone \nhad \nkilled \nthemselves. \nIt \nwas \nmacabre \nbut \nit \ndemanded \nI \nhad \na \nhelluva \nlot \nmore \nrespect \nfor  \nthe  \ncircuit.’ \n\n352 THE FAST STUFF \nCroz cancelled his  return flight after the  TT, realising he could make \na wage out  of British racing. Living out  of the  back of vans or  dossing \non  mates’ floors, ‘like most Aussies and Kiwis back then’, he hung out \nwith fellow Antipodeans and factory Suzuki mechanics Mick Smith \nand Dave ‘Radar’ Cullen, though this wasn’t the only reason Suzuki GB \nsigned him for  1980. \nPartnering Randy Mamola in  Texaco Heron colours, Croz did  it all \nthat year. In March he won the Daytona Superbike race on  a Yoshimura \nGS1000, in May he made his  500  GP  debut, in June he won his  first TT, \n(the Fl  race, then a one-race world championship), in July he won the \nSuzuka Eight Hours (beating Kawasaki's Eddie Lawson and Gregg \nHansford) and in  August he  scored his  first 500 GP  podium. Such \nversatility came naturally, he  says: ‘where we  came from we  raced on \nstreet circuits, short circuits, GP  style circuits, the  lot’. Nevertheless, \nSuzuki were so  impressed they doubled his  pay for  1981, to £25,000. \nContinuing his  two-stroke and four-stroke duties, Croz was just as \nsuccessful in  1981, winning two more TTs, taking his  first GP  pole \npositions and four podium finishes. But the doubts were already \ncreeping in.  That year’s TT  was marred by  death and controversy — \nHonda and Suzuki got involved in a  nasty wrangle over Croz’s Fl  win, \nHonda famously protesting by wearing all-black livery for the  Senior, in \nwhich Aussie privateer Kenny Blake died. \n‘It  was a  big Honda versus Suzuki fight, a  lot  of controver’y, ~vhich \ntook the  edge off the  enjoyment. And then we  lost  Kenny. I will always \nremember leaving the  paddock with Kenny’s van still parked there, \nclothing hanging on  the  line, that had a  huge impact. That’s why I \ndecided not  to  go back —  I'd won three races and that was enough.’ \nCroz also found himself embroiled in  a  messy tabloid wrangle with \nSheene, after he  had crashed out  of the  lead of the  British GP.  taking \nSheene with him. ‘I was a  bit  naive on  how to  deal with that; I was \nbeing told by various people what I should be saying and it backfired.’ \nAnd then he was axed by Suzuki, because Mamola didn’t want him as  a \nteam-mate, which may or  may not  have had something to do with Croz \nflushing Mamola’s head down the  toilets in the  Pukekohe paddock when \nthe  snotty youngster first raced in New Zealand during the mid-1970s. \nCroz was lucky to  start 1982 with Giacomo Agostini’s Marlboro \nYamaha team, or  so  he  thought. He  won the  Daytona 200 on  a TZ750 \nand was a  podium regular in  GPs but something wasn’t right. ‘I was \n\nCROZ, LAST OF  THE GREAT ALL-ROUNDERS 353 \nfalling behind, not from a  riding point of  view but more from an \norganisational point of view. I guess I needed a manager.’ \nThe early 1980s were a period of massive transition for  GP  racing — \nbig sponsors rolling in, riders forming themselves into unions, increasing \nprofessionalism —  and fun-loving Croz found himself all  at  sea. Then \nwhen the factory Yamaha and Marlboro Yamaha teams merged for \n1983, Croz once again found himself without a  ride. It was the  only \nexcuse he needed to  head home. ‘All  of a  sudden racing lost  its  appeal; \nI'd  taken up  flying and that was consuming for me.’ \nOver the  next three seasons Croz rode occasional races for  Suzuki in \nJapan, though his heart wasn’t in it. ‘I’d be halfway through a race and \nI'd  go  “what the  fuck am  I doing here?”, every lap was a  real wrong \none, then all of a sudden it’d  click in and away I'd go and 20 laps would \ndisappear without me  even thinking and I’d  be  “shit what happened \nthere?” It was then that I decided enough was enough.’ \nNow 50,  Crosby isn’t too  worried that he  never achieved his  full \npotential. ‘You always have regrets but I’m still alive and I only ever \nbroke one collarbone, so  I came out  of it remarkably well; there’s so \nmany other people who aren’t around.’ Since retiring for  good, Croz \nhas run his  own motorcycle shop, sold cars and become a builder. He \nmarried his  second wife, Helen, in the  summer of 2006. \nCrosby, beer and rentacars, a lethal combination \nCrosby’s \ninternational \ncareer \ncoincided \nwith \na  \nperiod \nof  \nhuge \ntransformation, \nwith \ngung-ho \namateurism \nreplaced \nby \nshiny \nprofessionalism. \nBut \nnone \nof \nthat \nstopped \nCroz \nfrom \npartying \nhard. \n‘T \nused \nto  \nbe  \nthe  \nworst \nat  \npiss \ndrinking \nand \npartying, \nI \ndon’t \nknow \nhow \nSuzuki \nput \nup \nwith \nme,’ \nhe \nsays \nwith \na \nguilty \ngrin. \n‘I \nused \nto \nbe \nso \nbad, \nthere’d \nbe \ntimes \nI \nprobably \nwould’ve \nfailed \na \nbreathalyser \ntest \nracing \nat \nthe \nTT. \nI’d \nhave \na \nfew \nbeers \nand \nsome \nwine \nthe \nnight \nbefore \nand \nin \nthe \nmorning \nI \nwouldn’t \neat \nanything \nbecause \nmy \nstomach \nwould \nbe \nchurning \naround. \nI’d \njust \nget \nout \nthere \nand \ndo \nit.’ \nCroz \nwas \nalso \ninfamous \nfor  \nhis  \nrentacar \nantics \nin  \nthe  \ndays \nwhen \nno \nself-respecting \nracer \nwould \nreturn \na \nhire \ncar \nin \none \npiece. \n‘I \nremember \nmeeting \nsome \nIrish \nguys \non \nthe \nbeach \nat \nDaytona \nat \ntwo \nin \nthe \nmorning. \nWe \nwere \nhooning \nup \nand \ndown \nin \nmy \ncar \nand \ngot \nkinda \nbogged \ndown \nand \nthat \nwas \nit. \nThe \ntide \ncame \nin \nand \nby \nthe \ntime \nwe \nwere \nrescued \nthere \nwere \nwaves \ncoming \nin \none \nwindow \nand \nout \nthe \nother...’ \n\n354 THE FAST STUFF \nI was the  butt of one of Croz’s jokes at  Suzuka in  1985. Me  and my \nteam had broken into the  circuit swimming pool in  the early hours \nafter a session at the legendary Mama’s bar. We  stripped off for a skinny \ndip, then realised someone had stolen our clothes. No  need to  guess \nthe  culprit... \nCroz’s factory beating rat  bike \nCrosby may have won TTs  on  factory Suzukis and Daytona on  a factory \nYamaha TZ750 but he’s best remembered for the rat  bike with which he \nfirst made his  name in Britain. \nThe yellow and blue Moriwaki Kawasaki Z1000 was a wolf in grubby \nsheep’s clothing, ratty as  hell and yet  as  fast as  the factory Honda \nRCB1000s. Built for  the  USA’s new Superbike series, both engine and \nchassis had been breathed on  by Mamoru Moriwaki, Pop Yoshimura’s \nson-in-law. \nIn  addition to  the  usual —  hot cams, pistons and so  on  —  the 120 \nhorsepower Zed Thou had also been strengthened with Z650 valve \nbuckets, replacing the  stock tappets, and solid cam chain tensioners, \nreplacing the standard auto tensioners. Carbs were 31mm Keihin \nsmooth bores, ignition came from a total-loss system and the  crank \nend was sawn off  for  extra ground clearance. The chassis was also \nstrengthened and tweaked, with revised geometry, Z650 triple clamps, \nlengthened Moriwaki swingarm and Kayaba racing forks and shocks. \nThe bike was sold to racer Gordon Pantall who recently carried out  a \nfull  restoration —  it looks tidier now than it did  in  1979! \n\nCHAPTER 46 \nMOTOGP RACING WITH \nNO  RULES \nMarch 2006 \nWhen \nyou \nask \na  \ngroup \nof \ntop \nMotoGP \nengineers \nwhat \nkind \nof \nbike \nthey \nwould \nbuild \nif \nthere \nwere \nno \nMotoGP \nregulations \nthere’s \nbound \nto \nbe \nsome \nextraordinary \ncreations... \nWhat kind of  MotoGP bike would you build if there were no  rules? \nThat’s the question we  asked the sport’s top designers. We asked \nMotoGP engineers from Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki and Yamaha \nto  start with a  clean sheet of paper, with only one aim in mind —  to  go \nas  fast as  possible. \nNot everyone welcomed this breath of  freedom, this escape from \nMotoGP’s myriad technical regulations. Pit-lane engineers spend their \nlives shackled by rules so  that some of them seem unable to  envisage \nanything beyond those rules; they simply find the  concept of thinking \noutside the  box too  scary to  contemplate. Yamaha’s M1  project leader \nMasahiko Nakajima said: ‘No  rules is nonsense!’ Ducati \nsaid simply they were too  busy designing their very real \n800cc GP7 to  create a  fantasy MotoGP bike. ‘Honda and \nNo  surprises there, really. Race engineers tend to  be Kawasaki created \nbusy people and also realists, not  dreamers. That’s the sensationally radic. \nstereotype anyway, but this story proves that some motorcycles which \nengineers have dreams just like the  rest of us,  except beg the question: \nthey \ntend \nto \nbe \nwilder \nthan \nanything \nwe'd \never \ndream. \nwho’s \nbeen \nputting \nBoth \nHonda \nand \nKawasaki \nembraced \nthe \nno-rules \nidea \nwhat \nin \ntheir \nwith \nenthusiasm, \ncreating \nsensationally \nradical \ngreen \ntea?’ \nmotorcycles \nwhich \nbeg \nthe \nquestion: \nwho’s \nbeen \nputting \nwhat \nin \ntheir \ngreen \ntea? \nSuzuki \ncrew \nchief \nTom \nO’Kane \nand \nformer \nGP-winning \nengineer \nHamish \nJamieson \nalso \ndreamed \nup  \ntheir \nown \nrace \nbikes, \ncreated \nwith \none  \nidea \nin \nmind, \nto \ncut  \nthe \nfastest \nlap \ntimes \never. \nAmongst \nthe \nfeatures \n\n356 THE FAST STUFF \ndesired by these cutting-edge designers are  jet power, two-wheel drive, \nvariable wheelbase, supercharging, nitrous-oxide, hub-centre steering, \nABS braking, active suspension, semi-auto gearshifters, Bonneville- \nstyle streamlining, 14-inch barrel-shaped tyres and, most bizarrely, a \ntwo-track motorcycle with its wheels side by side, not  in line. Now that \nreally is blue-sky thinking... \nHonda: two-wheel drive, active triple \nHonda came up with two designs, one for now, one for ten  years hence. \nTheir dream machine for  now is  a  250 horsepower, 834cc four-stroke \ninline triple with pneumatic valves, hub-centre steering, active geometry, \npart-time two-wheel drive, linked brakes, shaft drive, 16-inch tyres, \nactive suspension and a semi-automatic gearbox. \nThey reckon the  bike would rev  to  19,000rpm, surpass 350kmh and \nbeat most MotoGP lap  records by  about 10  per cent, which would \nequate to  an  improvement of  around ten seconds at  a  racetrack of \naverage length. And all performance factors —  both engine and chassis \n—  would adjust actively according to weather and track conditions. \n‘We chose hub-centre steering because we  wanted to  make a  bike \nwith active wheelbase and geometry, which would adjust itself for \ncornering, and this  would be impossible with telescopic forks,’ explains \nHonda Racing Corporation managing director Satoru Horiike. ‘We also \nthink two-wheel drive is a good way to  go in the  future, very useful for \nboth front- and rear-end traction. But this is just an  idea; so  far  HRC \ndoesn’t have any two-wheel drive prototypes.’ \nThe bike’s geometry —  wheelbase, ride height and so  on  —  would \nadjust automatically for  each corner and straight. During acceleration \nand deceleration the bike would be long and  low for stability, but during \ncornering the wheelbase would shorten from 1430mm to  1390mm and \nthe centre of  gravity would rise for quick steering and greater \nmanoeuvrability. HRC won't say  how they'd achieve this adjustment \nbut  it’d  take gyroscopes, sensors and plenty of electronics. The triple’s \nfront wheel would be driven by an  electric motor during corner exits to \nimprove traction and turning. \nHonda: way-out two-wheeler \nIs it a bird? Is it  a plane? Hang on,  is it a motorcycle? If you  think HRC’s \n834cc active triple is  radical, its  vision of  MotoGP racing in  2016 is \n\nMOTOGP \nRACING \nWITH \nNO  \nRULES \n357 \nabout \nas  \nfar \nout  \nas  \nyou \ncould \npossibly \nimagine. \nIn \ndesigning \nhis  \ndream \nMotoGP \nbike \nof \nthe  \nfuture, \nSatoru \nHoriike \ntook \nour  \n‘no  \nrules’ \nconcept \nto  \nthe  \nlimit, \nchanging \nthe  \nentire \ndynamics \nof \nthe  \nmotorcycle \nin \nsearch \nof \nultimate \ncornering \ngrip \nand \ntherefore \nultimate \nlap \ntimes. \nHe \nhas \ndesigned \na \ntwo-track \nmachine, \nwhich \nstill \nfits \nthe \nOxford \nEnglish \nDictionary’s \ndefinition \nof \na motorcycle \nas \n‘a two-wheel \nvehicle \nthat \nis \npowered \nby a motor’. \n‘The only stipulation of a  motorcycle is that it must be  two wheels, \nthat’s all,’ Horiike smiles. ‘This kind of bike wouldn’t necessarily be \nsafer but  it would be much faster. With an  inline two-wheeler you can’t \nachieve more than 1g but if you put the  wheels side by side you can \nachieve more g.  This would mean more grip and lap  times closer to \nFormula One cars. At  the  moment MotoGP lap times are  much slower \nthan F1,  even though top  speeds are  quite similar. I think it would be \npossible to  build this kind of machine in  ten  years. Already Segway \n(the self-balancing two-track scooter) has  done something similar. It’s \nsimple, you just need a  giro and some electronics. I first had this idea \nin  1989; I’ve  already made the  patent.’ \nThe two-track Honda uses the  company’s jet-plane know-how with \na  turbojet engine that would produce massive horsepower with a \nsmooth delivery. Like something out of  Star Wars, the machine \nharnesses the jet’s thrust by  using vectored nozzles to  help steer \nthe machine through corners. Air brakes would also play an \nimportant role in  cornering, helping the  bike to  tilt, developing extra \ndownforce and therefore grip for  the  inside tyre. An  active-controlled \nwing \nwould \ncontrol \npitching \nduring \nacceleration \nand \ndeceleration. \nBut \nit’s \nnot \nall \ncomputer \ntrickery, \nthe \nrider \nwould \nalso \nuse \nhis \nbody \nweight \nto \nimprove \ncornering \nspeed, \njust \nlike \nbike \nracing \nand, \ner \nsidecar racing. \nOne \nwonders \nif \nthis \nwas \nthe  \nbike \nthat \nValentino \nRossi \nwas \ntalking \nabout \nwhen \nhe \nsaid: \n‘When \nI \nwas \nracing \nfor \nHRC \nI \nkept \nhearing \nthat \nin \nJapan, \nin \nsome \nsecret \ndrawer, \nthere \nwere \nprojects \nthat \nwould \nrevolutionise \nmotorbikes...’ \nKawasaki: \nBonneville-style \nstreamliner \nKawasaki \nwant \nMotoGP \nbikes \nto  \nbe  \nsuper-radical, \nmuch \nless \nlike \nsupersport \nbikes \nthan \nthey \nare \ncurrently, \nso \nthey'll \nbe \nunique \nmachines \nwhich \nwill \nfascinate \nfans. \nThat’s \nwhy \nTeam \nGreen \nMotoGP \nengineer \n\n358 THE FAST STUFF \nKenichi Furuhashi has come up  with a  semi-tilting, streamliner with \nhub-centre steering, supercharged motor and enormous rear tyre which \nhe believes will be super safe and crazy fast. \nLike Honda, finding extra grip was a key factor in their design. Their \nsolution to  this issue was creating a  super-fat, super-low-profile \n800/10-14 rear tyre and a  two-part carbon-fibre monocoque chassis \nthat is, quite literally, hinged in the  middle. The rider sits  in a reclined \n‘armchair-style’ sitting position in  the  front section, which leans fully \nduring cornering while the  rear rolls slightly through centrifugal force, \nthe barrel-shaped rear tyre delivering a  massive footprint. The 400 \nhorsepower supercharged 800cc engine is  housed in  the  rear section. \nWheelbase is  1500mm. \nKawasaki believe that this machine —  with huge horsepower, \nmassive grip, very low centre of gravity and ultra-slippery aerodynamics \n—  will deliver lap times that would give an  Fl  car a  run for \nits  money. \nAnd Furuhashi didn’t stop at  designing a  motorcycle. He  believes \nMotoGP needs more than just radical new bikes. ‘We propose that \nracetracks should be  shorter, so  spectators can see all  the course at \nonce, like the  Valencia MotoGP track or  like Supercross,’ he  says. ‘We \nwould also want all  teams to  run  engines of the  same specification, so \nthe  rider becomes the  main player of MotoGP, which will produce very \nclose and exciting races.’ \nOnly one problem: HRC’s Satoru Horiike reckons he patented a very \nsimilar idea some years ago! \nTom O’Kane: bat-mobile (with rocket launchers) \nChris Vermeulen’s Suzuki crew chief Tom O’Kane has  worked in  GPs \nsince the  late 1980s, first on  Team Roberts’ factory Yamahas, then on \nthe  squad’s own two-stroke triple and four-stroke V5.  He joined Suzuki \nin 2005. \nLike \nsome \nengineers, \nO’Kane \nstruggled \nwith \nthe \nconcept \nof \ntotal \nengineering \nfreedom. \n‘I  \ntried \nto  \nwork \non  \nthe  \nbasis \nof  \n“let \nyour \nimagination \nrun  \nwild”, \nbut  \nafter \nwracking \nmy  \nbrains \nto \ncome \nup  \nwith \na  \ntwo-wheeled \nbat-mobile, \nI \ngave \nup.  \nMotorcycles \nsimply \ndon’t \nwork \nthat \nway. \nSo  \nwhat \nI’ve \ncome \nup  \nwith \nis \na  \nwish-list \nof \nwhat \nI \nthink \nis \nachievable, \ngiven \na  \nno-rules \nsituation \nwith \nmaybe \na  \nfew \nbat- \nbike \nparts.’ \n\nMOTOGP RACING WITH NO  RULES 359 \nO’Kane’s creation is thus a  lot  less wild than those dreamed up  by \nHRC and Kawasaki. He  reckons a  V5  four-stroke would be  the  ideal \npower plant, but  with nitrous-oxide injection. ‘More power is always \nnice,’ he  adds. ‘In  the  lower gears, the  important thing is to  limit the \npower to what the  rider can  use  and provide good throttle connection. \nBut on  long straights, in  the  higher gears, we  could benefit from the \nuse  of nitrous oxide, controlled by the  ECU.’ And to  improve corner- \nentry performance O’Kane’s bike would have anti-lock brakes. ‘I believe \nin  keeping computer control to  a  minimum,’ he  adds. ‘But an  ABS \nsystem that allowed the  rider to  keep both brakes on  hard up  to  mid- \ncorner would be worth its weight in silicon chips.’ \nBecause O’Kane works in  the pits he’s also keen to  create a  bike \nthat’s not  merely user-friendly for the  rider. ‘The bike would be easy to \nwork on,’ he explains. ‘The designers would have to  practise \ncommon tasks such as  wheel and shock-absorber changes, then \nredesign the bike accordingly. The designers would also be  on  a \nparts-count bonus scheme. That is,  every time they reduced \nthe  parts count without reducing the  bike’s performance, they would \nreceive a  pay bonus. Performance in  this sense means lap-time, \nreliability and how easy the bike is to work on.  Every time they managed \nto  make one part (or system) do  two jobs, they would receive a \ndouble bonus.’ \nSafety is also a  priority for  O’Kane. ‘Materials should be chosen for \nsafety. Billet parts, particularly those subject to  stress cycles, will be \nmade from 2024-T3 or  T4  aluminium. Although 7075-T6 is a little \nstronger, \n2024 \nis \nless \nnotch \nsensitive \nand \nmore \nfatigue \nresistant, \nthat \nis, \nfatigue \ncrack \npropagation \nis \nslower. \nMotorcycle \nparts \nshould \nnot \nfail \nwithin \ntheir \ndesign \nlifetime, \nbut \nmaterials \nmust \nbe \nchosen \nso \nthat \nif \nthey \nfail, \nthey \nshould \ndo \nso \nprogressively, \nnot \ncatastrophically. \nBrittle \nmaterials \nand \nmaterials \nwhich \ndo \nnot \nshow \noutward \nsigns \nof \nimpending \nfailure have no  place on  this bike.’ \nAnd \nO’Kane \nhas \none \nfinal \ntrick \nup  \nhis  \nsleeve. \n‘Finally, \nif  \nweight \nwasn’t \ntoo \nmuch \nof \na  \nproblem, \nand \nonly \nto  \nbe  \nused \nas  \na  \nlast \nresort, \na \ncouple \nof \nheat-seeking \nmissiles \nwould \nbe \nnice...’ \nHamish \nJamieson: \nsuper-light \nand \nturbocharged \nHamish \nJamieson \nwas \nthe \nman \nwho \nadapted \nYamaha’s \nYZR500 \nso \nthat \nwild-sliding \nGarry \nMcCoy \ncould \nwin \nGPs. \nAfter \nthat \nthe \nScot \nworked \non \n\n360 THE FAST STUFF \nKawasaki's MotoGP project before taking time out  in Africa, working \nfor the  Riders for Health charity. \nHis  dream concept is  a  small and light bike that delivers excellent \nfeel. ‘The overall ethos of this machine is feel and weight, both static, \nhence the small-capacity engine and dynamic, hence my choice of \ncarbon-fibre wheels.’ The engine is  a  300cc inline four-cylinder four- \nstroke with twin turbochargers, water injection and a  very low inertia \ncrankshaft rotating backwards. The frame is a  Ducati-style steel trellis \nunit with a  swingarm made from cast magnesium. The bike would \nweigh just 115kg. \nJamieson reckons feel is  crucial in  allowing a  rider to  extract the \nbike’s full potential over a  17-race season. ‘The machine needs to  be \nkept at its maximum feel, that is why I’ve  chosen carbon wheels, which \nare  20 per cent lighter than forged magnesium, allowing the suspension \nto be better tuned, which helps give the  rider more feedback.’ \nAdjustability will be  another key feature. ‘The rider will be  able to \nadjust the power output via the  turbo waste gates, especially important \nconsidering the high power output, and the suspension, allowing \noptimum use  of available grip. The ECU will take care of other functions \nlike traction control. Engine braking won’t be  such a big issue due to \nthe  turbocharged engine’s low compression.’ \nHis only concern is  running costs. ‘The engines would be  of  the \nthrowaway variety. The light materials and the  huge stresses imposed \nby the performance would render them junk in a very short time, about \n500km. Thus a  team of two riders would need about 80  engines for  a \nyear of racing and testing.’ \nNo  Rules MotoGP bike specs \nHonda's triple \nEngine: 834cc inline triple four-stroke with pneumatic valves \nBore: 93  x  40.9mm \nFuel system: PGM-FI \nEngine management: 32-bit processor ECU \nGearbox: semi-automatic \nTop speed: over 350kmh \nHorsepower: 250bhp at  19,000rpm \nAerodynamics: optimised for rider compatibility \n\na, ee \nMOTOGP \nRACING \nWITH \nNO  \nRULES \n361 \nFrame: \nFrameless, \ncarbon \nsuspension \nsupports \non  \nengine \nWheelbase: \nactively \nvariable, \n1390 \nto \n1430mm \nWeight: 125kg \nSuspension: \nShowa \nsingle \nshocks, \nfront \nand \nrear \nBrakes: linked Brembo system \nWheels: carbon dish \nFuel capacity: 18 litres \nKawasaki's streamliner \nEngine: 800cc four-stroke with supercharger \nFuel system: direct injection \nGearbox: semi-automatic \nTop speed: over 350kmh \nHorsepower: 400bhp \nAerodynamics: streamliner \nFrame: two-part carbon monocoque \nWheelbase: 1500mm \nWeight: 180kg \nSuspension: single shocks, hub-centre steering \nBrakes: rim disc front, conventional disc rear \nWheels: 16inch front, 14inch rear \nFuel capacity: 30 litres \nO’Kane’s bat-mobile \nEngine: 75.5 degree 990cc V5  with nitrous oxide in higher gears \nBore: 72  x  48.6mm \nFuel system: 10  injectors, 5 upper, 5 lower \nEngine management: 32-bit processor ECU \nGearbox: six  speed \nTop speed: about 360kmh \nHorsepower: 245bhp, 325bhp with N,O \nAerodynamics: optimised for handling, then cooling, then drag \nFrame: conventional aluminium beam frame \nWeight: 145kg \nSuspension: Ohlins \nBrakes: carbon front, steel rear \nWheels: forged magnesium \nFuel capacity: 30 litres \n\n362 THE FAST STUFF \nJamieson’s turbo \nEngine: \n298.45cc, \n16 \nvalve, \nfour-cylinder \nfour-stroke \nwith \n180  \ndegree \nfiring \nMagnesium \ncases \nincorporating \ncylinder \nblock, \nberyllium \ncylinder \nhead \nBore: \n54.5 \nx \n32mm \nFuel system: Marelli twin injector system, two KKK turbos \nEngine management: ECU-controlled water injection and waste gates \nGearbox: six  speed \nTop speed: about 360kmh \nHorsepower: 300bhp at  15,000rpm, depending on  boost \nAerodynamics: optimised for handling, then cooling, then drag \nFrame: steel trellis \nWheelbase: 1420mm \nWeight: 115kg \nSuspension: Ohlins \nBrakes: carbon front, steel rear \nWheels: Marchesini carbon-fibre \nFuel capacity: 26  litres, plus 3 litres water \nMotoGP Mutterings: April 2006 \nI have seen the future of MotoGP and it’s electro \nMarco Melandri is  stood in  the  back of the  Mugello pits looking a bit \nunsteady on  his  pins.

The stinky 125cc \nand 250cc two-stroke categories were axed in 2010, replaced by 200cc \nand 400cc four-strokes. Then internal-combustion engines were run \nout  of GPs in 2046. Petrol now costs 40  quid a litre, if you can get your \nhands on  any, because the  world’s shrinking oil  reserves have either \nbeen commandeered by the  military or  bought by China and Russia, \nwho have become firm friends with oil-rich nations like  Venezuela and \nKazakhstan, Iran and Iraq. \n\na \nOO ———— \nTHE \nFUTURE \nOF  \nMOTOGP \nIS  \nELECTRO \n363 \nFab Melandri rides for the  Panasonic team, which is due to launch a \n200kW street version of its  300kW ElectroGP bike at  the  Milan show \nlater this year.

I was there at  the  first \nhorsehoe turn, standing on  this other dirt-track kid’s box van. Russell \ncrashed early in  the  race, right in  front of me, then ran and jumped \nover the  bike and picked it  up,  they made a  big  deal about that in \nthe  US. \n‘The thing I remember more than anything is when he  came by the \nnext lap.

Then \nhe  was just charging through the  pack, picking them up  and laying \nthem down, it was impressive. He  wasn’t hurt too  much but his  bike \nwas torn up. \n‘I  must’ve been about 13  at  the time, in  eighth grade, so  about \nhalfway though Friday school I said I needed to  go  home because I \nwasn’t feeling too  good, so  then me  and my  older brother drove down \nfrom Owensboro to Daytona to watch the racing. Of course, I had school \non  Monday morning so  we  couldn’t stay for  the  whole race, we  had to \nbeat the  crowd and get home, so  we  were listening to it on  the  radio as \nwe  were leaving the  track and I just remember thinking, man, this is \nunheard of, some guy  crashing and still winning the  thing.

That race was at  Suzuka, he was on  Dunlops while \neveryone else was on  Michelins. He  was up  there but  then he  made a \nmistake and dropped way back. Then he  starting coming through, he \nwas smoking the  Dunlop around the  left-hander at  the  top  of the  hill \n(Dunlop curve) and you  didn’t see  that kind of thing back then. He was \nsmoking the thing up  and I was thinking no  way, that can’t last, he \ncan’t sustain that, but  he went on  and won it. \n‘From that point, that was it, Rainey was set  in stone, as  far as  I was \nconcerned he was the god. That ride had a big influence on  me  because \nyou see  what can  be  achieved, you think that’s it, he’s not  going to  do \nit, but  then you see  the  determination, he just rode the  wheels off the \nthing. I saw so  many things in  12  years of GP  racing, so  my  memory is \nclouded, but that ride had such an  impact that I remember it from even \nbefore I got  into GPs. It’s  absolutely the  most awesome race you could \nwatch, I still tell  people to  get  the  video. \n‘Rainey reckons he had an  out-of-body experience at  Suzuka and you \nonly get  that when you’re really in  the  zone, when you're riding and \nyou can do  no  wrong.

At  Motegi it  was just impressive that Tamada could \nachieve that much grip and I remember thinking at  the  same time that \nif this is  the  way racing is going, we  don’t have much hope for  good \nracing anymore. As guys get more mid-corner grip they use  more corner \nspeed, which means they'll all be on  one line, which means there will \nbe  a  lot  less passing, a  lot  less manoeuvring. It’s  pretty close to  that \nalready, these bikes are  like big  250s and I  think the 800s will be \nWOTSe.” \nValentino Rossi, seven-time champ and maybe the greatest racer ever: Going head \nto head with 250  rival Loris Capirossi at Assen in 1999 \n‘I think I’m  very good at  understanding when. another rider is fast and \nthere have been a few times when some rider has  impressed me, for sure \nmore at  the  beginning of my  career, because when you arrive from the \nEuropean championship to world grand prix, you say,  fuck, for me  it will \nbe impossible in all my  career to  go like  the  guys up front. \n‘I suppose Capirossi has  impressed me  many times, Barros for a short \nperiod in the last  races of 2002 and sometimes Gibernau has  been very, \nvery fast. Also, Pedrosa impresses me  a lot now because he’s a different \nrider because he is so  tiny, so  he needs to  ride different. \n‘Maybe the  most impressive was Capirossi at  Assen in  ‘99. Usually \nanother rider impresses you when you are  in good shape, with a  good \nbike, and he’s still able to  beat you. That day I was very fast and \nCapirossi was faster than me,  he was in fantastic shape. He  amazed me \nat  the  last chicane; what he  did  that day was impossible! That race \nwasn’t \na \nrace, \nit \nwas \na \nbattle. \nThat \nsometimes \nhappens, \nyou \nstop \nwith \nthe right lines and just fight, like remove one chip from your brain and \nput  in another.’ \nSteve \nParrish, \nBritish \nchamp \nand  \nGP \nracer \nturned \nBBC \ncommentator: \nBayliss \nv \nEdwards, \nImola, \nfinal \nround \nof \nWorld \nSuperbike \n2002 \n‘I \ncan’t \nthink \nof \na  \nrace \nI’ve \nenjoyed \nmore \nthan \nwhen \nthey \nwere \ngoing \nhead \nto  \nhead \nfor  \nthe  \ntitle. \nThe \nstakes \nwere \nso  \nhigh, \nit \nwas \nthe  \nfinal \nround \nand \nwhoever \nwon \nwould \nbe \nworld \nchampion. \nTroy \nhad \nbeen \n\n“HE \nJUST \nFUCKED \nOFF  \nAND \nI \nDIDN’T \nEVEN \nKNOW \nHOW \nHE  \nWAS \nDOING \nIT’ \n369 \nromping \naway \nwith \nthe  \nchampionship \nuntil \nhe  \ncrashed \nat  \nAssen, \nand \nColin \nwon \neight \nraces \non  \nthe \nrun  \nafter \nhe \ngot \nnew \nparts \nfrom \nthe  \nSuzuka \nEight \nHours. \n‘Race \none \nwas \na  \nhuge, \nhuge \nbattle, \nit  \nseemed \nlike \nit  \nwould \ncome \ndown \nto \nwho \nfell \noff, \nbut \nColin \nbeat \nTroy \nby \na \nbike’s \nlength \nto \ngo \nsix \npoints \nahead. \nWhat \nmade \nrace \ntwo \neven \nbetter, \nthe \nmost \nenthralling \nrace \nI’ve \never \nwitnessed, \nwas \nthat \nit \nwas \nanother \nenormous \nbattle, \nbut \nalso \nbecause \nTroy’s \nonly \nchance \nfor \nthe \ntitle, \nif \nColin \ndidn’t \ncrash, \nwas \nto \nback \nColin \ndown, \nbecause \nRuben \nXaus \n(Bayliss’ \nteam-mate) \nwas \ncoming \nthrough. \nThe \nplan \nworked \nto \nstart \nwith \nbecause \nXaus \nwas \ncatching, \ncatching, \ncatching \nand \ngot \nto \nwithin \ntwo \nseconds. \nWe \nthought \nthe \nshit \nwas \ngoing \nto \nhit \nthe \nfan, \nbecause \nwho \nwould \nwant \nXaus \nin \nthe \nmiddle \nof \nit \nall? \nThen \nColin \nbit \nthe \nbullet \nand \npassed \nTroy, \nthen \nTroy \nwent \nback \npast \nhim, \nthey \nwere \nclashing \nfairings \nand \npushing \neach \nother \nwide. \n‘Seeing those two duking it out  for  a championship with three laps \nto  go was quite extraordinary; it’s  one race I'll never forget.

The sidecars had fucked the  track, it was \nlike ice, lethal.

He rode like  that all day long in the  dry, so when \nthe  rain came he’d ride the  same. It was normal for \nhim to  have a  moment every corner and save it. \n‘Schwantz was so far Normal people have a  couple of  big  moments and \non  the edge all the think, fuck me, that’ll do, but  he’d just have another \ntime, it’d be on  his one  at  the  next corner. \nknee, he'd roll  the ‘It was front tyre stuff that he was unbelievable at. \nfront round and just He  rode the  bike so  weird, pushing on  the  front so \nsave it’ hard, but  he had such a mega feeling for it, the  thing \nwould roll  around underneath him and he’d keep it \ngoing. So  when it came to  shitty conditions he  had \nsuch a  natural feel for  where he  was at  that he  was prepared to  keep \npushing it and keep saving it. \n‘I remember the  party at  the  team hotel afterwards. We  did  all  the \nnormal juvenile stuff, like pinching Shirley’s (Schwantz’s mum) camera \nand taking photos of my  schlong in  the  toilet and filling her  handbag \nfull  of cutlery. \n‘Suzuki brought me  into the  team to  look after him. Then the  first \ntime we  went to Ryuyo (Suzuki's test track), he broke his wrist after six \nlaps, so  it was left  to  me  to  do  all  the  testing. At  the  end of three days \nthe  Suzuki engineers sat  me  down and asked me  what I thought. I told \nthem maybe they’d make the  top  ten  at  the  first race at  Suzuka. They \nwere pretty shocked. So  Schwantz didn’t do any more testing, came to \nSuzuka with the  wrist all  fixed up  and won the  race. But that was all \nhim, it wasn’t the  bike.’ \nMotoGP Mutterings: June 2006 \nOn  the passing of MotoGP’s oldest and only \ntruly unique racetrack \nI write to  tell  you of the  sad  loss of an  old  and much-loved friend. We \nvisited GP racing’s old  dame during June and although she  is not  quite \ndead, she  may as  well be,  for  she has been hideously mutilated by \nbrutal thugs. \nAssen was once a  thing of  great beauty, a  unique racetrack that \n\nON \nTHE \nPASSING \nOF  \nMoTOGP’s \nONLY \nTRULY \nUNIQUE \nTRACK \n371 \noffered \nunique \nchallenges \nto \nboth \nman \nand \nmachine. \nBut \nno \nlonger, \nshe \nhas \nbeen \ndismembered, \nher \nnorthern \nloop \nhacked \noff \nto \nmake \nroom \nfor \n‘TT \nWorld’, \nan \nentertainments \ncomplex \nwith \nhotel, \ncar \npark \nand \nshops, \nbecause \nthe \nworld \nneeds \nmore \nshops. \nYes, \nI \nam  \na  \nsentimental \nold  \ngit \nand \na  \nGrumpy \nOld \nMan \ntoo, \nbut \nI \nmourn \nnot \nso \nmuch \nfor \nthe \nsacred \ntarmac \nnor \nfor \nits \nhistory \nbut \nfor \nthe \nloss \nof \nseeing \neven \nthe \nworld’s \ngreatest \nriders \nthrown \nheadfirst \ninto \nanother \nwhirling \ndimension \nby \nAssen’s \ntricky, \ncambered \ncurves \nand \nforced \nto \nride \nlike \nthey \nride \nnowhere \nelse. \nThe \nmean \nlittle \nkink \nthat \nreplaces \nthe  \nbutchered \none-mile \nnorthern \nloop \nsimplifies \nthe \ncircuit \nno  \nend \n(dare \nI \nsay,  \ndumbs \nit \ndown) \nbut \nracers \ndon’t \ngo \nracing \nbecause \nthey \nwant \nan \neasy \nlife. \nThey \nloved \nthe \nold \nAssen \nbecause \nit \nforced \nthem \nto \ndig \ndeep \ninside \nthemselves \nto \nfind \na \nwhole \nnew \nway \nof \nriding, \nreformatting \nmind, \nbody \nand \nmotorcycle \nto \nunlock \nthe \nsecrets \nof \nits \ninsanely \nfast \nsweepers, uniquely crowned in  the middle like a ‘Assen was once a \npublic road. thing of great \nAround normal racetracks, racers essentially go left beauty, a  unique \nor  right. But around the  old  Assen riders negotiated racetrack, but no \ncorrugations of  camber while zigzagging back and longer, she  has  been \nforth at  crazy speeds, like riding the  back of a  giant, dismembered, her \nwriggling snake, swerving right and left over the northern loop \ncentre crown, positive camber one instant, negative hacked off’ \ncamber the next, then positive, then negative, the \nslightest slip and you were gone. That’s why riders \nused to variously call  Assen bike racing’s university, its cathedral, temple \nor  Mecca. Racers were in awe of the  place. Even Mick Doohan. \n‘The camber has bitten some of  the  best riders in  the  world,’ said \nColin Edwards a few years back. ‘It makes you feel  so  comfortable, then \nyou get  to mid-corner and the  track drops away, so  if you’re not  careful \nit’s  “Sayonara!”, you’re out  of there! And man, it’s  so  fast, every time \nyou go  there you have to  adjust your eyes because everything goes by \nso  quick.’ This is what Edwards had to  say  at  the  2006 Dutch TT.  ‘The \nnew circuit is  crap, it’s  just like anywhere else, it’s  lost the  challenge \nand the  history.’ \nIn \nfact \nAssen \nis \nstill \nheavy \nwith \nhistory. \nIn \nbetween \nthe \nwhiff \nof \nchip \nfat \nand \nweed \nsmoke \nyou \ncan \nalmost \ntaste \nthe  \nsweet \nold  \nsmell \nof \nCastrol \nR. \nMike \nHailwood \nwon \nraces \nthere, \nso  \ndid \nBarry \nSheene, \nKing \nKenny \nRoberts, \n\n372 THE FAST STUFF \nGiacomo Agostini, Freddie Spencer, Kevin Schwantz, Mick Doohan and \nValentino Rossi (Graziano too). There is no  other GP  track in  the  world \nwhere you can  say that because Assen is the sole  survivor from GP racing’s \ninaugural 1949 season. But Assen is no  longer unique, so  even though it’s \nbetter than some GP tracks, it’s only half the place it used to be. \nYou  may wonder why I consider racetracks to be so  important, why I \nget  excited rolling up  somewhere fast and open, like Mugello, Phillip \nIsland and Istanbul, but become strangely depressed when I turn up at \nmean little layouts like Losail, Motegi and Shanghai. I feel like that \nbecause great circuits promote great racing, with riders mugging each \nother at  every other turn, while poor layouts encourage Fl-style \nprocessions. That’s why circuits matter, possibly even more than bikes \nand riders. \n\nCHAPTER 48 \nPEDROBOT: \nSMALL MAN, BIG TALENT \nAugust 2006 \nThey \ncall \nhim \n‘Pedrobot’, \nso  \nwhat \nis \nthe \nsecret \nof \nsuccess \ninside \nMotoGP’s \ntiniest \nsuperstar? \nFirst of all,  an  apology. I once referred to  Dani Pedrosa as  a  cheerless \nmidget. On  closer inspection I realise I was wrong, or  at  least half \nwrong. Pedrosa is miniscule but he’s not  miserable, he just takes his job \nvery, very seriously. Although he  is now mentioned in the  same breath \nas  Freddie Spencer, because he’s the  first rider since Fast Freddie to \nachieve such success in a rookie premier-class season, Dani Boy is more \nlike Eddie Lawson or  Mick Doohan in his  attitude to  the  sport: first of \nall,  racing is a job, second, it is a  science and must be  treated as  such, \nthird, if people enjoy watching the  racing, so  be  it, though this is not \nreally his  concern. \nThese are  not  good times to  hold such dangerous beliefs, Valentino \nRossi has seen to  that. Nowadays every MotoGP star is expected to  be \na  party clown —  as  you sit  on  the  grid preparing to  get  nasty with the \nworld’s greatest riders you are  expected to  wave daftly at  the  cameras, \nlike you’ve just spotted your neighbour’s five-year-old son  on  your way \nto  the corner shop. Most MotoGP racers now indulge themselves in \nthis sad  ritual, doing their damnedest to  tell  the  world that they are \nreally fun characters but  ultimately failing. Pedrosa doesn’t mug up  to \nthe  cameras before races, nor  after races, even when he’s won. He  has \ncopped \nsome \nserious \nflak \nfor \nhaving \nthe \naudacity \nto \nbehave \nin \nsuch \na \nmanner \n— \nhow \ndare \nhe \nnot \nenjoy \nwhat \nhe’s \ndoing? \n— \nwhen \nreally \nhe \nis \njust \na \nbit \ntoo \nshy, \na \nbit \ntoo \nnervous \nwhen \nhe’s \nin \nthe \npublic \neye. \nNevertheless, \nsome \ncritics \nhave \nnicknamed \nhim \n‘Pedrobot’, \nothers \ncall \nhim \n‘Minnie \nMick’ \n(after \nrelentless \nwinner \nDoohan). \nSo  \ndoes \nbike \nracing’s \npuniest \nsuperstar \n—  \nall  \nfive \nfoot \nthree \nof \nhim \n— \nreally \nenjoy \nracing \nor  \nwould \nhe  \nbe \njust \nas  \nhappy/unhappy \nworking \nat \n\n374 THE FAST STUFF \nMcDonald’s? ‘For sure I enjoy racing, that’s why I’m here,’ he says with \na  quiet assuredness that characterises his  answers throughout this \ninterview. ‘The thing I enjoy most is the  feeling I get in myself when I \nfinish a race, when I see  my  guys are  happy because \nthe  team is very important to  me.’ \n‘Iam not  worried if So  why doesn’t he  smile more? ‘Just because I \nRossi retires and don’t always smile doesn’t mean I’m not enjoying \nthen my style isn’t myself. I think some racers smile but they don’t enjoy \nthe same as  his and racing as  much as  me.  I don’t feel  I’m much different \npeople don’t like  it’ to  the others, I just feel that some of  them show \nanother face when they are  off the  bike.’ \nThe former 125 and 250 world champ is  almost \ncertainly correct in  his  assumption that many racers are  only acting \nwhen they play up  to  the  crowd. They are  not  being real, they merely \nfeel that it’s  part of their job  to  salute the  fans and do  the  occasional \nburn-out. There is no  doubt that Rossi enjoys his  victory celebrations, \nbut the  Italian also knows that these shows are  an  investment that \npays rich dividends. Barry Sheene was the same, he  happily signed \nthousands of autographs, each and every one of them part of a  career- \nlong brand-building exercise. \nPedrosa will sign autographs and wave to the crowd but he’s definitely \nnot  in the  business of showbusiness. ‘If making a  show was natural to \nme, then maybe I would,’ he  explains. ‘But when something doesn’t \ncome naturally I don’t feel I have to  do  it to  give enjoyment to  other \npeople. I am  not  worried if Rossi retires and then my  style isn’t the \nsame as  his  and people don’t like  it.’ \nQuite simply, Pedrosa prefers if people appreciate him for  what he \ndoes during a race, not  after it.  ‘It  is  a big emotion to  feel  that people \nlike  you for  what you do,  but  I like it more when I feel they like me \nbecause I have ridden a great race, not  because I make a great party on \nthe \npodium.’ \nIn \nthis \nrespect \nhe \nis \nvery \nsimilar \nto \nLawson \nand \nDoohan \n(his—all-time \nracing \nhero, \nwhich \nexplains \na \nlot), \nthough \nhe \nis \nless \nbrusque \nand \nmore \npolite \nthan \nGP \nracing’s \nbiggest \nwinners \nof \nthe \n1980s \nand  1990s. \nAnd \nyet  \nthe \n20-year-old \nhas \na  \nbig \nfollowing, \nespecially \nin  \nSpain, \nwhere \ngangs \nof \nteenage \ngirls \nthrong \nround \nthe  \nback \ndoor \nof \nthe  \nRepsol \nHonda \npit, \nscreaming: \n‘Dani! \nDani! \nDani’, \njust \nlike \nthe \nValenteeniboppers \nat  \nMugello. \nPedrosa \nis \nan  \nunlikely \nsex  \nsymbol \nand \nhe \ncertainly \ndoesn’t \n\nPEDROBOT: \nSMALL \nMAN, \nBIG \nTALENT \n271.) \nfeel \ncomfortable \nin  \nthe  \nrole. \nI \nask  \nhim \nhow \nhe  \nfeels \nwhen \nhe  \nhears \nthose \nstrident \ncries. \nHe  \ngrins \nwidely \nand \nsays: \n‘Suspicious!’ \nNot \none \nfor  \nthe  \ngroupies, \nthen, \nwhich \nbrings \nus  \nonto \nthe  \nsubject \nof \ngirlfriends. \nPedrosa \nreveals \nthat \nhe \ndoes \nhave \na \ngirlfriend \nbut \nlaughs \nuncomfortably \nwhen \nI \nask \nif \nshe’s \nSpanish \nor \nEnglish. \nHe \ndoesn’t \nwant \nto \nanswer \nthat \none. \nThe \nCatalan \nlad \nis \none \nof \nmany \nMotoGP \nstars \nwho \nchoose \nto \nlive \nin \nthe \nUK \nto \ntake \nadvantage \nof \ncomplex \nEU \ntax \nlaws. \nHe \nrecently \nmoved \ninto \nNotting \nHill, \nLondon’s \nluvvie \ncentral, \nand \nsome \ntwisted \npart \nof \nmy \nmind \nwants \nto \nsee \nhim \nout \non \nthe \ntown \nwith \nthe \nlocal \nglitterati, \nperhaps \ndating \nKelly \nOsbourne. \nBut \nthe \nceleb \ncircuit \nisn’t \nhis \nscene, \nhe’s \nmore \nlikely \nto \nbe \nseeing \na checkout \ngirl \nfrom \nTesco \nMetro \nin \nthe \nPortobello \nRoad. \n(Subsequent \nresearch \nreveals \nthat \nhis \nlady \nis \nSpanish, \nnot \nEnglish.) \n‘I  am  a  simple man,’ he  insists. So  what would be  his  ideal night \nout? ‘Maybe take supper with my girl or with friends, go to the cinema, \nthen go out  and talk about the movie or  anything. I mainly don’t drink, \nexcept on  the  nights when the  situation tells you this is the night to do \nit, but  by two o'clock I am  finished.’ \nPedrosa is indeed an  old  man for  his  20  summers. His  racing career \ngot  serious when he was just 13, so  he never enjoyed a normal, carefree \nadolescence. A  few years ago I spotted him dining on  Phillip Island \nwith his mentor Alberto Puig, Dorna boss Carmelo Espeleta and two \nother fiftysomething suits. That is not a normal way for  a  16-year-old \nto  spend his  Saturday nights —  the poor kid  looked bored to death —  but \nthat’s the  price you pay for  doing a  dream job. \nHe  is  aware that the  lifestyle he  has lived over the  last seven years \nmakes him somewhat abnormal but  he has  strategies to deal with that. \nLike Rossi, he  prefers to  hang out  with old  mates who treat him like \nDani the  childhood friend, not  Dani the  teeny-weeny superstar. ‘People \nI’ve known since I was little don’t look at  me  any different, so  that’s \nwhen I don’t feel different, this  is a good thing,’ he says. ‘But sometimes \nother \nfriends \nmake \nyou \nfeel \ndifferent \nbecause \nthey \nlook \nat \nyou \nwith \nother eyes.’ \nIf \nPedrosa \nis \nwary \nof \nstar-fucking \nmates \nand \ngold-digging \ngirls, \nhe \nis \neven \nmore \ndistrustful \nof \nthe \nmedia. \nPuig \nhas \ninstilled \nmuch \nof \nthis \nsuspicion \nand \nrightly \nso, \nbecause \nthe \nmedia \nis \na \nferociously \nfickle \nbeast, \nbigging \nyou \nup \none \nmoment, \nknocking \nyou \ndown \nthe \nnext. \nThis \nis \nanother \nreason \nwhy \nPedrosa \nenjoys \nliving \nabroad \nwhere \nhe \nis \nrelatively \n\n376 THE FAST STUFF \nsafe from the  Spanish tabloids: ‘In  London I cannot read the  Spanish \npress, which is nice’. \nSo  this is  one rider who counts no  journalists among his  paddock \nmates. In fact Pedrosa is in no  hurry to make any friends in the paddock, \nwhether they be journalists, rivals or members of his own team. ‘I don’t \ngo out  fishing or  anything with my mechanics, we  do our  jobs, they go \nhome, I go  my  home.’ Casey Stoner, a  rival in  125s, 250s and now in \nMotoGP is  stunned by  Pedrosa’s chilly paddock persona. ‘He won't \ncommunicate at  all  or  make any eye  contact,’ says the  Aussie. ‘Maybe \nhe’s got a problem with me.’ \nThis is my second one-on-one interview with Pedrosa since he arrived \nin  GPs in 2001. When I first interviewed him in  2002 he hardly got  a \nword in  edgeways, Puig answering most of  the  questions. This time \nPuig is  again present in  the  interview room, along with two Repsol \nHonda media personnel who hover on  the sidelines, apparently nervous \nthat the  interview might prove all  too  much for their treasured charge. \nIn  fact Pedrosa seems to enjoy the  chat, absolutely confident but  never \ncocky, sometimes funny, sometimes raising an  eyebrow if he thinks I’m \ngetting a bit  too  tasty with my  line of questioning. \nNot surprisingly, the subject of Rossi comes up several times. He is aware \nthat MotoGP’s long-time ruler has taken a  few swipes at  him, most \nfamously at  Donington 2006, where a  journalist asked Rossi if he  was \nexcited about sharing a podium for the  first time with MotoGP’s up-and- \ncoming star. ‘Oh yes,’ beamed Rossi. ‘So excited I pissed myself!’ \nPedrosa is more oblique when talking about his  most famous rival, \nperhaps because he knows he could never win a war of words with the \nglobally popular Italian who has  been premier-class champ five times \nsince Pedrosa arrived in GPs. I ask him if he’s impressed by his MotoGP \nrivals. ‘I think they have good talent but  for  sure I know other people \nwith more talent,’ he  replies, referring to  his  childhood heroes Ayrton \nSenna and Lance Armstrong. Even Rossi? ‘I don’t know if it’s  talent or \nexperience, or  the  team and the  whole package, I just feel he’s very \nstrong and he always tries to win.’ And you know Pedrosa is a real racer \nwhen he implies that Rossi’s god-like status is just another target: ‘For \nme  he is a good opportunity to prove my  ability as  a rider.’ \nHis  abilities have so  far  taken him to  the  125  world title at  his  third \nattempt (Rossi managed that in his  second season), to  the  250 title in \nhis \ndebut \nyear \n(Rossi \ntook \ntwo \nseasons \nto \nwin \nin \n250s) \nand \nto \nhis \nfirst \n\nPEDROBOT: \nSMALL \nMAN, \nBIG \nTALENT \nBAT. \nMotoGP \nvictory \nafter \njust \nfour \nraces \n(Rossi \ntook \nnine \nraces \nto  \nwin \nhis \nfirst \n500 \nGP). \nBut \nall \nhe  \nwants \nto  \nsay  \nabout \nhis  \nremarkable \nsuccess \nis \nthis: \n‘I \nfeel \nvery \nfortunate \nto \nhave \nwhat \nI \nhave \n— \nthe \nbike \nand \nthe \nteam \n— \nto \nhelp \nme \nget \nwhere \nI \nam.’ \nHe \ndoesn’t \nwant \nto \ntalk \nabout \nwhat \nhe’s \ngood \nat, \nonly \nwhat \nhe’s \nbad \nat. \n‘I \nstill \nneed \nto \nimprove \nmy \nriding \nin \nthe \nrain, \nalso \nmy \novertaking, \njust \nbecause \nthese \nbikes \nare \nquite \nbig \nand \ndifficult \nto \nmanage, \nand \nalso \nbecause \nof the \nspeed.’ \nOh \nyes, \nthe \nspeed, \nso \nhow \ndid \nit feel \ngraduating \nfrom \na \n170mph \nmotorcycle \nto \na 210mph \nmachine? \n‘Once \nyou \nare \nriding \nfull-on \nyou \nforget \nit, \nbut \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nyou \narrive \nat \nthe \ntrack \nwhere \nyou \nare \nused \nto \nriding \na \n250 \nyou \nfeel \na \nbig \ndifference, \nlike \nwhoa!’ \nPedrosa has  adapted seamlessly from 125s to  250s to MotoGP bikes. \nHe  still  uses the  same spot-on, inch-perfect technique he used on  125s \nand 250s, maybe because he’s just too  small to  muscle a bike around. \nHis crew chief Mike Leitner believes he  succeeds by using brains, not \nbrawn. ‘Dani is very intelligent. He  is quite small so  he has to  ride the \nbike in a different way to  the  others. A MotoGP bike is too  big and too \nheavy for him but  he  thinks and then adapts to  the  situation.’ \nNo  doubt Pedrosa is a thinker. But  the MotoGP bullies who taunt him \nwith cries of  ‘Pedrobot’ don’t worry him. After all,  in  bike racing it’s \nprobably more of a  compliment to  be called a robot, because that is the \nstate that racers spend their lives working towards —  being able to hit the \nsame braking points and the  same lines lap after lap after lap. \nAnd how long before the  batteries run flat  on  this particular robot? \n‘T don’t know, because many things can  happen,’ says Pedrosa. ‘But maybe \nmy \nmid-30s \nwould \nbe \na \ngood \nmoment \nto \nretire.’ \nWhich \ntakes \nus \nto \n2020 \nor \nthereabouts. \nLove \nhim \nor \nloathe \nhim, \nbetter \nget \nused \nto \nhim... \nMotoGP Mutterings: August 2006 \nDucati \ncelebrated \nits  \n60th \nyear \nof  \nmotorcycle \n‘If \nthe  \nUS \nAir \nForce \nproduction \nin \n2006. \nBig \nup \nthe \nBolognese! \nhadn't \nbombed \nthe \nhell \nout \nof \nthe \n‘War, \nwhat \nis \nit \ngood \nfor? \nAbsolutely \nnothing,’ \nsang \nDucati \nfactory \nin \nEdwin \nStarr, \namong \nothers. \nHe \nwas \nright, \nof \ncourse. \n1944 \nwe \nwould \nnever \nWell, \nup \nto \na \npoint. \nBecause \nif \nit \nhadn’t \nbeen \nfor \nthe \nhave \ngot \nto \nsee \nthe \nUS \nAir \nForce \nbombing \nthe \nhell \nout \nof \nthe \nDucati \nwondrous \n916’ \nfactory \nin  \n1944 \nwe  \nwould \nnever \nhave \ngot  \nto  \nsee  \nthe \n\n378 THE FAST STUFF \nwondrous 916 or  watch Loris Capirossi grappling with his loopy \nDesmosedici. \nUntil the  USAF appeared over Bologna 62  years ago, Ducati had no \ninterest in bikes. Inspired by local electronics genius Guglielmo Marconi, \nthe Ducati brothers manufactured radios, electric shavers, cameras and \ncondensers. Mussolini was well impressed when he visited the  factory \nin  1940, so  much so  that Ducati was pressed into manufacturing \nmilitary equipment, first by  Mussolini, then, after the Italians \nsurrendered in  1943, by the  Nazis. Hence the  1944 visit by hundreds of \nFlying Fortresses in the  aptly named Operation Pancake. \nWith their factory flattened and the war over, the Ducati brothers \ndecided to build a new factory and have a go at making motorcycles to get \nwar-ravaged Italy back on  the road. Their first bike, Il Cucciolo (the Puppy), \nwas no more than a bicycle with a tiny 1.5bhp engine attached, very similar \nto  Soichiro Honda’s first bike, the Putt Putt, also created in 1946. \nStrange beginnings for a  company now nicknamed ‘the Ferrari of \nmotorcycling’, the only biking brand outside Japan capable of \nhumbling the mighty Honda. Ducati’s achievements in racing —  both in \nMotoGP and World Superbike —  are  remarkable when you consider the \nsize of  the company. In  a  good year the Bolognese production lines \nmake 40,000 bikes, while Honda churns out  several million. \nBut  to  fully understand Ducati’s racetrack prowess you need to  look \nat  some different numbers. Of Ducati’s 1000 staff, 100  (or  10 per  cent) \nwork at  Ducati Corse, while 125 engineers toil at  Honda Racing \nCorporation, around 0.4  per  cent of Honda’s 30,000 workforce. And if \nyou  can’t understand why Kawasaki Heavy Industries can’t kick arse in \nMotoGP, try  these numbers for  size —  Kawasaki's race shop numbers \njust 30  souls, or  0.075 per  cent of  KHI’s 40,000 workers. So  Ducati’s \ncommitment to  racing is 25  times greater than Honda’s and 130 times \nbigger than Kawasaki's. \nIn other words, Ducati is a large race shop with a smallish production \nline attached. And the  company lives or  dies by its  race results. Few \npeople remember that just two decades ago  Ducati seemed doomed to \ncollapse. Two things saved it from those dark days —  the  seminal 748cc \neight-valve v-twin built by Massimo Bordi, understudy to the legendary \nFabio Taglioni, and the  creation of the  World Superbike series. Bordi’s \n748 \nbegat \nthe \n851 \nwhich \nbegat \nthe \n888 \nwhich \nbegat \nthe \n916, \nwhile \nWSB \nprovided \nthe \nstage \nupon \nwhich \nDucati \nshowed \nthe \nworld \nwhat \nit \ncould \n\nWHAT THE USAF pip FOR DUCATI 379 \ndo.  And World Supers success allowed Ducati to  dare to  dream that \nthey might also humble biking’s Japanese overlords in MotoGP. \nDuring its  60-year history Ducati has been through more ups and \ndowns and ins  and outs, through more hairpin bends and multiple \npile-ups than an  Italian autostrada or  parliament. And it  may well \nalways be  so,  because while Ducati bosses talk in public about passion \n(‘Our company is glued together by passion,’ says CEO Federico Minoli, \nwhich sounds a  bit  messy), behind closed doors they probably talk \nmore about private equity. The factory has  just changed hands again, \nback in Italian ownership after some years with US  backers. \nCoincidentally, Ducati’s museum was completed at  about the  same \ntime. The final piece of the jigsaw —  a  1956 triple camshaft desmo 125 \nGP  bike —  was recently discovered in  the  corner of  a  French garage \nwhere it  had been for  four decades. The museum —  almost certainly \nEurope’s best collection of race bikes —  is  worth a visit, packed with \neverything from Cucciolos to  Hailwood’s TT-winning 900SS, half a \ndozen Foggy Superbikes and Capirossi’s MotoGP machine. The museum \nis  cool, dark and quiet, like a  chapel, and crammed with relics and \nicons, \nincluding \nthe \nvery \ndrawing \nboard \nat \nwhich \nTaglioni \nworked. \nIt  \nis \nperhaps \nodd \nthat \nDucati \nhas \nonly \nrecently \nawoken \nto  \nthe  \nvalue \nof \nits \nhistory, \nbecause \nwhile \nmachines \nlike \nthe \nDesmosedici \nRR \nconvince \nthe \nworld \nof \nits \ntechnical \nbrilliance, \nperhaps \nits \nfinancial \nsaviour \nwill \nbe \nbikes \nlike \nthe \nSport \nClassics \nwhich \nemulate \nthe \nHarley \nmodel \nof \nbuilding \nlow-tech \nbikes \nthat \ncommand \npremium \nprices. \nLet’s \njust \nhope, \nhowever, \nthat \nDucati \ndoesn’t \ncheapen \nits  \nlegend \ntoo \nmuch \nby \ncopying \nHarley \nin \nflogging \ncratefuls \nof \nHarley \nshaving \ncream \nat \nTesco. \nI’m \nnot \noptimistic, \nhowever, \nbecause \nFerrari \nhas \nalready \nstarted \nselling \nits \nown \nbrand \nof \naftershave \ncalled, \nwait \nfor \nit, \n‘Passion’. \n\nCHAPTER 49 \nSTONER: ‘I EXPECTED IT  TO  TAKE \nTWO YEARS, NOT TWO RACES’ \nAugust 2006 \nCasey Stoner’s debut MotoGP campaign proved he  had the \nspeed to  race with the best, but problems with his  equipment \nalso caused him to  crash, so  what went right and what went \nwrong for  MotoGP’s hottest new star in 2006? \nAussie youngster Casey Stoner has  always had the mark of genius about \nhim and now he’s made his  mark on  MotoGP. The 20-year-old qualified \non  pole for the 2006 Qatar GP making him the second youngest premier- \nclass pole-sitter after American legend Freddie Spencer. ‘I expected it to \ntake two years to  get a pole, not  two races,’ said the  former 125  and 250 \nGP winner who went on  to lead that race until leg cramps and a dose of \nthe  ‘flu  slowed him. Eventual victor Valentino Rossi was stunned by the \nnew boy’s speed: ‘He was racing like he’s been in this  class for ten  years’. \nStoner’s secret? An even earlier start to his career than Rossi: ‘I was doing \nthe throttle of  a Pee Wee when I was 18 months old, my cousin sitting on \nthe  back.’ Youth may be  wasted on  the  young, as  nineteenth-century \nIrish wit  Oscar Wilde once opined, but  not  always. \nSo  Stoner and  his  LCR Honda made their mark with impressive speed \nduring 2006, though they also made a few dents in MotoGP’s surrounding \nscenery. But  like  the feisty Australian says, people shouldn’t criticise him \nfor trying too  hard. And Stoner always tries hard. He is the exact opposite \nof former 250  rival Dani Pedrosa. He is not  reticent, he never likes to take \na  step back, he  is always on  the  attack. His  style is all-action, from the \nmoment he leaves pit lane to when he returns. And he’s the same off the \nbike, happy to  fire  off a  volley at  anyone who dares criticise his  riding. \nExcellent, the paddock needs people like that! \nDo you  enjoy MotoGP more than you  enjoyed 125s and 250s? \nIt’s  a little bit more my  style, what I’ve grown up  to deal with, which is \n\nSTONER: ‘I EXPECTED IT TO  TAKE TWO YEARS, NOT TWO RACES’ 381 \ndirt track —  sliding and moving the bike around. That way of riding is a \nlittle more enjoyable for me, so  I feel more relaxed on  these bikes. \nSo your dirt-track training is now coming into play? \nWith MotoGP bikes it’s  not  so  much to do with the  settings. Of course, \nyou've still got to  get the best setting you can, but it’s not  all to do with \nthat. At  the  end of the  day you can  ride what you've got  and still be \ncompetitive, whereas with 125s and 250s it’s  very hard to make up  the \ntime if your settings aren’t any good. \nWe have more time to work on  set-up in MotoGP but if it’s not perfect \ngoing into the  race you can still get a good result out  of it. If you don’t \nhave the setting pretty much perfect in  125s and 250s you're pretty \nwell buggered for the  race. In MotoGP it’s a little easier to pull it out  of \nthe bag if the bike isn’t perfect, as  you’ve seen Rossi do many times. He \nqualifies terrible, then wins the  race. \nIn  MotoGP the  main thing you've got  to  do  is get  the  power to  the \nground and towards the end of the race is when that gets real important. \nIf you've got the  riding style and a  good feeling to  get the  power to  the \nground, you can  pretty much make whatever you want out  of the bike. \nDoes your style change much during the course of a race? \nYeah, \nat \nthe  \nstart \nof \nthe \nrace \nyou \ntrust \nthe  \ntyres \na \nlittle \nbit \nmore \nand \nyou \npush \nthe \nbike \ninto \nthe \ncorners \na \nlittle \nbit \nmore \nbecause \nthe \ntyres \nare \nthere. \nTowards \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \nrace \nyou \ntake \nit \na \nlittle \neasier, \nyou \njust \ntry \nand \nconcentrate \non \ngetting \nthe \nrear \ngrip \nto \nhook \nup \nand \nthat \nmakes \na \nlot \nof \ntime. \nIs that easy with traction control? \nI \ndon’t \nknow \nwhat \nthe \nYamaha \nand \nthe \nother \nbikes \nare \nlike. \nWith \nthe \nHonda \nthe \ntraction \ncontrol \nis \nthere \nto \na \ncertain \ndegree \nbut \nit \ndoesn’t \nhelp \na \nheck \nof \na \nlot. \nYeah, \nwhen \nthe \ntyres \nare \nterrible \nat \nthe \nend \nof \na \nrace \nthen \nit \ncan \nhelp \nbecause \nit \nsaves \nyou \nenergy \nand \nyou \ndon’t \nhave \nto \nconcentrate \nso \nhard \non \nkeeping \nthe \nthing \nhooked \nup. \nBut \nthe \nbikes \nare \na \nlot \nmore \npowerful \nthan \nanything \nelse \naround \nso \nthey \nneed \ntraction \ncontrol, \nif \nyou \ndidn’t \nhave \nit \nthe \ntyres \nwould \nbe \nbuggered \nin \na \nfew \nlaps, \nso \nit \ndefinitely \nhelps \nwhen \nthe \ntyres \naren’t \ngreat. \nIn  \npractice \nat  \nthe  \nSachsenring \nmy  \ntraction \ncontrol \nwasn’t \nworking \nbut \nI \nwas \nonly \na \ncouple \nof \ntenths \noff \nwhat \nI \nwas \nnormally \ndoing. \nIt’s \nno \n\n382 THE FAST STUFF \nbig deal; personally I just think it stops a  lot  of highsides and, yeah, \ninstead of the  tyre constantly spinning when it steps out, it only lets  it \ngo to  that certain place and it’s  still  hookin’ you up. \nAre you  impressed by the riders in MotoGP? \nYeah, definitely. I’m  impressed by the  fact that every week they’re up \nfront and they’re always fighting hard, there’s no  easy race. In  125s or \n250s, if you have a  good set-up and some people are  having a bad day, \nthat’s it, they’re nowhere to  be  seen. In  MotoGP everyone has a  good \nday at  every race pretty much, they’re always running up  front. That’s \nthe  hardest thing to  get your head around. \nWho impresses you  the most? \nValentino, of course, and I’ve  got a lot of respect for Dani. What Dani has \ndone this year is very impressive, I’m kind of proud to step up to MotoGP \nat  the  same time as  him. He  is running second in the  championship in \nhis first year; he can’t really be too  upset about that. If I had finished the \nraces I hadn’t finished I'd  be in a lot better place as  well, but  we  didn’t \ncome in this season to  even think of running where we  are  running, so \nI’ve got to  be happy with what we  are  doing. \nDo you gauge yourself against Dani? \nNot really, because we’re racing so  many more people. Last year in 250s \nit was kinda just us  two consistently running up  front. In MotoGP the \ntop five are  always running up  front, it’s  a lot harder work, it’s  not  just \nbetween me  and him. \nAre you mates? \nWe  used to  be  until we  were in  the  same class. He  doesn’t seem to \ncommunicate with me, at all, or  make any  eye  contact. I’ve  never had a \nproblem with him and I respect him as a racer, but  maybe he’s got  a \nproblem with me. I don’t know why, maybe because we  came through \nat  the  same time. We  both came through Alberto Puig’s schooling. But \nI've  got  no  problems with him and at  one stage we  got on  pretty well. \nAre you  sad you never got to race 500s? \nI’m  sure Dani's got  the  same opinion as  me. I’m a little frustrated with \nwhat some other riders have been saying, like we  wouldn’t be  going \n\nSTONER: \n‘I \nEXPECTED \nIT \nTO  \nTAKE \nTWO \nYEARS, \nNOT \nTWO \nRACES’ \n383 \nanywhere \nnear \nas  \nwell \nas  \nwe  \nare  \nnow \nif \nwe  \nwere \non  \n500s, \nthat \nyou've \ngot \nto \nride \nthe \n500s \ndifferently, \nstand \nthem \nup \nmore \nand \nall \nthe \nrest \nof \nit, \nbut \nat \na \nlot \nof \nthe \ntracks \nDani \nand \nI \nare \nstanding \nour \nbikes \nup \nmore \nthan \nthe \nseasoned \nguys, \nso \nthey \ncan’t \nreally \ntell \nus \nwe \nwouldn’t \nhave \nbeen \ngood \non \n500s. \nI think \neveryone \nshould \nkeep \ntheir \nopinions \nto themselves \nuntil \nthey’re \nproven. \nI \nwould \nreally \nhave \nliked \nto stayed \ntwo-stroke \nand \nraced \n500s. \nI \nmean, \nI’m \nimpressed \nwith \nthe \nfour-strokes \nand \nwhat \ntheir \npower \nis \nlike, \nbut \nI \nwould \nsay \nthat \nthey \nare \na \nlot \neasier \nto \nrider \nthan \nthe \n500s. \nI would’ve \nliked \nto \nhave \ntried \nthe \nsavage \npower \nof \nthe \n500s, \nI \nsuppose. \nWho is your coach these days? \nI just do  my  own thing, I have been for  a  few years now.

This is how JB learned \nhis  legendary problem-solving skills \nEngines and engineering would seem to run in Jeremy Burgess’ blood. \nA  century before JB  won his  first world championship with Wayne \nGardner in 1987, his great-uncles David and John Shearer were creating \nAustralia’s first motor car, a  wood-burning, steam-driven vehicle \nequipped with a  differential, a decade before Henry Ford’s seminal Tin \nLizzy featured a  diff. The Shearer creation now takes pride of place in \nAustralia’s national motor museum, near Adelaide, JB’s hometown. \n‘The car  looks like  anything that Benz built in the  first days when all \nthose guys realised that trains ran  on  rails and that a  smaller steam \nengine would drive something on  the  road,’ says Burgess, a self-taught \nengineer who isn’t so  sure that engines do run  in his blood. He  reckons \nhis  love of engineering is a factor of nurture, not  nature, of his  growing \nup  on  the  family farm, surrounded by agricultural machinery. \n‘My father always insisted that my mechanical knowledge came \nfrom the  Shearers but  my brother is a lawyer and my  sister is a  doctor, \nso  I’m  not  so  sure,’ he adds. ‘I think any  young bloke growing up  on  a \nfarm in  the  Adelaide hills with machinery all  around would’ve picked \nup  on  all of that.’ \nWhat seems more certain is that the rough and tumble of rural Aussie \nlife and then of the Aussie bike-racing circuit equipped JB with the ability \nand the resolve to get stuck in and solve problems quickly. Where others \nget sidetracked by  the bullshit and complexity of  modern racing, \nJB  always gets to  the  nub. It is this  no-nonsense attitude and a straight- \nforward intelligence that has made him bike racing’s most successful \n\nTHE JB  MANTRA: KEEP IT  SIMPLE, STUPID 387 \nengineer of the  past two decades. Burgess followed Gardner’s 1987 500 \ntitle with a further ten  premier-class world championships between 1994 \nand 2005, five with Mick Doohan and five with Valentino Rossi. \nJB  started his  love affair with internal combustion engineering at \neight years old, in  1961. ‘I was driving at eight and bought my  first car \nat  12.  The idea of buying the  car,  as  the  old  man saw it, was to  tinker \nwith it, but  my  idea was to  get it going as  fast as  we  could and milk his \ntank for petrol.’ \nAt  15  he got his  first bike, an  ancient Velocette scrambler. ‘Someone \nhad converted it to  run on  alcohol and it kept bending valves, so  we \nplayed around with that.’ He  didn’t know it at  the  time but he  was \ngetting sucked in.  He  bought his  first road bike, a Suzuki T500 twin, a \nyear or  so  later, and then a Kawasaki 750  triple in  1972. ‘Your first years \nout  of school you  never really know what you're going to do and I don’t \nknow why I suddenly went out  and bought a  Mach 4 but  I did  and as \nsoon as  I got it I was racing it.  I suppose my  mates were doing it, that \nwas the  starting point, then you realise you enjoy it. \nSome things just take over your life.’ \nIt  might all  have ended there if  JB  had been ‘I was exceptionally \nconscripted \nto \njoin \nthe \nAustralian \narmy, \nwhich \nwas \nclose \nto \ngetting \nmired \nin \nVietnam \nwith \nthe \nAmericans. \n‘I \nwas \nconscripted \nfor \nexceptionally \nclose \nto \ngetting \nconscripted. \nI \nhad \nto \nVietnam, \nbut \nI \nwas \nregister \nby \nDecember \n31 \n1973 \nto \ncome \nup \nfor \nthe \ngoing \nto \ndodge \nit, \ndraft \nin \nthe \nfirst \nsix \nmonths \nof \nthe \nnext \nyear, \nbut \nanyway’ \nfortunately \nour \ngovernment \nchanged \nin  \nDecember \nere \nee \nand \nwe  \ndidn’t \nhave \nto  \nworry \nabout \nit.  \nI \nwasn’t \ngoing \nto  \nregister \nanyway, \nI \nwas \ngoing \nto  \ndodge \nit.  \nMy  \nfather \nhad \nalways \nsaid \nhe  \ndidn’t \nraise \ntwo \nsons \nto  \nhave \nthem \nkilled \nin \na  \nstupid \nwar.’ \nSaved \nfrom \nVietnam, \nJB  \ngot  \nserious \nabout \nracing. \nHe  \nbought \ntwo \nTZ350s \nto \ngo \nwith \nthe  \nKawa \ntriple, \nthen \nin  \n1976 \ntraded \nthem \nin \nfor \none \nof \nSuzuki’s \nnew \nRG500s. \nHe \nwas \nearning \ngood \nmoney \nworking \nfor \na \ndrilling \ncompany \nand \nthe \nlocal \nbrickworks, \nwinning \nplenty \nof \nraces \nand \ndriving \nplenty \nof \nmiles \n— \n26 \nhours \nto \nPerth, \n23 \nhours \nto \nSurfers \nParadise \non \nthe \nGold \nCoast. \n‘Racing \nconsumed \nme. \nI \nfelt \nI \nwas \npretty \ngood \nat \nit, \nI \nmade \nit \nall \nthe \nway \nto \nA \ngrade \npretty \nquickly, \nwhere \nI \nwas \nup \nagainst \nguys \nlike \nGregg \nHansford, \nthe \nWilling \nbrothers, \nJohn \nWoodley \nand \nKenny \nBlake, \nall \nthe \nguys \nwho \nwent \non \nto \nEurope.’ \nJB  \ndecided \nhe \nneeded \nmore \nhorsepower \nto  \nstay \nwith \nthis \nremarkable \n\n388 THE FAST STUFF \ngeneration of Aussie riders, so  he  sold the  RG  in  1979 and bought a \nTZ750. ‘It wasn’t the  smartest thing I ever did. Compared to the  Suzuki \nthe TZ didn’t have the calibre, it just wasn’t a purebred racing motorcycle \nlike  the  RG,  it was cheap, but  they made bucket loads of them and they \ndid  a good job.’ \nBy now JB  was starting to  dream about joining Hansford and the \nrest in Europe. But in the  end he made the  trip as  a holidaymaker, not \nas  a  racer. His  own racing career lost momentum after his  travelling \ncompanion got killed in a streetbike crash. ‘I never retired, I just stopped \ndoing it!’  At  the  end of ’79  JB  sold his  race bikes, took six  weeks off \nwork and headed to  Europe, part holiday, part recce, just in  case he \ndecided to  continue racing. Inevitably his  savings ran  out  sooner than \nexpected and he applied for a job as  mechanic to racing prodigy Randy \nMamola, who had just signed for  Suzuki. \nJB’s bike preparation in Australian championship racing had always \nbeen immaculate and it was this reputation that got him the job working \non  Mamola’s factory RG500s. ‘The guys at  Suzuki knew my RG ran  when \nothers broke,’ says JB, who still works by his  father’s axiom, the  five  Ps: \nperfect preparation prevents poor performance. So  his  fascination with \nall things mechanical was starting to pay big dividends and had put him \non  the road to world-class success. ‘When I was racing back home, mates \nwould drive up  the  driveway with their girlfriends and I’d  be up  to  my \nelbows in a TZ  gearbox or  an  RG  rotary valve or  whatever. They'd hang \naround for  half an  hour and then go  off,  but  I never felt  compelled to \ndrop the  tools and go with them, I was doing what I wanted to  do.’ \nBurgess fettled Mamola’s bikes for  three years, winning five GPs, \nthen when Suzuki downsized to  a  one-man team in  1983 he  got  a job \nwith HRC, spannering for Ron Haslam. He worked with Freddie Spencer \nduring the  American’s unique 250/500 title-winning year in  1985 and \ngot his  first crew chief job with Gardner the  following season. In  1987 \nJB  and the Wollongong wild one defeated reigning champ Eddie \nLawson to win the  500 title. In  1989 Burgess was assigned the  task of \nhoning \nHonda’s \nnew \nsigning, \nthe \nfast \nbut \nscary \nDoohan. \nThe \npair \nwon \nfive \nback-to-back \ntitles \nfrom \n1994, \nthen \nwhen \nDoohan \nquit \nin \n1999, \nHRC \nsigned \nRossi \nand \nput \nhim \nto \nwork \nwith \nBurgess. \nSome \ncritics \nsuggest \nthat \nJB \nhas \nbeen \nlucky \nto \nwork \nwith \ngenius \nriders, \nbut \nthat’s \nnonsense; \nHRC \nunderstood \nhis \ntalent \nfor \ngetting \nthe \nbest \nout \nof \nboth \nman \nand \nmachine \nand \nthus \ngave \nhim \ntheir \nmost \nvaluable \nriders. \n\nTHE \nJB  \nMANTRA: \nKEEP \nIT  \nSIMPLE, \nSTUPID \n389 \nJB’s \nwinning \nsecret: \ndon’t \ncomplicate \nthings \nBurgess \nis  \nfamously \nblunt \n(‘When \nyou \nsay  \nI’m \nblunt, \ndo  \nyou \nmean \nrude?’) \nbecause \nhe \nbelieves \nthere’s \nno  \ntime \nin \nracing \nfor \ncloaking \nwhat \nhe’s \ngot \nto \nsay \nin \ndiplomacy. \nIf \nsomething’s \nnot \nright \nor \nsomeone’s \nnot \ndoing \ntheir \njob \nproperly, \nhe \ncalls \na \nspade \na \nbloody \nspade. \nHis \ninsistence \non \nalways \nstanding \nhis \nground \n— \neven \nwhen \nhe’s \nworking \nwith \na \nsuperstar \nrider \n— \ngets \nhim \nrespect \nand \nresults. \nBut it is his  problem-solving abilities that have contributed most to \nhis  success, and JB  believes that this talent comes from his  days of \nmaking do.  ‘When I worked for  that drilling company we  were always \nin the  bush. So you're 500 miles from the  city and you can’t get a new \npart, so  you've got  to  fix what you've got, so  you heat it, weld it, cut  it, \nwhatever. The mentality is there —  how can  we  keep it going?’ \nAlthough the make-do mentality no  longer applies in top-level racing \nwhere parts mileage is automatically logged by computer and everything \nis  replaced in  good time, the process of  thinking your way through \nproblems does still count. JB’s approach is  always straightforward, \nunlike many engineers who seem to get too  caught up in the complexity \nof it all,  and it is ironic that the  more complicated racing becomes, the \nmore vital it is to  have a  simple approach. Burgess is a big picture man, \nalways determined to  simplify and demystify, so  here comes another \nfavourite maxim: the  KISS principle —  keep it simple, stupid. \n‘It’s the  same in  all  sports,’ he  says. ‘Look at  soccer, there are  three \nsides to  the  game —  when they’ve got the ball, when you've got the ball \nand when no  one’s got the ball. How much more difficult than that can \nit be? It’s  the  same in motorcycle racing, everything on  a motorcycle is \nmechanical, so  it either works or  it doesn’t. Every rider is going to have \nproblems, and problems are  only questions that don’t have answers, so \nyou \nfind \nthe \nanswer. \nAnd \nwhen \nyour \nrider \ncomes \ninto \nthe \npits \nhe’s \nalways \ngoing \nto \nspeak \nabout \nhis \nbiggest \nproblem \nfirst, \notherwise \nhe’s \na \ncomplete \nnitwit. \nIt’s \nthat \nsimple. \nMaybe \nI’m \nso \ndumb \nI \ncan \nonly \nsee \nthe \nbig \nthings \nbut \nI \nthink \nyou \nshould \nfix \nyour \nbigger \nproblems \nfirst \nand \nthen \nyou \nmove \non. \nA \nlot \nof \npeople \nget \nwound \nup \nabout \nsmall \nthings.’ \nJB’s \njob \nis \nto  \noversee \nthe  \nweekend’s \nwork, \nmaking \nsure \nthat \na  \ndozen \nYamaha \nengineers, \na \nMichelin \ntyre \nengineer, \nan \nOhlins \nsuspension \ntechnician \nand \nRossi’s \nmechanics \nare \nall \nworking \ntogether \nto \nget \nthe \nbest \nresult. \n‘If \nI \nwas \nto \ndescribe \nmyself, \nI’m \nthe \nnon-specific \nguy,’ \nhe \nexplains. \n‘A \nmodern \nracing \nmotorcycle \nis \nso \nsophisticated \nthat \nit’s \n\n390 THE FAST STUFF \nimpossible for one or  two or  even three men to work on  it, it demands \nmuch more than that, but there has to  be  someone who has an \nunderstanding and a  feeling for  what the rider is  trying to  explain. \nOver the  years I’ve become Valentino when Valentino goes back to  his \nmotorhome because the  data engineer taking the  information off  the \ncomputer needs someone there to  tell  him what Valentino was saying. \nThere’s a lot to be done, so  someone has  to  organise and prioritise how \nmuch time we  can  give between one  practice and the next on a particular \nproblem and what steps we’re going to  take to reduce that problem.’ \nJB’S dream garage \nLike most people in  MotoGP, Burgess thinks much more about the \nfuture than the  past: ‘We’re always pushing into the  space age, going \nfaster and faster,’ he  says. But when he  finally retires in  a  few years, \nhe’s all set  to  take a little trip down memory lane. \n‘Currently all I’ve  got in the  shed is  a CB1100RC (legendary early 1980s \nsuperbike) and a KE175 trail bike but in the next few years Id like  to pick \nup  one  or  two pieces that are  of interest to  me. My dream garage would \nstart off with a car, a Mk2 Jaguar. It wouldn’t be difficult to do one  of them \nin cherry condition. Then a ‘69 Bonneville, I’ve always wanted one  of them. \nAnd I wouldn’t mind putting together a bike that no  one  ever talks about \nanymore, the T500 Suzuki, because I had one  years back and  the bike’s got \na lot of history. Any more than that and you're in trouble.’ \nTypically, JB refuses to get excited about the exorbitant prices currently \nbeing achieved by old race bikes. ‘Both my TZ750 and my  RG  have been \nrestored by others and sold. The RG  went the  other day for  $33,000 and \nthe  750  went for  similar money. But if I’d  put the  money in  the  bank \nwhen I sold the bikes, with compound interest it’d come up to almost 30 \ngrand anyway. These bikes sound expensive but  they aren’t really.’ \nMotoGP Mutterings: November 2006 \nTwo-strokes were banned from MotoGP at  the end of  2006 -  a \ngood thing or  a bad thing, depending on  which way you look at it \nSo  it’s  goodbye to  the 990s —  the fastest race bikes ever seen on \nthis planet are to  be  dumped in  the dustbin of  racing history. No \ndoubt Valentino Rossi was on  the money when he  said: ‘Maybe \n\nA \nGOOD \nTHING \nOR  \nA  \nBAD \nTHING \nBoll \nwe  \nare  \nlucky \nto  \nbe  \nracing \nthese \nbikes, \nbecause \nsoon \nthey \nwill \nbecome \nlegend’. \nThe \n990s \naren’t \nthe  \nonly \nmonsters \nbeing \nregulated \ninto \nextinction. \nWhile \nrobbing \nus \nof \nwondrous \nmachines \nlike \nHonda’s \nRC211V, \nthe \npowers \nthat \nbe \n(that’s \nthe \nMotorcycle \nSports \nManufacturers’ \nAssociation) \nhave \nalso \ntaken \nthe \nchance \nto \nquietly \nrid \nMotoGP \nof \ntwo- \nstrokes \nfrom \n1 \nJanuary \n2007. \nThat’s \nright, \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nin \nmore \nthan \nhalf \na.century \nof \nGP \nracing, \ntwo-strokes \nare \nto \nbe \nbanned \nfrom \nthe \npremier \nclass. \nAs \nRossi’s \ncrew \nchief \nJeremy \nBurgess \nsays: \n‘You \nonly \nban \nthings \nwhen \nyou're \nscared \nof \nthem’. \nOf  course, the  writing had been on  the  wall since 2002, when the \nMSMA welcomed back four-strokes with a  98  per cent capacity \nadvantage over the  500cc strokers. But while the  two-strokes have been \nliving on  death row, I’ve liked to  dream that some rogue cell  within \nHRC was secretly toiling away on  a wildly updated NSR500 that would \nhumble the  990s, bankrolled by some Yakuza drugs baron who goes all \nwatery-eyed on  recalling his  teenage years spent popping wheelies on \nhis  RD350LC through the  Tokyo night. Perhaps my  dream was more \nthan mere fantasy, however, because some Japanese engineers strongly \nprotested against favouring the  four-strokes so  heavily. If the  ‘diesels’ \nget 990cc, so  should the  ‘stinkwheels’, they argued. Rough calculations \nsuggested an  NSR990 would make 420 horsepower... \nBut we  may as  well stop dreaming because it isn’t going to  happen. \nTwo-strokes have now been banished to  the cheap end of  the GP \npaddock, away from the  high-gloss MotoGP pits and VIP units to  the \n250 and 125 ghettos. No  bubble-wrapped motors air-freighted from \nJapan for  these people, only blood, sweat and riffler files. \nThere \nis \ndefinitely \na \nromance \nthat \nhangs \naround \ntwo-stroke \nGP \nbikes. \nEngines \nare  \nstill \nstripped \nafter \nevery \npractice \nsession \n(despite \ndetonation \nsensors \nand \nendoscopes) \nso \nthat \nmechanics \ncan \npore \nover \npistons, \ncarefully \nexamining \nburn \npatterns, \nlike \ngypsies \nreading \ntea \nleaves. \nAnd \nthen \nthese \n21st \ncentury \nsorcerers \nopen \ncaskets \nof \nstrange \ntreasures \n— \nmain \njets \nand \nneedle \njets \n— \nand \nput \ntheir \nhands \nupon \nbizarre \ndevices \n— \nreed \nvalves \nand \nrotary \nvalves \n— \nas \nthey \nchase \nperformance \nnirvana. \nNo \nwonder \nmechanics \nlove \nthem. \n‘I \nenjoy \ntwo-strokes \nmore,’ \nsays \nBrit \nTrevor \nMorris \nwho \nused \nto \nwork \non \nNicky \nHayden’s \nRCVs \nbut \nnow \nlooks \nafter \nYuki \nTakahashi’s \nHonda \nRS250s. \n‘Even \nmy \nkids \nnotice \nit \nbecause \nI \ncome \nhome \nwith \na \nsmile \non \nmy \nface. \nIt’s \nmore \n\n392 THE FAST STUFF \ndemanding, it’s  more involved, you feel like you’re a  mechanic, not  a \nparts fitter.’ \nAnd there is more. Two-stroke advocates argue that the  acute nature \nof the two-stroke race bike —  both in its set-up and behaviour —  educates \nracers better. This is why, they say,  MotoGP is packed with former 125 \nand 250 riders, not  ex-Superbike or  Supersport men. ‘Top MotoGP guys \ncome from categories in which you don’t just use  the  bike, you must \nknow about set-up,’ says Harald Bartol, KTM’s 125  and 250 engineer. \n‘To  me, 600s is donkey racing. A 600 is not  a  race bike, it’s  not  a race- \nhorse.’ The ACU, who axed the  250 British series in  favour of  600s, \nshould ponder Bartol’s words as  they consider the lack of British talent \nin MotoGP. \nBut perhaps it won’t always be  so.  Racing technology is  getting so \ngood that a  two-stroke education may soon be  unnecessary. Burgess \nadds that MotoGP engines are  already largely ‘self-adjusting’. And \nMorris admits that while changing a  gearbox ratio by less than 2mph \ncan  crucially affect a two-stroke’s performance, 4mph either way is fine \non  a MotoGP bike. So who needs the  finely trained ear  of a  two-stroke \nracer? Then there is  Bartol complaining that some KTM GP  rookies \nwho don’t even know when an  engine has seized. But there’s good \nreason for  this. Massive improvements in lubrication, carburation and \nmetallurgy mean that youngsters may never have experienced a seizure, \nso  they don’t have ears tuned to  anticipate the  stroker’s death rattle or \nthe  gunslinger clutch-hand reactions that may have saved their lives a \nfew decades ago. \nThe 250s and 125s aren’t set  to  disappear from GPs any time now \n(250s are  safe till 2012, 125s to 2014) but  they will go eventually, which \nwill be a  tragedy because there is nothing more graceful on  a racetrack \nthan a 250 GP bike. But as  for two-stroke romance? Try that on  someone \nstuck in,  say, rush-hour Jakarta surrounded by  a  thousand ancient \nmopeds belching poisonous smoke, their throats on  fire and all  but \nblinded by tears... \n\nCHAPTER 51 \nPRO-AM: \nTHE \nPRODUCT \nOF  \nA  \nSICK \nAND \nTWISTED \nMIND \nMarch 2007 \nYamaha’s \ninfamous \none-make \n350LC \nseries \nstunned \nTV \nviewers \nwith \nits \nscary \non-track \nviolence \nand \nmade \nstars \nout \nof \nyoung \nBritish \nriders \nYamaha’s Pro-Am championship was Britain’s most notorious race \nseries of the  early 1980s, a  crazed one-make championship apparently \ncreated by some sick and twisted mind to  cause maximum mayhem \nand carnage for  sensation-hungry TV viewers. \nPro-Am was dreamed up by the British Yamaha importers to promote \na motorcycle that needed no  promotion —  the company’s race-developed \nRD250LC and RD350LC were the nation’s most lusted-after motorcycles \neven before the series made it  onto ITV’s World of Sport during the \nsummer of 1981. \nOf course, Pro-Am wasn’t just genius lowbrow TV  entertainment, it \nalso played a  significant role in building our  racing stars of the  1980s. \nIn  1987 Britain had five factory riders in  the  500 world championship \n—  Niall Mackenzie, Rob McElnea, Kenny Irons, Roger Burnett and Ron \nHaslam —  and ail  but Rocket Ron had cut  their teeth and sharpened \ntheir elbows in  Pro-Am. \nOne-make \nracing \nchampionships \nweren't \nanything \nnew. \nFrance’s \nCoupe \nKawasaki \nhad \nbred \nstars \nlike \nChristian \nSarron \nand \nPatrick \nPons \nduring \nthe \n1970s, \nand \nBritish \nclub \nracing \nwas \nalready \neffectively \na \none-make \naffair \nwith \nLCs \ndominating \nfrom \nKnockhill \nto \nBrands \nHatch. \nBut \nPro-Am \nwas \nunique \nbecause \nthe \nspecially \nchosen \nriders, \nsupposedly \nthe \ncream \nof \nyoung \nBritish \ntalent, \nturned \nup \nat \neach \nrace \nand \nwere \nallocated \nbikes \nby \nlucky \ndip, \nthe \nriders \npicking \nignition \nkeys \nout \nof \na \nhelmet. \nTuning \nand \ncheating \nwere \nthus \nimpossible, \nso \nthe \nracing \nwas \nalways \nstupidly \nclose. \nPro-Am \nwas \nmotorcycling’s \nbastard \noffspring \nof \nthe  \nmovie \nRollerball, \na \nkind \nof \nX \nFactor \nwith \nGBH: \ntake \n25 \nof \nthe \nnation’s \nmost \npromising, \n\n394 THE FAST STUFF \nmost desperate under-24 racers, give them free motorcycles and tell \nthem they don’t have to fix them when they crash, offer them foolishly \ngenerous prize money and broadcast the  racing on  national TV  at  a \ntime when very little bike racing made it onto the  box. It was a recipe \nfor  disaster and great television with crashes aplenty and ten-rider \ndogfights for  the  lead. They even used to  get  Barry Sheene to  do  the \ncommentary. ‘Blimey,’ he’d say.  ‘You need a Valium to watch this.’ \nWith no  way of gaining a  technical advantage over \nyour rivals, Pro-Am came down to  knees, elbows and \n‘You were racing some of the dirtiest riding ever seen on  a racetrack. The \nagainst criminals, organisers did their best to keep it clean but roadracing, \ndrunkards, bike and especially production bike racing, were already \nthieves...” pretty loose at that time, just like life itself with Britain \nin a state of high anxiety, experiencing desperately high \nunemployment, nationwide inner-city rioting and the \ndeath throes of punk rock. As Mackenzie remembers: ‘Proddie racing was \nreally aggressive back then, everyone was completely mad, you were racing \nagainst criminals, drunkards, bike thieves and good people as  well.’ \nI got a Pro-Am ride in  1983 after a successful season of LC club racing, \nby which time the more experienced riders had sharpened their ferocious \ntactics to  a  knife point. I was one of  the  Ams, baby-faced hopefuls \nembarking on  national careers after success at club level, while the  Pros \nwere established national riders like  Mackenzie, Irons and Ray Swann. \nSo  I was the  kid  moving up  to  big  school, gawping wide-eyed at  the \nbadness of  the older boys. And they were bad, very bad; I’d  never \nexperienced such murderousness and  vindictiveness on  the racetrack. \nYou  were never safe in a  Pro-Am race. Into corners, through corners \nand out  of corners there were always a  few homicidal maniacs to  your \nleft, a villainous fool or  two to  your right. Even the  straights were free- \nfor-alls, you'd be  riding along, stretching the  throttle cable to  breaking \npoint when the  revs would drop and the bike would break into a weave \nbecause some idiot you’d just outbraked into the  previous corner had \nsnuck into your draft, grabbed hold of your LC’s pillion grabrail and was \nin  the  process of hauling himself past you, with a  speed advantage of, \noooh, maybe half a  mile an  hour. And that was the  nice bit.  If he  did \nmanage to maintain his  momentum despite you getting busy with your \nknees and elbows, he might nudge your kill switch as  he sneaked ahead, \nnot  good if there’s another half dozen riders chasing your slipstream.

The latest brakers would hurtle towards the \ncorner, forks fully bottomed-out and juddering madly, rear ends yawing \ncrazily and only when it seemed far  too  late would they dare tip into \nthe turn, tyres sliding, bikes bucking, handlebars tangling. In  such \nclose encounters it wasn’t unusual for  the  leader to  slip four or  five \nplaces in one corner, then regain the  lead a  few corners later. \nFor  this reason Pro-Am wasn’t the  greatest of racing schools. The LCs \nwere slow and very easy to ride, so  classy riding techniques were always \nvanquished by naked aggression. Of  course, the fastest way round a \nracetrack \nwas \nnice \nand \nsmooth \nwith \nbig \narcing \nlines \nbut \nyou \nnever \ngot \nthe \nchance \nto \nride \nlike \nthat. \nThere \nwas \nalways \nsomeone \ntrying \nto \ncome \nup \nthe \ninside \nor \naround \nthe \noutside, \nso \nyou \nhad \nto \nride \ntight, \ndefensive \nlines \nor \ncruel, \nvicious \nattacking \nlines, \ndepending \non \nthe \nsituation. \nTrue, \nPro-Am \ndid \nteach \nracers \nplenty \nabout \novertaking \nbut \nit  \nwas \nmore \nuseful \nfor \npromotional \npurposes. \nIt \ngave \nwild \nyoung \nmen \nthe \nchance \nto \nprove \nthemselves \nin \na \nhigh-profile \nchampionship \nthat \nenjoyed \nmassive \nTV \ncoverage, \nthough \nthere \nwere \ndownsides \nto \nthe \nlive \nbroadcasts. \n‘I \nwas \nbunking \noff \nwork \nto \ngo \nracing \nat \nDonington,’ \nrecalls \nMackenzie. \n‘ITV \nwere \nshowing \nthe \nPro-Am \nrace \nlive, \nso \nmy \nboss \nwas \nsitting \nwatching \nme \non \ntelly \nwhile \nI \nwas \nmeant \nto \nbe \ndigging \nholes \nfor \nthe \nelectricity \nboard. \nMy \ncover \nwas \nblown.’ \n\n396 THE FAST STUFF \nRiders like Mackenzie used Pro-Am as  a shop window to woo sponsors \nand they also survived on  the  championship’s generous prize money. \nFirst place paid a dazzling £500 at a time when ninth or  tenth place in a \nBritish TT  Fl  race would pay  £10. Mackenzie reckons that the  Pro-Am \nbooty helped him to quit digging holes and turn professional in  1983. \nSuch was the championship’s success that it inevitably spawned spin- \noffs, including pan-European Pro-Am finals and a  Two-Four challenge \nconsisting of an  LC race and an  MG Maestro race (this was indisputably \nthe funniest motorsport event ever, with Pro-Am riders trashing a dozen \nMaestros and possibly contributing to British Leyland’s ultimate demise). \nI never got to race a Maestro but  I did make the  five-strong British team \nfor the  1983 European final as  top-placed Am, thanks in part to a third- \nplace finish at  Snetterton behind Mackenzie and Irons. \nThe ’83 Euro final at  Hockenheim was Pro-Am insanity on  an \ninternational scale. Mackenzie, Irons and Graeme Cannell ganged up \non  the  French favourite during practice, hunting him down on  one of \nthe  German track’s autobahn-like straights and running him onto the \ngrass at  high speed. He  returned to  the  pits a  tearful, gibbering wreck \nand never bothered them again. \nObviously the bad boys of the British crew behaved just as disgracefully \noff the  track, getting drunk, crashing hire cars and devising ever more \nmendacious ways of  dealing with their rivals. With the fastest \nFrenchman out  of the  running, their main concern was fifth Brit Steve \nChambers, a  quiet, well-behaved racer who steered well clear of  his \nne’er-do-well compatriots. They messed with his  head by  slipping a \nlocal hooker into his  hotel room at  3am on  race day. That afternoon \nCannell beat Chambers by a  fraction, Mackenzie fourth, me  nowhere. \nThe British series enjoyed its  final year in  1984. Since then there \nhave been several other one-make race series but  none has  ever caught \nthe  imagination quite like  Pro-Am. \nHow Pro-Am helped build Britain’s stars of the 1980s _ \nThe  Pro-Am entry list reads like  a who’s who of 1980s and 1990s racing \nstardom. Niall Mackenzie, Rob McElnea, Kenny Irons and Roger \nBurnett all  went on  to  contest 500 GPs on  factory bikes, while Alan \nCarter went one better and actually won a GP  and Damon Hill went on \nto win the  1996 Formula One car  title, 14 years after he had thrashed a \nhumble LC  around Cadwell and Snetterton. Then there were Graeme \n\nPRO-AM: \nTHE \nPRODUCT \nOF  \nA  \nSICK \nAND \nTWISTED \nMIND \n397 \nCannell, \nAndy \nWatts, \nKevin \n‘Mad \nDog’ \nMitchell, \nSteve \nChambers, \nRay \nSwann, \nMark \nPhillips, \nNeil \nRobinson, \nAlex \nBedford, \nGary \nPadgett \nand \nPete \nWild, \nall great \nracers, \nseveral \nof them \nsadly \nno \nlonger \nwith \nus. \nBut what role did Pro-Am play in  building the careers of  these \nyoungsters? ‘The championship was certainly good, it really set  me  up,’ \nsays Mackenzie, who began his  Pro-Am career in  1981 as  an  amateur. \n‘But it may have only been coincidence that so  many of us  made it into \n500  GPs.’ \nMcElnea, who contested the  inaugural Pro-Am season as a pro, is \nconvinced the  series did  help the amateurs make it big. ‘It was just a bit \nof a laugh for the  pros but  it really did  help the  ams, it put  them in the \nshop window and the  money was big,’ says Rob Mac, who now runs \nYamaha’s one-make Ré6  series. ‘Pro-Am was perfect for  them because \nthey were desperate to  make a  name for  themselves and they did \nexactly that because they were racing on  a premier-league stage.’ \nThe RD350LC: ‘You could get  away with murder’ \nThe real star of the  Pro-Am championship was Yamaha’s RD350LC, the \nliquid-cooled successor to  the  air-cooled RD400 and loosely based on \nthe factory’s TZ  race bikes. The 350LC and its  250 sibling were the \nperfect proddie race bikes and dominated British club racing for years. \nIn  Pro-Am form they were pretty much bog-standard, fitted with \nnumber \nplates \nand \nDunlop \nTT100 \ntyres. \nAnd \nthere \nwas \nno \nchance \nof \ncheating \nbecause \nriders \nweren’t \neven \nallowed \nto \ntouch \nthe \nbikes \nallocated to  them for that race. \n‘The \nLC  \nwas \nway \nahead \nof \nits  \ntime,’ \nsays \nNiall \nMackenzie. \n‘I \nride \none \nnow \nand \nit’s  \nstill  \nan  \nokay \nroad \nbike. \nBack \nthen \nthe  \nLC \nhad \ngood \nsuspension, \ngood \ngrip \nand \nhandled \nwell. \nThey \nwere \nreally \nforgiving \nso  \nwe  \ncould \nstay \non  \nboard, \n‘I \nwould \nride \nhard \nmost \nof \nthe  \ntime, \nanyway.’ \nfor \na \nfew \nlaps \ntill \nthe \nRob \nMcElInea \nadds: \n‘We \nused \nto \nthrash \nthe \nfuck \nout \ntyres \nwent \nall \nfunny \nof \nthem \nall \nthe \ntime, \nit \nwas \nterrible. \nThey \nwere \na \nmega \nand \nthen \ngo \n“fuck \nbike, \nbut \nthey \nwere \nall \nover \nthe \nshop \nas \nsoon \nas \nthe \nthis!” \nIt \nwas \nmental’ \ntyres \ngot  \nwarm, \nthey \nwere \nreally \nscary \ngoing \ndown \nCraner \nat  \nDonington. \nI’d  \nnever \nraced \non  \nroad \ntyres \nso \nI \nwould \nride \nhard \nfor \na \nfew  \nlaps \ntill \nthe  \ntyres \nwent \nall  \nfunny \nand \nthen \ngo \n“fuck \nthis!” \nIt \nwas \nmental. \nBut  \nyou \ncould \nride \nthem \nso  \nhard \nand \nthey’d \njust \nfloat \nall \nover \nthe \nplace, \nyou \ncould \nget \naway \nwith \nmurder \non \nthem.’ \n\nCHAPTER 52 \n“EVERYTHING NOW IS  SYNTHESIZED \n—  THE TT  IS  THE REAL THING \nMay 2007 \nBritish racer Nick Jefferies —  who experienced both joy and \nmisery during four decades of  racing in  the Isle of  Man TT  - \nexplains why he  has never stopped loving the world’s most \ndangerous race \nNick Jefferies only scored one  Isle of Man TT victory but  for many years \nhe  was Mr  TT.  Always a  staunch defender of racing on  the  Island, he \nraced the  Mountain circuit every year from 1975 to  2003, starting 18 \nManx GPs, 67 TTs  and scoring 18 TT podiums, including that Fl  win in \n1993. During those years he rode pretty much everything —  from official \nYamahas and Hondas to  the  Britten and a BMW K100 proddie bike. \nJefferies, now in his  50s, comes from a Yorkshire family in the  north \nof England that is inextricably linked to  the  event, through both glory \nand tragedy. His  father Allan rode his  first TT  in  1933 and finished \nsecond to  Geoff Duke in  his  last, the 1949 Clubmans Senior TT.  His \nbrother Tony won three TTs  in  the  early 1970s and his  nephew Dave \nbecame an  Island great by scoring three consecutive hat tricks from \n1999 to 2002 before losing his  life in a high-speed crash during practice \nfor  the  2003 races. Remarkably, Jefferies was back on  the  Island just a \ncouple of  months after DJ’s death, doing the  Manx GP  classic race \naboard a Manx Norton. \nYou grew up in a  TT family; what made it so attractive? \nIt’s  the  nearest thing to  riding your road bike on  that imaginary road \nyou had in  mind when you were falling asleep at  night, that road in \nWales or  Scotland or  wherever, where you could really have a  go.  The \nTT  did  all that for me. Before I started racing, when I was trials riding, \nI was always tear-arsing around the  Yorkshire roads. I had my  own \nimaginary TT course, of similar length to the TT, and I used to  go out  in \n\n“EVERYTHING NOW IS  SYNTHESIZED —  THE TT  IS  THE REAL THING 399 \nthe  early mornings or  late evenings and time myself around this route. \nI was probably a menace to  all road users. So when I first rode the TT, \nthe circuit was so  good compared to  what I’d  been doing on  the \nYorkshire roads that it didn’t seem that hard. Not to  say  it was easy. \nI did all the road circuits —  Macau, the  North West 200, Scarborough, \nand I won the  Ulster GP.  I used to  find Donington and other short \ncircuits a real challenge and I loved them but  I got a bit dizzy and it was \nall a bit frenetic. The TT was all more gentlemanly, they line you up one \nat  a  time, then they come to your number and it’s  ‘Right, Mr  Jefferies, \nit’s  your turn to  go,  off you go  now’. I felt  it was a  more gentlemanly \nway of racing. I wasn’t a very good dicer, I wasn’t good at  pushing the \nfront wheel underneath other riders. I wasn’t good at that, it didn’t suit \nme. I just love the  Isle  of Man, being given the  freedom to  ride at  my \nown pace, it just suited me. I’m  not  suggesting that it’s  the only way to \ngo racing. \nAnd what was  your own pace? \nI used to ride damn hard. I used to go as  fast  as  I could.

I’ve been off five times round there, three big ones, bad \nnews. The first big one, I had just been passed by Carl Fogarty, it was in the \nwet 1990 Senior TT.  He  passed me  and I was on a slick rear and treaded \nfront. I just rode it too hard on  the wrong tyres trying to keep up with him. \nI lost it after Sarah’s Cottage, going onto the  Cronk-y-Voddy straight. I \nknocked myself about a bit: bad ankle, bad shoulder, bad lots of things. \nThe other one was when I had an  experimental gearbox seize on  a \nCBR600 in  morning practice. I’d  just caught Joey Dunlop going into \nGreeba Castle and that was the  last thing I knew. I was quite poorly \nfrom that, lost  all the ligaments in me  knee from that one, that was an \nunconscious job. \nThe third one was when the  suspension collapsed on  my  RC45. It \nwas our  fault, we’d modified the  shock. The whole back end collapsed \nbefore the  left  hander after Ballacraine. I was off  the  bike before I got \nto the bend. That was another airlift [helicopter] job. I lost the ligaments \nin  me  other knee, broken toes, broken arm, broken shoulder, I broke \nquite a  few things. But they’re not  serious injuries compared to  what \nyou can  have on  the  Isle  of Man at  those sorts of speeds. I always got \nback on  again, I didn’t want to  finish on  a low. \nApart from the win, what's your best  TT memory? \nIt was a  privilege for  me  to  ride in  teams alongside Carl Fogarty, Steve \nHislop and Joey Dunlop. Bearing in mind that I started life as a trials rider, \nI used to pinch myself that I was actually riding alongside these giants of \nthe  sport. Believe me, to  follow these legends around the  TT  course or \nMacau or  the Ulster or  the  North West 200  was a sight to behold and  will \nlive  with me  for  the  rest of my  days. The things they could do  with a \nmotorcycle, and I would highlight Hizzy [Hislop] here, beggars belief. \nWhat's important when you  ride the TT? \nTo  accomplish what I call  a  clean lap —  it might not  be  absolutely the \nfastest you  can  do, but it’s  a bit like a good round of golf, you're trying to \naspire to the best you can  do. If you  can  achieve a lap where your braking \npoints are  right, you  put  the power on  at  the right place, your apexes are \nclipped and you  come out  of the corners on  line, on  the power and in the \nright gear, if you just do all that without trying too  hard and if you  know \nexactly where you're going, it'll  still be a very good lap. \n\n“EVERYTHING \nNOW \nIS  \nSYNTHESIZED \n—  \nTHE \nTT  \nIS  \nTHE \nREAL \nTHING \n401 \nHow \nlong \ndoes \nit \ntake \nto \nlearn \nthe \nline? \nThey \nalways \nsaid \nthree \nyears; \nDave \n(J \nefferies) \nhad \na \ntriple \nwin \nin \nhis \nthird \nyear, \nso \nI \nthink \nthat’s \nstill \ntrue. \nOnce \nyou've \ndone \nsix \nyears \nyou \nshould \nbe \nright \non \nit, \nthere \nshouldn’t \nbe \nmuch \nmore \nto \nknow \nabout \nit. \nBut \nthen \nas \nthe \nbikes \nget \nbetter \nand \nthe \ntyres \nget \nbetter, \nthe \nlines \nchange. \nWhat \ndid \nyou  \nmost \nlove \nabout \nthe \nTT \nas \na \nwhole? \nI \nthink \nthe \nIsland \natmosphere \nis \na \nbit  \nspecial, \nthat \ndoes \nsomething \nfor \nme. \nAnd \nthe \nvariety \nof \nthe \ncourse \ndoes \nsomething \nfor \nme, \nit’s \nnot \nall \none \nthing \nlike \nso \nmany \ncircuits. \nThere’s \nso \nmuch \nvariety, \nit’s \nsmooth, \nit’s \nbumpy, \nthere’s \ntight \ntwists, \nthere’s \nlate \napexes, \nearly \napexes, \nbrows, \nyour \nbike’s \nairborne \na \nlot, \nthere’s \nsteep \ndescents, \nsteep \nascents, \nhairpins, \nthere’s \neverything. \nI \nwas \nbrought \nup \nin \nmy \nown \nmind \nas \na \ntrue \nmotorcyclist, \nso \nI \nhad \na \nfeeling \nof \naccomplishment \nin \ngetting \naround \nthe \ncourse. \nThe thing about the  Isle of Man is that you’re not  always back round \nagain where you were a  minute ago, you're still on  your journey, an \nadventurous journey. When you're lining up on  the  Glencutchery Road \nand it’s  a  six-lap race it’s  quite a journey, quite intimidating. \nThe TT  atmosphere used to  bring out the best in  me. There is \nsomething about being on  the Glencutchery road, looking across \nDouglas Bay at  the  shimmering sea. And there was something about \nthose early morning practices that was extraordinarily special to  me. \nWhen I was a schoolboy I was over there for practice week, it was first \nlight, I looked out  of my hotel window and there was \nan  MV mechanic bringing an  MV four along the \nprom for morning practice, where else are  you going ‘There's a feeling of \nto  see  that? I’ve  never lost that. There’s more legends camaraderie, I \nand stories about the Island than about any other wouldn't be at all \nrace circuit. surprised if a First \nWorld War trench \nBut  the stories are  about tragedy as  well as  triumph. was a similar thing’ \nWe’ve all  sat  in  the  paddock, looking across at  each \nother before a race, knowing that triumph has touched \nus, \nthat \ntragedy \nhas \ntouched \nus \nall. \nWe've \nall \nhad \nthat \nmix \nof \nemotions; \nno \none \nis \nsingled \nout \nfor \nspecial \ntreatment, \neveryone \nknows \nthey \ncould \nbe \nprone \nto \nit. \nThere’s \na \nfeeling \nof \ncamaraderie, \nI \nwouldn’t \nbe \nat \nall \nsurprised \nif \na \nFirst \nWorld \nWar \ntrench \nwas \na \nsimilar \nthing. \nIt’s \na \nvery \ntough \npaddock \n\n402 THE FAST STUFF \nwhen people are  getting hurt but  everyone knows that somehow you've \ngot to keep going on. \nWhy do you  have to keep going on? \nI think if someone was going to  invent the  TT now —  okay, it’s  going to \nbe  a  race on  public roads and each lap  is  38  miles —  they would be \nlaughed out  of bed. Because it’s  there is why we  have to carry on  going. \nLife is  dangerous. I’m not  condoning death, injury, tragedy, but how \nmany die each day on  British roads? That doesn’t justify the TT but life \nis a  risk, we  must get  off  our  backsides and do  things, you can’t take \nrisk out  of life. \nJust recently a lad got killed riding a quad on  our  local dump. People \nhave been riding bikes over that dump for 40 years and now the council \nis talking about closing it down. If they do  close it down the  kids will \nstill  want to  go and take risks, they’ll find them somewhere. \nWhat are  the rewards, what does the TT make you feel like? \nBelieve me, if my  circumstances allowed, if age hadn’t done a  bit  of \ndamage and if I didn’t have a family, I’d  still do it. Apart from bringing \nchildren into the world it’s  the  best thing I’ve ever done, from a selfish \npoint of view. It was my  injection, my  drug, the  TT  did  it for me. I can \njust about cope with not  riding there now but I still miss it.  Sadly, golf \nhas taken its  part in my  life! \nThe  TT was  everything within your family; is it still? \nNot  with all of us. \nYou  raced there just weeks after DJ’s death, that can’t have been popular. \nThe reason I went was that I was committed to  riding. My  daughters \nwere a little upset, there was a little bit  of family pressure not  to  ride \nbut  I’d promised my  sponsor. Once I was on  the  bike, I was loving it.  I \nlove being on  the  track, screwing a bike to  the  limit. \nHave you  always been a supporter? \nEven in the  darkest days. I can  hold my hand up with a clear conscience \nand say I’ve never knocked the TT, never. When I was riders’ representative \nfor  18 years I used to  fight the  inequalities and inconsistencies; I’d  fight \nlike crazy over all  kinds of issues. But I am  an  ardent supporter of the \n\n“EVERYTHING \nNOW \nIS  \nSYNTHESIZED \n—  \nTHE \nTT  \nIS  \nTHE \nREAL \nTHING \n403 \noverall \nprinciple \nof \nthe  \nTT  \nand \nthe  \nManx \ngrand \nprix \n[an \n‘amateur’ \nrace \nover \nthe \nsame \n37% \nmile \ncircuit]. \nI \nthink \nthe \nconcept \nof \nracing \na \nbike \naround \n38 \nmiles \nof \nclosed \nordinary \nroads \nis \nquite \nsimply \na \nsensational \nthing. \nEverything \nnow \nis \nsynthesized \nand \nshrink-wrapped, \nlike \nDonington \nPark \nand \nso \non. \nThe \nTT \nis \nstill \nthe \nreal \nthing. \nIt \nhas \nstone \nwails, \nyou \njust \nmustn't \nhit \nthem \nbecause \nif \nyou \ndo \nit’ll \nhurt. \nHow do you  deal with the risk? \nOn \nthe \nmorning \nof \na \nrace \nI \nwas \nbad \nbecause \nI \nwas \ntrying \nto \ncontrol \nmy \nemotions; there’d be quite a few visits to the loo.

Waiting for the start on  the \nGlencutchery road is surely like  nothing else in the world. It’s  terror. \nThere was that terrible morning practice on  Friday 31st of May 1996 \nwhen we  lost Mick Lofthouse and Robert Holden, both good pals. I \nremember going back to  bed to  my  wife and having to  tell  her the \nnews. We sobbed our hearts out but next day was the F1  race. I’m \nstood there lining up  to  race, I’ve got  a  badly damaged foot from the \nNorth West, I’m  on  funny pills and I’m  feeling crap. I’ve lost two friends \nand I went and finished second to  Phil McCallen [11-times TT winner \nbetween 1992 and 1997], feeling like shit.

Time to  salute the world’s greatest biking event \n‘The TT  is  the  manifestation of  every human emotion of  victory, of \ntriumph, but  sometimes of tragedy and pathos. Here one learns some \nof the basic truths of human experience, of human struggle and rivalry, \nof exultancy and despondency.’ \nWhen Norton boss Gilbert Smith spoke those words in the  1930s the \nTT was the  world’s most important motorcycle race and several riders \nhad already died chasing fame and fortune on  the  Island’s treacherous \nroads. Nowadays the  TT is no  longer the world’s biggest bike race; it is \nbut a  meandering country lane a  world away from the eight-lane \nmotorways of MotoGP and World Superbike. Riders still die  at  the  TT \nevery year: the  death toll  now stands at  over 200, and by the time \nyou read this maybe more will have lost their lives chasing their \nIsland dreams. \nThe TT  is pretty impossible to  defend. Some years ago I argued that \nit  should be  shut down. I’m no  longer of  that opinion. The TT  is  as \ninsanely dangerous as  it ever was, so  maybe it’s  me  who’s changed, or \nthe world itself. In fact the TT has  changed, it’s of much less  importance \nto  the  motorcycle industry, so  no  one  is coerced into racing there to  get \na  factory ride, which used to  happen all  the  time. In \nother words, riders race there because they want to, \n‘You have to be because they can’t resist its  unique and sometimes \ntotally at ease with deadly charms. Like nutters who climb Everest. \nyourself, know The adrenalin rush of a  fast  TT  lap is like  nothing \nexactly what you're else on  earth: it’s mainlining the greatest drug known \ndoing, and accept to  man, your synapses on  fire as  you burst into a \nthat you might be sleepy village at  five times the  speed limit. No  buzz \ngoing home in a  box’ that big comes risk-free. \nObviously, no  one who races there is  unaware of \nthe enormous dangers they face each time they rocket \ndown Bray Hill, bouncing from gutter to  manhole cover, fighting the \nmother of all  tankslappers. Poor old  David Jefferies was bang on  the \nmoney when he  gave this upfront assessment of racing on  the  Island: \n‘You have to be totally at  ease with yourself, know exactly what you’re \ndoing, and accept that you might be going home in a box.’ \n\nSALUTING THE TT 405 \nThe \nTT  \nfascinates \nracers \nwho \nshould \nknow \nbetter. \nSome \nyears \nago \nWayne \nRainey \nwatched \nan \non-bike \nTT \nlap \nand \ndidn’t \nstop \ntalking \nabout \nit \nfor \ndays. \nThe \nformer \n500 \nking \nwas \ngenuinely \nawed \nby \nthe \nreality \nof \nracing \naround \nthe \nstreets \nat \n190mph \n— \nhe \ncouldn’t \nbelieve \nit’s \nstill \nallowed \nto go \non. \nThe TT  is  a  relic from an  age  when most racetracks were similarly \nlethal, roped-off public roads. But  while dozens of other street venues \nhave been ‘shut down the TT  survives because it sits  on  a  self-governed \nisland which is  very fond of  the  millions generated by the  races. If \nanyone else was in  charge —  Westminster, Brussels —  it would be just \nanother piece of bike-racing history. \nAnd perhaps this is  where the  world and I have changed (please \nexcuse me  as  I enter Grumpy Old Git  mode). It seems to me  the  world \nhas been taken over by puritan megalomaniacs and I don’t like it. These \ncrusading cretins pretend they care about people but they don’t, they \nwant us  to stop riding motorcycles (why else would they keep tightening \nthe  bike test?) and quit smoking, but  they start wars. The TT  is a  wild \nanachronism in  an  increasingly controlled society; it’s  barking at  the \nmoon, a  big fingers up  to  those who want us  all to  lead safe, obedient, \nmortgaged lives under the  all-seeing eye  of the  CCTV camera, obeying \nthe command of  dayglo-clad security gorillas with an  IQ  of  50  and \ntranquillised by the  government’s looped mantra of ‘your safety is our \nprimary concern’. Bollocks to  the  lot of them. \nI don’t defend the  TT.  The only people who have that right are  those \nwho race there. All  I will do  is salute their right to  do what they want \nwith their own lives, unconstrained by government health-and-safety \nmuppets \nwho \nthink \nthey \nknow \nbest. \nThat \nsaid, \nI \nwouldn’t \nwant \nmy \nbest mate doing it. \n\nCHAPTER 53 \nROSSI: WHAT MAKES HIM \nSO  GOOD? \nJune 2007 \nCasey Stoner made a brilliant job of dismantling the legend of \nValentino Rossi during 2007, but there’s no  doubt that the \nformer world champ is one of the greatest riders of all time. So \nwhat makes him so  good? \nNot very long ago Valentino Rossi was bike racing’s King Midas, the \ngolden boy who could do  no  wrong. He  was a  genius motorcycle racer \nand it  seemed he  was even more than that, because while his  talent \nwon him dozens of races and a pile of world titles he seemed to have an \nalmost supernatural power to  make things go his  way, even when the \nodds were stacked heavily against him. \nNot any more, though. Things have changed over the  past year and \na half; Rossi has  lost the  crown he  had made his  own, proving that he \nis  in  fact only human. ‘Unbeatable superheroes only exist in  movies, \nreal life  is different,’ he  said after losing the  crown in 2006. \nSo Rossi is human and a fallible human at that. Nowadays bad  things \nhappen to  the  former MotoGP king, he  makes mistakes and he  loses \nraces, so  the  glitter is tarnished. But  despite the bike problems, the  tyre \nwoes and the  crashes, there’s no  doubt that he  is one of the  greatest \nriders of  all  time. So  what’s so  great about the seven-time world \nchampion’s methods, his psychology, his talent and his racecraft? \nWe decided to  ask the people who really know, those who get to \nwatch him up  close, both on  the track and in  the pits: the man \nwho made him king, his  crew chief Jeremy Burgess, the  man who \nfirst stole his crown, Nicky Hayden, and his Yamaha team-mate \nColin Edwards. \nThis trio  of paddock personalities call  Rossi a lot of things —  foxy, sly, \nvicious, crazy, serious, focused, aggressive, clean —  but perhaps it’s \nBurgess who gets to the root of it all. The straight-talking Aussie believes \n\nROSSI: WHAT MAKES HIM SO  GOOD? 407 \nthat \nRossi’s \ngenius \nis \na  \nfactor \nof \ngood \nbiology. \nJB  \nreckons \nhe’s \ngot \nvery \nhigh-performing \nmotor \nneurones \nthat \ngive \nhim \nthe \nability \nto \nprocess \ninformation \nremarkably \nquickly. \nComes \nin handy \nat \n200mph. \nSo, first and foremost, it is his  intelligence that makes Rossi so  good. \nHe  is  a  very clever young man, and he  could succeed at  pretty much \nanything he  wanted to  turn his  hand to,  because he  would work out \nhow to  do  it right. Perhaps JB  helped format Rossi's racing brain to \nwork unerringly logically, but  Rossi would probably have worked it out \nanyway. His  intelligence is obvious to all —  you see  it in his  eyes, hear it \nwhen he  opens his  mouth, witness it at  work when he  cuts another \nmasterful manoeuvre on  the  track. \nThis brain power is  also the most vital ingredient in  his  talent, \nbecause he has  the ability to decode what he feels on  the bike, either to \nride faster or  to  make the  bike better. This isn’t easy; many riders get \nlost in  the  labyrinth of  machine settings —  they focus on  the  wrong \nissues, give confusing feedback to  their technicians, waste time trying \nto fix problems that can’t be fixed. Rossi isn’t like  that, he knows where \nhe  wants to  go,  he  gives crystal clear feedback and never expects the \nbike to  be  100 per cent perfect. This is  hugely important because \nmotorcycle racing is  a  technical sport, it  involves ultra-high-tech \nmachinery so  it requires a  scientific mind. As  his  Ohlins suspension \ntechnician Mike Norton says: ‘Valentino is very good because he’s very \nmethodical... he  doesn’t dwell on  problems... he’s very black and \nwhite, very clinical. It’s  very rare he  can’t tell  you what’s going on  but \nif he can’t feel  any difference, he'll say  so.’ \nTrue, Rossi does appear to  have an  amazingly natural feel for \nmotorcycle riding but that comes from a  combination of brainpower \nand miles covered, which seems to  have created some kind of \ninformation superhighway between the  tyres, his  brain and everything \nin between. Rossi and his  motorcycle are  apparently wired together, so \nthey work as  a  single unit. \nRossi’s psychology is  also very strong, though it’ll be  interesting to \nsee  how he reacts in  the  long term to  Stoner’s current domination. He \nreally enjoys what he  does and that’s another major factor in  his \nsuccess. Racing isn’t only a job, it’s  something he  loves, he  loves it all, \nfrom poring over computer data readouts with his  engineers to  playing \nmind \ngames \nwith \nhis \nrivals, \nto \nsticking \nit \nup \nthe \ninside \nof \nthose \nrivals \nat  the  hairpin. As  Edwards says, he is sly. \n\n408 THE FAST STUFF \nHis  upbringing probably has a lot to do with his  psyche. His  dad was \na wise, open-minded teacher who didn’t bring Valentino up  as  a racer \nfirst and a human being second. Many modern-day racers who've been \nracing since they were four years old  aren’t rounded human beings \nbecause they’ve never had the chance to  become rounded human \nbeings. Rossi is mature and worldly wise, that’s why he  is  so  good at \ndealing with people, which helps him excel in pit lane and outside in \nthe  everyday world. \nHe  seems an  objective person, aware that there is a bigger world out \nthere, so  he  fully understands that he  is only playing a  game, albeit a \ngame he plays to win. Many other riders are  apparently engulfed by the \nenormity of what they’re involved in  —  they truly believe that what \nthey’re doing is the  most important thing in  the  world. Rossi’s make- \nup is the opposite of the  standard template for modern sporting success \n—the no-life sports star who eats, breathes and sleeps his  sport to ensure \nhe  is  always one step ahead of  the competition. Rossi does work \nincredibly hard at  his  racing, but  he’s got  a  life  beyond it, which is  a \nvital counterpoint to  his  brilliance on  the  racetrack. \nRossi is also very brave, incredibly brave. In fact he is a bit of a nutter, \nprepared to win pretty much by any  means necessary. We have seen his \ndark side in  action on  plenty of occasions, most memorably when he \nrammed the  hapless Sete Gibernau off the  track at  Jerez in 2005. Troy \nBayliss called him a  maniac, which is  pretty rich. Edwards calls him \nvicious, which is fair  enough, because however nice you might be  off \nthe  racetrack you need to  be  very nasty on  the  track if you’re going \nanywhere. As  George Orwell wrote: ‘Serious sport has nothing to  do \nwith fair play. It  is  bound up  with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, \ndisregard of all  rules and sadistic pleasure in  witnessing violence. In \nother words, it is war minus the shooting.’ \nSo  if you want to  be  another Rossi, this is what you need in  your \ncharacter make-up: plenty of brains and bravery, a bit of ebullience and \na  certain viciousness. Couldn’t be easier, eh? \nThe team-mate: Colin Edwards : \nColin Edwards first partnered Rossi in  the 2000 Suzuka Eight Hours and he’s \nbeen his full-time MotoGP team-mate for three seasons. \n‘We started as  team-mates at the  Suzuka Eight Hours in 2000. It’s  cool, \nwe  get  along great and I have the  luxury to  go  in the  garage and look \n\nROSSI: WHAT MAKES HIM SO  GOOD? 409 \nat  the  computer to  see  exactly what he’s doing. I enjoy that and I’ve \niearned a  lot.  There are  times when I feel like I’m hitting my  head \nagainst a wall, it’s like  “Why am I losing so  much time in section three? \nOr whatever”. It’s  pretty easy, you overlay the  data and you go “Ah, all \nright, now I see  how fast you can go  through that corner”, so  it helps \nout. And nowadays with GPS you can even look at  what lines he’s \ntaking. Sure, it’s  not  as  easy as  that, you don’t just hold the  gas  on  for \nanother sécond, you have to  analyse it and work out  how. \n‘My own assessment of Valentino is that he’s like  a  16-year-old who \nnever grew up.  He’s always having fun  and he’s fun to  be  around. He \nlooks at riding a motorcycle like my daughter looks at riding her bicycle \n—  it’s  something fun to  do.  It’s a little bit  different to  the  approach of \nmost guys on  the grid who are  maybe gritty, hard faced and determined. \nValentino has  got  all that, he just has  a  different way of showing it, he \ngoes out  there and enjoys the  battle. \n‘I’ve never really felt like he  gets enough credit for  how hard he \nworks, there’s always that myth that he  always has the  best bikes and \nso  on.  But until I arrived at  Yamaha I’d  never seen anybody work as \nhard as  I do,  so  I was like Wow, he  does work hard as  well”. I don’t \nthink many people realise that. There’s no  in between, he does it all to \nthe  max. \n‘He’s very clever, how would you  say it...  he’s sly. He’s very undercover, \nfoxy, sly. It’s  cool, he’s not  real blatant about some of the  mind games. \nTo him it’s  big and to  the  person he’s playing it to  it’s  big but not  many \npeople will catch onto it, because he’s real clever about it.  I don’t know \nhow much of  it  he  thinks up  on  his  own but  maybe most of it.  It’s \npretty \nfunny, \nyou \nsee \na \nlittle \nsticker \non \nhis \nbike \nor \nyou \nsee \nsomething \nhe \ndoes \nand \nyou \ngo \nwhat’s \nthat \nall \nabout? \nHe’s \nalways \ngot \nan \nexplanation, \nit’s \nalways \nsubtle \nlittle \nthings. \nHe’s \ndone \na \ngood \njob \nto \nmake \na \nlot \nof \npeople \nthink \nhe’s \nJekyll \nand \nHyde, \nif \nyou \nknow \nwhat \nI’m \nsaying. \nHis \nwhole \npersonality \nis \nnot \nso \nmuch \nthat, \nhe’s \njust \nnormal. \nBut \non \nthe \ntrack he’s pretty vicious! \n‘What \nare  \nhis  \nstrongest \npoints? \nWell, \napart \nfrom \nhis  \nability \nto  \nmake \nup \n20 \nbike \nlengths \nin \ntwo \nor \nthree \ncorners, \nwhich \nis \na \npretty \ngood \nability \nif \nyou \nask \nme, \nI \ndon’t \nknow. \nI \nguess \nhe’s \njust \nso \nsmooth, \nhe’s \naggressive \nbut \nhe’s \nmaking \nlots \nof \ntime \nand \nit \ndoesn’t \nlook \nlike \nit. \nIf \nyou’re \nbehind \nhim \nyou're \nworking \nyour \nballs \noff \nand \nhe’s \njust \neasing \naway \nfrom \nyou, \nbit \nby \nbit. \nYou’re \ngoing \n“I’m \ndoing \neverything \nI \ncan”, \nbut \nhe \nlooks \npretty \n\n410 THE FAstT STUFF \neasy. I don’t know if there’s one  thing he’s got that really impresses me \non  the  track... just everything, the whole package. \n‘Something he is really good at is recovering from mistakes. When he \nmakes the  kind of  mistake that would have most people sliding on \ntheir asses into the gravel, he  seems to  somehow gather it  back. \nOccasionally he’ll overcook it but  the  way he  gets away with it makes \nyou go  “how the  hell?”. \n‘Like Donington 2005, that really wet race. I locked up  the  front a \ncouple of times and it scared the  shit out  of me, so  I was cruisin’ with \nthe  pack and the  next thing you know he just pisses \noff. I looked at  his  data and it was scary. That guy \n‘I looked at his data was locking the  front in  the  rain on a shitty track \nand it was scary — that was slicker than snot, every other corner he just \nhis front was locked had it  locked. I  said to  him “Was your front \nevery corner — this locked?”and he  said “Oh yeah, a  couple of  times \nguy’s crazy!’ pretty bad”. Then I looked at  the computer and it was \nlike, a couple of times? Fuck, it was every corner, this \nguy’s crazy! That was probably the  most impressive \nride, I could look at  the  computer and actually see  how much locking \nwas going on,  it was crazy. I almost crashed a  couple of times and my \nlocks weren't as  bad as  his. I was like “oh fuck!” and he’s just like, \nsssrrrccccchh, that'll be  all  right, yeah! (Edwards mimes the act  of \nflicking the  bike into a  turn with the  front end ploughing sideways.) \n‘T really don’t think he’s got  any weaknesses. Guys keep saying he’s \ngonna go F1  or  rallying and I say  “no  way”. He  looks at all that stuff as \nfun, he  gets an  opportunity to  drive the  cars, it’s  just fun. He’s smart, \nhe  plays the  part so  people think this is what he’s thinking about. He \nloves and enjoys rallying and maybe later he  may do  that but I don’t \nthink he’ll give up  motorcycles the way it is at  the  moment. \n‘To  him motorcycle racing is  a  puzzle. If you put it  into climbing \nterms he’s got to work out  how to  get up  the wall. As  far as  making the \npass and pulling away, that’s the  crux, he has  to  figure out  that puzzle, \nwhere he needs to pass before the three or  four corners where he knows \nhe  can pull a  little gap and demoralise the  guy, that’s what he’s doing \nthe  whole time. Valentino doesn’t make unnecessary passes. Even at \nQatar in 2007 he was passing Stoner to  play with him, to  see  what he \nhad. He doesn’t do anything too  hasty, except maybe the first lap or  two \nwhen he'll do  some hasty things to  get up  front.’ \n\nROSSI: \nWHAT \nMAKES \nHIM \nSO  \nGOOD? \n4ll \nThe rival: Nicky Hayden \nHayden \nis \nthe \nman \nwho \nfinally \nbrought \nto \nan  \nend  \nRossi's \nrun  \nof \npremier-class \nsuccesses \nby beating \nhim \nto \nthe \n2006 \nMotoGP \ntitle. \n‘I \ncan’t \nsay \nit’s \njust \nhis  \napproach \nthat \nmakes \nhim \ngood. \nSome \nguys \ntake \ntheir \nracing \nreal \nserious, \nothers \nare  \nreally \nlaid \nback, \nit’s \nwhatever \nworks \nfor  \nthat \nrider. \nBut \nregardless \nof \nwhatever \nhe  \ndoes \nhe  \ndefinitely \ngets \naround \nthe \ntrack \nfast, \nthat’s \nwhat’s \nmost \nimportant. \n‘One thing I noticed when we  were team-mates is that he looks like \nit’s  fun, fun, fun; he  definitely cuts up  a  lot,  but once you're in  the \ngarage that dude is  so  serious, so  focused. Everything seems perfect, \nright down to  the  windscreen sticker and the  colour of his  boots. He \ndoesn’t overlook anything and I think that’s a big part of it. \n‘More than anything it’s  the racer in him that makes him so  strong, it’s \nobvious the guy wants to win. He’s got a lot of natural talent but I know a \nlot  of guys with natural talent and it gets some guys in  trouble. It’s  the \nwhole package that makes him strong: the desire, the focus, the  talent. \n‘I think sometimes maybe he’s not  as  laid back as  he  comes across. \nHe  knows what to  say  and when to  say  it to  make it look like things \naren't really getting to  him. He  knows how to  play it, on  the  bike and \noff the  bike. \n‘It’s hard to  say  what he’s like  with mind games because I can  only \ncomment on  how he’s been with me  and I’ve  never seen him play any \ngames with me, especially in 2006 when he was taking chunks out  of \nmy  points lead. The guy didn’t really change, maybe he just knew that \nI wasn’t going to  roll  over. Maybe some of the  guys he can  break down \nmentally, maybe he knew it wasn’t going to  get  to  me. \n‘Him and JB  (Jeremy Burgess) haven’t won all  those titles just \nthrough \nhis \nriding, \nthey \nknow \nhow \nto \nplay \npeople, \nthey \nknow \nhow \nto \nplay \ntheir \ncards, \nwhen \nto \nshow \ntheir \nhand, \nwhen \nnot \nto \nshow \ntheir \nhand. \nI \ndon’t \nthink \nhe \nplays \nas \nmany \ngames \nas \nother \nguys \n— \nyou \ndon’t \nneed \nto \nplay \na \nlot \nof \ngames \nwhen \nyou \ncan \nride \nlike \nthat. \n‘On \ntrack \nsure \nhe’s \naggressive \nbut  \nhe’s \ntotally \nclean \nand \nhe \ndefinitely \nhas \na \nlot \nof \ntactics. \nHe \nknows \nwhen \nhe \nwants \nto \nrace \njust \none \nguy, \nhow \nto \nseparate \ngroups, \nhow \nto \nslow \ndown. \nLike \nPhillip \nIsland \nin \n2005 \nI \nwas \non \nhim \nthe \nwhole \nrace \nand \nhe \neventually \nsaw \nthat \nhe \nwasn’t \ngoing \nto \nget \naway, \nso \nhe \nslowed \ndown, \nbrought \nthe \nnext \ngroup \nup \nto \nus \nto \nget \nme \ncaught \nup \nwith \nthem, \nthen \ntried \nto \nmake \nanother \nbreak. \nHe’s \ngot \na \nlot \nof racecraft. \n\n412 THE FAST STUFF \n‘I'd  \nsay  \nhis  \nbiggest \nstrength \nis \nthat \nhe  \ncan \nadapt. \nIf \nthe  \ntyres \ngo  \noff \nand \nhe \nneeds \nto \nslide \nhe \ncan \nslide, \nwhen \nthe \nbike \nneed \nto \nbe ridden \nin \nline \nhe \ncan  \nride \nin \nline, \nhe \ncan  \ndefinitely \nadapt \nto  \nsituations. \nI \ncan’t \nsay \nthere’s \none \narea \nof \nhis \nriding \nwhere \nhe \njust \nkills \nguys. \nIt’s \nnot \njust \nbraking \nor \ncorner \nspeed \nor \nthis or \nthat, \nI’d \njust \nsay \nthat \nwhen \nhe’s \nin \na \nrhythm \nand \nputting \nthose \nlaps \ndown \nhe \ncan \nbreak \na guy. \nLike \nat \nJerez \nthis \nyear \nhe \nbroke \nPedrosa \nby \nabout \nhalf \na \ntenth \na \nlap, \nhe just \nkept \nputting \nthose \nlaps \ndown, \nriding \non \nthat \nedge. \nHe \ndoesn’t \nride \n95 per \ncent, \nhe rides \non \nthat \nrazor \nedge \nfor \na long \ntime. \n‘I don’t know about weaknesses, it’s  hard for me  to point out  a  guy’s \nweakness when he’s won all those championships. In fact I’m not  going \nto say he’s got any weak points because I don’t need to motivate the guy! \nThat’s why I don’t want to  say  anything negative. I’m  a  big believer in \nnot  motivating these guys any more, that’s why I don’t talk trash.’ \nThe crew chief: Jeremy Burgess \nJB has worked full-time with Valentino since the end of 1999, so probably knows \nhim better than anyone else in the paddock. \n‘Racing is like anything in life —  you have to  have a plan and you have \nto work through the  plan. Clearly the  methods we  used to  use  on  500s \nand now use  in MotoGP differ somewhat from the methods he used at \nAprilia, the  basic is to  understand that the  bike won’t be  exactly how \nyou want it when you wheel it out  of  the  trailer, so  you have to  set \nabout attacking the  problems in  a  logical order in  a  given amount of \ntime. In the early days we  identified what we  want him to tell us  when \nhe returns to  the pits and that’s what we  get —  he has  worked very well \nwith us. \n‘He  enjoys his  job  and I think everybody in  this team enjoys their \nwork. There are  days when it might grind you the  wrong way and I’m \nsure there are  days when Valentino would rather be  in  Ibiza. But as \nlong as  he enjoys the  challenge of his  employment on  most days, that’s \nall we  need. \n‘He only uses mind games when people make a serious challenge, then \nhe pulls out  that extra tool  in his armoury, which he did with Max, with \nSete and to  a lesser degree with Marco. Then there’s Loris, who is also a \nserious challenge, but  there’s a  different understanding between them, \nthere’s a respect. When I first worked with Valentino he was mates with \nMarco. Whenever there was a dinner or  a party, Marco was always there. \n\nROSSI: WHAT MAKES HIM SO  GOOD? 413 \nWhen Marco came to MotoGP it was still fine, then when there was any \nsort of a challenge their friendship cooled off a bit. \n‘As  for  talent, whether it’s  Valentino, Roger Federer or  Tiger Woods, \nthese guys have a  very special ability to  process information, so  they \ncan. correct mistakes as  they’re happening, before we  would even realise \nwe've made a mistake. \n‘When Valentino goes rabbiting around the  track he enters a  corner \nand knows he’s six inches too much to the inside and he starts correcting \nthat long before anyone can  see  he’s made a mistake. In his  own mind \nhe’s made a little mistake which he  gathers in  a  long way before \nanybody even realises he’s made the  mistake. It’s  the  ability to  process \ninformation so  fast and so  accurately. Whether the  little electric pulses \nin his  brain fire  a bit better than yours or  mine, I don’t know.’ \nAnd finally, a word from fellow legend Giacomo Agostini \nLegend of the  1960s and 1970s, Ago still holds the records for the most premier- \nclass wins. He won 68 500  GPs, all with MV Agusta. \n‘T \nthink \nit’s \nno  \nsecret, \nI \nremember \nwhen \nAgo \ngo \nvery \nfast \nand \nI \nfirst \nrace \nMike \nHailwood \nand \nhe \nwas \nalso \nvery, \nvery \nfast. \nBut \nwe \ndon’t \nknow \nwhy, \nit’s \ndifficult \nto \nknow \nbecause \nit’s \nsomething \ninside. \nWhen \nI \nrace \nwith \nsome \nother \nrider \nand \nI \ncrash, \nI \nsay \n“why \ndo \nI \nfucking \ncrash \nand \nyou \ndon’t \ncrash?”, \nbut \nI \ndon’t \nhave \nthe \nanswer. \nIt’s \nsomething \nthat \nGod \nor \nmy \nmother \ngive \nto \nme, \nsame \nwith \nValentino, \nHailwood, \nBarry \nSheene \nor \nMichael \nSchumacher. \nI \ngo \nfast \nbut \nwhy? \nMaybe \nyou \ncrash \nat \n45 \ndegrees \nand \nI \ncrash \nat \n47 \ndegrees, \nit’s \nsomething \ninside \nand \nit’s \ndifficult \nto \nfind \nthe \nreason, \nin \nItalian \nwe \nsay \nregalo \ndalla \nnatura, \nit’s \na \ngift \nfrom \nnature.’ \n\nCHAPTER 54 \nTOWERING MOUNTAINS AND \nRAGING RIVERS OF  RIDING TALENT \nOctober 2007 \nHow did men like Casey Stoner, Mike Hailwood, Freddie Spencer, \nJohn Surtees and Valentino Rossi manage to  reach the very \npinnacle of their sport when barely out of their teens? \nCasey Stoner was a fresh-faced 21  years and 342  days old when he won \nthe 2007 MotoGP championship, making him the  second youngest rider \nto have conquered biking’s dizziest peak. Four others have managed the \nfeat at similarly young ages: Freddie Spencer won the  1983 500  title at 21 \nyears and 258  days, Mike Hailwood secured the  1962 500  crown aged 22 \nand 160  days, John Surtees took his first 500  championship in 1956 at 22 \nyears and 182  days and Valentino Rossi wrapped up  the  2001 500 title \nwhen he was 22  years and 240  days old. \nThose five title successes must rank amongst the greatest \nachievements in racing history; I mean, what do most of us  achieve by \nthat age? A  first proper job, passing your bike test, maybe getting \nthrough university, certainly nothing as  grand as  climbing to  the \nsummit of one  of the world’s most vicious sports. \nSo  what makes the young Stoner, Rossi, Spencer, Hailwood and \nSurtees so  different from the young you  and  me? Why were they on  top \nof the  world when you were maybe festering in  student digs, dispatch \nriding on  a  shagged-out Honda NTV, on  the dole or  simply getting \npissed up  and shagging around? And what makes them stand so  high \nabove other racers who also started young? \nRiding talent, for  a  start, towering mountains and raging rivers of \nthe  stuff, plus intelligence and unfaltering dedication, *or, as  Surtees \ncalled his  own brand of  world-beating determination, ‘the inherent \nSurtees family cussedness’. That’s all downright obvious, but where did \ntheir talent come from and how was it applied so  successfully and so \nearly? In  short, it’s  all nature and nurture, the  two factors that control \n\nTOWERING \nMOUNTAINS \nAND \nRAGING \nRIVERS \nOF  \nRIDING \nTALENT \n415 \nall  \nour \ndestinies. \nNature \nis  \nyour \ngenes, \nthe \nstuff \nthat’s \npassed \ndown \nfrom \nyour \nparents, \nwhile \nnurture \nis \nhow \nyour \nupbringing \ndeveloped \nyour \ncharacter. \nIn \nother \nwords, \na \nlot \nof \nit’s \ndown \nto \nparents, and  fathers in particular. ae \nStoner’s \ndad \nreckons \nhis  \nson’s \nskill \nis \nin \nhis  \nDNA: \n‘Casey \nwas \ndoing \n‘Like \na \nlot \nof \nkids \nit \nwas \nobvious \nfrom \nan \nearly \nage \nthings \non \na \nbike \nthat \nCasey \nhas \nthe \nskills \nlevel \nrequired,’ \nsays \nColin \naged \nsix \nyou \nStoner. \n‘He \nwas \ndoing \nthings \non a \nbike \naged \nsix \nyou \nwouldn't \nbelieve, \nwouldn’t \nbelieve. \nPlus \nhe’s \ngot \nthe \nmentality \nto go \nplus \nhe’s \ngot \nthe \nwith \nit. \nHe’s \nvery, \nvery \nmentally \nstrong. \nAnd \nlike \nall \nmentality \nto go \nthe \nothers, \nhe comes \nfrom \na petrol \nbackground.’ \nwith \nit’ \nStoner, Rossi, Spencer, Hailwood and Surtees share \nseveral characteristics and life  factors in  common, \nbut perhaps most important of all,  their dads were all  into bikes and \ninto speed. More than that, in  fact, their dads all  raced. Colin Stoner \nstarted riding on  Australian roads when he  was 14,  borrowing his \nbrother’s streetbike, and became a very handy roadracer and kart racer \nduring the 1970s, though he  admits ‘I  didn’t have a  clue what I was \ndoing’, which is why he got  involved with his  son’s racing, to help him \navoid the  pitfalls. Rossi’s father Graziano was a  top  GP  racer and  won \nthree 250 GPs in  1979, the  year Valentino was born. Freddie Spencer \nSenior was up  for  racing anything with an  engine —  dirt bikes, drag \nbikes, sprint cars and eventually powerboats. Hailwood’s old  man and \nSurtees’ dad raced sidecars before the  Second World War, pop Hailwood \nlater earning the  nickname Stan ‘The Wallet’ as  owner of a  chain of \nmotorcycle \nshops, \nwhile \nJack \nSurtees \nwas \nat \none \nstage \nthe \nUK’s \nbiggest \nVincent dealer. \nSo \nbikes \nand \nracing \nloomed \nlarge \nin \nthe \ngene \npools \nof \nthese \nthrusting \nyoungsters, \nbut \nthat \ndoesn’t \nmean \nthat \ntheir \ndads \nor \ntheir \nupbringings \nwere \nthe \nsame, \nfar \nfrom \nit. \nTake \nSurtees, \nRossi \nand \nStoner \nand \nyou \ncould \nhardly \nimagine \nmore \ndifferent \nbackgrounds: \nSurtees, \nthe \ngrubby- \nkneed \nkid \ngrowing \nup \nduring \nthe \nBlitz, \nscraping \ntogether \nenough \ncash \nto \ngo \nracing \non \na \nweekly \napprenticeship \nwage \nof \n£2.50, \nRossi \nthe \nfirstborn \nof \na \nbeaming \nGP \nstar, \nmotorhoming \nit \naround \nEurope \nwith \nBarry \nSheene \nand \nKing \nKenny \nRoberts \nin \nan \nage \nof \nvivid \nsporting \nglamour, \nStoner \ngrowing \nup \nthe \nAussie \nway \nin \nthe \nbig \noutdoors, \na \nfew \nminutes \nfrom \nthe \nbeach, \nmucking \nabout \nin \nboats, \non \nhorseback \nand \non \ndirt bikes. \n\n416 THE FAST STUFF \nTheir childhoods span generations, during which time the  world \nchanged a great deal. Europe was transformed from war torn, bombed \nand exhausted to rich, bangin’ and economically united, while Australia \nboomed and became arguably the world’s sportiest nation. In  the \nmeantime society’s attitudes were turned upside down, not least its \nattitude towards youth, while sport metamorphosed from a  game for \nmoneyed amateurs into a form of dynamic advertising. \nBack in the  1940s kids didn’t even get out  of school shorts until they \nwere well into their teens. Surtees had to  wait until he was 13  for  his \nfirst bike ride and a further three years before his  first roadrace, having \nspent the  previous ten  learning to  put bikes together with little more \nthan a screwdriver and a piece of string. \nStoner and Rossi grew up  in  an  age obsessed with youth, when \nteenagers can do  things they never dreamed of  doing half a  century \nearlier. Stoner was sitting on  the back of a minibike working the throttle \nwhen he was 18  months old  and riding around the  garden at  three. A \nyear later he  competed in his  first dirt track race and aged six  he won \nhis  first Australian title. Rossi rode his  first minibike aged two and a \nhalf, was Italian champion by the  age  of 15, contested his  first GP at  16 \nand was a multimillionaire before leaving his  teens. \nThere are  similarities in their upbringings, however. Surtees, Stoner \nand Rossi didn’t have pushy fathers. Colin Stoner, Graziano Rossi and \nJack Surtees were delighted that their kids got a  kick out of  bikes, \njust as  they did, but there was never any question of their sons being \npushed into racing. Dad Surtees was still pursuing his  own racing \ncareer when John first got into riding, so  the young teenager was \nmerely happy that his  father showed ‘no resentment, just lots of \nencouragement’. Years later Stoner wanted nothing more than to  go \nracing. During his schoolboy racing days he  saw many kids being \npushed into racing by their fathers, but as  he  says: ‘the good riders \nhave always wanted to  do  it all  their lives’. Rossi was also the  driving \nforce behind his  own entry into competition, initially in go-karts. ‘But \nthe  problem with go-karts is  that they cost very much money,’ he \nrecalls. ‘So  I said to  my  father “Maybe it’s  better we  race with a bike,” \nand he  say  “Ah, bo, really?” \nAnyway, all that really mattered was that Stoner was out  there at the \nyoungest-possible age, as  were Rossi, Surtees, Hailwood and Spencer \nbefore him, learning the  art  of  machine control, as  well as  strategy, \n\nTOWERING MOUNTAINS AND RAGING RIVERS OF  RIDING TALENT 417 \ntechnical \naptitude, \ncoolness \nof \nhead \nand \nhow \nto \ndeal \nwith \nthe \ndowns \nas \nwell \nas \nthe \nups. \nBut \nmost \nof all, \nhaving \nfun. \nIf Rossi’s and Surtees’ casual rise  to greatness lacked any grand plan, \nthings were a little different for Hailwood, arguably the most naturally \ntalented of all, and Spencer, whose fathers seemed more intent on  their \noffspring achieving success. Stan was a hard-nosed businessman who \nthrew serious money at  Mike’s career from the outset; he  was \ndetermined his  boy would succeed. He  bought the best bikes and \nharangued the media to  get  Mike the best coverage; in  that sense \nHailwood Senior was way ahead of his  time. \nAlthough Hailwood wasn’t legally allowed to  start racing until 17, \nwhen he was working his  apprenticeship at Triumph (making the  tea), \nhis  father gave him a  hand-made miniature motorcycle at  the  age  of \nseven, to  ride around the  grounds of the  family’s Oxfordshire home. \nThat creation, powered by  a  100cc Royal Enfield two-stroke, gave \nHailwood something of a  head start in  an  age  when no  one had even \nthought of mass-producing minibikes. \nLike Surtees and Stoner, Hailwood and Spencer were also made in \ndifferent eras and different cultures. While minibikes didn’t exist when \nHailwood was caning his little Enfield around his dad’s garden during the \n1950s, Spencer grew up in the  1970s, when minibike racing was exploding \nacross the  United States. Spencer’s father dedicated himself to  helping \nFreddie make it in the gritty world of US dirt track, collecting his son  from \nschool on  Friday evenings and spending the weekend driving thousands of \nmiles across the States. They’d do a dirt track Friday night, drive to another \nstate to  roadrace on  the  Saturday, then maybe another dirt track before \nheading back to  school. By the  time he  was 12,  Freddie was already a \nrenegade pro-racer, competing in  ‘outlaw’ dirt track events against real \npros at rodeos, and  then sharing the drive home with his exhausted dad. \nStoner’s dad put  in the  hard yards too  for his  son, driving thousands \nof kilometres across Australia. And all that effort surely had some effect \non \nthe \nkid’s \ndetermination \nto \ndo \nwell. \nStoner \nis \nrenowned \nfor \nnever \ndoing \na \nlazy \nlap \nand \nhis \ndad \nthinks \nthat \ngoes \nback \nto \nhis \ninterstate \ndirt- \ntracking \ndays. \n‘We'd \ndrive \n2000 \nkays \nto \na \ndirt \ntrack \nrace \nand \nCasey \nwould \nget \nfive \nlaps \nof \npractice, \nso \nhe \nhad \nto \nmake \nevery \nlap \ncount,’ \nsays \nStoner senior. \nPerhaps \nthe  \nStoner \nfamily \nmade \nthe \nbiggest \nsacrifice \nof \nthese \nfive \nbike- \nmad \nfamilies, \nselling \nup  \nDown \nUnder \nto  \nbring \n14-year-old \nCasey \nto \n\n418 THE FAST STUFF \nEurope. But Colin Stoner doesn’t see  it like that. ‘The way I look at  it \nthere were no  sacrifices,’ he says. ‘We set  off on  an  adventure just to  see \nwhere it ended up.  The adventure really started when he was four years \nold  and we  went racing. The trip to  Europe was another adventure, it \nwasn’t going to kill us  if we  failed but we  were determined not  to  fail.’ \nNineteenth-century Irish novelist and wit Oscar Wilde jokingly \nobserved that youth is wasted on  the  young, but not, apparently, on \nmen like these, though you could always argue that Stoner, Surtees, \nHailwood, Spencer and Rossi never really had their childhoods. While \nnormal boys are  out  and about necking alcopops, puffing on  cigarettes \nand putting their hands up  girls’ skirts, these youngsters were getting \nstuck in early, learning how to do areal man’s job. Maybe that’s cheating \nbut everyone’s at it these days; bike racing, tennis, golf, football and car \nracing are  all ruled by former child prodigies. As former 500  King Kenny \nRoberts, says: ‘If you start as  a  three-year-old and you’ve got a lot  of \ntalent, you’re going to beat the  guy who startedas a  15-year-old with a \nlot  of talent. Stoner and Rossi are  natural-born motorcycle racers, like \nTiger Woods is a natural-born golfer.’ \nIn  other words, it’s  both the  blood and the  guts, passed down by \nyour dad, and Roberts knows that better than anyone, for  he  was the \nfirst world champ to  father another world champ, Kenny Junior, who \nwon the  500  crown in 2000. So don’t be surprised if Stoner sires a child \nwho brings home the  world championship around about 2035. \nHistory’s youngest premier-class kings \nJohn Surtees \nBorn: 11  February 1934, Surrey, England \n500  world champion 1956, 1958, 1959, 1960 \n350  world champion 1958, 1959, 1960 \nSurtees \nrode \nroaring \nMV \nAgusta \nmultis \nto  \nfour \n500 \ncrowns, \nlater \nswitching \nto  \ncars \nand \nwinning \nthe  \n1964 \nF1  \ntitle \nwith \nFerrari. \nHe’s \nthe \nonly \nman \nto \nhave \nwon \nworld \ntitles \non \ntwo and \nfour \nwheels. \nSon of a sidecar racer, Surtees grew up in the  London suburbs during \nand \nafter \nthe \nSecond \nWorld \nWar, \nriding \na \nbike \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nwhen \nhe \nwas \n13. \nHe \ncompeted \nin \nhis \nfirst \nrace \na \nyear \nlater, \nas \na \nlast-minute \nsub \nfor \nhis \nfather’s \nregular \npassenger, \nonly \nto \nbe \ndisqualified \nbecause \nhe \nwas \nunder \nage. \nAt \n15 \nhe \nmade \nhis \ngrass \ntrack \ndebut \nand \nthen \nstarted \n\nTOWERING MOUNTAINS AND RAGING RIVERS OF  RIDING TALENT 419 \nroadracing, quickly amassing wins on  a  Vincent Grey Flash, then \nfactory Nortons before the MV  call came. Surtees won a total of 22  500 \nGPs and also took three 350  titles for MV. \nMike Hailwood \nBorn: 2 April 1940, Oxfordshire, England \n500  world champion 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965 \n350  world champion 1967, 1968 \n250 world champion 1961, 1966, 1967 \nHailwood is generally considered to be the greatest racer ever. Supported \nby his  rich father, Mike the  Bike made amazing progress through the \nBritish racing ranks after his  debut in  1957, winning three national \ntitles the  following year. \nDuring 1959 he  won all  four British titles and his  first GP  success. \nTwo summers later he leased a  factory Honda 250 four to  win his  first \nworld title and was quickly signed by the  then-dominant MV factory, \nfor  whom he  won four back-to-back 500 crowns, before returning to \nHonda. He  won four more titles for the Japanese but  ill luck prevented \nhim from giving Honda-san his  first 500 crown. Hailwood then went \nFl  car  racing, before making a fairytale return to bikes in the late 1970s. \nHe  died in a  road car  accident in  1981. \nFreddie Spencer \nBorn: 20 December 1961, Louisiana, USA \n500  world champion 1983, 1985 \n250  world champion 1985 \nA  dazzling natural talent, right up  there with Hailwood, Spencer was \none of  the  first modern generation riders who started not long after \nthey could walk. The Bible Belt kid  made his  dirt  track debut at  the  age \nof six  and was roadracing by 12. \nHoning the art  of  sideways riding, Spencer was soon signed by \nHonda, \nwith \nwhom \nhe \nwon \nthe \nUS \nSuperbike \ntitle \nbefore \nembarking \non \na \nfull-time \nGP \ncareer \nin \n1982. \nThat \nyear \nhe \nbecame \nthe \nyoungest-ever \nwinner \nof \na500 \nGP \nat \n20 \nyears \nand \n196 \ndays, \nclaiming \nthe \nchampionship \nthe \nfollowing \nseason \nafter \na \ntitanic \nduel \nwith \nKenny \nRoberts. \nIn \n’85 \nhe \nbecame \nthe \nfirst, \nand \nstill \nonly, \nman \nin \nhistory \nto \nwin \nthe \n250 \nand \n500 \ntitles \nin \nthe \nsame \nseason, \nbut \nhis \nlater \nyears \nwere \ndogged \nby \ninjury \nand \nill luck. \n\n420 THE FAST STUFF \nValentino Rossi \nBorn: 16 February 1979, Urbino, Italy \n500  world champion 2001, MotoGP world champion 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 \n250  world champion 1999 \n125  world champion 1996 \nIf Surtees and Hailwood were rare teenage winners in  their era, Rossi \nwas one  of a whole brood of teen stars when he burst on  to  the GP  scene \nin  1996. He  rode his  first minibike aged two and his  first minimoto race \nat  11, after starting his career in karts. Italian 125 sport production champ \nat  15,  he  was ushered into the  Euro 125 series by Aprilia in  1995 and \nthen into the world series the  next year, when he won his  first GP. \nThe following season Rossi walked the 125s, establishing a  pattern \nhe’d repeat on  250s and 500s: learn the  first year, dominate the  second. \nHe  switched to  250s in ‘98, becoming the  youngest-ever 250 champ in \n‘99, aged 20  years and 250 days, then graduated to  500s in  2000, \nwinning the  final 500 title in 2001 and the  first four MotoGP crowns. \nCasey Stoner \nBorn: 16 October 1985, Kurri Kurri, NSW, Australia \nMotoGP world champion 2007 \nStoner, like Rossi, belongs to  the  modern generation of kid  racers who \nget  serious about racing before they can  even read or  write. By the  age \nof three he  was riding a  minibike around the  garden, a  year later he \nhad competed in his  first dirt-track race and he won his  first Australian \ndirt-track title aged six. \nBy  the  time Stoner was a  teenager he  knew he  was ready for  the \ntarmac but  Australians aren’t allowed to  roadrace till  16,  so  his  family \nmoved to  the UK soon after his 14th birthday so  he  could start \nroadracing, and he won a  national title in his  first season. In  2001 he \nmade his  GP  debut. Casey won his  first GP  victory in  2003, finished \nsecond in  the  2005 250 World Championship, scored his  first MotoGP \npole position in 2006 and his  first MotoGP win in March 2007. \n\nCHAPTER 55 \nCOMPUTER \nSAYS NO \nJuly 2007 \nMotoGP is  turning tame -  these days there’s less sideways \naction, riding styles are getting more samey and races are  more \nspread out. So  are computerised control systems taking the \nnuttiness out of the world’s maddest motorsport? \nValentino Rossi and Casey Stoner are neck and neck, rocking out \nof  a  slow right-hander, wrenching their machines upright as  they \ngrab big  handfuls of  throttle and take aim at  the  next corner. They \nare out of  sight in  an  instant, gone in  a  blaze of  sound, leaving \nonly a  lingering stench of hot metal and scorched rubber. But, if I’m \nnot mistaken, something was missing from this assault on  the \nsenses. No  wheelspin, no  wheelies, no  sideways silliness. Just mind- \nboggling speed. \nIn  case you hadn’t already noticed, MotoGP has changed. Fast- \naccelerating technology has transformed the bikes from unruly monsters \nto  machines that hardly ever put a  wheel out of  line. If you are  an \nengineer, you  would be justifiably proud of this achievement, but  if you \nare  a  fan, you may be  a  teeny-weensy bit  disappointed. Perhaps you \nused to  enjoy watching MotoGP riders employ increasingly outrageous \ntechniques \nto \nwrestle \ntheir \n250 \nhorsepower \nmissiles \ninto \nsubmission. \nI \nknow I did. \nBut  \nthey \ncall  \nthis \nprogress, \nand \nprogress \nis \na \nroad \nalong \nwhich \nwe  \nare \nalways \ntravelling. \nIn \nthe \n1980s \n500 \nGP \nbikes \nwere \nmade \nmore \nmanageable \nby \nthe \nperfection \nof \nreed-valve \ntechnology. \nIn \nthe \n1990s \nthey \nwere \nfurther \ntamed \nby \nthe \nintroduction \nof \nthe \nbig \nbang \nfiring \nconfiguration. \nIn \n1998 \nthey \nwere \nemasculated \na \nbit \nmore \nby \nthe \nswitch \nto \n‘greener’ \nunleaded \nfuel, \nwhich \nmade \nthem \n‘like \nbig \n250s’, \naccording \nto \n500 \nmaster \nMick \nDoohan. \nThen \nin \n2002 \nthey \nfully \nhad \ntheir \nbollocks \nchopped \noff \nwhen \nthe \nsport \nshifted \nto \n990cc \nfour-strokes. \nAs \nformer \n\n422 THE FAST STUFF \n500 \nwinner \nChristian \nSarron \nsaid: \n‘The \nfour-strokes \nare  \nnice \nbikes... \nfor \ngirls.’ \nSo \nMotoGP’s \nnew \n800s \naren’t \nanything \nrevolutionary, \nthey \nare  \nmerely \nthe product \nof where \nwe are \nat \non \nthe road \nof \ntechnological \nprogress. \nThey \nare \nvery \nmanageable \nmotorcycles \nbecause \nthey \nare \nvery \nwell \nmanaged \nmotorcycles. \nBut is engine management -  traction control, wheelie control, launch \ncontrol, engine-braking control —  really sucking the glory out of MotoGP, \njust like it did  with F1  cars? Yes, if you listen to  the  riders. Even 800s \ngenius Casey Stoner thinks so.  ‘These things should be 1500s, not  800s,’ \nhe says. ‘In fact I’d rather be on  a  500  two-stroke, they weren't stacked \nout with computer control systems. These 800s, everyone can ride \nthem’. Valentino Rossi thinks the  same: ‘I prefer the  990s because the \nlatest control systems make it harder for the rider to make the difference.’ \nIn other words, the most talented riders want nastier bikes, so  they can \nuse  their rare skills to  beat their lesser rivals. \nRossi’s 2007 Fiat Yamaha team-mate Colin Edwards agrees that \nelectronics have taken some of the  talent out  of MotoGP. ‘You go into a \nturn, you take your line, you open the  gas  and the bike somewhat takes \ncare of itself,’ he  says, which doesn’t sound very difficult at  all.  ‘In  the \nold  days you used to  come out  of a  turn, get  on  the  gas  and you'd go \n“Man, I could’ve got on  it five  metres earlier”, next lap you’re on  it five \nmetres earlier and then you’re flying to  the moon, so  that’s where \ntraction control really helps.’ \nRiders fully rely on  the  technology to keep them out  of trouble. At the \nstart of  2007 I eavesdropped on  Stoner debriefing his  engineers after \npractice. The Aussie had been flicked over the highside when he had got \ntoo  eager with the  throttle, and he  was angry. ‘I  should never have \ncrashed,’ he  told his  crew chief. ‘The traction control should have taken \ncare of it.’  So  Stoner believed that the electronics should have translated \nhis  greedy fistful into exactly the  correct amount of power that the  rear \ntyre could handle at  that moment. This would seem to  be  irrefutable \nevidence that traction control does take the  skill out  of riding. \nAnd yet  if electronics trickery has stolen something from MotoGP \nwith one hand, it  does at  least give something back with the  other \n(when the  technology works, that is). ‘These days we  start a lot of GPs \nwith full  and healthy grids,’ says Edwards. ‘In  years past I don’t know \nhow many times guys like Schwantz, Rainey and Doohan rode with \n\nCOMPUTER SAYS NO 423 \nbroken \narms \nand \nlegs. \nThe \ntechnology \ndefinitely \nmakes \nit \nsafer, \nso  \nyou \ndon’t \nhave \nso \nmuch \nof that \nass \npucker \ngoing \non.’ \nChris Vermeulen’s Rizla Suzuki crew chief Tom O’Kane agrees. ‘I see \nit solely as  a  safety issue,’ he  says. ‘I don’t care what kind of traction \ncontrol you’ve got, if you open the  throttle on  one of these things at \nmaximum lean you better know what you’re doing, or  it'll  spit you off. \nI think traction control has been overestimated by people who don’t \nride the bikes.’ \nTraction control may make a rider’s life easier and safer but  it doesn’t \nnecessarily make him any faster around a racetrack. In fact, it may even \nmake him slower, as  Stoner says: ‘The engine cuts reduce the power.’ \nThat’s why most riders prefer minimum traction control, so  the \nelectronics cut  the  power just in time to  prevent a  highside. Edwards: \n‘I’ve tried Valentino’s traction control set-up and I didn’t like it, because \nI couldn’t get  the  bike to  spin to  finish the  turn, it kept running me \noff  the  track. You don’t spin the  800s like the  990s, but  you still need \nsome spin.’ \nSince traction control does allow riders to be braver with the  throttle \nthe  fastest guys must find another part of the  corner in which to  make \nthe  difference. Edwards again: ‘Now it’s  all about how you get into the \nturn, and that is only something a  racer can do.

If everyone \nrides the  same and uses the  same lines, how do  they overtake? With \ndifficulty. Most riders agree that passing is less easy with the  800s, and \nnot  only because it’s  difficult to  find an  alternative line to  get  a  way \npast. The 800s have shorter braking zones because they are slower \ndown the  straights and faster into the  turns, so  it’s  more difficult to \novertake on  the  brakes. . \nThis has  required MotoGP engineers to change their focus on  chassis \nsetup, proving that changing riding styles can  affect technology just as \nchanging technology affects riding styles. ‘Braking stability has become \nmore important,’ says O’Kane. ‘And turning has become much more \nimportant, so  the rider can  carry speed into the corner when he gets off \nthe  brakes without the  thing picking itself up  and running wide. For \nbike setup, the  800s are  a different set  of problems.’ \nThe end result of  the  samey riding styles and reduced overtaking \nopportunities is  less close racing. MotoGP used to  be  renowned for \nultra-close battles up  front, but the  800s are  spreading out  the  action. \nDuring the  last three 990 seasons the  average winning margin in  dry \nraces was just 2.07 seconds. During 2007 the gap from winner to second \nplace more than doubled to 4.54 seconds. \nThis isn’t simply because the  800s are  one-line motorcycles which \nmake overtaking so  difficult —  new tyre regulations have also played a \npart. Riders are  now limited to  the number of tyres they can  use  during \na  GP  which must be  chosen before practice starts. Inevitably, some \nriders choose more suitable batches of  tyres than others, so  the \ncompetition is  less equal than before (though some argue it’s  fairer \n\nCOMPUTER SAYS NO 425 \nbecause \nMichelin \ncan’t \nrush \nin  \nspecially \ntailored \ntyres \non  \nthe  \neve  \nof \nEuropean \nraces). \n‘Now \nit \njust \nseems \nlike \nso  \nmuch \nof \nyour \nrace \nis \ndecided \non  \nThursday \nafternoon, \nwhen \nyou \nchoose \nyour \ntyres,’ \nsays \nNicky \nHayden. \n‘If you \nchoose \nthe wrong \nbatch \nit’s \nhard \nto \ndig \nyourself \nout \nof \nthat \nhole. \nI think \nit’s \nhurt \nthe \nracing, \nwhereas \nbefore, \ncome \nSunday, \neveryone \nwas \npretty \nclose \nbecause \nduring \npractice \nyou'd \neventually \ntry \na \ntyre \nthat \nworked. \nI \nwas \nnever \na \nbig \nfan of \nthe \nnew \nrule, \nwhen \nthey \nwere \nkicking \naround \nthe \nidea \nI \nsaid \nI \ndon’t \nlike \nit, \njust \nbecause \neveryone \nwas \nreal \nclose \nas \nfar \nas \ntyres \nwent, \nso \nthe \nracing \nwas \nreal close.’ \nSo  there’s no  doubt that the  800s have changed MotoGP in  ways \nthat weren’t predicted, or  desired. And with teams already struggling \nwith sponsorship, MotoGP bosses Dorna should be  worried that the \nbikes are  less fun to  watch, because presumably fewer people will \nbother to  turn on  their TVs. But MotoGP’s technical rules are  looked \nafter by the factories, not Dorna, and the factories want more technology, \nnot  less, because that’s why they’re there in the  first place, to  develop \nnew technology. So  there’s zero chance of MotoGP diverting from its \ncurrent path. \nWhich might just give World Superbikes a chance to  get one over on \nits  glitzier rival. If WSB boss Paolo Flammini bans traction control by \nequipping bikes with a  ‘control’ ECU, he  might be  able to  offer a \nspectacle that MotoGP has  wilfully denied itself. Then the final decision \nwill come down to  you lot  sitting at  home in  front of the  TV:  do  you \nwant high-brow technology, like Fl  cars, or  lowbrow fun, like Nascar? \nYou decide... \nMotoGP Mutterings: January 2008 \nI’ve \nsmelt \nthe \nfuture \nof \nMotoGP, \nand \nboy, \nit \ndon’t \nhalf \npong \nSmell \nis  \nthe \nmost \nevocative \nof  \nall  \nthe \nsenses, \nwhich \nis  \nwhy \nI’m \nimmediately \ndragged \nback \nto \nmy \nschooldays \n— \nin \na \nwibbly-wobbly \nmovie \nmemory \nkind \nof \na \nway \n— \nupon \nentering \nthe \ncavernous \nRed \nBull \nRookies \nawning \nwithin \nthe \nMotoGP \npaddock. \nThe \natmosphere \nis \nthick \nwith \nthat \nbitter, \nnose-puckering \nstench \nI \nremember \npermeating \nthe \nlocker \nroom \nafter \neach \nmean \nand \ndownright \nvicious \ngame \nof \nrugby \nI \nplayed \nin \nmy \nteens. \nExcept \nthat \nin \nRed \nBull \nRookies’ \nworld \nthe \nreek \nof \n\n426 THE FAST STUFF \nteenage sweat and testosterone is  turbocharged with a  malodorous \nsoup of fetid leathers, smouldering rubber and acrid two-stroke smoke. \nExcuse me  while I go outside, I think I’m  going to puke... \nThe Rookies awning is populated by 23  of the  world’s fastest 13-  to \n16-year olds, chosen from a  nerve-jangling tearjerker of  a  global \nselection process that aims to  fast-track these youngsters —  via  a  series \nof races at  MotoGP events aboard identical KTM 125  race bikes —  to \nMotoGP fame and fortune. And perhaps that’s what really makes your \nnasal hairs stand on  end: it’s  the  heady stench of youthful ambition \nintermingled with the  odour of fear of failure. \nThere are  futures at  stake here, big futures for the riders (and for the \nparents) who only have to  let  their eyes wander a  few yards up  the \npaddock to  see  what ostentatious thrills might one day be  theirs: the \npalatial motorhomes of MotoGP’s gilded elite, gleaming Ferraris and \nPorsches and a coterie of silver-tongued managers and fixers, grinning \nhangers-on and girlfriends with ten-thousand dollar smiles and plastic \ntits. What wide-eyed pubescent wouldn’t risk it all for a  stab at  that? \nThe Red Bull recruits have already made it  this far,  from a  list  of \nmore than 1100 applicants from 60 countries, and from here on  in every \ngear change is  going to  be  the  most important gear change of  their \nlives. These kids’ minds are  set  on  their futures like most kids’ never \nare when they’re just 13 or  14.  I was getting severely beaten for smoking \nNumber Tens down fag alley and dreaming of riding an  RD400 when I \nwas their age, not  focusing on  becoming champion of the  whole wide \nworld. \nYou can see  it in  their faces, hear it in  their voices as  they describe \neach and every moment of  their latest race with a  glorious intensity \nthat only someone relatively new to  this life  can feel. It almost makes \nme  want to  be  an  adolescent again. Their eyes aren’t quite rolling \naround in  the  backs of their heads from all  the  adrenalin, but  it’s  not \nfar off.  Ironically, the last people on  this earth who would actually need \na can  of Red Bull are  these 22  boys and one  girl. They're already flying, \nthey don’t need wings. Not so  the  affable Red Bull marketing reps, \ndashing around making this dazzling enterprise -happen while \nenthusiastically quaffing can  after can  of their speedy brew and hoping \nthat somehow this show will add to  the  three billion cans they already \nsell  each year. \nThe \nRookies \nraces \nare  \nusually \nhugely \nentertaining, \nif \nonly \nfor \nthe \nwild \n\nTHE FUTURE DON’T HALF PONG 427 \ndisplays of  reckless teenage braggadocio and out-of-their minds \noptimism that characterise so  many of  the overtaking manoeuvres. \nAnd the  sense of fraternity among the  23  riders is refreshingly warm, \nnone of  the dead eyes and dead legs I remember from my  days in \nschoolboy sport. But  then I can’t help but feel  a nagging sense of moral \nunease about the  whole thing —  allowing a  bunch of schoolchildren to \ntear-arse around a  racetrack at  120mph, flogging energy drink and \nentertaining a  hundred thousand trackside fans and a  few hundred \nmillion TV viewers. \nIsn’t 13  a  bit  young to  be  sucked deep into the drive train of  the \ncorporate motorsport machine? Shouldn’t the  youngest of these stars \nof the future be back home swapping ringtones, bullying teacher, doing \nsome heavy petting, some studying, maybe even a  bit  of  schoolboy \nmotocross or  minimoto? Or maybe it’s  time to allow 13-year-olds to  do \nall the  other supposedly adult things we  currently don’t allow them to \ndo  —  like driving on  the  road, drinking in  pubs, working in  factories, \ngoing down the mines, owning guns, voting, smoking, joining the army \nand having sex. Just a  thought. \n\nINDEX \nFigures in italics refer to illustrations \nMotorcyles, teams \nand sponsors \nAprilia 90, 101, 137, \n165, 169, 172-174, \n197, 208-209, 212, \n235, 240, 249, 271, \n276,

      "text": "INTRODUCTION \nSome kind of extreme \nI first discovered that I like  going fast  on  motorcycles when I got  my  first \nbike aged 17.  Riding motorcycles (even now, at much more sensible speeds) \nis one  of the  big joys of my  life  —  I would never want to live  without that \nfeeling —  and I’ve  always got a huge kick out  of watching other people ride \nbikes fast. Motorcycle racers are  fascinating people, they live  their lives at \nsome kind of extreme, which makes them fascinating people to  talk to, \nmostly, anyway. \nThat’s what this book is really about —  it is a  collection of stories and \ninterviews that live and breathe on  the words of the sport’s towering greats, \nlike Wayne Rainey recalling his  pre-race psych-up routine: ‘I’d  be dancing \naround my  motorhome, kicking my  leathers, or  I’d  sit  there, focusing on \nthe feeling of being excited and wanting to spit nails and rip the handlebars \noff the  bike’. That’s what I love about motorcycle racing, it’s  not  just the \nbikes and the  speed, it’s  the  gladiatorial heroes and the  nutters who'll do \njust about anything to win. It is a violent, vicious sport, but at these extremes \nyou  can  easily discern the  difference between the  good guys and the  bad \nguys. Like Orwell said, it’s war, without the  shooting. \nThe pages of this book are  filled with the words of incredible people like \nRainey: my  thanks to all of them for allowing me  to take up their time. \nMat Oxley \nLondon, Spring 2008 \nMy thanks to Arie Blokland, Adil Jal Darukhanawala, Mark Forsyth, Mark \nGraham, Mark Hughes and Darryl Reach of Haynes, Magnus Johansson, \nMick Matheson, Rupert Paul, Marc Potter, Steve Rose, Matthias Schréter, \nMichael Scott, Tum Thompson, John Ulrich, John Westlake, Hugo Wilson, \nKen Wootton, Gunther Wiesinger and all  the  other editors who’ve been \nkind or  foolish enough to publish my crazed rants."

I got to  find out in the 1989 Suzuka Eight Hours, the \nmost hyped race in the world \nThe weather is typical of  Japan in July —  so  steamy hot the air you breathe \nfeels second hand and rivulets of sweat run  down every part of your body. \nI shouldn't care though —  I am  lying on  a couch with two girls draping \nnicely chilled towels across my  legs and torso. I have an  ice-cold drink \nin one hand and a bow] of sliced orange and banana within reach of the \nother. A  Japanese doctor massages my body and an  electric fan blows a \ncooling draught on  my  face, rustling the  leaves of the  nearby palms. \nHeaven surely couldn’t be  a much more delightful experience —  but  the \npleasure of this visit through the  pearly gates is tainted by the knowledge \nthat I soon have to return to  the  fiery torment of hell. \nHell in  this case is  the Suzuka racetrack, designed back in  1962 by \nsome fiendish Japanese, obviously intent on  giving racers sleepless \nnights well into the  next millennium. \nThe circuit is  tough enough in  itself but it’s  the viscous Japanese \nsummer which makes the Suzuka Eight Hours bike racing’s Dante’s \nInferno. As  you get deeper into the race, the ogres of  physical and \nmental exhaustion grow like monsters before you and devils dance \naround, \nlaughing \nhideously \nat \nthe \nsight \nof \na \nmere \nmortal \nventuring \nso \nfar into their terrible territory. \nThe \nexhaustion \nmay \nnot \nbe  \ntangible \nbut \nthe \ndevils \ncertainly \nare  \n— \nthey \nare \ndressed \nin  \ncolourful \nsuits, \nmounted \non  \nevil \n145 \nhorsepower \nmotorcycles \nand \ntheir \nnames \nare \nRainey, \nSchwantz, \nGardner, \nDoohan, \nSarron, \nMagee \nand \nKocinski. \nThey \nfly \npast, \ntaunting \nyou \nwith \ndaredevil \ndeeds \nthat \nwould \nmean \ninevitable \ndisaster \nif \nyou \nwere \nfoolish \nenough \nto \nattempt \nto emulate \nthem."

You can no  longer smugly announce ‘I  could do \nthat’ and walk away from the  spectator area safe in  the  knowledge \nthat, if someone put  a  million dollars in your hands and sat  you on  a \nfactory race bike, you could cut  the  same lap time as  these guys. \nI can only watch through my  visor in wonder as  Mick Doohan slips \nby me  into Suzuka’s first gear hairpin aboard his  RVF750, lays the bike \non  its  side until both tyres must surely exceed their traction limit, \ncracks open the  throttle as  he  progressively moves his  body weight to \nGea ty the front of the machine and lays a streak of scorched \nue rubber on  the  tarmac. The thick black arc  curves \n‘I’m still close outward towards the kerb and continues unfalteringly \nenough to see  what’s through the  shift to second for another 20 yards until \nhappening as Doohan hits third, then the  tyre hooks up  and the \nDoohan’s rear tyre RVF’s power finds another way of  showing itself — \nbreaks traction, this the front wheel jumps two feet in  the air  before \ntime at very high slamming back down onto the  deck, just in time for \nlean, and lays Doohan to  snatch fourth and lay  the  bike into the \nanother wild trail next, fast  right-hander. \nof rubber’ Since the hairpin Doohan has been climbing a \nLe \nRIE \nshallow \nrise \nbut \nafter \nthe \nbrow \nhalfway \nthrough \nthe \nfast right, the  track drops away. I’m  still close enough \nto  see  what’s happening as  his rear tyre again breaks traction, this time \nat  very high lean, and lays another wild trail of  rubber, thicker and \ndarker than the  hundreds of others already etched on  the  tarmac. As \nthe rear  tyre gets more and more out of line Doohan turns the handlebars \nonto opposite lock to control the  slide, shifts into fifth and lifts the bike \nmomentarily before laying the  RVF into the  next, even faster right that \nleads into Suzuka’s famous Spoon Curve. \nI’m \ngiven \nsimilar \nexhibitions \nof \nwhat \nit \ntakes \nto \nbe \na \nsuperhero \non \na \nmillion \ndollar \nfactory \ncontract \nby \nthe \nother \nstars. \nI \ndon’t \nemulate \nthem, \nI \ncan \nhardly \nlearn \nfrom \nthem \n— \nall \nI \nknow \nis \nthat \nthey \nare \ngoing \na \nlot \nfaster \nand \nI \nknow \nthat \nif \nI \ntry \nto \ngo \nas \nfast \n— \nI'll \ncrash. \nThat’s \nwhy \nthey’re rich boys and I’m  not. \nBut \nfor \none \nweek \nI’m \na \nfactory \nrider \n— \nwell, \nalmost. \nI’ve \ngot \njust \nabout \neverything \nI \nneed: \na \nmega-trick \nRC30 \nprepared \nby \nHonda’s \nHamamatsu \nboffins \n(including \nforks \nmachined \nfrom \nsolid), \nflash \nleathers \ncreated"

Over the next two days I have a further two 45-minute timed \nsessions to  slice off at least another two seconds, or  suffer humiliation \nat  the  hands of the  stars who I have to  interview at  every GP  in  my \nposition as  GP reporter for Motor Cycle News. The trouble is that it’s  three \nmonths since I last sat  on  a  race bike. That’s enough time to  lose the \nconfidence you  need to  flick into turns and slide out  of them. Not only \nthat, it’s  not  easy setting up a race bike when you do it so  infrequently. \nIt’s  like  speaking a foreign language a few times a year —  you forget the \nvocabulary you need to make things work. \nIn  the  first timed session I manage a 24.371 —  which might just get \nus  on  the  grid. I come across Rob McElnea scrubbing in  a  new set  of \ntyres on  his RC30. I  follow him, hoping for  a  tow —  a  trick that \nriders employ to  great effect in GP  qualifying. He  signals me  to  tuck in \nbehind him but he’s doing 21s and I can’t hack it.  He  drags a  few \nhundred yards on  me  in a lap, snatches a look at  me  over his  shoulder \nand I can almost see  his  mocking grin behind the blackout visor.

I try to  give chase to  Dominique \nSarron on  a factory RVF but halfway through the lap that I feel  is going \nto  be The One, the  RC30 springs a water leak, forcing me  into the  pits. \nI have to wait until my  final Saturday session to  get us  on  the  grid. \nAt dinner Rainey asks me  how things are  going —  and he’s managing \nnot  to  be  too  patronising. I tell  him I’ve gone two seconds faster every \ntime I’ve  been out  and I feel I can  go  quicker. ‘Hey, I can  go  faster,’ he \nsays. ‘You sound like a  real racer, I'll  have to  come over and interview \nyou guys sometime,’ he  grins. ‘Anyway, just get  into the  low 20s  and \nyou'll be  okay.’ Rainey manages to  make ‘low 20s’ sound so  easy, and \nlying in bed  thinking my way round Suzuka’s 18 corners I reckon I can \nmake \na \n2m \n22s \nlap \non \nSaturday. \nBut \nI \nhaven't \ntaken \nJapan’s \nfreaky \nclimate into account —  when I wake up  there is a  typhoon outside.

After a  few mouthfuls of  electrolyte \n‘energy drink I line up  for  the  sprint. My mouth is parched, my  heart \nracing and my legs nervy like jelly as  Suzuka’s electronic grandstand info \nboard flashes up ‘GO!’ I make a good getaway but within two  seconds all \nhell breaks loose. Two bikes collide in the getaway melee, I swerve wildly \nto  avoid the  exploding debris and I can’t believe it when another bike \nalongside me  ploughs into the  wreckage.

Every hour off the \nbike —  while Gilbert is out  there doing his  bit —  is spent on  a bed being \nmassaged and rehydrating. There’s even a  canister of oxygen on  hand \nif  I need it. And the  two girl assistants who help me  dress and undress \ngive me  a new pair of socks for every session. \nDoohan is  receiving similar treatment in  the  next door pit  but he \ndoesn’t look as  knackered as  I feel —  he  doesn’t get  new socks either. \nThe awesome pace begins to  tell  at  the  front of the  pack.

Dawdling out  of the \nSuzuka pit lane the  motor crackles though its  carbon-fibre cans and \nsounds pretty harmless. It  drives from nowhere, making a  tuned \nRD350LC seem unrideable. Thirteen corners later I hit  Suzuka’s back \nstraight, which curves gently left  and uphill over a \nrise, and I let  the  NSR do  its  very worst for  the  first \n‘The front wheel time. \nhardly makes Revs rise in a  remorseless rush, I’m shifting gears \ncontact with the faster than I’ve ever shifted gears before, the  motor \ntarmac all the way shrieking out more than 160 utterly intimidating \ndown the  190mph horsepower at  12,500rpm. The acceleration freezes \nback straight’ my  brain and paralyses my  senses which struggle to \naoe cope with the  speed at  which the  scenery turns to  a \nblur. The front wheel hardly makes contact with the \ntarmac all  the  way down the 190mph back straight, skimming from \nripple to ripple and grabbing left, right, left, right with a scary violence. \nThe 115  kilo NSR makes an  early Suzuki GSX-R feel mighty stable. The \nonly way to keep the thing going straight is to lock my arms around the \npetrol tank and hold on  for grim life, just like  the death-cheating heroes \nof  the 1970s on  the Daytona banking. Surely Lawson didn’: ride his \nNSR like this all year? \nIndeed he  did not. After a  frankly worrying (nope, make that \nterrifying) first few  laps, I pull into the pits ashen faced and feeling my \nrespect for  Lawson raised to  new heights. I mime a  nasty tankslapper \nto  the  waiting HRC mechanics who descend upon their pride and joy, \nturning the  handlebars from side to  side and chatting furiously.

      "text": "RIDING THE NSR WAS LIKE DEATH... WH \nspeeds. The NSR does indeed require serious physical input to overcome \nthe  chassis’ inadequacies. Lawson and his  pit-lane guru Erv  Kanemoto \nused 12  different chassis during ’89  as  they tried to  tame the  NSR but \nthe  bike still goes where it wants to,  rather than where you aim it.  At \nthe end of  Suzuka’s main straight all  it  wants to  do  is  keep going \nstraight, and the only way I can  get it to take the  third-gear left-hander \nis by wrenching hard on  the  handlebars to  overcome the  gyro-effect. \nEven so,  I never manage to hit  the  apex. God only knows how Lawson \nraced the  bike, let alone won the world title on  the  thing. \nTwo weeks before I scared myself on  the  NSR I had ridden Kevin \nSchwantz’s 1989 Pepsi Suzuki RGV500 in the  less exotic surroundings \nof Snetterton, Norfolk. The RGV consumes the  straights with almost as \nmuch voracity as  the  Honda, melting the  scenery, dragging the horizon \ntowards you at jet-like speed. \nThere’s no  doubt that the  Honda has  more power —  Lawson needed all \nthe top speed he  could get to  compensate for  the bike’s nightmare \nhandling —  but  the  NSR engine isn’t the vicious beast that racing legend \nwould have us  believe. The theory goes that the Suzuki has smooth, \ncontrolled power, while the  Honda is the  tyre-shredding sonofabitch. In \nfact the  Honda has  the  smoother power curve, even if it runs out  of puff \n500rpm sooner than the  13,000rpm RGV. Both motors have gaping wide \npowerbands and are  much more tractable than you'd believe possible. \nBut the  RGV’s power curve is much steeper, so  much so  that it tries to \nloop the loop in the first three gears, which is why Schwantz must resort \nto  his  rodeo riding stunts when he gets on  the  throttle, moving his  body \nweight as  far forward as  it'll go,  so  he doesn’t have to turn off the throttle \nto keep the  front under control. The NSR wheelies for sure, but  its flatter \npower curve means the  front lifts  more controllably. \nIf you watched Lawson take on  Schwantz and Wayne Rainey during \nthe \n1989 \nseason \nyou'll \nknow \nthat \nit \nwas \nalways \na \nproblem \nfor \nLawson \nto \nput \nthe \nNSR \nwhere \nhe \nwanted \nit. \nWhile \nRainey’s \nYamaha \nand \nin \nparticular \nSchwantz’s \nSuzuki \nproved \nnimble \nenough \nto \nhog \nthe \ntight, \nfast \nline, \nLawson \nhad \nto \nuse \nevery \nbit \nof \nthe \ntrack \nto \nstay \nin \nthe \nhunt. \nHe \nhad \nto \nuse \nhis \nbody \nin \na \ndifferent \nway \nto \nsubdue \nthe \nNSR, \nhanging \nhis \ntorso \nas \nfar \noff \nthe \ninside \nas \nhe \ncould \nto \ndrag \nthe \nbike \nthrough \nthe  turns. \nThe \nNSR’s \nbehaviour \nis \na  \npuzzle \nbecause \nthe  \ntextbooks \ndictate \nthat \nits \nchassis \ndimensions \nshould \nmake \nit \nturn \nbetter \nthan \nthe \nSuzuki."

Just  a spark of mental input was enough to flick the bike on  its \nside, at  the  very most it needed just a  tickle of the  handlebars to  get it \nthrough the  faster curves on  precisely the  line you’d intended. But the \nSuzuki's light-headedness became hard work on  the gas. Schwantz \nmay be happy exiting a turn cranked over with the front tyre lifting and \nthe  rear spinning, but  I wasn’t about to  go there. \nAdapting one’s brains to  the way these 500s shrink wide open \nracetracks into slender ribbons of tarmac isn’t a rapid process. Neither \nis  reprogramming one’s brain to  their stopping power. The Suzuki's \ncarbon AP  Lockheeds explode so  violently into action when you grab a \nhandful that it’s  hard just staying on  board. The Honda’s Nissins aren’t \nso  dramatic but you still need to  lock your arms to  maintain control \nduring braking. \nAt  Suzuka I managed three outings on  the NSR, about 40 minutes on \nthe  bike, before I was a  physical wreck: my  wrists and arm muscles \nached from braking and turning, my  leg muscles ached from shifting \nmy body around the bike and my brain ached from total mental \noverload.

Honda lost \nLawson at the end of ’89 for the same reason they lost Valentino \nRossi a  decade and a  half later —  they treated him like just \nany other employee -  and because the NSR was a  motorcycle \nracer’s nightmare. \nLawson is  a  highly intelligent man, so  you need to  read \nbetween the lines to  find out what he  really thinks.

And who could \nblame him for  that? \nStanding in  the  Marlboro Team Roberts truck at  Jerez, Eddie Lawson \npops a  couple of  small white pills into his  mouth and sweeps them \ndown his  throat with a gulp of water. \n‘Hey, Eddie, are  you on  drugs?’ I ask  idly. \n‘Nope, they’re aspirin. I gotta headache. It  must be  looking at  you \njournalist guys all day.’ \nLawson names the  interview as  the  thing he most hates about being \na  four-times world champion. A  Honda calendar, recently printed to \ncelebrate his  1989 title success aboard its  NSR500, quotes him thus: \n‘I’m not  looking for fame but  for  self-satisfaction.’ \nThis man does not need praise and glory to  motivate him. \nHis  motivation to  win, to  be  the  best, year after year, comes wholly \nfrom inside. \nWhen Lawson talks his  words are  as  dry as  dust. And the  man is a \nmaster of ultra-understatement. \nHow does it feel to be back on  Yamaha’s YZR500, which has already taken you \nto three world titles? \nPretty familiar, it’s  real easy to  ride and I already feel comfortable.

But  the  bike is only cranked over for an  instant \nbefore the Australian wrenches it upright and turns on  the  throttle. \nIn  first gear the  rear Michelin immediately breaks traction. The revs \nrise wildly as  the rear end cocks at least 20 degrees to  the right, the rear \ntyre etching a  black mark right out  to the kerb.

Out of that curve Doohan grabs another \ngear and the  warbling exhaust note signals that the  rear tyre is  still \nscrabbling for grip as  he  shifts up  again and takes aim at  the  daunting, \nsixth-gear left  that leads onto Misano’s back straight. \nRear-wheel steering is nothing new.

It is the rider who is able to use  his  riding \ntalent and physical strength to harness each step forward in GP technology \nwho ultimately wins the  day. Those who don’t keep rolling on  that \nlearning curve get left way behind to fill the lower placings. \nThe art  of  controlling a  170 horsepower 500 two-stroke V4  entails \nsuperhuman powers of co-ordination and the ability to analyse machine \nbehaviour minutely through each millisecond at  speeds of  up  to \n190mph. It also requires immense physical strength to resist the  forces \nimposed by modern tyres and chassis. \nThis fact is strangely neglected by just about everyone except the riders \nand a growing coterie of paddock quacks. Old-timers who censure today’s \nsuperstars for  failing to  emulate the  three-GPs-in-a-day performance of \nMike Hailwood and other old-school racing legends are  blind to  the \nadvances of science. In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, g-force was  something \nonly jet fighter pilots worried about. It’s  different these days. \nAnd yet  the  New Age stars talk of  their craft with mind-boggling \nmatter-of-factness: scrubbing the  front tyre sideways to  supplement \nbraking power, deftly controlling the  crucial rear-wheel slide with foot \npressure and throttle opening, steering the  bike by body positioning \nand weighting of the  footrests. All  this has  become just another part of \ntheir workaday racing lives. \nSimply staying on  a 500  is a major feat. Leading brake manufacturers \nAP  Lockheed calculate that riders hit about 1.5g during heavy braking, \nwhich means the  weight of rider and machine is amplified one and a \nhalf times. Thus.a rider has  to work against 300  kilos or  thereabouts as \nhe hurtles towards a corner. \nAt  this point the  rear wheel is probably off  the  ground, such is  the \nweight transfer during braking, and the  combined weight of rider and \nmachine is  thrown onto the  front wheel and the  rider’s wrists. The \ntendency for anyone unused to  such vicious forces is to be thrown over \nthe  handlebars. I know this because it happened to  me  while testing \nDoohan’s NSR. A  few laps and my  arms could no  longer resist the \nbraking g-forces, so  they folded while I was braking into a fast right- \nhander and I ended up  flopping over the ‘bars and headbutting the \nfront number plate.

It’s a  happy \ncoincidence that the leverage required to induce that level of deceleration \nhas  decreased as  stopping power has  increased.

      "text": "32 THE FAST STUFF \ntime comes when the rider must set  in motion the  chain of events that \nwill take him through the  corner. His eyes are  already lining up  the \nentry point as  he begins to ease off the front brake and apply handlebar \nand footrest pressure to  steer the  bike. \nAlthough the  tarmac takes a  smooth U-turn onto the  next straight, \nrider and machine don’t describe such a  graceful arc. That style may \nhave been the only way round a corner in the days of slippy tyres, dodgy \nsuspension and bendy frames, but modern GP machines permit a faster, \nmore aggressive route through the  turn. \nThe object is  to  minimise the time the machine is  cranked over, \nbecause in  that situation neither brake nor throttle can be  applied. \nNowadays the  rider keeps the  bike relatively upright deeper into the \ncorner, accomplishing the  actual turning in an  instant and then firing \nthe bike out  on  the  throttle. In effect he describes a ‘V’  line through the \nturn, not the classic and graceful ‘U’  of olden times. \nGetting the turning over and done with as  rapidly as  possible \ndemands violent measures. The rider doesn’t just lean the bike into the \ncorner —  he  knocks the machine onto its  side, applying aggressive \ncounter-steer by pushing heavily on  the  right handlebar to  turn the \nfront wheel to  the  left  and drop the  machine to  the  right. Body weight \nand feet inputs also play their part, the  pilot’s backside shifting to  the \nright and his  extra weighting of  the right footrest help to  pull the \nmachine over. The transition from upright to  full  lean is accomplished \nin  such a  dramatically short time that it  seems certain that the  rider \nwon't be able to  arrest the  descent before it’s  too  late. \nOf course, this time he  does avert disaster, and yet  as  the  bike leans \ndeep into the  corner the rider is  still fingering the front brake lever, \nscrubbing off excess speed as  the disc pads gently bite on  the decelerating \nrotors. From now on,  applying any more brake really can spell disaster, \nfor  the  average rider at  least, because this is where Mr  Average and the \nelite go  their different ways. Instead these elite riders happily induce \nfront-tyre slides, either with a touch more brake, a tweak on  the  ‘bars or \na  fraction more lean angle. The tyre then begins to  slide and scrubs off \nthe  speed which couldn’t be  safely lost  with a  more drastic pull on  the \nbrake. This is indeed treading the fine line between glory and disaster. \nRainey \nexplains \nhow \nit \nworks: \n‘I  \nusually \nonly \nscrub \nthe  \nfront \ntyre \nwhen \nI \nget \ninto \na  \nturn \ntoo  \nhot  \nbut  \nthis \nis \nhow \nit \ngoes: \nyou're \nin \nfourth \ngear \nand \njetting \ndown \nto  \nthis \nU-turn. \nYou \nbrake \nand \nflick \nit \nin.  \nYou \ncan"

And yet because he \nserved his  novice years on  two-stroke proddie bikes he doesn’t like the \nfeel of engine braking, so  when he  races Honda’s RVF in  the  Suzuka \nEight Hours he enters corners with the  clutch disengaged! \n‘On a  four-stroke I can slide the  rear even before the  apex and I can \nslide the  front good too,’ says Doohan. ‘At  the Suzuka Eight Hours I \nhad the  front skidding in the  second part of the  Spoon Curve.

It’s  more just to  slow the \nthing up,  when it does slide it’s  kind of like  “OH!” and you kinda dig in \nyour knee and it’s  a  bit  of  a moment.’ \nWith the bike into the corner and turned, the  rider is thinking of one \nthing and one thing only from now on  ~  getting on  the  throttle as  soon \nas  possible.

      "text": "34 THE FAST STUFF \nthe  next straight, hence the  hurry to  get  the  turning done to  allow \nmore time and space for playing with the  throttle. \nThe turning point is  the slowest stage during cornering but mid- \ncorner speeds saw a significant increase in  1990. Before then tyres had \nprovided the predictability to  ride the bike deep into the turn and \nsideways on  the  exit, but  they hadn’t given enough side grip to  allow \nriders to  maintain real corner speed. That changed with Michelin’s \n1990 front and rear radial slicks, but  there was a sting in  the  tail  for \nriders who tried to  abuse the  extra grip they discovered at  maximum \nlean. No  doubt about it,  1990 was the  year of the  highside —  Doohan, \nSchwantz, Wayne Gardner and Niall Mackenzie all  discovering the \nterrifying, bone-crunching up-and-over flip. \n‘Suddenly we  all  found we  had a  lot  more grip when banked over, \nmore grip from all parts of the  tyre,’ says Mackenzie, Schwantz’s Lucky \nStrike Suzuki team-mate during 1990. ‘At  the point where they used to \nslide they kept on  gripping and some riders were giving it more and \nmore throttle at bigger and bigger leans angles until eventually they got \nspat off.’ \nIt was some time before riders had realised that you abused the extra \ngrip at your peril, and by then the  500  GP injury list had grown critically \nlong, to the point where the  sport seriously discussed banning 500s and \nreplacing them with 375cc two-strokes or  600cc four-strokes. \nThe 1990 world champion, Rainey, came within an  ace of  falling \nvictim too, smashing several fairing screens at early GPs, as  he wrestled \nto  control the  early stages of a highside. \n‘The bikes have been throwing everybody off because now you’re at \nmaximum lean angle with so  much grip that when it does step out  it \nthrows you a  long way,’ says Rainey. ‘That’s what I try and stay away \nfrom \nin \nthe \nmiddle \nof \nthe \ncorner \nwhen \nyou've \ngot \nmax \npressure \non \nthe \ntyres.

This action will tighten his corner-exit \nline and give him more room than he  would otherwise have had to \nunleash as  much power as  possible as  soon as  possible. \nRainey again: ‘There’s a certain point where you see  the inside of the \ntrack, you can see  the  outside of the  track and you know you are  not \ngoing to make the corner, so  you give it more throttle. You just need the \nbike to  turn a little bit and as  soon as  it’s  spinning it turns just enough \nto where you can  pick the  bike up  and then you nail it off the  corner.’ \nThis squirt of wheelspin which initiates the  final turning phase is \nbarely visible; the  turning is  all  over and done with by the  time the \nrider completes his  acceleration out  of  the  corner with a  spectacular \nbroad-slide. ‘Where you really see  us  sliding around coming out, that’s \nmostly power-wise,’ continues Rainey. ‘Usually the  turning is all  done \nright when it first spins, we’re doing that only to  help turn the  bike.’ \nDoohan is probably the  most spectacular and sustained of the  rear- \nwheel steerers. Although a  newcomer to  500s, the  Aussie reckons the \nHonda gives him no  other choice (Doohan sometimes uses lower-than- \nusual gearbox ratios to encourage the bike to wheelspin to aid  turning). \n‘It’s partly the way the power comes in,’ he explains. ‘But at the moment \nit’s  also one of the  only ways I can steer the  bike, especially in  faster \ncorners. If it’s  not spinning, it’s  not turning. On  the  Yamaha you don’t \nhave to  do  that. But I’ve noticed that whenever I’m sideways on  the \nHonda, Schwantz is sideways on  the  Suzuki, but  my  suspension seems \nto work better in the  slide than his.’ \nRainey reckons to  have between 8000 and 10,000 rpm on  the  rev- \ncounter when he first begins to work the  twistgrip. At  those revs —  with \nmore than 3000rpm still to  go  —  the 500 is  already producing plenty \nenough power and torque to  spin the rear tyre with only the  most \ndelicate \nincrease \nin \nthrottle \nopening. \nA \nfraction \ntoo \nmuch \nthrottle \nand \nthe \nrear \ntyre \nwill \nspin \nout, \nmost \nlikely \ncausing \na \nhighside \ncrash."

      "text": "36 THE FAST STUFF \nThe art  therefore is  to  get the rear tyre spinning just enough to \nexecute the turn, and then maintain forward drive as  the  tyre struggles \nto  hook up. Doohan once again: ‘I’m just feeding the throttle in, \nwinding it back and forth, trying not  to put down too  much or  too  little. \nI just keep it spinning until it gets to a point where it’s  not  making any \nmore power and then I shift gears. I’d  rather have it doing that than \nlifting the  front and shaking its head.’ \nThrottle control isn’t enough on  its  own to  do  this and riders play a \ntreacherous and delicate juggling act, weighting the footrests and \nshifting body weight to  increase or  decrease rear tyre grip as  required. \nSometimes the  rider will find too  much grip and he  can loosen the \nrear tyre’s hold on  the  tarmac by  shifting his  body weight forward, \naway from the  tyre contact patch. As  ever he  relies on  phenomenally \nrapid reactions to  check any sudden loss of grip before the  point of no \nreturn is reached. And just as  the  rider uses his  inside knee as  a lean- \nangle sensor, his  outer foot plays a  crucial part as  an  early warning \nsystem and can then provide the  extra grip required to  avert disaster. \nBy  forcing down on  the upper, outside footrest the rider obtains \nexceptional feel for  rear tyre grip. Weighting the footrest further \nincreases grip by  counteracting the tyre’s tendency to  sideslip and \ncrucially helps move the  machine upright where the  tyre contact patch \nis larger, once again offering more grip and predictability. \nRainey believes he  couldn’t make a  corner at  GP  speed if he merely \nsat  on  the  bike without pushing down —  hard. ‘You'd actually fall  off. \nYou've got  to push down on  the  bike to  get your seating right so  when \nyou're on  the  throttle it’s  all hooked up  together. Going through a right \nyou're using your right side to  feel  for traction and your left  to  give you \ntraction. You can feel the  grip more and you can control the  bike a  lot \nbetter by forcing down on  the  ‘peg when the  rear steps out.’ \nSchwantz, less of a  dirt tracker than his  American contemporaries, \nacquired his  footrest-weighting techniques from another two-wheel \ndiscipline. ‘I learned a lot about how to keep traction from riding trials. \nYou lean out  of a  corner on a trials bike to  keep the  tyre biting. On  a \nroadracer, \nif \nyou \nkeep \nyour \nweight \non \nthe \noutside \n’peg \nas \nyou \nthrow \nthe \nbike \ninto \na \ncorner \nyou \nstand \nmuch \nless \nchance \nof \nhaving \nthe \nrear \nend \nstep \nout. \nThen \nyou \ngo \nover \nthe \nseat \nand \nhang \noff \nthe \ninside, \nbut \nyou \nstill \nkeep \na \nlot \nof \nweight \non \nthat \noutside \n‘peg \nand \nyou \nput \nsome \nmore \non \nif \nthe  tyre starts really sliding.’"

I’m right off the  side of the bike, \nso  it takes much longer for me  to  get back on  it and control the  slide.’ \nAs  body weight is  transferred back to  the  centre of  the  machine, \nlifting the  bike still further, the  rider heaves himself forward over the \nfront. Today’s 500s wheelie out  of most corners and lift  the  front even \nwhen the rider still needs the front tyre’s grip while arcing out  of turns. \nSo the turn will almost certainly be completed with the bike hard against \nthe kerb, front wheel off the  tarmac, the rider still using body weight to \nsteer (with the  front wheel airborne he  doesn’t have a lot  of choice) as \nthe  rear tyre continues to  lay down its  tell-tale smear of hot  rubber. \nEven down the  straight the  rider is working to  use  every trick he can \nmuster to get to the next corner as  quickly as  possible. Especially exiting \nfaster corners he  may try  to  keep the  bike cranked over longer than \nnecessary. This keeps the  bike on  the  smaller diameter section of the \nrear tyre, thus lowering the  final gearing ratio and thus increasing rpm \nand power. \nOf  course, not all  corners are straightforward U-bends. Modern \nracetracks are  infested by chicanes, which demand a  complex cocktail \nof all kinds of riding techniques.

But  only a certain amount of this can  be directed \nthrough the  handlebars because the  front end will only take so  much \ninput before the  ‘bars turn towards full  lock, and the  rider crashes. \nFootrest weighting, throttle control and movement of body weight \nagain play a vital role here. The rider enters the  first part of the chicane \npretty much how he enters a normal corner, but  at the very moment he \nachieves maximum lean the bike is forced upright and laid down in the \nother direction. The change of attitude is achieved far quicker than in a \nnormal turn, and this is where rider strength and stamina really tell. \n‘You don’t realise you use  your feet so  much until you hurt one of \nthem,’ affirms Doohan. ‘Even if I just get  one of my  feet in the  wrong \nposition when I’m  on  the  bike it really messes me  about and it’s  easy \nfor that foot to just flick off the  ‘peg.’ \nTo  initiate the change of  direction, the rider stands hard on  the \noutside footrest to force the bike upright, also using the peg to lever his \nbody weight up  and over to  the  other side. At  the  same time he  also \nuses counter-steering to help flip the bike in the other direction. And as \nhe  lifts the  bike in  the  middle of  the  chicane he  gives the  throttle a \ngentle tweak which raises the front end to  assist the up-and-over \nmotion. If the  front wheel lifts a few inches off the  tarmac at this point \nyou may see  evidence of counter-steer —  the airborne wheel momentarily \npointing one  way as  the bike steers the  other. \nThe forces transmitted through the footrests is  more difficult to \nascertain —  until you check out  the  soles of a  GP  rider’s boots —  which \ninvariably feature great holes gouged out by the footrests. Some top \nriders ruin a pair of boots in a  single GP weekend. \nEach season, physical strength becomes more crucial in  the  bid  for \n500 GP glory. Today’s 500 riders are serious athletes, constantly \ndeveloping their physique and technique to  fit  the ever-growing \ndemands of a  two-stroke V4  on  big, fat  slicks. And as  the  technicians \ndiscover ways for the machines to accelerate faster, brake harder, corner \ndeeper and grip better, those riders have to keep working their arses off \nto  keep up —  or jump off the  rollercoaster."

Kocinski certainly isn’t quite normal but  is he  good guy \nor  bad guy, madman or  genius? \nWhatever, JK is the new life force in 500 GP racing, the freckly 23-year- \nold who wasn’t afraid to bust into 1991’s exclusive 500  GP winners’ club \n—  apart from Wayne Rainey, Mick Doohan and Kevin Schwantz, Kocinski \nwas the  only man to win a  500  GP  in the  summer of ’91. \nHis  ebullient disrespect for his  elders has  won him an  army of young \nfans who delight in  youth triumphing over experience —  you see \nmore Shoei Kocinski replicas on  the  roads of  Europe than any other \n‘wannabe’ lid. \nBut  \nthe \nMarlboro \nTeam \nRoberts \npilot’s \nbrash \nyoung \nstyle \nhas  \nalso \nwon \nhim \nenemies. \nKocinski’s \nolder \nrivals \ndon’t \nlike \ngetting \nbeaten \nby \nraw \nyouth \nand \nhis \nmaiden \n500 \nvictory \nat \nShah \nAlam \nin \nSeptember \n‘91 \nbit \ndeep \ninto \nvanquished \nAussies \nDoohan \nand \nGardner. \nThe \nRothmans \nHonda \npair \nfound \nthe \nAmerican’s \nvictory \neuphoria \ntoo \nmuch \nto \nbear, \nso \nthey \ntook \nhim \naside \nand \ntold \nhim \nto \ncool \nit \nin \nthe \npost-race \npress \nconference."

Then just 20  years old  he \nturned up at  Suzuka and battled bravely for the lead with 250 stalwarts \nSito Pons, Toni Mang and Jacques Cornu. From that initiation Kocinski \nhas  shown fear for no  one. \nTwo years later he was a  GP  full-timer, destroying the  cosy world of \n250 grands prix as  he  whipped Europe’s best on  what was usually a \nbelow-par motorcycle. The 1990 season firmly established the  Kocinski \nenigma. The Midwest American, who at  17  left his \nparents back home in cotton-picking Arkansas to live \n‘I don’t ever give up close to  Roberts in  California, was like none of his \n—  Ill be sliding that rivals. He  seemed a  bit  of a  recluse but maybe this \ncocksucker like was natural for  an  all-American boy, living in  a \nyou've never seen’ strange land for the  first time. \nHis rivals mistook his  self-imposed isolation for \nsnobbishness, but  Kocinski simply preferred to  keep \nhimself to himself. ‘I just don’t rap with them,’ he said at the  time. ‘I’m \nnot  gonna say why. It’s  private and no  one  knows except me.  The people \nwho know me, know me, and the  people who don’t, don’t.’ \nWhen Kocinski wasn’t in his  motorhome (the same model as  1987 \n500 champ Wayne Gardner’s but a  crucial few centimetres longer) he \nwas either firing shots at  the  opposition or  getting fired at himself. The \nverbal warfare raged this way and that like a gangland shootout. \nHis  250  Honda rival, Helmut Bradl: ‘Kocinski has  a brain the  size  of a \npea...’ Kocinski: ‘If you ain’t American you ain’t shit...’ Another of his \nHonda rivals, Carlos Cardus: ‘The only thing educated about Kocinski is \nhis asshole...’ Kocinski: ‘Honda riders are  a bunch of crybabies...’ \nOf course, Kocinski got  the  last  laugh when he won the  title. And he \ncouldn’t resist getting in the  final word: ‘Bradl said I had a brain the  size \nof a pea. I think that’s funny. But  I kicked his  ass  every week —  I mean I \nreally laugh. Maybe it’d  be a different story if he was beating me.’ \nIn  1991 the  tone changed when Kocinski graduated to  500s with Team \nRoberts. He was no  longer the new boy in town, he’d learned the ways of \nthe continental circus and now he was racing against the men he'd always \nwanted to  race against. The 250 world title had just been a  minor \ndiversion. \nBut  the first half of his debut 500  season suggested that ambition may \nfinally have got  the  better of him.

And if he’s \nhard on  others, he’s even harder on  himself. \nLater in 1991 Kocinski began to get what he needed from his motorcycle \nand he  was transformed —  once again the  excitable kid  with the  cute \nsmile. ‘My team think I’m going fast around that first corner,’ he grinned \nat  Donington. ‘Man, I could ride my bicycle faster around that corner.’ \nAs  his  confidence grew on  the  500, the  talk got  taller. ‘I don’t ever \ngive up.  I'll be sliding that cocksucker like you've never seen, but to ride \nas  fast as  I want to ride it’s  going to take a mean motherfucker to hang \non  to  that thing for a full  race.’ \nKocinski has always been a  man of  extremes. His motorhome is \nundoubtedly the cleanest in the paddock because Kocinski suffers from \nOCD. Ask Wayne Rainey where his  team-mate is and the  champ jokes: \n‘Try down at  the  dry cleaners!’ \nYou will never see  Kocinski line up on  the  grid blemished by a single \nmicrodot of dirt. He  spends hours meticulously cleaning his riding gear, \nfolding his  T-shirts with miraculous precision, picking the  lint out  of \nhis  socks, fussing over his kit like a street-riding kid bursting with pride \nover his  first-ever set  of leathers. \nIt’s  the  same back home on  King Kenny’s ranch —  his  motocrosser is \nalways spotless —  so  Roberts and Rainey never miss an  opportunity to \nbury the  kid  in dirt when they’re off-road training together. Kocinski’s \nschooling with Roberts was never easy.

But the  long-term therapy session ended when Conboy fell \nout with the team’s physio Dean Miller [see Zen and the Heart of Motorcycle \nRacing, page 214]. \nGet  Kocinski on  a good day and he’ll chat and joke for ages. Get  him \non  a  bad day and he  won’t even know you. The unlucky people who \nmeet him at  the  wrong moment will go  away convinced he’s arrogant \nand pigheaded. And they wouldn’t be totally wrong. \nThere’s no  doubt Kocinski has a  few issues but what really screws \nhim up —  and this is the  case with a  fair  number of racers —  is his  total \nand utter commitment to  being the  fastest racer on  earth. He  allows \nnothing to  get in the  way of his  lofty ambitions, so  if you try chatting \nto  him while gear ratios and steering geometry are occupying his \nthoughts, bad  luck, dude. \nLife is never dull when JK   is around —  either in  the  paddock or  out \non  the  racetrack —  because he  doesn’t give a  toss how many people he \nrankles. In  little more than two seasons Kocinski has generated more \ncolumn inches than most riders do  in  half their careers. Now he  is \npoised to  achieve the  success he’s dreamed of ever since his  hero King \nKenny was 500 world champion. And like always, Kocinski’s not  taking \nprisoners. As  he says: ‘I ain’t afraid of nobody.’ \nEpilogue: Kocinski and Roberts split at  the  end of  1992. King didn’t \nneed him, thinking he still had  a good few seasons left in Wayne Rainey. \nAfter that JK couldn’t even get a job with another 500  team and ended \nup joining Suzuki’s 250  outfit which sacked him halfway through ’93 \nfor  deliberately over-revving his  RGV. So  Cagiva snapped him up,  the \nItalians lavishing love and attention on  the  kid, who won two GPs on \nthe  blood-red V4s. When the  Cagiva team folded at  the  end of 1994 JK \ntook a  year out, then came back in World Superbikes, first for  Ducati, \nthen Castrol Honda, with whom he  won the title in  1997. After a \ntroubled return to  500s in  1998 and 1999 he faded into retirement. Last \ntime I saw  him he was  testing Yamaha’s M1  four-stroke in 2001, boasting \nabout \nhis \nhand-crafted \nBentley \nAzure \nMulliner. \nAt \n£170,000, \nit \nsounds \nlike \nJK \nis \nstill \nhaving \nthe \nlast \nlaugh. \nHope \nhe’s \nfound \nhappiness."

From Daytona’s ‘salad bowl’ \nbanking all  the  way to  Donington’s lawn-edged curves, Wayne Rainey \nand Kevin Schwantz have duked it out, no  quarter asked, and never \nany given. \nBetween them the Californian and  the Texan have dominated the GP \nscene since the  late 1980s, winning more races than everyone else put \ntogether, stealing the  headlines and entertaining millions with some \nunforgettable do-or-die battles. So  far  they have won 23  500  GPs each. \nRainey has come through it  with the most world championships, \ntaking three crowns on  the trot  and earning the nickname ‘Mr  Perfect’ for \nhis  unerringly consistent displays of  controlled aggression. Meanwhile \nSchwantz has  been the  crowd pleaser, building an  unenviable reputation \nas  a win-or-crash merchant. But  he’s lived and  learned. \nThe real beginnings of their rivalry go back to  Daytona, March 1987, \nthe start of a  season-long fight for  the  US  Superbike title. The results \nread like a  trailer for  their GP  contests —  Rainey won the crown, \nSchwantz won more races and twice fell  while leading. \nIn  those days Schwantz was the  mercurially talented up-and-comer, \nplucked from obscurity by Yoshimura Suzuki, while Rainey was  the deadly \nskilled, established star  with a US  Superbike title (with Kawasaki in  1983) \nand \na \nfull \n250 \nGP \nseason \n(with \nTeam \nRoberts \nin \n’84) \nalready \nbehind \nhim. \n‘T \ndidn’t \neven \nknow \nwho \nhe \nwas,’ \nsays \nRainey \nof \nthose \nearly \ndays. \n‘He \nhad \nthis \nbig \nthing \nto \nprove \n— \nto \nbeat \nWayne \nRainey, \nand \nI \nwasn’t \ngoing \nto \nlet \nthat \nhappen. \nWe \nwere \nlike \nkids \nwho \nhated \neach \nother \nat \nschool.’"

Since then they’ve bumped and barged their way around \nthe GP  circuits, dazzling fans with their skill, bravery and total trust for \neach other. Few other GP  racers have got  so  close, so  often, without \nending up  in a big heap. \n‘When we  first got to GPs the big thing was who could win a GP first, \nwho could be  the fastest. There was a  big ego thing between us,’ \nsays Schwantz, who went out and won the  opening race of  the  ’88 \nseason, riding the woefully underpowered Suzuki with a  recently \nbroken wrist. \n‘I was really pissed off about that, but  I beat him on  points that year,’ \ndeclares Rainey, who’s finished ahead of Schwantz in each of their five \nGP  seasons. ‘Kevin thought he  was going to  smoke us  after that first \nwin, but  I was more consistent. I guess I go about it a different way.’ \nConsistency indeed. Since that first GP  Schwantz has  crashed out  of \n1]  races. The super-aggressive but  always precisely controlled Rainey \nhas fallen down just three times, two of  those while chasing Mick \nDoohan’s exceptionally good big-bang Honda NSR in  1992. \n‘Kevin always used to  ride balls out  even if he didn’t have a  chance, \nhe’d be out  of the  saddle more,’ explains Rainey, who has  scored 24 per \ncent more points since they started GPs. ‘He'd hit  the  ground whereas \nI'd  ride for  a  position. I sometimes wondered if he  liked crashing. I \nknow I don’t.’ \nRainey hasn’t won any more GPs than his constant opponent but the \nsecret of  the  triple champ’s success is  going for  safe points when he \ncan’t win. ‘Fifth’s okay for  me, so  long as  he’s sixth! Kevin’s the  guy \nI’m \nalways \nlooking \nat \nbeating. \nWe \nkinda \ngauge \nourselves \noff \neach \nother. \nI hate getting beat by him more than anyone else.’ \nSchwantz \nhas  \nmanaged \na \nbest \nof \nsecond \noverall \nonly \nonce \n(in \n1990), \nbut \nthe \nbig \nzero \non \nhis world \ntitle \nscore \nisn’t \nall his \nown \nfault."

In the past I’ve  had a bike that works good at three or  four \ntracks. The Suzuki always used to  be  on  the  edge, you had to  ride it \nrisky if you  wanted to win.’ \nAs well as  their different approaches to winning titles, Rainey (who’s \nthree years Schwantz’s senior at  32)  believes there’s a  big contrast in \ntheir riding styles. \n‘Kevin is really, really good on  the  brakes. He’s got a lot of feeling for \nthe  tyre going into the  corners, but  that’s often why he falls down. I’m \neasier going in,  and I work harder mid-corner and on  the  exit. Some \ntracks his  style works best, other tracks it’s  mine. I guess it levels out. \nAbout the  only thing we  do the  same is the way we  get on the bikes.’ \nSchwantz puts it all down to  machinery: ‘The way you ride depends \na lot on  the bike you're on.  On the  Suzuki you  always had to ride it into \nturns, stop it, turn it and get  it out. That was the  only way to  ride it, \nand it’s  easy to jump off when you have to  ride that way.’ \nAll  that changed at  the  start of  1993. Suzuki have finally built an \nRGV500 that works everywhere, while Yamaha seem to  have taken a \ngiant step backwards. \n‘Kevin's on  the best bike this year,’ Rainey affirms. ‘We’ve beat Suzuki \nevery year since ’88, it  was only a  matter of  time \nbefore they got it  right. We always used to  have a \nbike which worked pretty well right from when you ‘We  both know you \nloaded it  out of  the truck. This year the Yamaha can  get hurt real bad \nchassis has been a  real struggle at  every racetrack, on  a  racetrack’ \nand we’re not  sure why. \n‘Kevin's grown up a lot  this year too.

We \nsettle our  differences and race clean —  we  both know you can  get hurt \nreal bad on  a  racetrack. When we're off  the  track I’d  say  we’re good \nfriends now.’ \nRainey echoes Schwantz’s feelings of mutual respect and friendship: \n‘When you see  each other for  eight months of every year it would be \nhard work if we  hated each other. We’d probably end up  taking each \nother out. We  respect each other’s talents, we  know the  pressures and \nit’s  good we  can  get on  and have a beer after the race. ‘But when you’re \nracing for  the world championship it’s  hard to  be best buddies, but  if I \ncan’t win it, I’d like  Kevin to,  because he’s American.’ \nDespite the friendship, the rivalry for biking’s biggest gong has  taken \nits  toll this season. ‘It’s already getting a  bit  tense,’ says Schwantz. \n‘Normally when Wayne’s leading the championship, he’s easier to find. \nHe  keeps to himself more nowadays.

You don’t really get the  front \ntucking under either, because you can  feel  them losing grip before they \nreally tuck, so  you’ve got  time to  do  something about it.’ \nHow to  steer \n‘I guess you're using opposite lock to steer all the  time —  pushing on  the \nright ‘bar to  turn the ‘bars left and make the  bike go  right. But you \nnotice it more when you're changing direction. That’s how I bagged it \nat  Eastern Creek in  December ’92  when my  right leg was still pretty \nweak. I wasn’t using my  feet much to  steer the  bike, I was putting too \nmuch force through the  ’bars. You do a lot more steering with your feet \nthan you realise —  I reckon it’s  pretty much a 50/50 thing between your \nfeet and your hands.’ \nHow to  change direction \n‘In  real slow-speed changes of direction, like the  chicanes at  Suzuka \nand Assen, you probably use more feet than hands. At  Assen it’s  a \nright, left, right chicane, and after a  few laps doing that my  right foot \ngets tired. You’re on  the  ‘pegs a lot —  you can tell  because the  ‘pegs are \nalways making big holes in the  soles of your boots. If you just used the \nhandlebars you wouldn’t get  through a  chicane.’ \nNiall Mackenzie chips in here: ‘When I’m  riding on  the  road I just sit \non \nthe \nbike \nbecause \nI’m \nso \nscared! \nBut \nif \nI \nstart \nriding \nproperly \nI \nfeel \nten \ntimes \nsafer. \nIf \nyou're \njust \nflopping \nabout \nusing \na \nbit \nof \nbody \nweight, \nyou \ndon’t \nfeel \nanything. \nYou \nfeel \na \nlot \nbetter \nif \nyou \nbrake \nto \nweight \nthe \nfront \ntyre, \naccelerate \nto \nweight \nthe \nrear, \nand \nkeep \nweight \non \nthe \n‘pegs. \nYou've \ngot \nto \ngo \ninto \nevery \ncorner \nproperly: \nbrake \nto \nget \nthe \nfront \ndown \nand \nchange the  geometry, so  the  bike steers better.’"

If it snaps out  quick the instant thing you do is shut \nthe  throttle down, but sometimes when it snaps out  quick it feels all \nright, so  you just keep feeding throttle into it and the  bike pulls itself \nstraight. Once the rpm goes past the power peak, it starts to tone off, so \nthe  back wheel stops spinning and pulls itself back in. \n‘When you're getting on  the  gas  —  just feeding it in —  I guess it’s just \nlike a dirt  bike. Once it starts sliding I don’t give it any more throttle. I \njust keep a  constant throttle with a  little opening, and wait until the \nrpm has gone into the  over-rev, then I click another gear so  the  tyre \ndoesn’t get  a  big  surge of horsepower halfway through the  slide. It’s \nthe  same thing with a  four-stroke —  I let  the  RVF over-rev a bit  and it \npulls itself straight again. \n‘Also, when you're sliding, say coming out  of a left, you put pressure \non  the  right footpegs and that gives you a lot  more feel and a lot more \ncontrol. It just feels out  of control if you don’t put  any force through \nthe  ‘pegs. \n‘Once the  tyre starts to  spin you don’t really keep the  bike leant over \nand keep gassing it.  You start to  pick the  bike up,  and, as  the  contact \npatch gets bigger, you’re accelerating harder so  it keeps spinning. \n‘If  I want it to  spin some more I move my  body weight forward to \ntake some weight off the rear tyre. In  some places it’s  quicker to  spin it \nup  and get  to  the  rpm where you can hook another gear, rather than \nshut the  throttle. Basically, a 500  will spin no  matter what gear you're \nin.  Like at  Phillip Island there’s a  fifth gear left, and as  soon as  you \nbend it over the  bike picks up  revs and starts to  step out  sideways. \n‘I even used to  slide my TZR250 when I was proddie racing, but  that \nwas just because the tyres weren't good enough. It  wasn’t a  power \nthing. It was just the  corner speed breaking the  tyres away, but  it was \nthe  same thing. I didn’t shut it down, I just kept it in there, and I guess \nkeeping \nit \nsliding \nis \nthe \nsame \nprinciple \non \na \nTZR250 \nas \nit \nis \non \nan \nNSR500.’"

But what’s speed all  about —-  why do  we love it  and \nwhat does it  do  to  us? Time to  investigate the facts behind \nfrighteningly fast \nOkay, so you like going fast. But have you ever wondered why? Is it for the \nsensation of speed or  do  you love the  risk factor? And what makes you \ndifferent from people who hate going fast? How does speed affect your \nbrain, what biochemical reactions take place when you give it some? \nAlmost certainly, you go  fast for  the  buzz, wherever it  may come \nfrom. When you race down some strip of tarmac faster than you've ever \nbeen before, you get  the  buzz and your body undergoes an  amazing \ntransformation, heightening your mental awareness, increasing your \nphysical capabilities and minimising risk of  injury in  case you crash \nand burn. It’s  adrenalin city: your heart pumps, your mouth goes dry, \nyou're buzzing. You know the  feeling... \nAs  you wind open the throttle and tuck down behind the screen, \nyour body and brain need energy, so  you produce hormones to  convert \nfats and proteins to  sugar, and your liver releases extra sugar to  fuel \nyour muscles. Your metabolic rate increases in anticipation of expending \nenergy, as  do  your heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate. Your \nspleen releases extra red  blood cells to  help carry more oxygen, your \nmuscles tense, and inessential bodily functions, like digestion, are \nhalted \nto \nsave \nenergy. \nSaliva \nand \nmucus \ndry \nup, \nincreasing \nthe \nsize \nof \nthe  air passages to your lungs (hence the  dry mouth). \nThese \nfunctions \nhelp \nyou \nperform \nbetter, \nso  \nyou \ncan \nride \nfaster \nand \nmore \nsafely, \nbut  \nat  \nthe  \nsame \ntime \nyour \nbody \nprepares \nfor  \ndisaster: \nyou \nsecrete \nnatural \npainkillers \ncalled \nendorphins, \nconstrict \nyour \nblood"

It’s  the  adrenalin thing —  the  hypothalamus \nlooks after your brain’s neuroendocrine systems (the adrenal-cortical \nand sympathetic nervous systems), which pump out the hormones \nepinephrine (adrenalin), norepinephrine (noradrenalin) and ACTH \n(the adrenocorticotrophic hormone) to trigger the  drastic physiological \nresponses already mentioned. \nIt  all  adds up  to  the  sensations that speed freaks know and love: \npounding heart, dry mouth and a state of hyper-consciousness. Some \nracers will be aware of a particularly acute form of this condition, which \nmoves you into a  state of apparent hyper-reality. Psychologists call it \n‘flow’, and some racers liken it to  meditation, or  moving into a  fourth \ndimension, where despite the world rushing past at  180mph, you feel a \nZen-like inner peace. \nI experienced this feeling a  few times in  my racing career: you're \ngoing faster than ever and your subconscious takes over, it’s like  you’re \ndriving without interference from your conscious self. The world seems \nto  shift into slow-mo, and things go  quiet, except your breathing rate \nhas  gone sky high and you  are  riding better than ever before, seemingly \ncorrecting mistakes before you’ve even made them. Five-time 500 world \nchamp Mick Doohan knows the  feeling: ‘Riding fast is  a subconscious \nthing —  you go quickest, you’re most in control and least likely to make \nmistakes when you don’t have to  think about anything.’ \nThis is the biggest high that a racer or  speed freak can  ever have: it’s  a \ntranscendental moment. But  it can  just as  well go  the  other way. Your \nbrain can  reach overload if you become over-aroused —  too  excited, too \nangry or  too  scared. Instead of that state of hyper-reality, you just get \nhyper, your brain absorbs too much information and you end up thinking \nand reacting more slowly. It’s  like  an  adrenalin OD. As  a racer you have \nto  learn to  control your adrenal flow. When I started racing I used to \nalmost puke on  the  grid, and a  friend of mine sometimes used to  wet \nhimself waiting for  the  green light. You see, it’s  a myth that racers have \nto psych themselves up  for a race. If anything it’s  the  other way around, \nthey work to  calm themselves down. Former 500 champ King Kenny"

They all \ngive off  some kind of a  buzz, and they all  have that element of risk \nabout them. \nBy  the same token, many so-called fearless racers are  worried by \nstuff that wouldn’t worry most people: WSB champ Carl Fogarty is \nscared of water, three-time 500 king Wayne Rainey has vertigo and \nMackenzie is claustrophobic. \nThe  question is why do some people crave speed and excitement more \nthan others? Like everything else, it’s part nature, part nurture —  the mix \nof your genetic make-up and how you were brought up.  A lot  of racers \ncome from racing families and were brought up surrounded by bikes and \nspeed —  your dad  does it, so  you  end up doing it, that’s nurture. \n‘Everyone has a  different pathway to  this kind of  thing,’ adds Cox. \n‘Maybe you  get into speed from some experience in your youth —  you may \nhave seen a bike going fast  on  the  road, or  even on  TV, or  you were taken \nto a racetrack and you fell in love with the noise, the  speed, the smell.’ \nThen there’s the  nature aspect: the genetic configuration of  your \nbrain and its neural circuitry. The reticular system is another area of the \nbrain that plays a  major role in  controlling your state of arousal, and \nresearch shows that some people’s reticular systems demand more \nexcitement than others —  making the  difference between thrill-seekers \nand couch potatoes, extroverts and introverts. \nMackenzie obviously isn’t aware of  how his reticular system is \nconfigured, so  he  sees it  more simply. ‘You either like speed or  you \ndon’t,’ he  says. ‘You're either into going as  fast as  possible or you’re not \ninterested at  all.’ \nLike most adrenalin junkies, Mackenzie remembers loving speed \nfrom his  earliest years —  his  surroundings nurtured a desire for  speed. \n‘T lived in this village on a hill and I used to  go down that hill  as  fast as \nI could. I got  so  many bloody noses from crashing at  the  bottom —  my \nRaleigh Chopper wasn’t built for speed, it always got out  of control. I’ve \ngot so  many memories of  mates pushing the bike home, with me \nstaggering behind them. The fact that I kept doing it means I must’ve \nliked it.’ \nI still remember pedalling like crazy down hills when I was a kid. It \nwas the biggest thrill, more exciting than anything else I could do. And, \nlike Mackenzie, that lust for  speed got me  into bikes. Back in my  own"

Their childhood love of speed in its  own right is overtaken by the \ncompetition. The speed is  no  longer the  buzz per  se,  it’s  beating other \nguys by being faster and crazier than they are. Mackenzie again: ‘Once \nyou've done 100  or  150  a few times it’s no  big deal. Going down that hill \non  my Chopper was a big thrill, the wind in my face and all that, but  the \nbig thing became beating my mates, that’s why I wanted the  speed.’ \nRacers are  barely aware of the  sensation of speed. Ask a racer how it \nfeels to  do  190mph and he'll just shrug his  shoulders: the straights \nare  the  easy part, they’re not thinking about riding in a straight line, \nthey’re thinking about the next few corners, that’s the fun part. Michael \nSchumacher reckons that ‘straights are  boring’ in  an  FI  car, but of \ncourse it’s  slightly different on  a  GP  bike, you’re nudging the  double \nton, head and shoulders stuffed under the screen, fingers delicately \ngripping the  handlebars, hoping the  bike doesn’t break into a  terminal \nspeed wobble. I’ve done it on  Doohan’s Honda NSR500 and it is kinda \nscary, but you’re so  focused on  the next corner that you don’t have time \nto  savour the sensation. The scenery doesn’t even dissolve into a  blur, \nbecause you're looking dead ahead, not  to  the  side. It’s  just hellishly \nnoisy, and pretty uncomfortable. \nI once asked Rainey what's the fastest he’s ever been. ‘Three hundred \nand twenty three kays at Fukuroi,’ he said. (That’s 201mph at Yamaha’s \nmain Japanese test track.) So,  how did  that feel? ‘It  felt  like it needed \nanother \ntooth \noff \nthe \nrear \nsprocket,’ \nhe \nreplied. \nThe \nspeed \nitself \nmeant \ndiddly \nsquat, \nhis \nonly \nconcern \nwas \nthe \ngearing. \nNot \na \nhint \nof \na \nbuzz \nand \ncertainly \nno \nfear. \n‘It \ndoesn’t \nmatter \nif \nyou’re \ndoing \n150 \nor \n205,’ \nRainey \nadds. ‘You don’t feel  the  sensation.’ \nThere’s \nalso  \nanecdotal \nevidence \nthat \nit \nisn’t \nthe \nactual \nmiles \nper  \nhour \nthat \nare \nthe \nbuzz, \nbut \nthe \neffort \nrequired \nand \nthe \nactual \nsensation \n— \nI \nget \nmore \nof \na \nspeed \nthrill \nriding \nmy \nlittle \nTyphoon \nscooter \nat \n60mph \nthan \nriding \na \nSuper \nBlackbird \nat \nthe \nsame \nspeed."

Racing at  500 GP  level is a  science \nand racers are  the  front-line laboratory troops, they just wear leathers \ninstead of  white lab  coats. Talk to  Doohan of  racing concepts like \nbravery, risk-taking and heroics, and he  stares at  you like you're nuts. \nIt’s  not about that any more, nowadays racing is  a  cold and precise \nscience —  a  giant, globally televised physics experiment. Sure, racers \nneed balls just as  much as  they ever did, but only as  much as  they need \nto understand computer data-logging, kinetic traction or  the intricacies \nof transient engine behaviour. \nHailwood was happily technophobic. Someone like Mick Doohan \nain’t no  rocket scientist, but  he can  talk deep technical concepts."

The \ngun-totin’ acid casualty author talks of how a  few decades back the \nUSAF developed ‘a  computerized version of  the legendary, hell-for- \nleather test pilot’, banishing the  old  ‘kick the  tyre, light the  fire  and \naway we  go’  heroes of old. He  goes on:  ‘the best pilot in  the  world — \neven if he could land a B-52 on  the number eight green at Pebble Beach \nwithout taking a divot —  would be useless on a test-flight project unless \nhe  could explain, in  a  written report, just how and why the  landing \ncould be made’. \nIt’s  the  same with modern GP  aces —  500s are  so  hi-tech that riders \nmust describe machine behaviour in  acute detail, then check it  and \ncross-check it with their technicians and computer read-outs. \nThere’s another link between old  fliers and GP  racers. Thompson \ndescribes how test pilots used to  get  their kicks in  the  Mojave desert: \n‘Back in the  good old  days, when men were men and might was right \nand the  devil took the  hindmost, the  peaceful desert highways were \nraceways for off-duty pilots on  big motorcycles. Slow-moving travellers \nwere frequently blown off  the  road by wildmen in leather jackets and \nwhite scarves, human torpedoes defying all  speed \nlimits and heedless of their own safety.’ \nNot any more: when he  revisited this base in  69, ‘The survivors \nhe \nfound \nthe \nUSAF \nappalled \nat \nthe \nidea \nof \nanything \npushed \non, \ntreating \nas \nfun \nand \nas \ndangerous \nas \na \nmotorcycle. \n‘Today’s \ndeath \nlike \na \npilots \ngo \nto \nbed \nearly, \nand \nregard \nbig \nmotorcycles \nchurlish, \nharping \nwith \nthe \nsame \nanalytical \ndisdain \nthey \nhave \nfor \ncreditor, \ntoasting \nhippies, \nwinos \nand \nother \nfailure \nsymbols. \nThey \ntake \ntheir \nown \nlegend \ntheir \nrisks, \non \nassignment, \nbetween \ndawn \nand \nwith \nwild \nparties \nto \n4.30pm.’ \nSo \nthe \nbig \nbrass \nweren’t \nimpressed \nwhen \nhe \nward \noff \nthe \nchill’ \nrolled up and shook hands with his left  hand because \nhe’d broken the  other in  some crazy bike crash. \nOf \ncourse, \nthere \nis \nanother \nreason \nfor  \nyour \nmodern-day \nGP  \nracer \nto \nget \nall \nserious \nand \nscientific: \nmoney. \nModern \n500 \nGP \nracers \nget \npaid \nbig \nmoney, \nwith \nenough \nnoughts \nto \ncommand \nanyone’s \ntotal \ncommitment. \nIf \nyou \nwere \non \nfive \nmill \na \nyear, \nyou’d \nstop \npartying \nand \nbecome \nboring \nfor \na while, \nwouldn’t \nya? \nYou \nmay \nwonder \nwhy \nI’ve  \nonly \nmentioned \n500s \nso  \nfar, \nand \nnot  \nFoggy \nand \nSuperbikes. \nWell, \nWSB \nhas \nstill \ngot \nthat \nol’ \nbarnstorming \nthang"

I \ninterviewed him in  the spring of  1999, three years before he \ndied of  prostate cancer at  the age of  63.  At  the time he  was \nworking on  his  Turbinator streamliner, designed to  be the first \nwheel-driven vehicle to  crack 500mph. Nutter! \nDon Vesco was the  first man to  do 300mph on  two wheels and he held \nthe bike land-speed record for  12  years from 1978 at  318.598mph, \nrunning a  streamliner powered by two turbocharged Z1000 motors on \nthe Bonneville Salt Flats. Before that he had used two  TZ750 two-stroke \nrace engines. \nIn  1990, fellow American Dave Campos broke Vesco’s record by a few \nmph, touching 322.87mph in  a  seven-metre streamliner powered by \ntwo Harley-Davidson motors (I kid ye not! ), but Vesco is now considering \na  new attempt in  a  streamliner powered by two supercharged Vincent \nengines. A  famed tuner, Vesco builds most of  his  own machines. He \nalso roadraced successfully in his  younger years. \nHow does it feel to go 300mph-plus on  a bike? \nI'd probably compare it to  being in a jet-liner on  the  runway, just before \ntake-off. The acceleration isn’t amazing, speed-record bikes don’t \naccelerate that hard, though my  car  goes pretty rapidly after 140mph, \nwhen it takes around 20  seconds to  reach 470mph. \nWith the  bikes it probably takes a  minute and a  half to  do a  six-mile \nrun, \nbut \nyou \ncover \nthe \nlast \nmile \nin \nabout \nten \nseconds. \nThey've \ngot \nthese \nmarkers \nthat \nare \none \nmile \napart \n— \nyou \ncan \ndo \nsix \nso \nfast \nyou \ndon’t \neven \nrealise \nyou're \nthere. \nWhere \nI \nreally \nsee \nthe \nspeed \nis \nwith \nthis \nblack \nline"

Castrol Honda \nwon his  confidence by doing stuff like fitting his  RC45 with his  own \nhandlebar grips. And he won the world championship. During 1998 he \nraced 500s for  Sito Pons, and the  Spaniards hadn’t a  clue how to  deal \nwith him, so  he flunked. \nIt sounds daft but  it works. What you have to remember is that fast \nmotorcycle racers are  very weird people. Treat them like normal human \nbeings and you don’t stand a  chance, treat them like weirdo psychos, \nand you're there. \nSo  how do you do  that?

In  that \nrespect they’re probably no  different from anyone else who makes it \nbig in this world: people who dedicate their lives to climbing to  the  top \nare  usually desperate to prove themselves; well-adjusted, self-confident \npeople see  no  need to risk life  and limb to  show everyone they’re bigger \nand tougher than the  next guy. \nAs  Mike Sinclair —  the  engineer who guided Wayne Rainey to his  three \ntitles and now fettles Max Biaggi’s bikes —  says: ‘The fastest riders are \nusually the most insecure people.’ In other words, these guys gain strength \nfrom their weakness —  using their insecurities to push them to victory. \nSinclair is amazed that sports psychologists —  already widely used in \npretty much every other big-money sport —  have hardly made it into the \npaddock. ‘It’s a  huge area we’ve not got  into,’ he  adds. ‘But in  some \nways us  guys do  the  same job —  what you do  to  the  bike can  affect the \nrider’s head.

That’s why \n500s are  so  different from other motorcycles. At  every other race your \nbike might not  be  steering exactly the  way you want it to,  so  you have \nto  use  your mental strength to  overcome any deficiencies, to  make the \nbike do what you want it to do.  If you really want to do something, you \ncan, but  it’s  like a mental sacrifice, and it’s  tough.’ \nBeyond the  rider/bike relationship, the  overall team environment is \nalso crucial to  a rider’s mental well-being. Kocinski didn’t only shine at \nCastrol Honda because they fitted his  RC45 with the  right grips, he  felt \ngood because it’s  a  hyper-organised Anglo-Saxon outfit, as  is Marlboro \nTeam Roberts, with whom JK won the  1990 250  world title. As  everyone \nknows, Kocinski has a cleanliness/tidiness obsession, so he likes his team \nto  have schedules and programmes and timetables. When he  rides for \nthe Latins —  like  Pons in ’98 and Ducati in ‘96 —  he struggles because they \ndon’t get  all  anal about doing things by numbers. Carl Fogarty’s the \nopposite —  he much prefers the laid-back but hot-blooded way Ducati do \nthings.

Hervé Poncharal, \nboss of the  French Tech 3 team that runs Olivier Jacque and Shinya \nNakano in  250 GPs, puts a  huge emphasis on  building relationships \nwith his  riders. He  tried, and failed, with JK,  with whom he  had an \nacrimonious split mid-way through the  ’93  250 GP  season. \n‘With John I thought I could give him something, he seemed lonely, like \nhe needed some support or  friendship, but  that doesn’t always work,’ he \nsays. ‘Generally, the  more you get  to  know a rider, the  more you know \nabout what he needs. If you spend time with him away from the racetrack \nand talk about non-racing things, you'll find out  different aspects of his \ncharacter. Some riders want to be your friend, some like  to be alone, some \nneed compliments, some don’t. Racing is not  an  easy life, especially when \nthings aren’t going well —  it’s quite easy for the rider to blame the  team or \nvice versa, or  maybe the  rider will start doubting himself. But  you can’t \npush your rider too  much or  he'll start crashing; then again, you mustn’t \nmake him feel too  secure or  he'll go  to  sleep —  you've got  to  keep him \nhungry. Like everything in life and in racing, it’s  a compromise.’"

At \nthe  climax of his  team’s glitzy launch night in  Spain, Roberts emerges \non  stage amidst a sweat of PVC-clad dancing girls and the first thing he \nsqueezes is the throttle grip of his freshly painted number-two RGV500. \nThen when his  index finger reaches out a  few moments later, it is to \nstroke the RGV’s front-brake lever. That’s what you need to  be  500 \nworld champion —  focus. \nLater that evening the grinning hostess stumbles across the stage \nand topples into his  Movistar Suzuki, so  Roberts dives forward to  save \nnot the girl, but the  bike. That’s something else you need to  be  500 \nworld champ —  a certain disregard for  the  comfort of others. \nThe rider formerly known as  Kenny Roberts Junior (he dropped the \nJunior suffix at  the  start of 2000, then reintroduced it a couple of years \nlater, then dropped it  again, then... oh,  I’ve lost interest) has pretty \nmuch got  everything it takes to  be  king of bike racing’s toughest class. \nAll  he  lacked in  1999 was a  fully competitive bike.

Hang on,  ain’t that what it’s  all  about, proving \nyou're faster than the  next guy, than the  rest of  the  whole goddam \nworld? So come on  Kenny, are  you a better rider than Crivillé? \n‘Whether I think that or  not is  irrelevant; it’s  too  basic to  say  I’m \nbetter or worse. If you were to ask me  whether I could take a motorcycle \nthat shouldn’t beat him and then go out  and do that, well yes, I believe \nI can  do that.’ \nSo you must be a better rider. \n‘No, that’s for you and the  fans to decide, that’s not  for me  to  say.  Of \ncourse I’m going to  think that, I wouldn’t be  a  grand prix rider if I \ndidn’t. I thought that when I was riding the Modenas. To make you see \nit, that’s a different thing.’ \nSo  you obviously believe you are  better, why don’t you just say  it? \n(He’s getting wound up  now). \n‘No! I want you  to say it,  I want other people to say it, because it doesn’t \nmatter what I say.  I believe I can  outride anybody forever, because that’s \nthe  way racers think, that’s the  way world champions think. But my \ngoal is for everyone else to  think that.’ \nOkay, okay, point taken. We’re sitting and chatting on  the  Jerez pit \nwall, Spanish spring-time sunshine beaming down while the Marlboro \nYamaha crew works on  a  YZR500 belonging to  Max Biaggi, the  man \nmany rate as  Roberts’ most dangerous rival for  the  2000 crown. \nBiaggi is  widely reckoned to  be  bike racing’s biggest earner, now \nthat ten-million-a-year Micky D  is  drawing his pension. Popular \nestimates have Biaggi on  four mill plus, and while Crivillé maybe earns \nsimilar wedge, no  one else comes close, not even Roberts. Does this \nworry him? \n‘Sure, I’d love to earn more money, make no  mistake. If  I made Max’s \nmoney I could probably afford to  burn what I earn. It’s  just because of \nwhere I was born, Max and Alex come from countries where bike racing \nis popular. If  I was Spanish I’d probably be making double what I make, \nbecause I’d  make good money off  sponsors.

Back in “96,  midway \nthrough his  first 500 season, I asked his  dad how this could be, when \ndad’s got  such a mouth? ‘Well,’ replied the  King. ‘He’s still got  time to \nbecome an  asshole!’ What Kenny Senior meant was this: ‘As  Kenny \ngets better, he’ll get harder to  please. That’s what I want, I never want \nhim to  be  satisfied with a  result or  with his  bike. You don’t win \nchampionships like that.’ \nRoberts Senior had every faith in  his  first-born back then. ‘Junior \nhas what it takes to be world champion,’ he said. ‘He has natural talent. \nSo  long as  everything happens right I see  no  reason why he  shouldn't \nbe champ.’ \nIronically, what happened right was Kenny defecting from his  dad’s \nstruggling Modenas team at  the  end of ’98  to ride Suzukis. Even in ’96 \n(when he  was riding Yamaha 500s for  his  dad) Junior knew he  had \nwhat it  takes. ‘I  know I can run top  three, mentally I don’t have a \nproblem with the  speed,’ he  said then. ‘It’s  just a matter of learning to \nget  the  set-up right.’ He  proved he’d learned that the  moment he  got \nback on  a V4 in  1999, whupping everyone including Doohan at the  first \ntwo  races. \nRoberts has  been bred for 500  glory. Back in ’96,  he also told me  this: \n‘For me, sliding a bike is like  a  streetbike rider turning on  the  ignition \nkey, I just do  it.’  He  grew up  sideways, spending his  childhood racing \nguys like Wayne Rainey, Eddie Lawson and the  King himself around \nthe  dirt oval at  his  dad’s ranch; wheelspinning a  500 is in  his  nature \nand in his  nurture. \nNow \nworking \nwith \ngenius \nAustralian \nengineer \nWarren \nWilling, \nhe’s \ntrying \nto \ndevelop \nthe \nSuzuki \ninto \na \nHonda-beating \nmotorcycle. \nThis \nis \nwhere \nwhat \ndad \nwas \nsaying \nabout \nnever \nbeing \nsatisfied \ncomes \nin, \nand \nwhen \nyou \nrealise \nthat \nwithin \nthe \nnice \nguy \nis \na \ncontrol \nfreak, \ndetermined \nto \nbend \nthe \nSuzuki \nfactory \nto \nbuilding \nthe \nbike \nhe \nwants. \n‘Some \npeople \nin \nthe  \nteam \nprobably \nsay  \nI’m  \noutspoken. \nI \ntry \nnot  \nto  \nbe \nderogatory, \nbut \nI \ntry \nto \nmake \nmy \nteam \nand \nengineers \nsee \nwhat \nwe \ncan"

Garry McCoy is  not the  new Micky D,  never will be,  never \ncould be. It would be hard to imagine two more different racers: Doohan \nwas the psycho, burning up inside, scarred and broken outside. He was \na  phenomenon, determined, driven and focused like no  other. As  a \nracer he  had an  aura that crackled with electric intensity; he  wasn’t \neasy to  be around. \nGazza is  the  total opposite: no  superhero aura, no  withering stares \nand gritted teeth, just a big toothy grin and plenty of laughs. Gazza is a \nnormal geezer who doesn’t stand out  from the crowd. He  soon got used \nto  the  Doohan comparisons but  never understood it.  ‘I reckon Mick’s a \nbit German, like  he’s got  a bit of German blood in him!’ he laughs. ‘I’m \nvery different, I’m easygoing and I don’t believe I'll  ever change.

Australians and Americans ruled, because \nthey’d grown up  sideways on  dirt tracks, while Europeans couldn’t \ntranslate their 125  and 250  roadrace technique to those fiery old-school \n500s. But later advances in  chassis and tyre design allowed men like \nValentino Rossi, Alex Crivillé and Max Biaggi to ride 500s like they once \nrode 125s and 250s. Then along comes McCoy, sliding and spinning his \nYZR500 and disappearing into the  distance. \nAfter that first win at Welkom, Doohan wasn’t even sure Gazza had \ngot it right. ‘He  doesn’t really look in full control of the  thing when it’s \nsnapping sideways,’ said the  former grandmaster. However, McCoy’s \nfurther victories at  Estoril and Valencia proved that the boy does \nknow what he’s doing, even though he looks like he’s heading for  the \nstraw bales. \nOn  the  other hand, former champ Rainey reckoned that McCoy was \nthe only man who impressed him during 2000. ‘He rides the bike \nsideways and that’s where 500s are happiest,’ said the American. \n‘They’re okay until the  tyres go  off  halfway through a  race, then you \ngotta ride them sideways.’ \nYou see, McCoy needs the  bike to  snap sideways. ‘When it  snaps \nmid-corner, that allows me  to get the bike turned a lot quicker,’ he says, \nlaughing, as  he  does most of  the  time he’s talking about giving his \nfactory YZR heaps, giving it the  guts, to coin a couple of his  fave Aussie \nphrases. ‘People forget that everyone rode like that seven years ago  and \nsome guys have told me  I should pull the  bike back into line but  that’s \nnot  what I’m used to.  It’s  difficult to change your style, a lot of thought \nhas  gone into it, plus I’m  pretty light, so  the  rear spins up  easy.’ \nMcCoy’s style does cause him some problems but only because it’s \ndifferent from everyone else’s. ‘If I’m  behind someone they hold me  up \na  hell of a  lot  because they’re not  really on  the  gas  until their bike is \nupright, so  I have to  run through a  corner at  their speed, spending \nmore time turning the  bike. If I’m  on  my own I can  get on  the  gas a lot \nearlier, steer the  bike with some wheelspin, then stand it up  and away \nwe  go.  I learned most of that through riding speedway ten years back. \nTo me, it’s  the  same thing.’ \nMcCoy hasn’t raced speedway for  a  while. Nowadays he  hones his \nsideways style on  a  600 trail bike. ‘I’ve got  a  600 on  knobbie tyres and \nthat’s good for learning powersliding on  tarmac. You snap it on  through"

He  scored one top-ten finish that summer before \ncrashing big time at Brno, clipping the back of Doohan’s NSR, tumbling \nhorribly and shattering an  ankle. On  crutches all winter, he got passed \nover for a  99  ride and had resigned himself to working with his uncle, \nfitting garage doors. \n‘I'd  kind of had enough of racing.

I thought about racing in  the  US  —  you get  paid there and it \nmight’ve been a happy life.’ \nThen the  phone rang at  3am on  22  June 1999. It was Peter Clifford, \nrace director of the  Red Bull Yamaha WCM team, who’d just split with \nKiwi Simon Crafar. He wanted to put  Gazza on  Crafar’s YZRs. \n‘I was a little iffy. I still wasn’t 100  per  cent fit and \nI’d  never ridden a  four-cylinder 500 before.

He was out  of control through the \nawesome right-left kink that leads onto the  back straight, the  YZR \nwheelspinning, tank-slapping, Gazza hanging on  for  dear life. Hugely \nentertaining but  frightening too. \nHe  finished the  race 15th, alive, at  least, and continued relatively \nunnoticed at  the  next few GPs. It was at  the Valencia GP  a few months \nlater that McCoy first got noticed. He was getting the  hang of the YZR, \nstarting to  treat the  thing with some serious disrespect, smokin’ the \nrear tyre and finishing third. ‘After about four races I was into it,  I \nfound my style on  the bike and got comfy with it.  I  even tried \nriding with the  wheels in  line but it  didn’t work for  me, the lap \ntimes suffered.’ \nOver the  winter McCoy and his  amiable Scottish crew chief Hamish \nJamieson \nworked \nat \nadapting \nhis \nYZR500 \nto \nsuit \nhis \nmanic \nstyle. \n‘When \nI \nfirst \nrode \nthe \nthing \nit \nwas \nlike \na \nraging \nbull \nbut \nit’s \na \nlot \nbetter \nnow,"

In  1999, the \nFrench tyre brand accelerated development of its  16.5in rear slick, first \nused successfully by Schwantz in the mid-1990s. McCoy soon found he \npreferred the  tyre to  the  17in used by his  rivals, because it puts more \nrubber on  the road at max lean, giving him the kind of grip he needs to \nthrow it sideways. \nWhen McCoy won his first 500 race, the season-opening South \nAfrican GP  back in March, he used the  16.5in. But  because he was the \nonly man regularly using the  tyre, Michelin only had a limited range of \ncompounds and constructions and it took until mid-season to  get  the \nchoice he  wanted to  suit every racetrack. That’s why his results \napparently slumped after that great start to the year. ‘They always make \ntyres available to  everyone, so  it took time because they couldn’t just \nmake them for me. I started getting the  tyres I wanted in July.’ \nWith Michelin and Yamaha well behind him he undoubtedly looked \nlike a  major contender for  the 2001 title. But you have to  wonder \nwhether McCoy is just too  nice to  be world champ, like fellow former \nAussie 500  winner Kevin Magee and Niall Mackenzie —  hugely talented \nbut lacking that psychotic killer’s instinct. Then again perhaps his \nmusical tastes reveal a rougher side. ‘Iron Maiden and Megadeath are \ntwo of my  favourites, just something to  relax with at  the  end of  the \nday.” Megadeath for relaxation?

A proddie bike starts getting out  of control \nlong before it actually goes out  of control. The tyres are  squirming, the \nchassis is flexing, it’s  like an  early warning system, you see  the  limit \ncoming, so  you ease off just in time (at least that’s the  idea). GP  bikes \naren’t like that, the chassis is  rock steady, the tyres are gripping, \neverything seems totally cool. Then, whacko, you're flying through the \nair  wondering what the  fuck happened. The grey area was so  narrow \nthat it came and went before you even saw it, but as  you’re hurtling \ntowards pain city, you remember that maybe the  rear did  start sliding \n0.0001 seconds before it let go. \nObviously the skill required to  survive as  the grey area narrows \nincreases exponentially. And, just to  complicate matters further, the \nreally greatest riders can find extra speed by actually shrinking that \ngrey area. They are  the only ones able to use  a tyre that offers more grip \nbut  less feedback. \nMichelin, who have dominated 500 GP  racing for  years, spend vast \nresources on  widening that transition phase just as  wide as  it'll go, \nbecause that’s what all but  a handful of the  world’s riders need. \n‘To  slide like they do,  500 riders need a  huge amount of  feel and \nfeedback,’ explains the  firm’s racing boss Nicolas Goubert. ‘They need \nto  sense exactly what the  tyre is  doing, and from experience, know \nwhat it’s  going to  do  next. Tyre compound and, to  a  lesser extent, \nconstruction are  the  crucial factors in offering excellent feedback. \n‘The more grip a rider has  at his  disposal, the more feel and feedback \nhe needs. What most riders want is a period of warning as  they approach \nthe  limit. It’s  no  good having massive amounts of grip if the  limit is \nreached without any warning, because the rider won’t have the \nconfidence to  approach that limit. Most riders will go  faster with \nslightly less grip and more feedback. Only the  very best riders can go \nfastest with a  huge amount of  grip and minimal feedback, because \ntheir skill allows them to  cope with less of a  transition phase.’ \nMick Doohan is the man Goubert is talking about, and I only mention \nhim because Michelin’s tyre engineers are  still in  awe of the  bloke, \ntheir eyes rolling in the  back of their sockets when they recall what he \ncould do with their tyres. He was so  familiar with them that he reckons \nhe always knew what the  tyres were going to do before they did it. With \nthat kind of knowledge (and faith), ain’t no  one going to  touch you."

We’re speaking to him through an  interpreter \ngirl from Shoei, whose lids Kato wears. The atmosphere is a little \nuneasy —  Japanese GP  riders are  notoriously difficult to  talk to.  The \nlanguage problem makes communication difficult at best and they very \nrarely say much, largely because most of  them are factory riders, \nunwilling to  let  loose their employers’ jealously guarded secrets. Most \ninterviews with Japanese stars of the  GP  scene rarely offer much more \nthan: ‘Yes’, ‘No’, ‘Coming better’ and ‘I  will try  my best’. We are \ndetermined to  try  our best at  squeezing something more out of  this \nridiculously talented 250 bladerunner, but  his  first words are: ‘I  don’t \nspeak much, not  only because I can’t really speak English.

And since most experts rate Mike the Bike the greatest racer in \nthe  world ever, that’s a  big  deal. Kato’s French GP  win also took him \npast Mick Doohan’s phenomenal win rate, and not  only that, his current \nwin rate of  41.7 per cent puts him ahead of  men like King Kenny \nRoberts, Freddie Spencer, Wayne Rainey, Eddie Lawson, Kevin Schwantz, \nValentino Rossi and Max Biaggi.

All  these bikes hold their place in  history for \npushing the limits of performance to new levels, but however impressive \nthey once were or  still are, they’ll never be as  great as  Yamaha’s RD250 \nand 350LC. \nWhile the 900SS, 916, RC30, CB750, Manx and R1  have changed \nmotorcycling forever, they aren’t bikes of  the people, they’re exotic, \ncostly machines owned only by the  lucky few, unlike the  LC.

Mackenzie, \nKenny Irons (who also went on  to  race GPs but  got  killed in ’88), and \na  few others, including myself (I’d finished top  Am in that year’s UK \nseries), made up  the  British team. Mackenzie and Co  blazed a trail of \nchaos through Germany that autumn, crashing hire cars, doing runners \nfrom bars (no doubt confused by the  continental system of not  paying \nfor your drinks round by round) and terrifying the  foreigners. \nThey had the  number-one French hope in tears after ganging up  on \nthe  guy during practice and running him off the  track at  100mph-plus. \nAnd they dealt with the  threat of super-quick Brit Steve Chambers — \nwho was being dead serious, going to bed  every night at a sensible time \n—  by calling up whores from the  local brothel and sending them round \nto  his  hotel room in the  early hours. Irons lucky-dipped a dog of an  LC \nand compensated for  its  lack of speed by pulling himself past anyone \nahead by hauling on  the  leading bike’s pillion grabrail, then swerving \nviolently, forcing Johnny Foreigner to  back off  or  risk a  high-speed \nendo. Manxman Graham Cannell won the race by  a  gnat’s from \nChambers, and the  defeated continentals shuffled home, struck dumb \nby the  Brits’ full-on aggression. But it was only what Cannell and Co \nhad been doing at  home for years. \nThat LC  madness is still going on  today, there’s LC nutters out  on  the \ntrack and at large on  the  streets, though in much diminished numbers. \nWhile the  machine’s status as  a  race-winning phenomenon may have \nwithered somewhat, there’s now a special class for  LCs.

It was a  true milestone machine and \nstayed on  sale for  six years, undergoing just a handful of minor changes \nduring that period; the bike was that good from the  start. \nThe fully square 54  x  54mm motor employed technology learned \nfrom Yamaha’s range of TZ250 and 350 racers but  was nevertheless a \nfairly straightforward piston-ported two-stroke with reed-valve \ninduction. Bullet-proof —  until club-race owners started doing dodgy \nhome-tuning jobs —  the  stock motor made over 30bhp, with well-tuned \nversions exceeding 40bhp. \nThe 108mph 350, with 10mm bigger bore, turned up half a year later, \nlooking identical to  the  250 but for  an  extra disc. Yamaha claimed 47 \nhorsepower from this engine and, like the  250, it  responded well to \nsimple but clever tune-up jobs. And, also like the 250, the chassis \nneeded few modifications for  the track: fit  some KR124 Dunlops \n(KR124 front/Michelin TG22 rear were the  go later on), stick spacers in \nthe  forks and you’re winning races and setting lap records. \nUnlike the 250, the 350 did undergo a major revision. The much-changed \nmark two version appeared in  1983, with handlebar and belly fairing, \nuprated chassis and YPVS exhaust control. The motor was undoubtedly \nmore powerful and easier to  use  than the  original, with a  smooth 59bhp \nand 115mph top  speed. Full-race versions could be tweaked to  a genuine \n70bhp plus. The new chassis was appreciated by road riders though racers \nweren’t so  keen on  the handling. Nevertheless, it came to rule the 350  and \n500  proddie classes, just as  its predecessor had done. \nLater versions of the  YPVS were given unpretty full sports fairings \nand, as  sales faded in the  mid-to-late 1980s, production was moved to \nYamaha’s Brazilian factory, where the last  RD  rolled off the line in 1995. \nIt  seems only right that such a  mad motorcycle should end its  days \nbeing built by Brazilians, people who know how to  have a mad time."

Rossi \nis clever, he gets energy from all this, but  I think people get tired of it.’ \nEight years Rossi’s senior, Biaggi was first on  the  GP  scene, though \nhe  only started racing a  year before his  arch-rival. While Rossi was \nraised on bikes by his  GP-winning dad, Biaggi had nothing to  do with \nthem until a  visit to  a  racetrack in his  18th year. Now 30,  he  came to \nGPs four years later, and won four back-to-back 250  titles from ’94,  the \nfirst three with Aprilia, the  fastest 250s of the  era. But  then he fell  out \nwith his  Italian employers and made an  apparently ill-judged switch to \nHonda for ‘97, winning the title again, against all the odds. That success \nsecured Honda 500s for  the  following year, when he had Mighty Mick \nDoohan rattled, an  achievement of which he’s still proud. ‘Mick had an \neasy life  until I came to  500s, I put some fire  on  his  back!’ \nWhile Doohan stayed at  Honda, Biaggi wasn’t going to  get  full- \nfactory support, so  he moved again, joining Yamaha, even if that meant \nhe was back to  riding second-best machinery. The  Yamaha YZR is good \nnow, though not as  perfect as  Honda’s NSR, and that’s something \nBiaggi never lets  anyone forget. \n‘Rossi is lucky, he’s always in the right place at the right time, he had \nthe best bikes in  125s and  250s and now he has  the best 500, the Honda \nhas some magic.

Kenny (Roberts Junior) offered me  his  gear and said \n“Hey, you  go ride”. I just said “I’m off for a coffee and doughnut, I'll see \nyou later”. All it takes is for me  to come here and watch one guy hit the \nground and it’s  “Uh oh,  it’s  not  worth it”. \n‘Anyway, every now and then Suzuki say  “come ride this or  come \nride that”, and I still get a huge buzz from riding top-level machinery. I \nrode Mladin’s bike at  Road Atlanta and I rode Kenny’s bike at  Phillip \nIsland. The 500  was a kick in the  ass!’ \nHaving been away from GPs for  a  while, Schwantz admits he  was \nstunned at  Mugello. ‘I never question why I raced but I look at  these \nguys now and think “holy fuck, they’re doin’ some really scary stuff”. \nAs  a  kid  growing up,  I’d  ridden and ridden and ridden and the  bikes \nhave gotten bigger and speeds have gotten greater, and it’s  all  kinda \nworked into itself. Now  I play around on  dirt bikes and ride a street bike \noccasionally, and to come back and watch the 500s, it’s a huge difference \nfrom anything you'd ever imagine. It’s a whole different mindset. I’m \nsitting there watching some 500 guy goin’ around a  corner and \nriingggggeg [he does a very passable imitation of someone having a big \nsideways moment] and it’s  like “fuck, I’d  pull in  and stop right now, \nthat would’ve scared the  living shit out  of me!’”” \nSchwantz used to have the  same effect on people watching him. He’d \nhave a  wince-inducing highside on  Saturday, crack a  few bones, get \npilled up  at  Dr  Costa’s, then win the  race on  Sunday. But he was paid \nwell for the pain. ‘The year I won the championship I made five  million \ndollars. That’s bonuses and everything said and done.’ At  15  GPs a year, \nthat’s $333,333 a ride. Riders like  Rossi and Max Biaggi make more but \nSchwantz wouldn’t want to  have been born later.

Crashing still hurts just as  much \nand bike racing is still a vicious way to earn a living but  the  technology \nhas changed everything.

We  came back to the paddock at three in the morning, \nwe'd probably had just a little bit  too  much to  drink, and Eddie stuck \nhis  Porsche in the  ditch, with my  coaching.’ \nDespite a good few years of jackassing around the world, there’s not \nmuch that Schwantz regrets having done in his career. The single world \ntitle he won certainly wasn’t reasonable recompense for his astounding \ntalent, and there’s plenty of so-called experts who reckon he would’ve \ndone better if he’d ditched Suzuki's fickle RGV to  ride a  more user- \nfriendly 500 from Honda or  Yamaha. But despite an  eye-opening ride \non  Mick Doohan’s NSR a year after he limped into retirement, he thinks \nhe  did  the  right thing. | \n‘Mick’s NSR was intimidating, but  then any 500  would’ve been after \na  whole year of  not riding. I’m happy I stayed at  Suzuki. I had an \nopportunity to  go  ride Yamaha at  the  end of ’89.  All  I wanted was the \nsame exact shit that Wayne had, because I wanted to  beat him on  the \nsame stuff. When Yamaha couldn’t promise that, I stayed where I was. \nI also talked to  Erv (Kanemoto, Honda GP  guru) midway through ’92 \nbut  that never really got  close. \n‘If  I regret anything it’d  be  what I did  to  my  wrist in  ’94  to  fix  it \nquick. I should’ve taken time, got it fixed right, taken a year or  two off \nand realised at  that point, “Shit, I’m  still  only 32”. \nOf course, Schwantz’s career-long association with Suzuki has opened \nup  some cool retirement options; he seems to enjoy his new role as  rider \ntraining guru. ‘I go  watch the  Yoshimura Suzuki guys practise. Then I \ncome in and say  “Hey, some other guy is out a little bit  from where you \nare  at  that corner, and they’re not  hitting that bump, so  the  front’s not \nunsettling, so  the whole bike’s not  getting messed around”. That seems \nto work good with the young kids. If their mechanic tells them this and \nthat, the kids are  like “What does he  know about riding?”, where \nhopefully I can  come from a different perspective.’ \nAlthough \nhis  \nprime \nduty \nis  \nto  \ncoach \nup-and-comers, \nSchwantz \nis \nalso \nan  \ninvaluable \ngo-faster \naid  \nto \nMladin \nand \nSuzuki's \nolder \nriders. \n‘I'll \nsee  \nsome \nguy \nfrom \nanother \nteam \nusing \na \ngear \nhigher \nto  \nget  \nthrough \na \ncorner, \nnot  \nhaving \nto \nmake \na \nshift \nand \nnot  \nunsettling \nthe \nbike. \nBut  \nsure, \nyou \ncan’t \njust \nsay  \n“Hey, \nyou're \ndoing \nthis \ncorner \nwrong”. \nIt \ncompletely \ndepends \non \nif \nhe’s \ncomfortable \ndoing \nit \nyour \nway \nand \nif \nthe \nbike \nset-up \nwill \nlet \nhim.’"

      "text": "“HOLY FUCK, THESE GUYS ARE DOIN’ SOME REALLY SCARY STUFF’ 107 \nAt  Daytona 2000, Schwantz’s track-spotting skills helped Mladin \nwin the 200  miler, America’s biggest race. ‘Mat said “My bike’s working \nreal good through the  infield but  it’s  not  getting up  on  to  the  banking \nas  good as  Id  like it to.  But I know that if I adjust it to  get  on  to  the \nbanking better, I’m gonna give away the  advantage I’ve got  through \nthe  infield, so  tell me  what it looks like  to you, is it that much worse on \nto  the banking than everyone else’s?” I went out  and watched him and \nhis  bike didn’t look any worse than anybody else’s, it actually looked \none of  the better ones getting up  there. I  said “You're not giving \nanything away,” so  he raced it that way.’ \nTwo of  Schwantz’s biggest GP  rivals —  Rainey and Doohan —  have \nalso tried their hand at  trackside coaching. Rainey gave it up  as  a bad \njob, realising it’d take forever to find a rider who matched his staggering \ncommitment. Doohan still dispenses advice to  Honda riders like Rossi \nand Chris Walker, but never begins to pretend he can  instil anyone with \nworld title-winning skills. \nSchwantz agrees, adding: ‘It’s just keeping their minds open to \ndifferent ideas. When guys get to  this  level they don’t need to learn how \nto  do  stuff, they just need to be reminded there’s more than one  way to \ndo  it.  Maybe they get  too  focused, a  bit  of  tunnel vision about some \ncorner, so  they're going \"I  gotta make this work”, so  they hit  that same \nbump and bang! [He shouts a passable impression of a race bike crashing \nto  earth.] Whereas if they’d made a later or  earlier entry, they wouldn’t \neven have hit  that bump. It’s  like at  Mid-Ohio, they’ve got  big concrete \npatches right through the  apex of some corners, with only so  much on \nthe inside that’s asphalt.

Here’s the proof \nA few nights before the 2001 GP season kicked off at Suzuka I had a dream, \none of  those pre-season anxiety dreams I have before most seasons. I \ndreamt that all the riders had had head transplants with each other. I was \nrushing around the paddock searching for riders I needed to interview, but \n‘I dreamt all the \nriders had had head \ntransplants with \neach other.

I walked over to \nKenny Roberts Junior and started talking to him, then \nrealised it was Rossi; the  pair of  them had swapped \nheads. I tracked down Leon Haslam, only for him to tell \nme  he’d exchanged with Jezza McWilliams (that'll be \nthe old head on young shoulders, then). I tell you, I was \ngetting a  little confused, a little panicked, and a  long \nway behind my deadlines. \nThe GP  paddock can  have that effect on  you. It’s  a \nweird environment, populated by some of the  most \nextreme people you'll ever meet. And not only the \nriders, everyone at  GPs has a  hint of  the  psychotic \nabout them (yeah, I’m including the  media in  this) because they’re \nultra-ultra serious about what they’re doing. The riders, for  starters, \nhave one of  the weirdest jobs on  earth: flying around the world, \nemployed as  mobile advertising hoardings and occasionally hurling \nthemselves into Armco barriers. Their mechanics are  no  less obsessed \nwith what they do; most of them only get to return home for  six weeks \nin a year. And then there’s the  team managers, the PR people, the cooks \nand the  gofers, the  medics and the  media, the  hangers-on and the \nfloozies, almost a  thousand people in all —  and stress monkeys, the  lot \nof them. As Randy Mamola said recently, if  a bunch of Martians started \nmonitoring bike racing from space, they’d worry for humanity. \nIt’s  my job as  a journalist to wander through the  paddock and make \nsense \nof \nthe \nmadness. \nBut \nlike \nlife \nitself, \nit \ndoesn’t \nquite \nwork \nout \nlike \nthat. \n‘The \nmore \nI \nsee, \nthe \nmore \nI \nknow, \nand \nthe \nmore \nI \nknow, \nthe \nless \nI \nunderstand,’ \nsang \nthat \ngeezer \nfrom \nThe \nJam \nand \nhe \nwas \npretty \ndamned \nright. \nHowever, \nwe \nhave \nsome \nfun \nalong \nthe \nway, \ntrying \nto \nsuss \nout \nthis \ntravelling circus of semi-lunatics. \nYears \nback \nI \nused \nto \nwork \nwith \nJohn \nKocinski’s \nYamaha \nteam \nand \nit"

In  the light of  what happened to  poor old \nHizzy, it’s  full of poignant moments \nBorn-again bikers dominate the  British biking consciousness —  scoring \nmore bike sales and hospital visits than anyone —  so  it’s  perhaps fitting \nthat two knocking-on-40 racers are dominating the 2001 British \nSuperbike series. \nSteve Hislop and John Reynolds are the Chris Walker and Neil \nHodgson of  2001, duking it  out  way ahead of  the  pack and getting \ninvolved in  some seriously hairy paint-swapping.

His career has been mostly British \nchampionship with a  heap of TT  successes and a  few endurance wins \nthrown in.  Reynolds, three years younger but more touchy about his \nage, has  been racing 15 years. He’s done 500  GPs and World Superbike, \nreturning to  the  British scene for  the  past few years with ever-faithful \nbenefactor Atkin’s Red Bull outfit, even winning a  Brands WSB race \nlast autumn.

You know when you're riding on  the \nlimit —  you just get  the  bike stopped for  a  turn, just scrub off  enough \nspeed, so  the front’s moving around as you tip in, then the rear’s moving \nwhen you tap on  the  power. The whole bike is just floating.’ \nYes, nothing beats experience on  the  racetrack, except experience. \n‘That's the  thing,’ says Hislop, who was British 250  champ way back in \n1990. ‘We've both got  15/20 years of knowledge and gamesmanship, so \nit’s  “Where am  I gonna try him on  the  last lap?” I’m  digging deep and \nthe  problem is that John’s been racing almost as  long as  me.’ \nReynolds adds: ‘When you first start racing you're ten  feet  behind the \nbike, that’s the dangerous part, where all the learning and hurting comes \nin.  Then as  time goes on,  you get  level with the  bike, so  you're sort of \nhappy.

But  does that mean that racing gets easier the longer \nyou go  on? ‘No  way!’ he  answers. ‘Nah,’ adds Hizzy. ‘Maybe it’s  easier \nriding because your knowledge is  greater, but the  racing never gets \neasier; in  a  way it  gets harder every bloody race.’ Reynolds chips in \nagain: ‘It  bloody well does with him about!’ \nOut of  Walker’s and Hodgson’s shadows, both men know they’re \nriding harder than they’ve ever ridden in  their lives, so  they bristle \nwhen people suggest they should pack it in  and give the  kids a  break. \n‘We're \nenjoying \nit \nand \nputting \non \na \ngood \nshow, \nso \nwhy \nshould \nwe \ncall \nit \na \nday?’ \nsays \nHizzy. \n‘People \nexpect \nyou \nto \nhang \nup \nyer \nboots \nand \nlet \na \nyoungster \ntake \nover \nyer \njob, \nbut \nI’ve \ngot \ntwo \nkids \nto \nthink \nof \nand \nI \ndon’t \nknow \nwhat \nI’m \ngoing \nto \ndo \nafter \nracing. \nI’ve \nnot \nmade \nenough \nmoney \nto \nretire, \nI’ve \nscrewed \nup \nwith \na \nfew \nteams \nand \nbeen \nused \na \nbit, \nso \nit’s \na \nproper \njob \nfor \nme \nif \nI \ncall \nit \na \nday. \nJamie \nWhitham’s \nthe \nfunniest \nguy \never, \nhe \nsays \n“I’m \nscared, \nscared \nof \ngetting \na \nreal \njob”.’ \nWhich \nbrings \nus  \nto  \nfear. \nRacers \nnever \nlose \ntheir \nskill, \nthey \njust \nlose \nthe  \nwill \nto  \nuse \nit,  \nand \nuntil \nthey \nreach \nthat \npoint \nthey \nkeep \ngetting \nfaster, \nThat’s \nHislop \nand \nReynolds \nfor \nyou; \nthey’ve \nnot \nyet \nreached \nthat \nmoment \nwhen \nfear \nbegins \nto \ncreep \naround \ntheir \npsyches, \nstealing \na"

People wrote me  off,  “Oh, he’s a  half-season \nspecial, he’ll go fast for  a while but his head’ll go, he’s a fuckin’ fruitcake”. \nEverybody’s wrote me  off that way for the past four or  five years. I’ve had \nproblems in teams but there’s been reasons for that, which is why I’m  so \ndetermined to  come back and do well. The arm scared me  but  it’s  given \nme  real  determination since then. It’s  like  Doohan in ’92, he wrecked his \nleg and came back from that. Fantastic!’ \nAnd here’s another dose of racers’ psychology, from Hizzy again. ‘I \nwas panicking a few weeks back because I hadn’t crashed in ages, so  I \nwas thinking, oooh nooo, I’m  in for a big one. Then I went and lost the \nfront in  practice at  Oulton. That’s the  way to  do  it, lose the  front, go \ndown nice an’  easy. I felt  a lot better after that.’ \nDespite a  bit  o’  fairing bashing this year, at  Oulton and elsewhere, \nthe pair remain friends, though they're not  sure how long that'll last as \ntheir title fight approaches the  final round. ‘I enjoy racing Steve,’ says \nReynolds. “You can  pretty much rely on  what he’s going to be doing, but \nsometimes you can’t, and that’s what racing’s all  about. We  all  do  it — \nyou try and pull off  a move and you end up  colliding.’ \nHislop knows what he’s talking about: ‘I know, I know, two years ago \nI did  a  do  or  die  on  John at  the  Old Hairpin at  Donington, taking him \nand Bayliss out. On  the  way back to  the  paddock, John said to  me  “If \nthere was one guy in Britain I trusted not  to wipe me  out  it was you, Ill \njust have to  watch you now.” That was a rare moment of madness for \nme. John is fast and aggressive but safe —  I can almost work out  what \nhe’s going to  do,  just like he  said about me. We’re the  old  school of \nriding, we’ve got  a  bit  of  mutual respect here, whereas some of  the \nyounger guys just run into you and wipe you out.’ \nSpeaking \nof  \nyoung \nguys, \ndoes \nit \nworry \nthe  \npair \nthat \nthere \ndoesn’t \nseem \nto  \nbe \nmuch \nyoung \nBritish \ntalent \naround? \n‘I \nthink \nthere \nare  \nsome \ngood \nguys \ncoming \nthrough,’ \nsays \nReynolds. \n‘But \nthe  \nproblem \nis \nthat \nit \ncosts \nso  \nmuch \nto  \nrace \nSuperbikes. \nA  \nteam \nlike \nours \ncosts \na  \nmillion \na \nyear, \nso \nyou \ncan’t \nafford \nto \ntake \na \ngamble \non \nsome \nkid.’ \nHislop \nreckons \nthat \nproposed \nregulations \nchanges \nfor \n2002 \nwill \nmake \na \ncrucial \ndifference. \n‘There’s \nalready \na  \nfew \nguys \nlike \nShane \nByrne \ncoming \non \nstrong, \nhe’s \nmega, \nbut \nthe \nchange \nto \nsemi-Supersport \nrules \nwill \nallow"

Not that you’d know it;  considering where he’s at,  he’s \nremarkably down to  earth and ungobby. \nHaslam was on  the  GP  trail from six  weeks old, travelling through \nEurope with his  dad, once the  wild man of  British racing, who was \nriding Honda NS500s alongside world title-winning team-mates \nFreddie Spencer and Marco Lucchinelli in  the  early 1980s. Leon won \nhis  first race, a  kids’ off-road event at  the  ’87  Argentine GP  when he \nwas four, ‘I can remember that, I got  a  nice little trophy,’ and he  was \nnational schoolboy motocross champ at  12.  A year later he  switched to \ntarmac and walked the British scooter title. That success made him the \nyoungest-ever winner of a national roadrace crown, the  first of  a whole \nrun  of youngest-ever achievements. \nThe following year, 1998, Haslam graduated to  125s and became the \nyoungest-ever winner of a  British championship race. He  made his  GP \ndebut the same summer to  become, you guessed it,  the country’s \nyoungest-ever GP  rider. He  contested his  first world championship \nseason in  2000, still on  125s, and commenced 2001 riding Honda \nNSRY500 twins for  the  Shell Advance squad, scoring points in  two of \nthe first seven GPs. But when senior team-mate Chris Walker was \nsacked after falling out  with Aussie team-owner Jeff Hardwick, Haslam \nwas given the Stalker’s NSR V4s. The surprise promotion makes him \nHonda’s youngest-ever 500  GP rider and completes a giant leap from 45 \nhorsepower to  190 horsepower in  less than a  year. Oh  yes, and Leon \njust got voted a  top-ten pin-up by teen girls’ mag Bliss. \nAll  giddy stuff, but racing has  also been hard on  Haslam. He  lost  two \nuncles to  the  racetrack, broke his  left  leg when he was 12,  his  right leg \nwhen \nhe \nwas \n13 \nand \nhis \nfirst \nGP \nseason \nwith \nthe \nshambolic \nItaljet \nteam \nwas \na \nnightmare \nthat \nwould’ve \nfinished \nsome \nriders. \nHe’s \ncome \na \nlong \nway, \nbaby, \nand \nnow \nhe \nfaces \nthe \ntoughest \nchallenge \nof \nhis \ncareer \n— \ntaming the  bikes that ate  Walker alive. \nHaslam \nhas \nuntil \nthe  \nend \nof  \n2001 \nto  \nprove \nhe’s \nworthy \nof  \nfactory \nsupport \ninto \n2002 \nand \nbeyond. \nThat’s \nserious \npressure \nfor \nan \n18-year- \nold, \nespecially \nwhen \nthe \nNSR \nappears \nless \nthan \nwilling. \nWalker \nspent \nhis \nfive \nmonths \nwith \nthe \nNSR \ncrashing \nhis \nbrains \nout \nand \nHaslam \ndidn’t \nget \noff \nto \na \nmuch \nbetter \nstart, \ntumbling \nout \nof \nhis \nfirst \ntwo \nGPs \non \nthe \nbikes. \nOne \ncan’t \nhelp \nbut \nwonder \nwhether \nShell’s \nNSRs \nare \ncursed \n2c"

It’s  not so  much riding to  go  faster, it’s  sitting down and \nthinking about it  to  go  faster. I always wondered why Chris was \nstruggling because I know he’s a  good rider, now I know it’s  not so \nmuch whether you're a  good rider, it’s  more a  case of  thinking and \nunderstanding. \n‘The Honda is hard because it’s reckoned not  to turn so well [Haslam’s \nNSRs aren't latest-spec bikes like  Valentino Rossi’s], and coming from \n125s I’ve  always rode heavy on  the  front, doing all my  steering off the \nthrottle, all through the front end. Plus the four has  got so much power, \nso  you've got to  steer it off the rear more, concentrating on  not  running \nso  much corner speed and getting it  out of  the corner. It’s totally \ndifferent for  me, I’ve got  to  get  my  head sorted not  to  go  into corners \nputting all  the  weight on  the  front. It’s  hard; guys like John Kocinski \nnever got on  with the Honda 500, but I’m learning the set-up and \nthe  style.’ \nDespite all  the scary losing-the-front moments, the NSR does, of \ncourse, have its good sides. ‘It’s a full-on bike, and it’s mega spinning it \nup.  First time I rode it,  I was spinning it up  every corner and loving it. \nBut  you've got  to  be  precise. I could get  away with a  lot  more on  the \n500 twin, you could run  wide, square off  the  corner \nby spinning it all the way to the white line and fire  it \n‘Mum and dad out, but  if you’re a foot off line on  the  four, the  lap’s \ntried to put me  off finished. That’s what I’ve learned from looking at \nand get me  into Mick Doohan on  videos, he  was so  smooth.

I’ve got  a  lot  more to  come from myself, simply from \nmore track time, but  I’ve  been struggling with fitness. I did  a wrist at  Le \nMans in May, a finger at Assen in June and I dislocated my collarbone in \nGermany, they've all  knocked me. But I’m  where I want to  be.

And if I make it \nthen, I'll be the youngest-ever premier-class champ.’ And hell, you  never \nknow, he may even get a pay  rise, too. \nEpilogue: \nHaslam \ndidn’t \nget \nthe \nHonda \nGP  \njob \nin  \n2002, \neveryone \nknows \nthat. \nInstead \nhe came \nhome \nto \nrace \nBSB \nand \nWSB."

He’s not  the  funniest man in the world but  Haga’s got \nto be the Vic  Reeves of  Japanese GP  racers. \nAnyway, it’s nice to see  him in a good mood, because he’s spent most \nof 2001 looking dead miserable, and not  only because he’s bombed out \non  results. ‘One problem is I don’t have so  many friends in GP,  this is \nmy  first time. But everyone so  serious, I don’t think that’s necessary. \nFor  sure Superbike paddock is more funny and people more friendly.’ \nSuch is the  curse of modern corporate-funded sport —  more money \nequals more pressure equals more stress equals less fun. Football’s the \nsame, everything’s the  same. There are  far greater rewards available in \nGPs than World Supers, so  there’s no  time for charging around getting \nwrecked on  Sunday nights. Haga finds this hard to  cope with. ‘There’s \nalways so much thinking about riding the bike, so  there’s much tension. \nIf I think too  much, for  sure coming stressed.’ \nHaga copes with stress the  same way as  most normal folk: he  gets \npissed.

I ask him “What alcohol do you drink”, and he say  (Haga \nadopts very loud and totally bizarre Asian Ocker accent) “For me  always \nonly beer!” He  drank about ten  litres in  four hours, too  much! But \nwhen he drunk, he very funny, very funny!’ [Haga enunciates ‘very’ like \nmany Japanese who struggle with their Vs  and Rs,  so  it  comes out \n‘belly’.] And what about Haga, does he  get  funny when pissed up? ‘I \ndon’t remember!’ More guffaws. \nEventually we  move on  to  serious stuff, like why hasn’t.he ripped up \nthe  tarmac in  GPs the  way he  did  in  Supers? Of  course, we  already \nknow the answer —  an  R7  on  Dunlops is a cosy armchair ride compared \nto a 500  on  Michelins. As former Supers champ Scott Russell once said: \n‘You better take your time with 500s or  you'll be  pulling straw out  ya \nass  and having Dr  Costa shoot Novocaine in ya  feet.’"

Yeah, yeah, I think so,’  is his  only \nreply to persistent interrogation on  the  subject. You see, Japanese riders \nare  not  renowned for  making revelations —  they maintain a  corporate \nloyalty way beyond that of most round eyes. \nBut there’s good reason for  Haga to  keep his  lips zipped. Despite his \nmiserable performance during 2001 (mostly qualifying on  the  third or \nfourth rows and finishing 10th or  worse), Yamaha still rate him as  a \nfavoured son, and they’d be  mad not to  give him a  YZR-M1 for  2002 \nbecause however shite he is on  a  500, he’s the  bomb on  big, lairy four- \nstrokes. There’s only one problem. Carlos Checa recently destroyed lap \nrecords on  the M1  so  there’s others after this  particular 200 horsepower \nride and Haga’s got  to join the  queue with Checa, Biaggi and Co. \nNot surprisingly he avoids all talk about 2002; indeed we'd been told \nthat this subject was out  of bounds. We  ask  him anyway. ‘Maybe I stay \nhouse, in Japan.’ he replies. ‘Maybe my father and mother come to GPs \ninstead.’ Thanks Nori, you’ve been most helpful. \nEpilogue: Haga returned to  WSB in  2002 and has been there ever \nsince. At  the  time of writing, however, he  still hadn’t won the  title."

Back at  the end of  2001, \nsoon after he’d wrapped up  his  first premier-class crown, Rossi \nagreed to  a  one-on-one interview which ended up  going on  for \nan  hour, in his  team’s office within the Sepang paddock. As  the \nclock ticked, Rossi’s white-haired manager Gibo Badioli began \nto  pace the room impatiently, but Vale was happy chatting, so \nGibo let him be. This might just be Rossi’s longest-ever interview \nwith a non-Italian journalist... \nYou  were incredibly dominant throughout 2001, were you surprised by how \nmany races you won? \nI was surprised to  win the  first three in a  row because I’m  usually not \nso  fast at  the  start of  the  season. But we  had some very good tests \nduring the  winter, so  we  arrived at  the  first three GPs in good shape. I \nknew we had the potential to  win some races and the world \nchampionship, but  I thought it would start more slowly. \nMax Biaggi always talks a lot about you  having the better bike... \nWho? Max who? Ha,  ha! \nBut  could you  beat him if you were on  a  Yamaha? \nFor  me, I think yes, because we're not  talking about Biaggi winning six \nraces and me  seven, or  me  scoring just ten  points more than him. Of \ncourse, I think my  bike is very good. Me, my  team and HRC had worked \nhard on  this bike since October 2000, we  did  some fantastic work and \nwe  made a fantastic bike, but  I also think that I was the  fastest rider in \n2001, usually. I won 11  races, Biaggi won three and he only won Assen"

Mick \nDoohan had a different riding style from me, he  didn’t use so  much \ncorner speed, so  he had less  of a problem with settings. He used to  slide \nand go,  like a  real 500 rider. But I came from 250s so  I had to  change \nmy style to  go  into corners a  little slower and though I learned to \nunderstand slide control and started to  slide like Mick, I’m  still faster \nin the  middle of the  corner, not  because I’m  a better rider, just because \nI have a  different technique. And to  ride with this style, using more \ncorner speed, you have to  have more accurate settings. \nBut  the  team also started working my way. Germany was a very hard \nrace for  us  and a  very bad result [Rossi was seventh, his  worst dry- \nweather result of  2001], but it  was also very good because Jeremy \n[Burgess, Rossi’s ex-Doohan crew chief] understood that it  was \nnecessary to follow me  more and to make more changes. From Germany \non  he  changed a  lot  and we  tried many different things with settings. \nBefore that I would sometimes say  I want to  try  this or  that and he \nwould say  ‘No, for  sure it won’t work’, but  now we  try everything. \nSo how did the bike change? \nAll \nthe  \nsuspension \nsettings, \nto \ngive \nme  \nmore \nfront \ntyre \ngrip, \nbut  \nmost \nof \nall \nthe \nbike \nnow \nturns \nbetter. \nThe \nHonda \n500 \nhad \nalways \nhad \na \nturning \nproblem, \nit \nwould \nalways \nrun \nwide; \nnow \nthe \nbike \nis \nbetter \nfrom \nthat \npoint of view. \n[At  \nthis \nmoment, \nRossi’s \nHRC \nteam \nmanager \nCarlos \nFiorani \nchips \nin: \n‘I’m \nsaying \nthis \nbecause \nI \nknow \nValentino \ncan’t. \nWhen \nValentino \ncame"

But now Jeremy says that Valentino has an \nincredible system, he can  test  many different things at  the  same time, \nwithout getting confused. He  has some kind of amazing link system \nwhich allows him to  think “I like this” and “I don’t like this’’.’] \nDo you  think Max hasn't changed his style from 250s? \nYes, absolutely. Biaggi is  a  very hard 250 rider, he  won four 250 \nchampionships, so  he’s very good on  250s, and of  course, he’s also \nvery good on  500s. But he  never slides the rear, never, you never \nsee him sliding because he  uses the front so  much. Riding like \nthat it’s  possible to  win three or  four races a  year, because with that \nstyle it’s  necessary to  have the  settings 100  per  cent correct. When I \nstarted 500s I also used the  front very much, and I crashed many times \nbecause I was using the  front too  much. Biaggi also uses the  front \ntoo  much. \nDoes Biaggi’s Yamaha YZR have any advantages over your Honda NSR? \nYes, the Yamaha is easier to use  than our  bike on  acceleration, it’s easier \nto  open the  throttle early because the  engine character is  softer. We \nhave good braking stability but the  Yamaha has a  very good corner \nspeed. \nYou  rode your best  race of 2001 at  Donington, coming from 11th to  win; how \ncome you're so good at overtaking? \nI’m  very used to  coming from the  back because I’ve  never been a very \ngood starter; it was the  same in  125 and 250. Like at  Barcelona this \nyear, I started from pole but  I was almost last at the first corner because \nI collided with Alex Crivillé or  Sete Gibernau.

It’s  not  right \nthat the pace should be  the same because 500s have double the \nhorsepower, so  it was time to raise the pace. After Mick stopped in early \n1999, the  500  pace was very calm and sweet, the lap times were always \nslower than the  lap record. \nSo if Mick was  still racing, could you  beat him? \nHa ha!  I think I’m  now quite good on  500s, but  I’ve  seen some Bf Mick’s \ndata readouts and, fuck, he  was very fast. It  was him that made the \ndifference, not the  bike. He  was able to  make the  difference because \nhe’d always been fighting with Rainey, Schwantz, Lawson and  Gardner, \nand when all the ‘Old Dogs’ stopped, it was easy for him to beat Crivillé, \nRoberts, Okada and all.  If  I was to race Mick, I think I could fight with \nhim, but  I don’t know who would win. Nobody knows, ha ha! \nWhen Biaggi crashed right in front of you  at Motegi, for the second time in four \nraces, are you  sure you  didn’t smile? \nNo, I didn’t smile. When Biaggi crashed at Brno and Motegi he was going \nso  quick. I had my mind on  other things, like  ‘Ah, maybe it’s  possible to \novertake him here on  the  last  lap’, or  ‘Here I’m  faster, there I’m  slower’, \nand when he  crashed I thought ‘Oh fuck, now it’s  necessary to  change \nmy plan’, so  it was ‘What do I do now?’ For  sure it was easier to win after \nhe crashed at  Brno and Motegi but  I didn’t smile either time. \nWill beating Biaggi to the title change your relationship with him? \nIt \nwon’t \nchange \nmy \nrelationship \nwith \nhim, \nbecause \nwe \ndon’t \nhave \na \nrelationship, ha! \nTell \nus  \nwhat \nhappened \nwhen \nyou  \nhad \nthe \npunch-up \nat \nCatalunya. \nWhat \nhappened \nwasn’t \nvery \nbig \nand \nit \nwasn’t \nimportant. \nIt \nwas \nlike \nbeing \nat \nschool: \n‘He \nstarted \nit!’, \n‘No, \nhe \nstarted \nit!’, \n‘No, \nhe \nstarted \nit!’ \nBiaggi"

I started the  race from last  position and I arrived first \nat  the  flag, I made the  fastest lap and I made a fantastic victory, so  why \nwould I want to make all that shit? That’s all I’m  saying. \nMax says you  use  the rivalry for energy to help you  ride faster; do you  agree? \nWhen I was racing for  the  250 title in  1999 my  main rival was Tohru \nUkawa but  I always knew in my  mind that I could beat him. For  sure, \nBiaggi is stronger because he’s so  fast. To beat me  he gave 120  per cent, \nso  the  fight was fucking hard. In the  past in he never rode the  500  like \nhe  did last season, maybe ’98  but  in ’99  and 2000 he wasn’t so  fast. \nIn 99, when I was fighting with Ukawa, he had a 40 point lead after \nmy chain broke at  Paul Ricard. It  was a  strange situation because I \nknew I was faster than him but  I knew I couldn’t afford one mistake \nbecause the  gap  would go to  60 points and I’d be fucked. \nYou  want to choose between the RCV and NSR for 2002, but do you  really think \nHonda will let you  make the choice? \nIt’s  a difficult situation but  I think it’s  necessary for me  to  try the  RCV \nbecause although Honda think this bike is very much faster than the \n500, I’m  not  so  sure. Before I speak any more I think I need to  try the \nRCV again because so  far I’ve  only ridden it for eight laps at  Suzuka in \nthe  rain. \nYou  seem to think the four-stroke won't give you  as  much riding satisfaction as \nthe 500... \nYes, the  satisfaction of riding the  500 is a very, very big motivation for \nme, because when you're riding the most difficult bike in the world, it’s \nnecessary to  have a  perfect set-up if you’re to  be  able to  ride fast, and \nyou've also got to ride perfect all the  time.

Whenever I leave my  motorhome there are \nalways very many people and unfortunately I don’t have enough time \nto do every autograph and photo because we  have work to do.  If I never \nsay  stop, I don’t get a minute to myself. \nWhen you're 16 or  17 you  don’t have problems, unless it’s  something \nreally big  like family problems.

Also, because in  Italy there are  very many doctors \ncalled Dr  Rossi, so  I became Dr  Rossi. ; \nSo what's next? \nFor  2002 we  stay with the  doctor for  sure, and after that I don’t know, \nwe've no  ideas yet."

We just wanted to  do  something new to \nshow the  big emotion of winning races. \nSo why did they finish? \nBecause I don’t think a lot of people really understood the whole thing, \nso  they don’t deserve it.  It’s  like last  June at Mugello, we  had my bikes \nin that Hawaiian paint scheme, they looked great. But  when I crashed \nout  of the  race some people said I’d  only crashed because I’d  been up \nall night painting the  bikes! \nIn  98  at  Mugello I  finished second and arrived on  the podium \nwearing beach gear and people said bad things. It’s  like if you win \nevery race of your career you're a genius, but  if you finish second you're \na fucking clown, or  stupid! So I decided it was better to  stop all this and \njust wave like other riders, then have a  big party on  Sunday night with \nmy  real friends. \nThe problem with many journalists who write bad things is  that \nthey are  too  conformist, so  if you make a  rude sign for  fun, you’Te a \npiece of shit, or  a  criminal, so  you should go  to jail. I don’t understand \nall  that. \nWhere did the Hawaiian paintjob come from? \nIt was an  old  idea. In  ’99  we  had two different ideas for  my  Mugello \npaintjob \n— \nthe \n1970s-style \nValentinik \npeace \nand \nlove \nthing, \nwhich \nis \nwhat \nwe \nused, \nand \nthe \nHawaiian \nthing. \nSo \nwe \nalready \nhad \nthe \nidea, \nand I think it was a very, very beautiful bike."

That \nbike was Honda’s fabled oval-piston NR500, and this is its  story \nFour-strokes took over GP  racing at  the start of  2002, when new \nregulations allowed 990cc four-strokes to  take on  the  500 two-strokes \nthat had dominated for so  long. Cynics viewed this transformation as  a \nfinal victory for  Honda, the  four-stroke fans who had been trying to \nmake GPs a  four-stroke deal for 25  years. \nWhen Honda first contested the  world championships in the  1960s, \nfour-strokes were king, but  as  the  strokers got up  to  speed, Honda quit \nand stayed out  of GPs for  a  dozen years. When they returned in  1979, \nthey did so  with a  four-stroke, even though two-strokes were all- \ndominant by then. The wondrously exotic oval-piston, 32-valve NR500 \nraced for four years, cost Honda billions of yen and never scored a single \nworld championship point, though it  did win a  couple of  low-key \nnational events. Nevertheless Honda rated the project a success, because \nit taught them plenty about four-stroke technology, much of which will \nhelp them in the  new four-stroke GP  era. \nThis is the  story of Honda’s NR500 as  told by five  people close to  the \nproject —  Youichi Oguma, Seiki Ishii, Gerald Davison, Mick Grant and \nRon Haslam —  and an  outsider —  GP journalist Mick Woollett. \nOguma was one of Honda’s most charismatic warlords and the  man \nwho masterminded the  NR’s first win in  a  low-key Japanese race. He \nalways said what he thought. Engineer Ishii started out  working on  the \nNR’s ultra-complex carbs before becoming HRC team manager in  the \nmid-1990s, looking after NSR250s and 500s. \nDavison was team manager of  the Honda International Racing \nCompany and the  man who oversaw much of  the NR saga, liaising"

Of  course, Honda wanted to  get  back into GPs, \nwe'd been out too  long and we  were losing commercial ground to \nYamaha, but  the  NR  was conceived right at  the  top  of the  company by \npeople who weren’t in  touch. The passion within Honda was four- \nstroke but these people had no  grasp of  the  gap between two-stroke \nand four-stroke technology, they simply believed that Honda could win \nby putting enough muscle into it.  What we  ended up  doing was like \ntrying to put  a man on  the  moon. \n‘I was in Japan for  the  press launch of the  CBX1000 six.  I was pretty \nclose to  Kawashima (team manager of Honda’s original TT team in  1959 \nand then president of Honda Motor) and he  sent for  me, asking me  to \nwrite a  speech for  the  press. We  got  well into it  and then he  said he \nwanted to announce that Honda would return to GP racing, with a four- \nstroke. I was shocked but  he  thought it was funny that he’d told me  in \nthis way. Then he told me  I was going to organise the whole thing.’ \nMick Grant ‘When Gerald was trying to get me  to sign a contract he told \nme  they’d got  some radical ideas which frightened me a little. Like they'd \nuse  liquid nitrogen to cool the motor so  they wouldn’t have radiators, and \nthey'd use a lot of ceramics, which were almost unheard of at the  time.’ \nGerald Davison ‘The management said “We're going back into racing \nand \nwe \ndon’t \nwant \nanyone \nold, \nthis \nproject \nwill \nhelp \nyoung \nengineers \ncut \ntheir \nteeth”. \nThat \nwas \na \nmiscalculation \nbecause \nthere \nwas \nno \none \nwithin \nthe \nNR \ngroup \nwith \nany \nracing \nexperience, \nit \nwas \nall \ngreen. \nSilly \nmistakes \nwere \nmade \nbut \nno \nmatter \nhow \ndark \nthings \ngot, \nno \none \never \nasked \nfor \nadvice \nfrom \npeople \nlike \nMichihiko \nAika \n(the \nengineer \nwho \nmasterminded \nHonda’s \n1960s \nGP \nsuccesses \n).’"

I didn’t see  how it could possibly \nsucceed against the  latest two-strokes but  I never expected them to  fail \nquite so  totally or dramatically. The  thing they built in ’79 wasn’t even as \ngood as  the  ’76  MV Agusta (the last four-stroke to  win a  GP,  at  a  wet \nNurburgring in ’76), it was slower and it didn’t handle half as  well. That \nfirst year it had 16-inch wheels, a funny frame and weird forks. The next \nyear all  that was gone, it had a  British-made Maxton frame, 18-inch \nwheels and ordinary forks. It was all just an  engineering exercise.’ \nMick Grant ‘When IJ arrived at Honda R&D I went into the workshop and \nit all looked so  convincing, I couldn’t believe it wasn’t going to work. But \nwhen I first rode it the  engine wouldn’t tick over at  less than 7000rpm \nbecause there was  no flywheel. The power started about 12,500 and though \nit’d run  on  to 21,000, it was all done by 17 five. And it felt slow, very much \nso.  I was four seconds off the  Suzuka record and I was riding as well as  I’d \never done in  my  life. The engineers couldn’t understand why it wasn’t \ngoing quicker, they almost didn’t want to grasp the reality. \n‘The handling wasn’t a big problem, but with less than 100 horsepower \nit wasn’t going to  be.  The main worry was the  aluminium monocoque \nchassis, it kept cracking. I’d do three laps, come in and have it welded, \nthen another four laps and the  same again. It  didn’t make for  happy \nmotoring! The monocoque was a great idea, it would’ve worked well in \ncarbon fibre. There were lots  of good ideas but they jumped in too  early; \nthey should’ve kept it under wraps and kept testing.’ \nMick Woollett ‘We all just fell  about laughing when the bike made its \ndebut at  the  British GP.  It was such an  absolute total balls-up, the  only \nreason they got on  the  grid was that someone pulled out. Then poor old \nGranty fell arse over head at the first bend and the bike burst into flames! \nA lot  of people hated Honda because they always had the  most money, \nthough we  were delighted they’d come back into racing. It was good to \nsee  them get beaten and the  NR  kept us  amused for a few years.’ \nMick Grant ‘At  Silverstone we  went out  for first practice with the  125s \nand 250s and there were TZ250s pulling away down the  straights.

But racing isn’t so  simple, Magoo ran  into a few issues that stopped \nhim getting it together. \nBut we  never learn. Early in 2002 I named Daijiro Kato as  the man most \nfeared by Valentino Rossi. I interviewed him a couple of weeks after he’d \nharried Rossi at Jerez, but  life went pear-shaped for the little Japanese at \nthe  next few GPs, he  started crashing his NSR500 rather too  often.

Even Yamaha, who have to  sanction Red \nBull's signings, were wondering if WCM race director Peter Clifford \nhad taken leave of  his  senses. Hopper had won the  2001 American \nFormula Xtreme crown, but  so  what? \nClifford, a former bike journalist, and one of the  few GP  team bosses \nprepared to  take risks in  nurturing new talent (most of the  paddock \nthought Clifford was nuts when he  signed Hopper’s Red Bull team- \nmate Garry McCoy in  1999), had given the teenager a couple of runs on \nhis  YZR500s during 2000 and 2001, following a  tip-off from American \nbike journalist John Ulrich, who’d spotted Hopkins before he’d even hit \nhis  teens. Ulrich, by the  way, is  the  guy who recommended a certain \nKevin Schwantz to  Yoshimura Suzuki way back in  1984... \nSo who is John Hopkins? He  sounds American but  that SoCal drawl \ndisguises 100 per cent Limey blood coursing through his  veins, his \nparents hailing from Acton, a  not  particularly salubrious west London \nsuburb. His  dad, who died from lung cancer when Hopper was 12, was \nwell into bikes and even raced the  TT  before heading west. The family \nemigrated to  the  States in  the  mid-1970s, settling down in  Ramona, \nclose to  the  Mexico border, and pretty soon dad was hooning around \nthe  desert on  dirt bikes. Hopper joined him at  the  age  of three. ‘First \ntime I ever rode a  motorcycle was in  the  desert, my  dad figured he’d \nput \nme \non \nthis \nlittle \nHonda \n70 \nbecause \nI \nwas \nalready \nriding \nmy \nbicycle \npretty \nwell, \nhittin’ \nlittle \nramps, \njumpin’ \noff \nkerbs \nand \nstuff. \nEvery \nweekend \nwe'd \nhead \nout \ninto \nthe \ndesert \nwith \na \nvan \nfull \nof \nbikes, \ncamping, \nhaving \nbarbecues, \nhanging \nout \nwith \nfamily \nand \nfriends.’ \nPretty \nsoon, \nof \ncourse, \nHopper \nwanted \nto  \ndo  \nmore \nthan \njust \nthrash \nthrough \nthe  \ndunes. \n‘We \nwere \nwatching \none \nof \nmy  \ndad’s \nbuddies \nrace \nmotocross \nat \nAscot \nand \nI \nsaw \nsome \nkids \nracing \nPW50s, \nso \nI \nasked \nmy"

Can I race?” We were out  there the next Friday and \nmy whole life has  been motorcycles ever since.’ \nHopkins started motocross, dreaming of becoming a  Supercross pro, \nbut got sidetracked during an  Oklahoma national. ‘They had this \ngo-kart track where they were running YSR50 races and they were \nletting kids ride around on  their PW50s. Being a  roadracer, my dad \nthought it’d  be good for me. It was kinda funny because everyone was \nriding their PWs on  dirt-track tyres and I was on  knobbies, I did  four \nraces and ended up  pulling away and lapping up  to  second place every \ntime; it just came natural to me. But until I was 11  tarmac was just my \nhobby, my real thing was motocross.’ \nHis  moment of awakening came at  Willow Springs, when a  family \nfriend offered him a  run on  a  Honda RS125 GP  bike. ‘That’s what \nchanged my  whole perspective, it was the  thrill of  everything —  the \nhandling of the  bike and doing the  straightaway —  that just made me \nfocus on  roadracing, and from then on  I was looking at  Schwantz \nand Rainey.’ \nBut  Hopkins was still too  young for  the  real hard stuff. Until he was \n14  he  had to  make do with YSR racing and a  once-a-month track-day \nthrash aboard the  RS125. He’d already graduated to  250s at  the  age  of \n15  when a  rash of blow-ups persuaded him to  return to  motocross. ‘I \ngot  frustrated, I said ‘I’m done with this, this isn’t \n_ getting me anywhere, I’m gonna concentrate on \n‘Next thing I know motocross’. That’s when John Ulrich gave me a call \nI’m  shooting and asked me  if I wanted to try one  of his GSX-R600s. \nthrough the air, The bike was strange, it was like riding a  big  boat \nlooking down at the after what I’d  ridden.’ So  Ulrich got  him a start in \nground thinking, the  Aprilia Cup for  hotted-up RS250 streetbikes and \n“all right, why did Hopper won the '99  title at  16.  ‘The bonus was a \nthis happen?’”’ ticket to  Italy, to  go  test a  GP  125, plus a  few days \nTea vacation in  Florence, Rome and Venice; that was \ndefinitely a mind-changing deal.’ \nAfter that he raced GSX-R600s and 750s for  Ulrich’s outfit, winning \nthe  2000 Supersport 750 title and shifting up  to  Formula Xtreme for \n2001, riding a  185  horsepower GSX-R thou. ‘From there the  thrill just \nstarted gaining and gaining and we  ended up getting the championship. \nThe 1000 was a lot  of fun, it definitely got  me  familiar with the  speed \nbut  without the  handling and acceleration of the  500.’"

When I first started working with the \nteam, I'd  go  out  and ride, then we’d change it and I’d  end up  getting \nlost. If there’s not  a problem, to  me  there’s no  point in changing it, so \nnow they’ve gotten to work with that, they come up with a base setting, \nthen I go out  and ride it, then if  I do have a problem, I let  them know. \nI tell  them I’m pushing the  front through some corner and they’re \npretty good at  fixing that. I’d  say  I’ve  gotten better the less changes we \nmake to  the  bike. \nSo  it’s  a  case of getting used to  the set-up, so  you  can  predict what's going to \nhappen? \nYeah, you're not  gonna get  the  same feelin’ out  of the  bike if you keep \nchanging it,  especially when you're havin’ to  learn the  circuits, learn \nthe  tyres and everything about the  bike. \nWhat have you  learned about riding? \nI’ve had to  adapt to  a  completely new style this year. I’m finding that \none  of my strong points compared to other riders is braking. I’m  getting \ninto the  corners really good. I think that comes from motocross, I was \nalways one of the  best getting into the  corners, I used quite a  bit  of \nfront brake in motocross, though a lot more rear brake. It’s  kinda funny \nbecause I don’t use any rear brake whatsoever on  the  500, not  in  the \nwet either. The team finds that strange. \nHow do you get the bike settled into  turns? \nI guess I’ve got  a  good body set-up, a  good body language to  keep the \nrear kinda okay. I’ve had to  work on  my  riding style to  keep the  bike \nsettled because I’d rather not  touch the  rear brake. \nWhat's the biggest buzz of the 500? \nFirst, I’d  have to  say  the  competition, then the  speed-to-weight ratio, \njust how fast it gets goin’.

I found that pretty amazing. \nWho's the best guy out  there, who’s amazed you  most? \nI mean, I definitely don’t want to  look up  to  any of them but  I’d  have \nto say Garry [McCoy], just for his riding style. I find that most impressive \nout of everything, it’s  just so  different, it doesn’t seem like top-level \nroadracing. Last winter when I first started testing properly with the \nteam I followed him a lot at  Sepang, but his lines are  so  much different \nfrom what I run. His  slides take him all  the  way out  to  the  edge of the \ntrack, where I like keeping it pretty much in line, drivin’ it out. I hold it \na little bit tighter, he kinda swings it out  a lot wider with his  sliding and \nthen he kinda shoots back. \nIt looks like time wasting... \nBut it works out. \nAre you  looking forward to getting on four-stroke in 2003? \nI’ve  been really lucky to  get one of the  last  rides on  a  500, so  I’m  takin’ \nadvantage of that. That was my whole goal and I just made it on  to one, \nso  I’m  really happy about that. But I think it’s  gonna be a really good \nthing to  have a  four-stroke next year, because I can  combine my  four- \nstroke experience from back home with my  500  experience and fill it all \ninto the  MotoGP bike. And with the  knowledge of the  tracks and the \nknowledge of the  riders around me, I think it’s  gonna be  really good. \nAnd, depending on  what bike it is, I think it could be quite a bit  easier \nto  ride. \nWhat's your best  GP moment so far? \nI'd have to  say  Assen, comin’ into the  last lap tryin’ not  to  go too  hard, \nbut  to judge it so  I could stay ahead of Nakano. He  ended up comin’ by \nme  on  the  brakes, I was really hard on  them into the  chicane and he \njust came right up inside of me.

And even as  a \n16-year-old he made a great interviewee... \nCasey Stoner is the  16-year-old 250  GP rider with his  eyes firmly set  on \nthe MotoGP big time. A multiple Aussie junior dirt  track champ, Stoner \ncontests his first world championship campaign in  2002 and he’s \nalready got factory bosses sniffing around him. \nA  bright and sparky kid, Stoner has the  stamp of  greatness upon \nhim, no  doubt whatsoever about that. He  only started roadracing in \n2000 and had never raced a  250 before the  start of 2002. But second \ntime out  in  South Africa he  became the  youngest rider in  the  53-year \nhistory of the  sport to  qualify on  the  second row for  a  250 GP.  And at \nthe  Czech GP  he  scored a  remarkable fifth-place finish, coming back \nfrom 15th on  the first lap. But Stoner also jumped off a lot as  he battled \nto  get to  grips with his  100  horsepower Aprilia RSV250. \nStoner’s parents brought him to  Europe to  start his  tarmac career in \n2000, because he would've had to wait another two years to go roadracing \nif he’d stuck around Down Under. He was quick from the get-go, winning \nthe 2000 British Aprilia RS125 Challenge and more importantly attracting \nthe attention of GP talent spotter Alberto Puig, a former 500  star  to whom \nGP rights holders Dorna had given the task of bringing non-Spanish and \nnon-Italian blood into the  southern Europe-dominated GP  scene. Puig \nsorted him bikes for  the  super-competitive Spanish 125  series and also \nfixed him wild card rides for the 2001 British and Australian GPs. Stoner \nscored his  first world points at  Phillip Island but  that ride cost him the \nBritish 125 championship, which he’d totally dominated in  between \ntrucking down to  Spain every other weekend."

I did  quite well at  school but  never liked it, I absolutely \nhated it. \nWhen did you start riding? \nEver since I was born! When I was 18 months I was doing the  throttle, \nsitting on  the bike, with my cousin on  the back, turning the throttle on \na  Pee  Wee. My dad raced a bit,  and my  sister raced before I was born, \nso  I grew up with her riding around the place. I started doing dirt  track \non  a  Pee Wee. \nDirt track has  produced a lot of good riders, basically everybody who \ndoes roadracing in  Australia did  dirt track. If they made dirt track a \nworld championship thing and it was big, I'd like  to  do that better than \nroadracing. It’s  just really enjoyable, I absolutely love doing it, it’s just \na  fun  thing. I did  speedway for  a  bit  but  it’s  not  the  same. Dirt track’s \njust really good, you get  oil  tracks, so  it’s  like  supermoto but  slipperier, \nyou've got to  choose the right lines between the loose stuff and the \nshiny stuff, a lot  of different things. \nWhen did you start dirt track and then roadracing? \nAt four and I finished at  13 when we  came to Europe. You  can’t roadrace \ntill  you’re 16  in  Australia, so  I started at  14  in  the  UK. Alberto had \nheard of us  doing quite well in  the  last couple of rounds of the  2000 \nBritish championship, so  he  asked us  to  do  the  last two rounds of the \nSpanish championship to  see  how we  went. \nWe  had a  few problems but I didn’t do  too  bad, so  we  got  on  his \nteam \nand \nwent \ntesting \nat \nthe \nstart \nof \n2001. \nI \ndid \nreally \nwell \non \na \nstandard \nbike, \nso \nAlberto \nwas \nquite \nimpressed \nand \npushed \nHonda \nto \nget \nbetter \nparts. \nI \nwas \nvery \ngrateful \nfor \nthat, \nplus \nI \nhad \nthe \nopportunity \nto \ndo \ntwo \nGP \nwild-card \nrides, \nthat \nall \nhelped \nand \ngave \nme  experience."

It was a bit weird; \nI was old  enough, I'd  got the  licence, I’d  got the  approval. There’s a lot \nof jealousy in that kind of thing. The guy who runs the  series didn’t get \nalong with us  because we  didn’t go through him. All the other kids had \nbought their bikes off him, they’d done everything through him but we \ndid  it our  own way. He  didn’t like us  because of that, so  he  didn’t let \nus  race. \nDo you get a lot of stuff like punch-ups in kids’ racing? \nThere’s a lot of punch-ups! Normally not  between the  kids, most of the \nkids get along pretty good. It’s just the parents, very strange. I only had \nproblems my  last couple of years of  dirt track.

It’d  be a little easier if I was driving, because it’d  pass the \ntime and I’d probably enjoy it. \nDoes it feel like an  adventure or are you gagging to get to the next race? \nI’m  basically gagging to  get  to  the  next race and try  the  next track.

But this is  not  what makes the  bike so  seductive. The \nC594 was the culmination of almost two  decades of extravagant though \nultimately unproductive investment by the  Castiglioni brothers, who \nowned much of Italy’s motorcycle industry, from Cagiva to MV Agusta, \nfrom Ducati to  Moto Guzzi. \nClaudio and Giancarlo Castiglioni are  industrialist empire builders, \nrenowned for  their hardnosed business dealings, and yet  their grand \nprix adventure was marked by a  singular lack of  penny-pinching \nbusiness nous. They went racing because they loved it, and in  an  age \nwhen accountants rule the corporate world, knowing the price of \neverything and the value of  nothing, that’s to  be  applauded. The \nCastiglionis had a  passion for  racing, with a  capital P. \nIn  this sense the brothers were the last in  the line of  Italy’s \nromantic old-school motorsport patrons, men of  means like Count \nDomenico Agusta and Enzo Ferrari, who ruled over their stables like \n20th-century Machiavellians, enjoying the  behind-the-scenes political \nmachinations as  much as  they adored the wondrous machines they put \non the racetrack.

If they had managed to get away with their megabuck \nhobby for  16 years, they were finally told to  stop playing in  1994 when a \nconsortium of banks rescued the  Castiglioni group from the  financial \ndifficulties that also threatened to engulf Ducati. The banks’ accountants \ninsisted on  the  curtailment of  GP  activities as  a  precondition of  their \nrescue package. Ducati were allowed to  stay in World Superbike because \nthat series offered a direct commercial kickback. \nDuring Cagiva’s final years on  the  GP  scene, when they were at  their \nmost competitive, the  Castiglionis steadfastly refused generous offers \nof commercial sponsorship, for  the  simple reason that they wanted a \nblood-red motorcycle, just like the  older Ferrari Fl  cars that are  still \nworshipped the  world over. Perhaps it’s  just as  well that Cagiva’s GP \ndream ended when it did, before its purity got perverted by 21st-century \nracing mores —  blanket corporate sponsorship and dodgy team orders. \nIt  is  also somewhat ironic that Cagiva only achieved success with \ntwo wholly un-Latin riders —  American racing automatons Eddie \nLawson and John Kocinski. Of course, both men have a  huge passion \nfor  motorcycles and racing, but it took the  strange brew of their cold- \nblooded brains and the  Italians’ warm-blooded hearts to  win Cagiva’s \nthree GP victories, between 1992 and 1994. \nThe C594 was a development of the  previous year’s C593, which was \ncreated out  of Lawson’s invaluable input during 1991 and 1992, when \nhe won the  factory’s first GP  after a clever tyre gamble at  a damp 1992 \nHungarian GP.

But  racing proves time and \nagain that success is  achieved by  effective application of  known \ntechnology, rather than by brave forays into the technological unknown, \nso  Rosa focused his  team’s efforts on  research and development that \nwould bring immediate results. \nThe 593 and 594 were styled by  Rosa, along with chassis designer \nRomano Albesiano and Claudio Castiglioni, who liked to  involve himself \nat  every level of  the project. ‘The bike’s style came naturally during \ndevelopment,’ says Rosa, who went on  to  work with Benelli’s Tornado \ntriple. ‘I think that good style is very much linked to aerodynamic efficiency, \nas  Enzo Ferrari once said: “If a car  is beautiful, it will also be functional”.’ \nYou see, the function equals beauty equation works both ways. \nThe C594 is an object lesson in clean, straightforward design, in which its \ncreators have maintained their focus on  functionality, letting the machine’s \nmission define its appearance. And it’s almost certainly no  coincidence that \nDucati’s 916 style icon has  more than a  passing resemblance to  the  bike. \nRosa gave 916  designer Massimo Tamburini a  C594 for his  design offices, \nand Tamburini had already borrowed heavily from an  earlier Cagiva 500 for \nhis design of the marque’s Mito 125  streetbike. \nRosa presided over three years of great industry and success within \nCagiva’s race department that coincided with a  period during which \nmuch of  Italian commerce was starting to  enjoy something of  a \nrenaissance, mating its  age-old talent for  design and manufacture to \nmodern-day business practices. It  was a  far  cry  from Cagiva’s earlier \ndays on  the GP  trail, when the team staggered along Don Quixote- \nstyle, \njousting \nineffectually \nwith \nthe \n‘windmills’ \nof \nthe \nFar \nEast. \nThe \nfirst \nten \nyears \nat \nleast \nwere \nrarely \nany \nless \nthan \ntragi-comic, \nriddled \nwith \nrider \nwalk-outs, \nmechanical \nmeltdowns \nand \ntales \nof \ntrickery. \nLegend \nhas \nit, \nfor \nexample, \nthat \nthe \nfirst \nCagiva \n500 \nof \n1979 \nwas \nbuilt \naround \na \nset \nof \nSuzuki \nRG500 \ncrankcases \nnicked \nfrom \nSuzuki's \nfactory \nteam \nHQ \nin \nSurrey \nthe \nprevious \nsummer. \nThat’s \nthe \nCagiva \nGP \nstory \n— \nwrapped more in romance than in sex. \nAprilia \nRS3 \nCube: \nFrighteningly \nfast, \ngood-looking \nand \nItalian \nCan \nbrutal \nbe \nbeautiful? \nOr \nsexy? \nIn \nmotorcycling, \nalmost \ncertainly \nyes. \nAprilia’s \nRS3 \nCube \nlooks \nbeautiful \nin \na \nbrutal \nkind \nof \na \nway. \nIt \nlooks \nlike"

The Cube’s styling was born out of a  desire to  win \nraces, not to  flog streetbikes, but since function is  beauty, these two \nintents usually deliver the  same end result. ‘No  one at  Aprilia tells us \nthat we  need a nice design for marketing reasons,’ proclaims Witteveen, \nthe  main man behind the  little Italian marque’s Superbike, 250 and \n125 successes. ‘Our first target is  always performance, though I also \nbelieve that the  emotion of the  fans, and of the  people who work with \nthe  bike, is important.’ \nThe Cube’s shark-like look was created in the wind tunnel, or  rather \na virtual wind tunnel, to cope with the particular aerodynamic demands \nof  MotoGP racing.

He would invariably head \nthe top-speed charts while his lap times languished somewhere outside \nthe  top  ten. So Aprilia have steadily detuned the  motor, replacing top- \nend horsepower with mid-range torque, and each time they do that, he \ngets quicker. \nNevertheless, whenever the  Frenchman with the, erm, enthusiastic \nriding style climbs off the  bike, he looks like  he’s just gone ten  rounds \nwith some mythical six-headed monster. Eyes bulging and sweat \nglistening, Laconi mimes the  experience of riding the  220  horsepower \nCube as  a  horseman might act  out a  wild-stallion ride towards the \napocalypse: arms straining from their sockets as  he’s dragged towards \nthe  horizon at a terrifying rate, with seemingly little control over his \ndestiny. So  the  former 500  and Superbike winner obviously adores the \nbike. ‘It really kicks in every gear, more than my Yamaha 500  ever did,’ \nhe jabbers, still pumped after another practice run. ‘It  feels like a  500 \nbut  with more power and much more torque. The engine internals are \nvery light, so  it picks up  revs really fast and accelerates like crazy.’ \nThe Cube’s Cosworth-designed inline triple is crammed with more \nradical technology than any of  the  Japanese MotoGP bikes, namely \npneumatic valves and a  super-small, super-light, Fl-style AP  Lockheed \ncarbon clutch. Also sexy. ‘We have more than enough power, so  the \npneumatic valves aren’t necessary at  this moment,’ adds Witteveen. \n‘But if we  need to  increase performance in the  long term, they will give \nus  a  useful margin.’ \nAnd this is where Witteveen contradicts his  earlier declaration that \nAprilia’s \nracing \ndepartment \nhas \nno \ntruck \nwith \nthe \nmen \nfrom \nmarketing. \n‘We \nchose \na \nthree \ncylinder \nbecause \nI \nwas \nsure \nthe \nJapanese \nwouldn't \nmake \na \nthree; \nwe \nwanted \nto \nbe \ndifferent. \nOf \ncourse, \nour \ncomputer \nsimulations \ntold \nus \nthe \nthree \nwould \nbe \ngood \non \nthe \ntrack, \nand \nsince \nit’s \nmore \ndifficult \nto \nmake \nhorsepower \nwith \na \nthree \nrather \nthan \na \nfive, \nthis \nhelped \nus \nin \ndeciding \nto \nuse \npneumatic \nvalves. \nWe \nliked \nthe \nidea \nbecause \nwe \nwanted \nsome \nhigh \ntechnology \nin \nthe \nengine.’ \nLeast \nsexy \nof  \nall,  \nmanufacturing \ncosts \nalso \nhelped \ndetermine \nthe \nCube’s \nconfiguration. \n‘An \ninline \nmulti \nis \ncheaper \nto \nproduce \nthan \na"

But  wait, this surely means there'll soon be a Cube road bike. ‘Not \nthis year, not  next year, I don’t know when,’ insists Witteveen. And if \nthere ever is a street Cube you can  be certain it will be a dead ringer for \nthe racer, because the link between track and street is  particularly \ncrucial to Aprilia. The company only started making motorcycles in the \nmid-1970s and would be  nowhere in  the  global consciousness if Max \nBiaggi, Valentino Rossi, Laconi et al hadn’t put  its name up  in lights. \nMeanwhile, the  Cube racer is  expected to  get  quicker and quicker. \nThe 2002 bike is well over its  MotoGP-minimum weight limit and will \nstay that way for  some months, while each prototype part is whittled \ndown to  size and recast or  re-machined in  unobtanium. Witteveen \nreckons his  creation is  currently losing a  kilo every GP  (it’s the  new \nMotoGP diet: lose a  kilo a  fortnight, only £45,000!), which suggests \nthat the Cube will be pretty trim by Christmas and down to the  135-kilo \nlimit by the  start of the  2003 MotoGP season. \nQuick, shapely and Italian, the Cube’s sexiest attribute is probably its \npotential to  beat Honda. ‘We have a  chance to  beat them because, I \nhope, we have more fantasy, more creativity,’ Witteveen says. ‘If \neconomic power was all  that mattered in  racing, Honda would win \neverything, but  we've already demonstrated that’s not  always so.’ \nAnd he’s not  the only man who believes, as  one  rival Japanese factory \nengineer recently let slip: ‘The Aprilia will soon be kicking our  asses’. \nThe little guys defeating the big guys, now that is sexy. \nEpilogue: Sadly, the Aprilia never did beat Honda. World Supers champ \nColin Edwards rode the  bike in  2003 and got  his  arse burnt when the \nbike caught fire in Germany. In 2004 Jeremy McWilliams did  his best to \ntame the fiery beast. But  the factory was already in dire financial trouble \nand so  the  Cube project was crushed, exactly a decade after the  Cagiva \nwent west. Shame."

But just how bad do bike \nracing’s biggest losers feel? Grand Prix and World Superbike nearly \nmen Randy Mamola, Aaron Slight and Ralf Waldmann reveal what \nit’s  like never quite to shake off the  habit of finishing second \nRacing is  all  about winning, but if anything, it’s  more about losing. \nThere’s only one victor in every race but  many vanquished. And it’s  the \nwinners you get  to  read about, while the  losers barely rate a  mention. \nYet, just as  the  devil has  all the best tunes, it’s  the  losers who've got all \nthe  best tales. \nIn  500 GPs and World Superbikes, there’s two king losers: Randy \nMamola and Aaron Slight. Mamola won 13  GPs and finished second in \nfour 500  world championships during the  1980s; Slight won 13  Supers \nrounds (that scary number again) and made the  top  three in the  world \nchampionship six  seasons running from ’93.  Both men were at the top of \ntheir game for  years, as  fast as  anyone out there, but somehow they \nnever quite won a world championship, so  they’re left  to live  out  the rest \nof their lives wondering what might have been, the  memories of those \nbig days that didn’t turn out  right forever eating them up  inside. \nThere are  plenty of  reasons why Mamola and Slight never struck \ngold. Racers get  slagged for whingeing but, in all honesty, their excuses \nusually are  reasons. No  one ever had a  perfect race, there’s always \nsomething that might’ve panned out  better. The potential for cock-up is \nimmense. Riders are  at  the  mercy of inanimate objects, thousands of \ncomponents that might not  work exactly right. Or  the  weather may go \nwrong, even a  two-degree temperature change can confound a  tyre \nchoice. And then there’s 30  other very animate riders out there, all \nquite prepared to  ride into you at  140mph.

The title of his  autobiography You  Don’t Know the Half of It \ncertainly suggests that there was a whole load of emotional! investment \nand ifs  and buts that he wanted off his  back. ‘Writing the  book was a \nsort  of therapy for me,’ says the New Zealander, who switched to racing \ncars after he quit two wheels. ‘I couldn’t go through all the ifs and buts \nhere, because there’s so  many of  them, but the  biggest one was the \nrules. I was the  nearly man of Superbikes because I was riding a  750 \nfour when everyone was winning on  1000 twins. Now everyone knows \nyou've got  to  be  on  a  twin, but I was screaming about that for  ten \nyears.’ \nOf  course, Slight did eventually get  to  race a  twin when Honda \nunleashed its  SP-1 in  2000, but that’s the  year his  head went pop, a \n‘cavernous malformation’ in  his brain causing the stroke that \nprematurely ended his  career. Some people never get  the  luck. And \nthere were other moments, like ‘94, when a  blow-up at  Hockenheim \nand a disqualification at  Donington cost him the  title. Or 96, when he \nled  the  championship into the  penultimate round, only to  suffer a bad \nattack of flu at Albacete. ‘I got sick when Honda sent me  to the Cologne \nshow to  do publicity stuff, I’d argued for hours to  try and get out  of it.’ \nOr ‘98, when he was up for the  title but  his  team never instigated team \norders to help him out. That contest went to the wire with Ducati’s Carl \nFogarty at  Sugo, where Slight had tyre problems. ‘That year I won five \nraces, Carl won three and still took the  championship.’ \nSo  does Slight’s ultimate failure to  win a  world title still keep him \nawake at night? ‘I really have to make sure it doesn’t have that effect or \nI’d  stay awake forever. I started racing cars because that’s the  only way \nI could take my  mind off it; it had a huge effect on  me.’ \nMamola, a  decade into his  retirement from GP  racing, is a  little more \ndistant from his failures and therefore more sanguine. Like Slight he had \nhis  disasters, like when he  led  the 1980 championship into the  final \nround at  the  daunting Nurburgring. First time out  at  the  lethal 14-mile \ncircuit, the  20-year-old needed a win to  take the  title from. King Kenny \nRoberts. He was leading when his RG500 popped an oil seal. The following \nyear he signed with Nava helmets, whose visors fogged up  so  badly that \nhe  couldn’t see  where he  was going in  wet races. ‘Trying to  hold your \nbreath at  170mph with your heart doing 150bpm, I was furious.’ Or  ’84, \nwhen he only secured a  ride three races into the  championship.

Every year I wrote “Don’t be  such a nice guy, think \nof yourself,” but you are  what you are, I was just too  soft.’ \nIn fact, Slighty has had his moments of badness, including feuds with \nboth Foggy and Hodgson. ‘There was a bit of drama at  Sugo ’98, when I \nhad that run-in with Neil. On  the  grid for  race one I walked up  to  Carl \nand said “I guess it’s between you and me”, shook his hand and walked \noff.  On  the  way back, I don’t know what possessed me, but  I saw Neil \nand  said to him: “If I poke a wheel up, will you give us  some room?” That \nwas like a  red  rag  to  the  bull, every chance he  got, he  carved me  up,  I \nthink we  came together about six times, so after the race I rode up behind \nhim and smacked him in  the  kidneys. He  stopped, I parked my bike \nagainst the barrier, went over, grabbed him by the chin piece and dragged \nhim off the bike. Yeah, I saw red, but it wasn’t about him that day, it was \nthe championship slipping away.’ Ironically, that incident highlights \nSlighty’s gentler side, not  his  ruthlessness. Few other racers would even \ndream about shaking hands with a rival on  the  grid at  such a moment, \nand few would dare ask a fellow rider for any  quarter. \nNot surprisingly, he  cites that day’s second race as  the gloomiest \nmoment of his  career. ‘I made the  best start of my  life, from tenth on \nthe  grid to  fourth at  the  first corner, and when I turned on  to  the  back \nstraight I saw Carl pulling away, I could feel  the  championship slipping \nthrough my  fingers.’ \nMamola’s darkest moment came at  the  end of  ’87, just after he’d \nfinished second overall for  the  fourth time. Roberts, boss of his  Lucky \nStrike Yamaha team, sacked him and brought in Wayne Rainey. \nBoth Slight and Mamola console themselves with the  fact that they \ndidn’t do  so  bad; second place may be  the first loser, but it’s  heaps \nbetter than 28th. ‘When you look in the  record books and your name’s \nnot listed as  world champion, that kinda hurts,’ adds Mamola, now \nmarried with kids and living in  Barcelona. ‘The thing that keeps my \nhead above water is  that I  stood on  the podium in  three different \ndecades —  the  1970s, the  1980s and the  1990s —  and that J got  to  ride \nwith some great guys like Kenny, Sheene, Spencer and Lawson, Rainey, \nDoohan and Schwantz.

I’m sat  on  a  drum of gas, he’s on a pile of \ntyres, and he thinks this is hilarious. It seems that Waldi really is happy \nwith what fate has  bestowed on  him. We  distil the  reasons for his  two \nclosest world-title failures to  two moments. In ’92  his  Honda 125  team \nhad a  mid-season meltdown, a  bitter feud between his  two chief \nmechanics erupting into a  pit-lane brawl. In  ’97  he  chose a  wrong- \ncompound tyre for  the  penultimate Indonesian GP.  He  finished that \nrace seventh when fourth place would’ve given him the  title. Just ten \nseconds separated fourth from seventh. \n‘If you look for  reasons, you find them,’ he  says, a little more glum, \nthe memories seeping up  to haunt him. ‘Before ’97 it was brilliant with \nthe  money, with the  stuff we  get, but  then we  lose our sponsor and it \nwas really shitty, because we don’t have enough money. We have \nminimum of budget and only one bike; Max has two bikes.’ I notice a \nslight tremble in  Waldi’s voice, and, yup, he’s welling up.  Jeez, I’ve \nopened a real can of worms here. So it does still affect you, then? ‘Little \nbit, yes,’ he trembles, rubbing swollen, watery eyes. ‘Doesn’t matter, it’s \ntrue, so  no  problem, I live  with that or  I don’t live with that.’ \nThis is getting heavy, I almost feel like giving him a  hug but  feebly \nproffer some kinder words.

By  now Waldi’s on  an  emotional rollercoaster and suddenly \nhe’s in hysterics. ‘Ha, ha ha!

World titles is what every racer looks for, but  I had \nso  many nice races and I win 20  times, so  I must keep this in  my \nmemory, not  one title.

Like \nmaybe, just maybe, you might catch a  glimpse of  Sheeney’s bird \nStephanie Maclean through the  sweet, sickly greyness. \nIt  wasn’t all  glamour, of course. Those early 500 two-strokes were \nnasty pieces of  work —  their engines likely to  lock solid at  the  most \ninappropriate moment, skewing the  machine sideways and jettisoning \nthe  rider skyward, seriously dangerous when tracks were adjoined by \nbrick walls and telegraph poles, not  cosy expanses of gravel trap. The \nbikes were agonisingly noisy too, for  it wasn’t until the  late 1970s that \nanyone even thought about silencers, by which time many an  eardrum \nhad been shredded (presumably they couldn’t think for  the  racket). \nTommy Robb, whose GP  career straddled the  four-stroke and two- \nstroke eras, was one of many who suffered. ‘Seizures were always a \nworry,’ \nsays \nthe \nUlsterman \nwho \nrode \nfactory \nHonda \nfour-strokes \nto"

The two-strokes were getting faster and more refined with \nevery race —  the  four-cylinder OW26 which the  Italian stallion rode to \nthe  following year’s 500 title had a  powerband almost 2000rpm wide \n—  while the  four-strokes were going nowhere. But guys like Sheene — \naccustomed to  spending their winters partying hard —  paid a high price \nfor the  strokers’ improving usability. ‘Foolishly enough I told Suzuki I’d \ncome to  Japan at  the  end of ’74  and stay there until the  engine was \nright,’ he says. ‘I was there for five weeks, the biggest jail sentence I’ve \never served in my  life, a nightmare, but  the bike came good.’ \nThe only riposte that the four-stroke faithful had had to  the \nstinkwheels’ two-power-strokes-for-the-price-of-one technology was \nmultiplying cylinders and gears, as  Honda had done with their five- \ncylinder/eight-speed 125 and six-cylinder/seven-speed 250. But new \ntechnical regulations, intended to  reduce costs, limited the number of \ncylinders and gears, outlawing Honda’s most exotic creations, including \na  250 V8  and 500 six  that were rumoured to  be on  the  drawing board. \nThe new rules swung the advantage irrevocably towards the two- \nstrokes. Only by rewriting the  regs for  2002, when four-strokes were \ngiven a near 100  per  cent capacity advantage in MotoGP, was the  reign \nof the  two-strokes ended. \nAs  the  1970s accelerated to  their disco-pumping peak, Sheene’s hair \ngrew longer and the two-stroke’s powerband grew wider. ‘By the end of \n‘76  people knew the  four-stroke was finished,’ he  adds. ‘In  “79  the  RG \nwould start at  seven five  and go through to  11,000; it was just the extra \nknowledge they had about porting, expansion chambers, ignition \ntiming, everything.’ \nAnd they just kept getting better.

The party stopped as  the 1980s \nkicked into gear —  the  boom pumping serious money into sport for the \nfirst time. Evermore-bloated budgets raised the stakes for  the riders \nand the people making the bikes, so  engines got quicker, tyres got fatter \nand chassis stiffer. All of sudden, riders needed to be more than half fit \nto ride the  things, so  the  flared-up, Gitane-puffing playboys caved in to \nthe  cool-headed, cold-hearted professional automatons, pumping iron \nand riding sideways. \nThis was also the age  of the computer, when data acquisition allowed \nengineers to fully understand the inner mysteries of the life of the  two- \nstroke, so  they could hone efficiency to  dizzy new heights, not  only in \npeak power, but also in  power delivery. Reed-valve induction, power \nvalves and digital ignition mapping calmed engine character, though \nRoberts missed out  on  the  luxury of reeds by just one  year. ‘It was only \nafter Yamaha copied Honda and went to crankcase reeds in ’84  that the \nYamaha got pretty ridable,’ says Roberts, who spent his GP  years \nheroically wrestling with much less friendly piston port and disc valve \ninduction. ‘The reeds just broadened out  the whole powerband, so  you \ncould spin the  tyre and know where you were with it.’ \nUp  to  a  point, anyway. The OW70 V4  that Roberts raced in ’83  had \n135  horsepower, by the  early 1990s Honda’s NSR500 V4 was screaming \nout  170, and riders were once more running out  of traction, the endless \ncycle of engine and chassis development spiralling upward. Once again \nit was Honda that divined the  way forward, creating the  ‘big bang’ \nengine for  Mick Doohan in  ’92. This firing order bunched the  V4’s \npower pulses together, giving the rear tyre time to  regain traction \nbetween each salvo. Roberts again: ‘The big bang was the  one, it just"

Only one way to  find out —  ride Valentino \nRossi’s RCV \nAt  the end of  2001, Honda’s NSR500 ruled the  world, the greatest \nrace bike ever, the  most wanted race bike on  earth. Now the  NSR is \nobsolete and unwanted, its  reputation swept away by its  four-stroke \nsuccessor, the  RC211V. And now I know why. Testing the  RCV and NSR \nback to back at Valencia the  day after the  2002 season-ending Valencia \nGP,  the RCV takes your breath away, helps you do  things you never \nthought you’d do on  a motorcycle. Then you  ride the  NSR and it’s  a bag \nof  nails —  it  doesn’t stop, turn or  go,  it’s  vicious, awkward and too \ndamned demanding. \nI feel weird slagging the  once all-powerful NSR but I’m  not alone. \nAlex Barros, who’d beaten fellow RCV rider Valentino Rossi in  the \nprevious day’s race, turned up  during the test to  ride the NSR he’d \nridden during most of 2002, just for old  time’s sake. He  rode a handful \nof  laps on  the machine, returned to  the  pits and handed it  to  his \nmechanics, announcing: ‘This bike is sheeeet!’ \nHow can  this  be?  How can  Barros heap scorn upon a motorcycle that \nhad taken him to  three 500 GP  wins during the  previous two seasons? \nMaybe because its  successor took him to  two MotoGP wins during just \nfour races at the end of 2002. But more so because the RCV is a quantum \nleap forward in  all-round engine and chassis performance. It’s  both \nfaster and easier to ride than an  NSR500, and you can’t say  anything \nbetter than that about a race bike. \nRiding the  RCV leaves you dizzy, struggling to  translate its  other- \nworld performance into words and wary of getting carried away on  a"

And this is what HRC were aiming at when \nthey created their first four-stroke GP  racer in more than two decades. \nRCV project leader Hejiro Yoshimura wanted the  bike to  be  ‘easy to \nmanage, like  a motocross or  trials bike’, and that’s pretty much what it \nfeels like  —  a  220bhp trials tool, very cool. \nHRC achieved this goal largely through a  radical centralisation of \nmass, starting with the  75.5 degree vee  engine, which is  significantly \nmore compact than any other big-capacity four-stroke, including \nHonda’s SP-2 World Supers motor.

      "text": "188 THE FAST STUFF \nWhen you ride the  RCY, it feels like its  entire mass has  been tucked \ninto the  size of a  football just beneath your stomach, offering amazing \ncontrol. The  bike seems two feet long, so  you don’t ride around corners \nso  much as  dive in  and out, and yet  it has none of  the  nervousness \nassociated with a  short wheelbase. \nRacing at  the limit is  all  about confidence, and the RCV delivers \nshed-loads of the  stuff because engine/chassis/suspension integration \nallows a  remarkably balanced machine. The RCV’s neutral behaviour \nalso reduces the  need to  rework set-up at  every track, so  the  rider can \nuse  the  same settings week after week, which allows him to intimately \nunderstand the  bike’s behaviour, so  he  knows what it’s  going to  do \nalmost before it does it, which gives him yet more confidence, so  he can \nride even harder. \nThe RCV is so  good at  cornering that it makes an  NSR feel like  hard \nwork. Four-strokes are  easier to  ride around corners than two-strokes \nbecause they’ve a constant connection between throttle, tyre and tarmac, \nwhich is why Superbikes run  so  close to 500  lap times. Shut the  throttle \non  the  RCV and the  engine helps you turn the  corner, shut the  throttle \non  the  NSR and there’s no  rear-end connection, the  bike wants to  go \nstraight, so  you have to  do all the  steering through the  handlebars. \nThe RCV seems committed to  helping the  rider in every way possible, \nvery unlike 500s, which only yield their real potential to  the most \naccomplished riders. You notice this at every point of the  racetrack —  the \nRCV happily rides through fast sweepers on a trailing throttle while the \ntwo-stroke surges and snatches.

I would say if there’s anybody out  there with a similar \nstyle to  mine it’s  Corser —  never really out  of shape, keeps the  thing in \nline, and goes white line to white line. It’s just different techniques and \nobviously he  made the  Ducati work really well. I mean, it might be  a \ncharacteristic of the  bike, but  I think a lot  of it is in Troy’s ridin’. \nWhat did you  learn from Troy this year? \nThe thing I learned with Troy is that you never ever give in.  It doesn’t \nmatter if you've got five, six or  seven seconds on  him, the  guy just does \nnot stop. I know a lot  of riders out  there, and I'll  agree I was one of \nthem, who when somebody pulled out  five or  six  seconds on  me, well \nshit, I’ve only got  six  laps left, I’m  not  going to make up a  second a lap, \nso  you Settle for the  position you’ve got and you take it home.

At  times when you think it might be an  easy win you still gotta \nride your ass  off just to  keep the  gap. With Troy you can’t even allow \nthe gap to  come down two or  three tenths a  lap, instead of  almost \ncruisin’ to  the  finish. \nI'll  be  honest with you, I’ve never raced against anyone like him. I \nmean he’s awesome —  as  a  rider he’s awesome and his mental \ndetermination is  awesome. He  wants to  win, sure we  all  do,  but the \nthing I learned from him is that when I get  out  front I’m  going, I keep \nthe lap times going, until I know it’s  two laps from the  end and I’ve  got \nfive or  six  seconds, so  I can afford to  catch my  breath and go  on  to \nwin the  thing. It  used to  be  the  last five or  six  laps, whoever was a \nfew seconds back would ease off  a  little bit  or  whatever, but not \nwith Troy."

You come up with \nyour own little ideas, and it just happens like it happens. \nHave you  always ridden aggressively? \nYep, I’ve always had the same sort of  style. For sure I used to  be \nmore ragged [laughs]. I look quite a bit smoother than I used to, though \neven now I  look like I  put a  lot  of  physical effort into it  and I \nactually do. \nSo when did you  change from super ragged to smooth ragged? \nI think 2001 was the only time it settled down a bit.  When I was racing \nin England a few years back I started to get a little bit more smooth, but \nwhen I first came on  board of Ducati to have a go in World Superbike I \nwas pretty... I don’t know about ragged... but very physical on  the \nbike.

But I \nthink I’ve settled down a little bit  since. \nWere you  aggressive as a club racer? \nFor  sure, they used to  call  me  ‘the can  opener’! When I did  club races \nbefore I got into national events we  used to do, like 10 or  12 races a day, \nso  it was always the  same guys in  the same races, and the  first and \nsecond corners were always absolutely crazy.

It’s  a  good place to \nstart, that’s for  sure. \nIs aggression what it’s all about? . \nThe bikes are  getting so  fast and so  powerful that to  get the  last  bit out \nof them you've got  to  put  a  lot of physical input into them.

And Honda \nand the  rest have got  to  be working on  their own versions of the  M1 \nsystem, so  pretty soon everyone will be  cruising into turns all neat ‘n’ \ntidy.

This is the history of rear-wheel \nsteering and the masters of slide, before traction control came \nalong and spoiled everything \nIn  the  good old  days, when men were men and a fast 500 GP  bike \nrattled out, ooh, at  least 50  horsepower, the fastest way around a \nracetrack was knees tucked in, wheels in line, chin rattling on  the  gas \ntank. But  time moves on.  With more than two hundred horses kicking \nthrough the  rear tyre, wheelspin is  something you've got  to  live  with, \nso  you'd better use  it to your advantage. \nThe number-one reason that racers spin the  rear is  to  steer out  of \nturns. Getting sideways points the  front end back towards the  corner’s \ninside, tightening the  rider’s line, giving him more room to  get  on  the \ngas, which means more speed down the  next straight. It’s  like using \nthe  handbrake in a car, except you're breaking traction with throttle, \nnot  brake, and you're doing it to  go faster, not  slower. \nRear-wheel steering came from US  dirt track. American racers used \nto  start their careers riding ovals and then roadrace, and having grown \nup  sideways it was only natural they’d be  the  same on  tarmac. King \nKenny Roberts was the first serious back-end boy and his  success \nencouraged a  whole generation of bad-ass American and Aussie dirt \ntrackers to go GP racing. Also, it just so  happened that 1980s 500s were \nkicking out  way more power than their tyres and chassis could handle, \nso  there was only one  way to  subdue them: kick ’em sideways with big \nfistfuls of throttle and slingshot out  of the  turn. \nRoberts, Spencer, Lawson, Gardner, Rainey, Schwantz and Doohan \nall  ruled GPs after starting out  on  the  dirt. But during Doohan’s mid- \n1990s reign, chassis and tyre technology improved so  that tarmac-"

I could find the  limit, while Ago was a \nline racer, so  it was much harder for him to define the limit. If you  gave \nhim eight days of  practice he  could ease up  on  it  but otherwise I’d \nsmoke him.’ \nRoberts believes that spinning the  rear is an  essential weapon, not \nonly for  steering but  also because it allows more feel. \n‘You do it so you  don’t need to ride the line. You  can  start sliding it and \nthat points you in  the  right direction, plus, when it starts to  slide, you \nknow exactly how much traction you have and where your traction limit \nis. That’s Biaggi’s problem; he rides 500s like  they’re 250s, so  he feels the \nlimit with the  front tyre, and when you  find the  limit with the  front, it’s \nanother \nthing \nto \nsave \nit. \nSliding \ntakes \nthe \nfront \nout \nof \nthe \nequation.’ \nThere’s \ncorners \non  \nevery \nracetrack \nwhere \nthe  \nability \nto  \nslide \nis \ntotally \ncrucial. \nRoberts \ncites \nDaytona, \nwhere \nriders \ncome \non  \nto  \nthe  \nbanking, \ngiving \nfull \ngas \nfor \nthe \nall-important \n190mph \nblast \nto \nthe \nfinish \nline \nand \ntrying \nto \nmiss \nthe \nwall. \n‘You'd \nbe \npointing \nthe \nbike \nup \nthe \nbanking, \ngoin’ \nlike \nhell \nand \ngoin’ \ntoo \nfast \nto \nmake \nit, \njust \nby \nusing \nlean. \nSo \nyou'd"

If you didn’t you’d \nhave to nick it back on  the  throttle and that lap was gone.’ \nAlthough the  aim is  always the  same, other racers have their own \nway of getting sideways and Roberts knows the  differences better than \nanyone, having watched trackside since the  mid-1980s. \n‘It depends on  the  rider and the bike. If you’ve not  got the  power, you \ncan  do it with lean angle —  lay the thing over so it breaks traction. Doohan \ndid  it like that —  he’d exit the  corner a little too  fast, lean a little more, \nthen give it more gas  so  the  tyre would light up  and fix his  line. McCoy \nis  a  little different from Mick, he  sets it up  with a  lot  more rpm, he’s \nslower mid-corner, sets  it up a little earlier, then gases the hell out  of it.’ \nDespite tyre and chassis improvements, Roberts insists dirt track is \nessential training for  anyone aiming at  a  premier-class crown. ‘Alex \nCrivillé wouldn’t have been champ in  1999 if he hadn’t gone to my dirt- \ntrack school’ —  Alex said so  himself. Guys like McCoy obviously know \nhow to  do it and Rossi messed around doing dirt track when he was a \nkid. He  still does some on  his  XR650, he knows how to  do it.’ \nWayne Rainey: sideways is as  normal as  going straight \nLike all  the greatest rear-wheel steerers Wayne Rainey learned his \nracing craft as  a  child. Sliding and throttle control were nurtured into \nhim from the  earliest of ages. \n‘As  a kid, being sideways was as  normal as  riding in a straight line,’ \nsays Rainey, who emulated mentor Kenny Roberts with a  500  title hat \ntrick in 1990, ’91  and “92.  ‘When I started roadracing in the early 1980s, \nI didn’t know if it was right or wrong but it was what I felt  comfortable \nwith. If  the  tyre wasn’t spinning and the  bike turning, I didn’t feel \nright. I liked it spinning because it gives you a  safety buffer, you kinda \nknow where you can  go with it. \n‘In  fact, sliding is  the  easy part, the  difficult part is front-tyre feel. \nThe key to  my  riding style was getting through that area really quick, \ngetting the front tyre out of  the  way so  I could get  on  the throttle. \nWhen you brake and flick, it’s  all front tyre, which is kinda risky. \n‘The advantage rear-wheel steering gave me  was huge. And it’s just the \nsame now —  watch Rossi, he’s getting a bit sideways now. It’s  great when \nyou've \na \nlot \nof \ngrip \nbecause \nyou \ncan \nuse \nmore \nthrottle \nthan \nthe \nother \nguys, \nand  when the grip starts to fade, you  know where the traction is."

But  when you're doing this  you're \ntalking very small changes in throttle opening because you're at the limit \nof everything —  throttle position, chassis flex, tyre flex, you're feeling all \nthat stuff. Spinning the rear relieves pressure on  the tyre, relieves pressure \non the suspension and that widens the safety area. But you're only spinning \nto  keep the bike turning, just to keep it on  track. There’s no  performance \nadvantage in spinning like speedway. I think McCoy will get better at  it, \nhe'll know where to spin and where not  to spin, whereas now he spins too \nmuch. Most of the  time you don’t want the  tyre to  spin much at  all, you \nwant it to drive maximum, you're always focused on  drive.’ \nBut there are  times when getting truly, madly, deeply sideways does \nhave its uses. ‘I used to do it just to piss off the guys behind me  because \nthey couldn’t do it. It was just intimidation.’ \nRainey reckons that rear-wheel steering will always be  around \nbecause traction control won't work in bikes (but time has  proved him \nwrong). ‘The tyre contact patch is so  small in bikes and that’s what you \nrely on. You need to  control that contact patch, you don’t want a \ncomputer controlling what the  tyres are  going to  do because they’re so \nmuch less forgiving than in a car,  and on  a bike you're always changing \nlean angle and so  on.  Plus, in a car  you spin, but  a bike throws ya.’ \nMick Doohan: oversteer, understeer, wobbling free \nMany fans will always remember Mick Doohan for his  artful, crossed-up \ncorner exits, etching arcs of molten rubber on racetracks around the world. \nBut  The Mighty One insists he wasn’t a  total rear-wheel steerer. In fact  it \nwas his  input during the 1990s that brought emphasis back to  the  front \ntyre, and the Aussie’s deadliest weapon was always high corner speed. \n‘My first roadrace stuff was production racing and when the  bike \nstarted to break traction, I found it was quicker to keep it sliding rather \nthan not  keep it sliding. After dirt track, I’d  tip the bike into a turn and \nexpect it to  go  sideways, so  it wasn’t a  problem when it did. \n‘Then \nwhen \nI \nfirst \nstarted \n500s, \nthe  \nHonda’s \nengine \nwas \npretty \nwild, \nso \nthe \nfastest \nway \nout \nof \na \nturn \nwas \na \nbit \nsideways, \nrather \nthan \nrunning \nout \nof \nracetrack. \nBut \nonce \nthe \ntyres \ngot \nbetter, \nthe \nquickest \nway \nwas \nto \nkeep \nthe \nbike \nin \nline. \nYou’d \nonly \nstart \nsliding \nand \nspinning \nit \nup \nMahe \ntyres \nwere \ngoing \naway. \nWhen \nit \ncomes \ndown \nto \nit, \nthe \nreality \nis \nthat \nsideways \nisn’t \nquickest, \nand \nI \nwanted \nto \nwin \nraces, \nnot \nlook \ngood, \nso \nI \nonly \nused \nit \nwhen \nI \nhad \nto."

Also, having the  rear spinning feels \nsafer, rather than having the  tyre on  an  edge where you don’t know \nwhen it’s  going to break loose.’ \nThe five-time champ reckons he was more of a drifter than a serious \nsideways merchant. ‘I was more into the drifting slides, rather than the \nactual “get in,  turn it and wheelspin it out” stuff. I was always into \ncorner speed, so  a lot of my slides came from that —  the bike would start \nto  drift and I’d just keep it drifting, laying black lines from lean angle. \n‘If you’ve got  great grip, there’s no  need to  slide around and get  the \nbike unsettled. But once the  tyres start losing grip, the  momentum \nyou're carrying through a  turn makes them drift, and other than \nslowing your corner speed by  shutting the throttle, which will slow \nyour lap  times, you start slowly feeding in  the  power to  take some \nweight off  the  front, which keeps the  rear sliding and also introduces \nsome wheelspin. So  you keep that going, but not to  a  degree where \nyou're completely sideways, sitting there spinning and burning rubber, \nlooking fantastic but  not  going forward.’ \nDespite his  insistence that McCoy’s fully sideways antics aren’t the \nway forward, Doohan agrees with Roberts that mastery of the  rear is \nvital. ‘If  you’re confident enough to  slide when the  bike or  the  tyres \naren’t working at  their optimum, then you’ve got  an  advantage. A lot \nof guys can  slide the rear when they've got good grip but when the  tyre \nloses its  edge they don’t know the  limit. You’ve got  to  have the  feel to \nride the tyre and use  throttle control to  spin it up just enough, so  you’re \ngoing forward, not  just smokin’ rubber.’ \nGarry McCoy: there’s sideways, and then there’s sideways \nSerious sideways antics seemed to  have disappeared from 500 racing \nuntil Garry McCoy came along in  late 1999. The ex-speedway rider \nfound that the only way he  could ride his  YZR500 was oval-style, \noversteering like crazy, smokin’ the  rear like a  bastard. So  much so \nMcCoy has  choked rivals on  the  fumes. ; \n‘We went testing at  Estoril and Noriyuki Haga hadn’t been there \nbefore so  I said he  could tuck in  behind me,’ recalls McCoy with a \nmischievous chuckle. ‘I  gave him a little wave to  say  “come on,  let’s \ngo”, \nthen \ndid \ntwo \nor \nthree \nlaps, \nlooked \nback \nand \nhe \nwasn’t \nthere. \nBack"

You start off at half throttle and just play \nwith it from there, it’s  a  feel and experience thing. In  roadracing it’s \ndifferent at every track, at  every corner and sometimes from one  lap to \nthe  next. It depends on  the  type of turn, whether you’re alone or  with \nother riders, all that kind of stuff.’ \nDespite the extremity of  McCoy’s slides, he  initiates them like \nDoohan, with corner speed rather than throttle. ‘It  starts when you're \ncarrying a lot  of corner speed and the  rear starts washing out. The real \nbuzz is  getting the rear loose as  I back it  into the turn, keeping it \nsideways all  the  way through and all  the  way out. But I never —  and I \nknow I shouldn’t say this —  feel  out  of control with the rear. If I’m  going \nto  crash I always feel like I’m  gonna crash with the  front.’ \nMcCoy’s antics do indeed look crazy —  especially in 2003 when he was \nracing Kawasaki's MotoGP bike on  Dunlops —  but  there’s a method in his \nmadness. ‘Once the  rear is loose I spin it up  to  help get  the  bike turned \nand then I can also adjust my  corner exit line with the  throttle. If I’m \ngoing to run wide, I give it more throttle, if  I want to  go wider, I use  less \nthrottle. I use  it on  some turns more than others. If it’s  a corner followed \nby a long straight, I’ll want to  get more drive so  I don’t use  it so  much.’ \nMcCoy has  found that perfecting the  sideways art  isn’t just a matter \nof riding style —  bike set-up and tyre choice are  also crucial. ‘When I \nstarted riding the  500  it would spin up but we  didn’t have the  set-up to \nmake it work with spin. The rear will spin easier with a hard spring but \nyou don’t get  drive, so  we've just kept going progressively softer ever \nsince.’ \nMcCoy \nalso \nuses \ndifferent \nignition \nmapping \ncompared \nto \nfellow \nYamaha \n500 \nriders \nlike \nMax \nBiaggi, \nbecause \nhe \nlikes \na \nsharper \npower \ndelivery to  keep the  rear nice and loose. \nIntriguingly, \nMcCoy’s \nstyle \nmakes \nhis  \nrear \ntyre \nrun \ncooler \nthan \nhis \nrivals’, \nwhich \nmeans \nhe  \ncan \nrun \nmuch \nsofter \ncompounds, \nbut \nhow \ncan \nthis \nbe \nwhen \nhe \nappears \nto \nbe \ngiving \nhis  \nrear \nso  \nmuch \ngrief? \nIt’s  \nbecause \nthe \ntyre \nis \nspinning \nrather \nthan \ndigging \nin, \nso \nwhile \nsurface \ntemperature \nis \nhigher \nthan \nnormal, \nthere’s \nnot \nso \nmuch \nheat \ndriven \ninto \nthe \nall- \nimportant core of the  tyre."

In fact, smallness \nin itself is the  major bonus of being small. It means a  tight-knit team \nof engineers, short lines of communications and quick decision making. \nAnd since speed off  the  track is  vital for  speed on  the track, Ducati \nCorse have a very crucial advantage over the  corporate giants. \n‘If we  have a problem with something that we  don’t understand, we \nphone Loris (Capirossi) and he’s at  the  factory half an  hour later, and \nthe next day we  start designing a  new part,’ explains Ducati’s chief \nMotoGP engineer Corrado Cecchinelli. ‘I think the only other difference \nbetween us  and the  Japanese is that we  design the  bike and race the \nbike, while it looks to  me  that with them, maybe someone designs the \nbike and someone else races it.”  Domenicali adds: ‘With Ducati, the \nsame people who are  at  the  race on  Sunday are  back in  the  office on \nMonday, so  we  are  more like an  F1  car  team than a \nbike race team, which means we  can  be very quick in \n‘Ducati’s racing making improvements.’ \nphilosophy: This is the kind of thing that can  have a huge effect \nsimplicity, not on  a  rider’s state of  mind and his  results.

It’s  all  about assembling a \ngood crew of young and open-minded engineers who can work together, \nthen letting them get  on  with it, rather than making the  mistake that \nmany enterprises make these days —  trying too  hard and out-thinking \nthemselves, because they've failed to  understand the  basics of what’s \nrequired to achieve their goal. \nWhich explains why Ducati are  steadfastly sticking to  what they \nknow best. True, they had to  ditch plans to  build an  oval-pistoned \nv-twin MotoGP bike, because even a  super-trick twin wouldn’t make \nenough power, but they’re still flying in  the face of  conventional \nMotoGP wisdom with a desmodromic 90-degree V4 housed in a tubular- \nsteel frame. This is significant because no  one has  ever made a  success \nof doing things differently to the Japanese in the premier class. The last \nnon-Japanese factory to win in  500s was Cagiva, who achieved success \nby building a Yamaha YZR clone.

      "text": "210 THE FAST STUFF \nBut  it is in the  chassis department that Ducati have really gone their \nown way. While rivals stay faithful to  the  ubiquitous aluminium beam \nframe pioneered in  the  early 1980s by Yamaha’s 500  GP  bikes, Ducati \nprefer to  stick with an  apparently archaic concept —  welding together a \nfew lengths of tubular steel. Once again, it’s  a  tradition thing. ‘We are \nconfident with this kind of frame, it’s  our  tradition,’ says Cecchinelli. \n‘Plus it’s  light enough and it’s  stiff enough, so  why go with something \nelse? I’m  sure we’re better staying with what we  know.’ \nAlthough Ducati’s ultra-minimal steel frame looks old fashioned, \nthere’s plenty of evidence to  suggest that it might actually be  superior \nto  a chunky beam chassis. Stiffness is not  everything in bike racing — \nengineers want their frames to  flex in certain situations, most crucially \nmid-corner, where ultra-high lean angles prevent the  suspension from \nworking effectively, contributing to  chatter, and on  corner exits, where \nthe  right amount of flex can smooth out  a rear-tyre slide. \nYou only need to  examine the  wacky twin-shock Yamaha M1 from \n2002, complete with ‘anti-chatter’ dampers, to  realise that the Japanese \nare  heading up  some weird alleys in their efforts to  sort chatter and flex \nproblems. There seems to be a fundamental contrast in philosophy here: \nwhile Ducati keep it dead simple, maybe Yamaha are  thinking too  hard. \nIt would be easy to  slump into national stereotypes here, suggesting \nthat the  Italians are  more intuitive in  their approach to  racing, while \nthe Japanese are  deeply scientific, maybe too  scientific. But  that would \nbe nonsense —  Ducati are  every bit  as  scientific as  their Japanese rivals. \nAnd yet  maybe their engineers are  more pragmatic or  more down to \nearth than some Japanese engineers, whose obsession with pushing \nthings forward can sometimes lead them up  development cul-de-sacs. \nPragmatism might not  be considered a  typical Latin characteristic, but \nDucati have definitely got  it,  and they’ve blended it well with their \nItalian passion and love of heritage. \nOf  course, we  are talking slightly out of  turn here, because the \nDesmosedici has yet to  turn a  wheel in  anger. Testing isn’t racing, \nhowever many lap  records you break, and Ducati are  very aware of \nbeing over-confident at  this stage. As  Cecchinelli says: ‘Always \nremember, you only get  points at  races! I think we’ve done well to  be \ndoing such good lap times so  soon, but  I’m  not  surprised because our \naim was to  be  competitive as  soon as  possible. We  want to  fight for \npodium results but this  season won’t be easy —  there are  so many factory"

Racing is  all  about how \neverything fits  together, it’s  about work, dedication and a little luck.’ \nDuke of balance: How Ducati adapted from WSB to MotoGP \nThe Desmosedici is Ducati’s first full-on, big-bore racing bike in  three \ndecades. Ever since the 1970s the Bolognese have made their name \nwith street-based racers, from the  GT750-based Imola winner of  1972 \nto  the World Superbike-conquering 916. Racing MotoGP prototypes \nshould be a very different deal but MotoGP engineer Corrado Cecchinelli \ndoesn’t believe there’s such a great difference between Superbikes and \nMotoGP machines. \n‘I  wouldn't say, for  example, that the  MotoGP bike brakes harder,’ \nsays Cecchinelli. ‘Because braking is  down to  geometry, even many \nstreetbikes have enough braking power to  lift  the  rear wheel, so  it’s  a \ncase of how low  you can  get  the bike. The only real difference between \nMotoGP carbon brakes and Superbike steel brakes is that the  carbons \nare  lighter. \n‘The difference is  that MotoGP bikes are  lighter and much more \npowerful, so  the game is to exploit all the  advantages from having such \na big amount of horsepower. You can  do everything with chassis set-up \nin  search of more acceleration, but  then maybe the  bike won’t handle \nany more, so  that’s the  compromise you have to  make.’ \nIn  fact Ducati don’t believe in  incorporating too  much adjustability \ninto their race chassis, rather like Honda. They reckon that large changes \nto a bike’s set-up only makes its handling unfamiliar to  the rider, which \nmeans he won’t know what to  expect, which means he won't have the \nconfidence to  push to  the  very edge. \n‘It’s better to  think deeply about what you are  doing, find a  good \ncompromise, \nand \nleave \nit \nlike \nthat \nall \nseason,’ \naffirms \nCecchinelli. \n‘The \ngeneral \nconclusion, \ngoing \nfrom \nthe \nsuccess \nof \nHonda \nand \nourselves, \nis \nthat this is the  right way.’ \nCecchinelli \nconsiders \nthe \ncurrent \nDesmosedici \nto  \nbe  \nextremely \nconventional \n— \na \nstrong \npoint \nat \nthis \nstage \n— \nbut \nit \nwon’t \nstay \nlike \nthat"

Already \nthe  dominant performer in World Superbike, Ducati was attracted to  the \nnew championship because, unlike the streetbike-based Superbike series, \nMotoGP demands prototype machines, allowing engineers to experiment \nwith avant-garde technology that will help Ducati maintain its edge as  a \nhugely successful manufacturer of high-performance streetbikes. \nSince the 1970s Ducati has been renowned for  its  range of v-twin \n(with L-shaped configuration) desmo sports machines that have won \nfans all-over the  world. Created by celebrated engineer Fabio Taglioni, \nDucati’s early 750GT and 900SS v-twins scored unforgettable successes \nin  the  Imola 200 and the  Isle of  Man TT.  In  the  late 1980s the  air- \ncooled, two-valve v-twins were replaced by a liquid-cooled, four-valve \nv-twin, designed by Massimo Bordi, which scored victories at  Daytona \nand in the  inaugural World Superbike event."

It is the Zen-like psychological state of grace that every \nracer craves \nWhen you peel away the  layers that make up  the  sport of motorcycle \nracing, you go  through a  lot  of  flesh and metal —  engine power, \nsuspension set-up, tyre choice, riding technique, physical fitness and \nbravery, all of them quantifiable to  some extent. Then, if you look deep \nenough, you'll sometimes find something else, something much hazier, \nless easy to  define, let  alone quantify.

There are certain \nprocedures \nyou \ngo \ncan \nthrough \nin \nan \neffort \nto \nencourage \nflow \n— \nmost \nnotably meditation and visualisation —  but they’re far from guaranteed, \nfor normal mortals at  least. As  sports psychologists say  of the  zone: ‘It \nis indeed a place, but a map won’t get you there’. \nI experienced flow maybe three times during my  ten-year racing \ncareer, and each of those episodes is still vividly clear in my mind. They \noccurred at Brands Hatch, Spa Francorchamps and the Island, and each \ntime I was riding effortlessly beyond my normal limits. British Superbike \nchampion Steve Hislop reckons he  may feel the  flow three times a \nseason, while five-time 500  king Doohan reckons he had it pretty much \nevery time he raced. So was it the  Aussie’s ability to  feel  the  flow that \nmade him arguably the  greatest racer of all time? Perhaps. \nHislop describes his  flow experiences thus: ‘You have those moments \nwhen you think “Fuckin’ hell, I’m  on  it here”, but  it’s  cool, it’s  dead \nrelaxing and peaceful. You're just spot on,  faster than ever and you're \nnot even breaking into a  sweat. It’s  a  nice feeling when you get  it, if \nthey could only bottle the  stuff so  you could guzzle it...’ \nDoohan’s great rival Wayne Rainey also enjoyed some flow moments. \nIn  fact Mike Sinclair, the engineer who fettled Rainey’s Marlboro \nYamahas, reckoned that Doohan and Rainey were the  only ones who \ncould ‘get in  that headspace where they are  100  per  cent fast. Some \nguys don’t have a  problem getting there every time they ride, guys like \nWayne and Mick, others find it harder.’ Sinclair wasn’t aware of flow at \nthe time, but he  knew something spooky was going on  inside these \nguys’ heads. \nRainey still has  memories of flow, bright as  a button in his  mind, one \nof which manifested itself as  an  out-of-body experience. This is nothing \nunique —  Fl  legend Ayrton Senna reported a  similar experience at \nMonaco in  ’88. ‘I won over 20  GPs and there’s only a  few that stand \nout,’ says Rainey, 500 champ in  1990, ’91  and ’92. ‘Some were really \nstrange, some were a lot  of fun and some were a lot  of work.

I \nwas thinking: “Man, he’s gonna take off!”, then I caught him, passed \nhim and pulled out  a  bit. I was the  only guy on  Dunlops and my tyres \nwent off a little, so  I was able to  slow down some, cool the tyres off, drop \nback to  fourth, then make another charge towards the  end. Normally \nyou can’t do  things like that in  a  race, you’re normally flat  out  all  the \nway, but  I was able to  exploit the  advantage I had with the  tyres, and \nthat’s what won me  the  race. I knew I had a  performance advantage \nwith the  tyres, just from the  way I could manoeuvre the  bike, put  it in \ndifferent areas of the  corner and kinda intimidate everybody and enjoy \nthat. It was like turning around and sticking your tongue out  at  them, \nthat’s the way I felt. When you  can  think that way and you're in a world \nchampionship race, when there’s so  much on  the  line, I was just feeling \nlike  a kid. I was thinking: “This is not  meant to be this much fun!” \nRainey’s Suzuka experience tallies with research by  psychologist \nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the  man who first investigated flow in  the \nearly 1970s. He  surmised from thousands of interviews that flow is ‘a \ncommon subjective experience of pleasure, interest and even ecstasy, \nderived from activities that perfectly match one’s skills with the \ndemands for  performance’. Rainey’s talents were obviously entirely \nmatched to what he was required to  do. \nDean Miller, Rainey’s trainer during his  GP  years, recalls another \nmoment of Rainey flow. This was at  the  ’93  Czech GP.  the  race which \npreceded the crash that ended his career. ‘Very inexplicably Wayne took \noff,  passed everybody and won by six  or  seven seconds,’ says Miller. \n‘Afterwards he couldn’t remember anything that had happened during \nthe  race, he  talked about music and tunes going through his  head, all \nthese strange processes going on,  and the  race came so  easy. It was a \nvery strange race to  him, but  very successful, very satisfying and very \nethereal, in a kinda “out there” way. That’s the so-called Zen-like feeling \nyou get  in  the zone. Flow can also happen in  training, I call them \n“golden days”, when you can  run  forever and you don’t get  tired.’ \nSo  extreme is  the sensation of  flow that Rainey found it  slightly \ndisconcerting recalling these moments for  this story. ‘Thinking about"

Doohan has \nexperienced flow, even an  out-of-body moment, but  he’s more prosaic \nabout it  in  his  archly down-to-earth Aussie way. ‘People talk about \nRainey and Senna having those out-of-body moments, and it’s  exactly \nWhat you feel, you definitely visualise yourself from the outside,’ \nDoohan says, going on  to  explain his  theory behind the saved-the- \nslide-before-you-even-had-it feeling. ‘I  think it’s because you've \nbasically gone through the  turn before you've actually gone through it, \nso  you’ve imagined what could happen before you come across it,  so \nyou're well prepared for,  say, the  front to  push. You think the  front’s \ngoing to  push because of  how much speed you're carrying going in \nthere, or  you think the  back’s going to  break away mid-turn because \nyou're carrying a bit too  much momentum in the  middle of the  corner. \nSo  you catch the  slide as  it’s  happening, because you’re well prepared \nfor it, you basically know it’s  going to  happen. You're that far ahead of \nthe  game that everything is in  slow motion, but it’s  not  even in  slow \nmotion, your thought processes have just gone through what’s going to \nhappen or  what could happen.’ \nNow you know why Doohan was so  astonishingly good —  he  had \neverything worked out  in advance. ‘Putting a  lap together is all  about \nbeing prepared for  the  next corner before you approach it.  It’s  not  so \nmuch visualisation, you just know what’s coming up,  you know what \nneeds to  be done. Flow happened most of the  time to  me. Whenever I \nwas on  top of  it,  things would seem to  slow down, but that’s just \nbecause I was in the  rhythm and riding all the  time, so  it seemed slow. \nIf  I were to  hop on  a  motorcycle now, everything would happen about \nfive times quicker!’ \nBut  while Doohan tends to dismiss any  otherworldly explanations of \nthese \nstrange \nforces, \nhe \nworked \nhard \nduring \nhis \ncareer \nto \nutilise \nthem \nto \nhis \nadvantage. \nDuring \nGP \nweekends \nhe \nwas \nknown \nto \nbe \ndistant \nand \nuncommunicative, \nalmost \nto \nthe \npoint \nof \nrudeness. \nThis \nwas \nsimply \nhim \ndoing \nwhat \nmost \npro-sportsmen \ndo \nto \nget \nin \nthe \nzone—concentrating \non \nhis \nown \nlittle \nworld \nwithin \nwhich \nhe \nwas \nrelaxed, \ncalm, \nself- \nconfident \nand \nfocusing \non \nbike \nand \ntrack. \nAny \nother \noutside \ndistractions \n— \njournalists, \nfans, \npretty \nmuch \nanyone \n— \nwere \nunwelcome. \n‘From \nthe  \ntime \nI \narrived \nat  \nthe  \ncircuit \nit \nwas \nall  \nabout \nthe  \nrace, \njust"

Basically I’d think \nabout the race completely, so when I got on  the bike I was pretty relaxed. \nIt was much more intense getting ready. I enjoyed that part of my career \n—  those one  or  two hours before the  race by myself. It was very intense \nand very exciting. But it was also a lot  of work, a lot of commitment, a \nlot  of dedication and desire. You give up  a whole lot  for  that.’ \nRainey isn’t the only rider to  have psyched himself up  on  his \nmotorhome hi-fi. This is  Hislop: ‘You’ve got  to  get  away from people \nprior to  racing.

It was Roberts’ first four-stroke roadrace. ‘We were \nstruggling about a  second and a half off  pole,’ recounts Miller. “So  one \nlunchtime \nKenny \nsays: \n“let’s \ngo \nback \nto \nthe \nhotel”. \nHe \ntold \nme \nnot \nto \nlet \nanyone \nknock \non \nthe \ndoor, \nhe \ndidn’t \nwant \nanyone \nbothering \nhim. \nSo \nhe’s \nlaying \nflat \non \nthe \nbed, \ndoing \nlap \nafter \nlap \nafter \nlap \nfor \nabout \n50 \nminutes, \nthen \nhe \ngets \nup \nand \nsays \n“I’ve \nfound \nit, \nI’ve \nfound \nhalf \na \nsecond \nhere \nand \na \nsecond \nthere”. \nWe \ngo \nback \nover \nto \nthe \ntrack \nand \nhe \nqualifies \non \npole, \njust \nlike \nthat. \nKenny \ncould \nvisualise \nbetter \nthan \nanyone.’ \nVisualisation \nis \na \nkind \nof \nmeditation; \nit’s  \nlike  \npractising \nin \nyour \nmind, \nas \nMiller \nexplains: \n‘If \nyou \nthink \nabout \nsomething \nlong \nenough, \nit’s \ngoing \nto \nhappen’. \nMaybe \nmost \npro \nracers \ndon’t \nprepare \nfor \nraces \nin \nthe \nlotus \nposition \nbut \nthey \nall \nhave \ntheir \nown \nmeditation \nrituals \n— \nRainey"

Or you watch \nbasketball players and some of them have to drink a special kind of water \nfrom a  special kind of bottle. You get  these crazy situations where guys \nare  trying to put themselves in that zone. Rossi’s process obviously works \nfor him, it’s  repetitive and it’s  in his best interests not  to change it. \n‘Racers have a whole lot of anxiety and pressure to deal with, especially \nsitting on  the grid. Everybody attacks that anxiety differently. If you look \nat  Kenny Junior he sits  on  the  line with his  arms folded, sunglasses on, \nearplugs in, head down —  he’s in a  focus zone, visualising something in \nhis  mind, which may include the  first lap. Whatever he  does works for \nhim, because he always gets a good start based on  that visualisation. \n‘Wayne listened to  rock ’n’  roll  to  engage himself and gear himself \nup. Eddie Lawson was a  little different, he’d sit  in  his darkened \nmotorhome and prepare his helmets; anybody who went in there would \nthink he  was a  caveman sitting in  the dark, but that was just his \nvisualisation process. Then there was John. People used to  think he \nwas a little crazy, which he was with his obsessive compulsive behaviour, \nbut all that cleaning was the way he alleviated his  anxiety to do his job. \nIt’s  all  about having a  specific routine before you do  whatever you’ve \ngot  to  do,  some sort of an  ambience going on.’ \nOf course, it’s  not  quite as  simple as  that. The process of preparation \ntakes much, much longer than an  hour or  two before the race. ‘It’s also \nyour background,’ continues Miller. ‘Your entire life goes into that \nprocess to get where you're at.  And it all comes together in one  moment \n—  that’s a lot of laps, a lot of practice, a lot of braking, a lot of cornering. \nAnd if it works, it just flows. It’s  an  ethereal situation of everything \ncoming together from everything you’ve ever accomplished and \neverything you’ve ever worked for.’ \nIn  other words, you only get  there through absolute commitment to \nthe  cause, withering self-discipline and total concentration.

I don’t think a  sports psychologist could \nmake any difference to  these guys because they’re already at  such a \nlevel, so  I don’t think there’s one person in our  paddock who needs a \nsports psychologist, and that includes John Kocinski. Back in  1990 \nKenny (Roberts, who successfully guided Kocinski to  that year’s 250 \nworld title) brought in  a  psychologist to  work with John because he \nthought the  kid  had a  problem with obsessive compulsive behaviour. \nThis guy  also said he thought John had a problem and I said: “Well I’m \nunder the impression that John’s here to  race motorcycles and he’s \nwinning everything and now you've alerted the  guy to  the  fact that \nhe’s got  a  problem”. So  I fired him. Kenny wanted to  know what was \ngoing on,  so  I told him: “I  know you think John’s strange but  did  you \never see  yourself lay down in a  motorhome and do  the  things you did \nto  prepare for  a  race?

Which could mean some big-buck sponsorship \nopportunities for MotoGP... \nSo,  coalition fighter pilots are  popping speed pills to  help them stay \nawake during military operations in  the  Middle East. Pretty mad, eh? \nSome guy, buzzing off his nut, scything across the  sky at mach two and \ncarrying enough munitions to  flatten a  small town. Gives a whole new \nmeaning to  the  phrase ‘war on  drugs’. \nBut  there’s no  cause for concern. Just so  long as  these knights of the \nsky are  administered the  correct dose of amphetamines, it’s  perfectly \nsafe, say the USAFE In  no  way whatsoever are these jet  jockeys \ncompromising their ability to  carry out  their duty, though this whole \nstory arises from an  Afghan campaign friendly-fire incident in which \nfour Canadian soldiers were killed by a  laser-guided bomb unleashed \nby an  F16 pilot who was on  USAF-administered amphetamines. The \nfact that it’s  illegal to  imbibe this drug at,  say, a Saturday night house \nparty, is irrelevant. As  is the  fact that dextro-amphetamine, the USAF’s \nusual stimulant of  choice, ‘may impair the ability of  the patient to \nperform potentially hazardous activities such as  operating machinery’. \nAnd, you'll also be  happy to  hear that speed is  only administered to \nrelieve pilots’ tiredness; the  drug is  absolutely not intended to  raise \ntheir aggression levels, although dextro-amphetamine’s known side \neffects do include agitation, irritability and moodiness. \nAnyway, this has got me thinking (always a  risky business). If \namphetamines make fighter pilots perform better, surely this  gear has  got \nto be good for motorcycle racing. Currently, performance-enhancing drugs \nare  banned from most sports, but  in the light of USAF evidence aren’t we \nperhaps being a little old-fashioned? A  few years back Fat  Boy Slim \nproclaimed better living through chemistry, now we  have (apparently) \nbetter bombing through chemistry, so  why not  better racing? \nI feel there’s every reason that MotoGP racing should take the  lead \nhere, since GP  bikes have so  much in  common with jets, as  Warren \nWilling, engineer to  500  world champ Kenny Roberts Junior once said: \n‘Dynamically, a bike is more like  a fighter plane than a car’. And doesn’t \nevery bike racer or  R1  rider half think he’s a jet-fighter pilot? And wasn’t \nthe first-ever 500  world champ —  Les  Graham —  a World War II pilot?"

Hayden \ndefinitely got a  lot  of  attention from the ladies in  his  debut world \nchampionship campaign, but, like most things in  life, the kid from \nKentucky seems to  take it all in his  shambling, loose-limbed stride. \nNot that his  attractiveness to  the  opposite sex  matters to anyone but \nhim, but what does matter is  that Hayden is  more than GP  racing’s \nnew pin-up, he  might just be GP racing’s new Eddie Lawson.

By the  very nature of \ntheir profession, racers have little or  no  patience, they want to  get \nwherever they're going —  whether it’s  to the  next corner or  to  their first \nworld championship —  as  fast as  they can, and damn the  consequences \nof getting it wrong. \nHayden sensibly used his 2003 MotoGP apprenticeship to  gain \nconfidence one step at  a  time: build some confidence, go  a bit  quicker, \nbuild some more confidence, go  a bit  quicker and so  on.  It’s  the  same \nstrategy that Lawson used when he came to GPs in the early 1980s, and \nthough it  doesn’t grab overnight headlines, it  has created a  solid \nfoundation on  which Hayden should be  able to  build in  subsequent \nseasons when he  know the tracks, the bikes and the tyres. True, \nHayden’s 2003 results aboard the RC211V weren’t as  strong as  Lawson’s \ndebut season aboard Yamaha YZR500 in 1983, but GP racing is different \nthese days. Back in  Lawson's day there was just a  handful of factory \nbikes, now they’re all  factory bikes, with the  top  ten separated by less \nthan a  second. That’s why Hayden didn’t set  MotoGP on  fire, but  those \nin the  know were impressed by his  slow-burn campaign, because they \nlooked deeper than mere results, noting that his  race pace was often \nwithin half a  second of Rossi’s during the  closing stages of the  season. \nAt  Motegi, where he  scored his  first top-three finish, he  finished just \nfive seconds behind winner Max Biaggi. \nAnd unlike most quick kids, he  doesn’t crash. Hayden fell just four \ntimes in 2003, despite having to  learn his  way around a new bike, new \ntracks and new tyres. Compare that record to  Nori Haga (15  crashes), \nJeremy McWilliams (11), Alex Barros (10) and Marco Melandri and \nTroy Bayliss (9). As  Rossi’s crew chief Jeremy Burgess says: ‘Hayden is \nthe  stand-out guy this year. He’s not  shown me  anything that suggests \nhe won’t make it all the way to  the  top. He’s a little bit not  right on  his \ncorner entries but  he’s got  good machine control. He’s impressive.’ \nOff-track, Hayden’s and Lawson’s parallel lines peter out. Whereas \nLawson never appeared to enjoy his racing, from the outside at least, and \nresented the  media big-time, Hayden had the  time of his  life during the \nsummer of 2003 and doesn’t mind talking about it. His  is a new attitude \nthat pervades the GP paddock; the latest generation of pro-GP racers like \nHayden, Rossi, Bayliss, Edwards, Gibernau and Co  take their racing just \nas  seriously as  men like  Lawson, but  they’re having a lot more fun.

I’ve \nhad to  prove I’m serious, that I’m  not  going to  lay down just because a \ncouple things didn’t go my way. I just kinda regrouped, I decided I’ve  got \nto have more fun riding and not  be so  hard with myself —  just go out  and \ndo the best I can. That was on  Friday night at Barcelona. I lay in bed  and \nthought it all over, and from there each race has  been better and better. \nAt the beginning of the year I was really lucky to have so many people \nhelping me  but  maybe it caused me  to  think too  much.

That’s \nwhat I do now —  I’m  still serious, I’m  still focused, but  sometimes you’ve \njust got  to  do what comes natural and let it rule. \nHow have Tady and Mick helped? \nWhen I was struggling those guys were really cool about not  being too \nhard on  me, just being honest. Also, they’ve helped at  some of  the \ntracks I’d  never been to, just telling me  what to  expect, what to watch \nfor.  Like at  Assen, it started raining on  race day and I only got  one lap \nin the  wet before the  race. They were like  ‘Hey, this track’s good in the \nwet, you can  push, but  it does puddle here or  there’. So  they’ve helped \nwith that kinda thing. \nDo you  have access to Valentino's set-up? \nA little bit.  I’m  sure if it came to  it I could maybe get  everything but \nthat’s not  how my  team works. Sometimes if I’m not sure what tyre \nI’m  gonna race on;  I'll  be like ‘What’s happening here?’ to  JB  (Jeremy \nBurgess, Rossi's crew chief), ‘What does Valentino think about this or \nthat tyre?’ but I’ve hardly done that any.

Tech chats with Bayliss tend to  go  like this: \n‘Troy, what’ve you been working on?’ ‘The bike, mate.’ ‘What areas \nexactly?’ ‘All of it.’  ‘Front or  rear?’ ‘Ah Jeez, the  front.’ ‘Suspension, \ntyres, what?’ ‘Ah, just the  whole front, mate.’ \nWhen it  comes to  talking about his  motorcycle, Edwards is  the \nopposite; \nhe’s \nhappy \nto \nget \ninvolved \nin \ndeep \ntechnical \nchat \nwhile \nwife \nAlyssia \nchanges \nbaby \nGracie’s \nnappies \non \nthe \nnext \ncouch \nin \ntheir \nmotorhome. \nAnd \nno \none \nknows \nhow \nto \nget \ntheir \npoint \nacross \nbetter; \nthis \nis \nhow \nhe \ndescribes \nwhat \nit’s \nlike \nto \nride \nhis \nAprilia \nMotoGP \nbike: \n‘You \ntake \na \nbull, \nyou \ncut \noff \nits \nballs, \nyou \ndangle \nthem \nin \nfront \nof \nits \nface, \nthen \nyou \nclimb \non \nits \nback’. \nJust \nlike \nhis \nold \nWorld \nSupers \nrival, \nEdwards \nis \nfor \nreal, \nhe’s \nfar \ntoo \nmuch \nof \na \nreasonable \nhuman \nbeing \nto \nlet \nhimself \nbecome \na \nMotoGP \narse. \nMost \nimportantly, \nhe \ndoes \nlike \na \nbeer \nor \nfive \nwhen \nhe’s \nnot \nriding. \nAt \nthe \n2002 \nValencia \nGP \n(some \ntime"

Then there’s the nastier tactics —  like \nshutting the  throttle halfway through a  corner to  force someone into \ntaking drastic avoiding action, thus losing them vital time. And then \nthere’s the  seriously dangerous stuff — like  running a rival onto the  grass \nat  high speed, or  deliberately colliding with them, or  hitting their kill \nswitch, or  shutting their throttle, or  punching or  kicking them. \nEven legends like King Kenny Roberts and Mick Doohan happily \nadmit to  getting dirty.

He  insists that he  never \nknocked anyone off when he was doing GPs, but  the hard-knocks dirt- \ntrack scene in  the  States was different. ‘One time going through this \nturn I felt this guy’s clutch lever on  my right foot, so  I just gassed it and \nflipped him off,’ says the  King who won a  heap of dirt-track crowns \nbefore taking back-to-back 500 titles in  1978, \"79  and ’80. ‘He came \nover after and wanted to  know why I'd  knocked him down and I said, \n“Well, the  reason I knocked you down is that you put your clutch lever \non  my  foot”, so  he  started shouting that I’d  knocked him down and I \nsaid, “Yeah, and next time you do that I’ll knock you down again”. You \nknow, it’s  just one of the  things, if anyone does something like that to \nyou, well, sorry... But normally it’s  the  guys who aren’t so  quick who \nhave all  the  tricks, the  quick guys don’t need them so  much.

I never even thought about it, other than that time Freddie \naced me  off the  track in Sweden (an infamous move that won Spencer \nthe  1983 500 title). I thought about doin’ something the  next race but \nI still couldn’t allow myself. Every guy has  his  style, every guy has  his \nbag of tricks, and when you race them enough you start to  learn who \ndoes what.’ \nFive-time 500 champ Doohan, who ruled the  mid-1990s GP  scene \nwith a pitiless talent, was renowned as  much for his ruthless aggression \nas  for  his  awesome skill. ‘I wouldn’t say  I’ve knocked people off  the \ntrack but  I’ve maybe “lifted” them off  the  track,’ he  says. ‘Like when \nsomeone thinks they can go  around the  outside, you just pick up  and \nmodify your line. They’re already committed, so  there’s only one place \nleft  to  go,  and that’s normally off  the  track. I guess it’s  a  good way to \nbring cocky people back to earth, just to let them know that it’s not  like \nthis is your first race.’ \nDoohan had a  couple of  famous run-ins with a  young Anthony \nGobert in ’97.  Goey had made the  mistake of goading Mighty Mick in \nthe press and he paid the price on  track. ‘As  much as  everyone thought \nGoey \nwas \nso \ngreat, \nhe \njust \nhad \nno \nracecraft \nback \nthen,’ \nDoohan \nrecalls. \n‘You'd \ndo \nquite \na \nclean \nmove \non \nhim, \nthen \nhe’d \ncome \nat \nyou \nfrom \na \ndifferent \nangle, \nso \nit \nwas \nlike, \n“Hello \nstupid, \ntry \nthis!”, \nand \nthe \nnext \nminute \nhe’d \nbe \noff \nthe \nracetrack. \nThen \nhe’d \ncome \nin \ncomplaining \nabout"

I just ran  into the  side of \nhim, we  both ran  off the  track and it cost us  first and second, which Rob \n(McElnea, their team manager) wasn’t too  impressed about!

      "text": "240 THE FAST STUFF \nEveryone always used to say that Mackenzie was too  nice to be world \nchampion. But  what about someone like Loris Capirossi, who won the \n98  250 world title by ramming Aprilia team-mate Tetsuya Harada off \nthe  track at the last but  one  corner of the last race? Capirossi is just like \nMackenzie —  sweet as  pie  off  a  bike, transmogrified on  track. That’s \nracers for  you —  it’s  a  Jekyll & Hyde deal. ‘Unless you’ve been a rider \nyou don’t understand the  red  mist thing,’ explains Mackenzie, who \nreckons the  Capirossi collision wasn’t premeditated. ‘He  could see  the \nchampionship going, so  he took a chance, sometimes there’s no  time to \ncalculate the consequences. At worst he probably thought they’d collide, \nrun wide and it’d  be  a  scramble to  the  finish line but the  red  mist \nconfused his  judgement. I don’t think it was a  desperate attempt to \ntake out  Harada.’ \nDoohan reckons he  was more victim than villain during his  career. \n‘I’ve been done by guys who put  you off  the  track even in a straight \nline,’ he  says. ‘They draft you and when they’re beside you they lean \ninto you, put  you on  the  white line, so  you’ve got  to  shut down, or  go \non  the  grass. (Wayne) Gardner did  that to  me  down the  front straight \nat Phillip Island in 1990, at around 290kays. He drafted past and started \npushing me  over. I had to  throw my  foot off the  inside ‘peg, it was the \nonly way to  shift some weight to  stop me  going off the  track. That was \npretty blatant. And (Luca) Cadalora ran  me  onto the  grass coming out \nof a  six-gear right-hander at  Shah Alam once, just ran up  beside me \nand actually pushed me  off  the track. I’d  never go  that far. I’d  say \nGardner, Cadalora and Biaggi were the  three worst guys I raced with. \nBiaggi even tries to  intimidate people on  slowdown laps.’ \nGardner angrily refutes Doohan’s version of events at  Phillip Island: \n‘To  suggest that I was a  dangerous rider is a  complete insult. I didn’t \ncome anywhere near him, I passed him fair and square, but  that’s when \nI had the  broken fairing, which was dragging on  the  road, and I had a \nbroken wrist, too. I remember quite clearly the bike wanting to  steer to \nthe left  down the hill. Maybe the  draft was bigger than normal because \nthe  fairing was half off,  in  fact I think they were thinking of black- \nflagging me  at  the  time.’ \nIntimidation is  the real deal. These mad stabs aren’t just about \nwinning a  position there and then, they’re about establishing a \nreputation with other riders. If everyone knows you're a nutter, they’re \nmore likely to get out  of your way, so  next time you’re on  track together,"

Sure, there’s \nplenty of times I scared the  hell out  of people, and if they ran  off  the \nracetrack that was their problem, but I’ve never intentionally put \nanyone off the  racetrack. It’s just a matter of keeping your position on \nthe  track, and perhaps modifying your position from where you'd be if \nthere was no  one else there, for  no  other reason than to  intimidate \nother guys and mess with their heads.

In fact both riders were censured for \nthat incident, because Rossi shouldn’t have been so  naive as  to  believe \nthat Biaggi would give him the space to  run past on  the  outside. In \nother words, this  is motorcycle racing —  you should know you're not  the \nonly maniac on  the track. Following that clash, FIM president Francesco \nZerbi wrote an  open letter to  the pair: ‘to reproach you  both, in order to \ninvite you to  more attentively and correctly control your actions and \nreactions, without taking anything away from your fighting instinct, \nyour desire for victory, your skill, your courage and the sporting qualities \nthat a  true champion shows to  all  the world.’ Yeah, right. Ten \nweeks later Rossi and Biaggi were boxing each other’s lights out  at  the \nCatalan GP... \nInvariably riders get  let  off  the  hook because most of  the  crimes \ncommitted on  track are  so  subtle, and because they’re very much a part \nof bike racing. After all,  it’s  the  ducking and diving, the  feints and the \nparries and the scary moments that make the  sport so  exciting to watch. \nFor  example, what Biaggi did  to  Rossi at  Suzuka is an  everyday ploy in \ntight situations. ‘Sometimes you don’t get  a  good drive out  of a  corner \nbut  you casually use  all  the  track even if you don’t need it,’  explains \nMackenzie. ‘You know the  guy behind may get  a  good drive and try to \ngo  round your outside, so  you use  all  the  track and the  kerb, because \nthere’s no  way they’re going to want to use the  grass.’ \nRiders use  a similar tactic on  the way into corners. Mackenzie again: \n‘You brake a little longer than normal, so  the  guy behind can’t turn in \nwhere he  wants to,  because you're still there braking. You just slow it \nall down, hit the apex as  normal, and the other guy has  to file in behind \nor  run  off the  track.’ \nSome riders do the  same kind of thing mid-corner —  just ease off the \nthrottle, so  whoever’s following has to  back off, run off  line and, er, \nmaybe crash. ‘I was never really guilty of that,’ says Mackenzie. ‘  But I \nknow a lot  of people who did  do it. Gardner definitely did, and I know \n(Eddie) Lawson gave him a  few warnings, told him the  next time he \ntried it he was going to be in big trouble. I remember Gardner doing it \nat  the  last  turn at  Laguna Seca because it’s  so  slow. You  just get off the \nthrottle and then get  back on  it,  the  bike pretty much stops and the \nother guy has to  pick up. It’s  not hugely dangerous but it  can cost \nwhoever a lot of time because they get off line and then they’re probably \nin too  tall  a gear. It’s  a dirtier tactic, I didn’t use  it because I felt  like  it"

But  it’s  very effective if it works.’ \nShifting rivals off  line is  even more effective nowadays, because \nroadracing has  become like  dirt  track, with a narrow grippy line, beyond \nwhich there’s little traction. ‘The thing is that bikes have got  a lot more \ngrip now, so you don’t get the variation in lines that you used to,’ explains \nRoberts. ‘You used to  be able to watch at  a chicane and say,  “That guy’s \ngot the right line and that guy  hasn't”, but now everyone’s got the  same \nline because they’ve all  got  so  much corner speed. So  there’s only one \npart of the  track being used —  maybe a metre or  a metre and a half —  and \nthe rest of the track isn’t so  grippy. So it’s like dirt track, where you've got \nthe  grippy notch. You see  a  guy coming and you just move out  to  the \nedge of the notch, and that leaves them nothing.’ \nAnd if that doesn’t work you can let  a  rival come alongside on  the \nstraight and just shut his  throttle.

He \nknew what motivated him, people winding him up  made him dig  in \neven more, so  he was really conscious of not  doing it to anyone else.’ \nMackenzie’s own brand of race psychology required him to be nice to \neveryone, whether he  was racing GPs or  BSB. ‘There’s two ways of \ndealing with rivals —  you either don’t speak to  them or  you’re mates. \nSomeone like John Reynolds wouldn’t be  rude but he  wouldn’t \ncommunicate, he’d just go away and get in his little shell.

It’s  all  about the  way he  carries himself, the  way he  looks, the \nway he  acts, the  company he  keeps, how much fun he  can handle. It \ndoesn’t necessarily matter what clothes he  wears or  which ladies he \nhangs out  with, but  the  right gear and the  right girl can make all  the \ndifference. Basically, he’s got to be the kind of guy  you’d want to  spend \na  night out with, the  kind of person who spreads a little fun around \nthe  place. \nHe  needs charisma, he’s got  to  be bright and funny, he’s got  to  have \nballs and he’s got  to  do  things his  own way —  simpering, sponsor- \nfriendly rentamouths don’t get a look-in here. He’ll require a love of the \ngood things in life —  partying, ladies, that kind of thing —  and he’ll need \nto  be  passionate about what he  does, not  robotic. Finally, he  needs a \ncertain I-don’t-give-a-fuck air  about him, and a  few bad habits will \nhelp as  well, but  that doesn’t mean he’s got to be an  asshole.

He  was \nproudly technophobic, with zero interest in  the  complexities of set-up. \nOnce asked by one of his  engineers: ‘What gear are  you in through turn \nfour?’, Hailwood replied: “I don’t know, how many gears has  it got?’ An \napocryphal tale  perhaps, but  certainly indicative of the man’s attitude. \nAlthough he was polite and good-natured, Hailwood was afraid of no \none. When he signed to Honda in ’66, he flew to Japan to test  the factory’s \nevil-handling 500 four. Appalled by the  bike’s wayward behaviour and \nunable to  properly explain his  feelings to  the  engineers, he  grabbed the \nbike’s rear shocks and lobbed them into the lake behind the  Suzuka pits. \nIn  his  later years Mike the  Bike had a  dash of loucheness about him, \nlike the rich man’s son  gone partying, which brought with it a spectacular \nfashion sense.

In  fact, like many \nparents of motorcycling kids, they did  the  opposite: they tried to  bribe \nhim to give it all up with the offer of a brand-new sports car.  Rich kid  or \nnot, Ago was determined to get his  two-wheel kicks, so  he turned down \nhis parents’ offer and used to  sneak out  of the house to compete in local \nhill climbs. In other words, he had the  coolness deep within him. \nA few years later he  was signed by Count Domenico Agusta to  ride \nfor  the  renowned MV Agusta marque. Ago and the  Count were the \nepitome of pre-summer-of-love 1960s cool —  a talented, smart-dressing \nyoungster funded by a  mega-rich aristocrat. And, of course, Ago was \ndesperately handsome, the  ladies swooning at  his  feet from Milan to \nthe  Isle  of Man. His  good looks and bravery won him massive fame in \nItaly, so  it was only a matter of time before some Italian director asked \nhim to play the  heartthrob in a couple of movies.

      "text": "256 THE FAST STUFF \nThere’s an  old  saying in  racing: if you’re not crashing, you're not \ngoing fast enough. Proof: The last rider to  win a world championship \nwithout crashing was Sito Pons, who lifted the  1989 250  crown without \nonce overstepping the  mark. And here’s another racing axiom, from \nthree-time 500  king Wayne Rainey: ‘If a  rider’s fast and he’s crashing, \nmaybe you can  stop him crashing, but if a rider’s slow, you’re not  going \nto  make him fast.’ In  other words, there’s no  racing without crashing. \nAnd if you ever go racing, you'll be crashing too. \nCrashes happens because racing is  all  about being faster than the \nnext guy, which means you’ve got  to  bend the  laws of physics to  your \nown will and thus exist on  the edge of  a  precipice. It’s therefore \ninevitable that you'll fall  over that precipice every now and again. \nBut what does crashing mean to a racer? Beyond the obvious physical \nagonies, what does it do  to  a  rider’s state of mind? And how do  they \nkeep coming back for  more while they’re still struggling with injuries \nand pumped full of painkillers? What follows is a veritable list of racing \nwreckers who really do  know what crashing is  all  about: 1987 500 \nchamp Wayne Gardner, former World Supers rider James Haydon, \n1960s pile-up legend Dave Croxford, MotoGP star  Carlos ‘Chuckitaway’ \nCheca and king of ’em all,  1993 500  champ Kevin Schwantz. \nWayne Gardner: the Digger who always dug deep \nSome racers are  always in the  headlines, sometimes for  all  the  wrong \nreasons. Wayne ‘Digger’ Gardner was one of  them —  if  he  wasn’t \ngrabbing daring 500 GP  victories, he  was usually incarcerated in  Dr \nCosta’s House of Pain, nursing another bunch of broken bones. That’s \nhow it went with WG: up  or  down, no  in between. \nGardner epitomises the rough-edged Antipodean racer —  frighteningly \nbrave, always up  for a fight and never one to  say  die. His  career peaked \nat  a  time when 500s were seriously nasty pieces of work —  horsepower \ndramatically outstripping tyre and chassis technology —  which kind of \nsuited his  give-it-heaps-and-hang-on-for-dear-life riding technique. \n‘The NSR500 was a  hunk of  shit in  the 1980s,’ says Gardner, who \nwon the  500 crown with Honda in  ’87. ‘The suspension wasn’t very \ngood, the  tyres weren’t that good and the  power came in  hard, so  it \nhighsided a  fair bit. There wasn’t a  lot  you could do.’ Not that this \nstopped him from giving it  big  handfuls: ‘You’re dedicated, you're \ncommitted, you're in that little world that all racers are  in, so  you have"

For  nine years he  raced \nSuzuki's notoriously fickle RGV500 which was never the  quickest 500. \nNot only that, it had borderline chassis performance —  get it right and \nit was the  sweetest-handling thing out  there, but  go  racing two clicks \nout on  the suspension settings and it was a vindictive piece of machinery, \napparently hell-bent on  flinging its rider to  the  ground. \n‘Most times I crashed I was trying to  figure a way to  go  faster and it \njust snuck up and got me. I'd be having problems getting the bike to do \neverything I wanted it  to  —  to  handle right and to  finish the corner \nexactly the  way I wanted —  so  I might try and go  in a bit  deeper to  get \nthe sharper part of  the  turning done early.’ Cue front-end crash. ‘Or \nmaybe it wasn’t finishing the  corner, so  I'd try to  steer it with the  back \nwheel coming out.’ Cue highside crash. \n‘T only remember a few  races where things worked really, really well. \nBut for the most part it was such a fine line to get a grand prix motorcycle \nworking right that I had to  ride 100  per  cent pretty much every corner, \nevery lap.’ \nWhatever his  bike worries, Schwantz was always unwilling to  give \nin, which is why he was such a big hit with the  fans. ‘There were a lot \nof times when I was following somebody thinking: “God he’s getting \naway, I gotta come up  with something, I gotta figure something out”, \nthat can sneak up  and get  you too. You're tryin’ to  do  something \non  newish tyres, where you've not really got  to  the  limit and figured \nhow much you can push the  front or  spin the  rear. Then the thing \nspins, snaps sideways, snaps back and throws you  off.  I was just a little \nover-anxious.’ \nBut however much he  crashed, Schwantz never angered his \nbosses to  the  point where they gave him the  flick, simply because they \nrealised that no  one could ride a  motorcycle quite as  hard as  he  could. \n‘I’m sure there were people in  the  team who got  angry with me, but I \nthink they realised that slapping my hand and telling me that if  I \never fell  again I wasn’t going to  race any more wasn’t the  way to  solve \nthe  problem.’ \nAnd yet  inevitably there came a  time when the  accidents did  begin"

Crox made his  name racing the  factory John Player \nNorton twin in an  age  when Yamaha’s scarily fast TZ  two-strokes were \nchanging the  face of racing. Remarkably he didn’t break a  single bone \nin those 14 seasons. That would be incredible these days, but back then, \nwhen riding gear was rudimentary and run-off often non-existent, it \nsmacked of some kind of God-given immortality, or perhaps a pact with \nthe  devil. No wonder fans called him ‘Rubber Bones’. \nNow well into his  60s, Croxford is very aware that he  got  off lightly \nat a time when fatalities were commonplace. ‘I’m one  of the lucky ones, \nno  aches or  pains, I’m  right as  rain,’ he  says, recalling that racers used \nto take the risks more lightly back then and damn the consequences. ‘It \nwas real good fun  in them days —  if it rained you sometimes popped in \nthe  bar  for a couple of pints of Guinness and then went out  to race.’ \nLike any racer, Croxford does have reasons for his  multitudinous get- \noffs, and not  all of them involve the consumption of intoxicating liquor. \n‘The TZs were coming out  then and they had loads of power, but the \nhandling wasn’t right, while the  Norton was great in corners but  slow \non  the  straights, so  I was always trying to make up  ground.’ \nMany of Croxford’s tumbles were comedy events. ‘I crashed at Brands \nwhile battling with Bazza (Sheene), I was sliding along on  my arse \nwaving at him, and he was waving back.’ Or one of his  two TT  crashes: \n‘This bloody great big pig comes out  and it’s  running alongside me...’ \nOf course, Crox lost plenty of mates who weren’t as  blessed as  him, \nbut somehow he  managed to  blank it  all  out. ‘Other blokes did get \nkilled, which made you  think “It  could be bloody me”, but  it’s  no  good \nbeing cautious because then you're not  going to  be up  the  front. No,  it \nnever used to  worry me, I lived for  racing, that’s all  I wanted to  do  — \nevery Wednesday I’d  bunk off  from work to  go  down to  Brands for \npractice. Sure, there’s many times it could’ve happened to  me  and I’d \nthink ’God, I was lucky there”, but  I’d just pick meself up,  bow to  the \ncrowd and that was that. Nah, don’t think about it —  just get  back on \nand ride.

In  other words —  the \nguy’s got balls of steel, very big balls of steel. \nThe Spaniard was one  of MotoGP’s bravest hoons. In  1998 he crashed \nheavily during British GP  practice and was helicoptered to  hospital \nwhere he  suffered a  relapse —  lying blind and partially paralysed for  15 \nhours. His  surgeons told him they weren’t sure whether he’d recover, \nbut six  weeks later he  was racing, and crashing, again. The following \nseason Checa quit Honda and joined Yamaha, falling 27  times before \nthe year was out; an  impressive achievement, but even more remarkable \nwas his  ability to  limp back to  the  pits, take his  number-two bike and \ncontinue at  the  same pace, or  even faster. Checa was unique in  this — \nmost riders begin to  ease the  throttle shut after a  dozen or  so  crashes. \nWell, you would, wouldn’t you? \nSo what was different about Checa? ‘I get a  good feeling by fighting \nthe  limits within myself and breaking down barriers,’ he  says. ‘When \nyou do  that and get  a  good result, you feel great.

Then, after you’ve jumped many times you lose the  fear and start to \nfeel  many things you didn’t feel  when you  were scared.’ \nOf  course, Checa knows there are  other consequences of  crashing \nbeyond inner feelings. ‘Crashing is shit for you, shit for the bike, shit for \nthe mechanics and shit for the set-up. It’s  a signal that you’re heading in \nthe  wrong direction. You want to  win but  crashing is the  opposite. It’s \nlike being in  France when you want to  go  to  England and when you \ncrash you go to  Spain. That way you'll never get to England!’ \nCheca admits that he  has been freaked by some crashes. ‘All riders \nhave scary moments, except when you're on  a  confidence high. When \npeople talk about riders losing confidence it’s  just that scary feeling \naffecting you, it’s chemicals in your brain. The worst crashes are  the ones \nyou can’t explain —  because then you don’t know what to change. If you \nknow you braked too  deep into a turn, then you can  change that, or if the \nfront end’s wrong, you can change that, but if you don’t know what \nwent wrong, it’s  hard to  get  back on  and go  to  the  limit again.’ Checa \nblames most of his  crashes on  his  Yamaha’s tendency to  lose the  front \nmid-corner. ‘You get off the  brakes and go  to  open the  gas, which shifts \nweight to  the rear tyre and suddenly you’ve got no  front-tyre contact.’ \nJames Haydon: ‘There’s been times I’ve over-ridden a bike’ \nJames Haydon was one of those riders with a  bit  of a  reputation for \ncrashing too  much, and like  most other riders who carry the  stigma, he \ndoesn’t think he really deserves it. \n‘I’ve crashed a bit but  I’ve  rarely been on  the  best equipment, which \nmeans you've got  to  push a  bit  harder,’ explains the  former BSB, WSB \nand 500  rider. ‘Riding like that might’ve caused me  a  few crashes but \nit’s  also given me  a  few wins I wouldn't otherwise have had. The only \ntime I’ve  had a bike that matched everything else out  there was the  Red \nBull Ducati in  2000. Getting on  that thing was like “Wow!”, I didn’t \nhave to  over-ride it, so  I hardly crashed it at  all.’ \nHaydon cheerfully admits that he’s one of those riders who doesn’t \nknow when to let his  discretion get the better of his valour. ‘I don’t like \ngetting beaten, but  sometimes you've got  to  use  the  clever bit  in your \nhead, so  if you’re struggling to  stay with someone because they’ve got \na better set-up or  a faster bike, maybe you should see  that and settle for"

It’s not \ndifficult to  see  their logic: after all,  what’s the  point of risking your \nneck to  finish 11th instead of  12th? ‘Maybe guys like that are \nmore clever than me,’ adds Haydon. ‘I want to  do  the  best I can, so \nthere’s been times I’ve over-ridden a bike, but  now I’m  starting to  look \nat  it differently.’ \nHaydon had two crashes in  his  last few years of racing that alerted \nhim to  his  own mortality —  a crunching highside at  Silverstone in 2001 \nand a terrifying get-off at Oschersleben in June 2003. ‘The Oschersleben \ncrash was absolutely petrifying, the worst I’ve ever had, just amazingly \nscary. I had a  gearbox problem and went off  at  the  fastest part of the \ntrack. The worst thing was that I knew I was going to  crash, I was \nheading towards this barrier, my  brain judging all  the  distances, and I \nknew I was definitely going to  hit  it. What made the  crash really scary \nwas that I was still on  the  bike and it seemed like  an  eternity, knowing \nI was going to go down, so I just had to jump off.’ Haydon hit the gravel \ntrap at  120mph, sustaining neck injuries and a displaced disc. \nThere’s nothing worse for a racer than crashes caused by mechanical \nproblems —  they take a  rider’s destiny away from him, leave his  life  in \nthe  lap of the  gods. And while most riders can bounce back from the \nworst of tumbles and injuries, even the strongest-minded racer struggles \nto  get  back on  dodgy equipment and ride his  hardest. \nAs  Haydon says: ‘It  all  depends on  you knowing what happened in \nthe crash —  if I know I was a bit early on  the  throttle or  I got in a bit hot, \nthat’s not a  problem at  all,  because I know what to  do  to  make sure it \ndoesn’t \nhappen \nagain. \nThe \nmechanicals \nare \nthe \nreally \nscary \nstuff.’ \nSome guys bounce better than others \nThere’s \nno  \ndoubt \nthat \nsome \nracers \nget \nhurt \nmore \noften, \neven \nif \nthey \ndon’t \nfall \noff \na \nlot.  \nBut  \nwhy? \nQuite \nsimply, \nsome \nguys \nbounce \nbetter \nthan \nothers, \nas \ninjury-hit \nKevin \nSchwantz \nexplains: \n‘I \nthink \nsome \nriders \nhave \nsomething"

This is an  increasingly controversial event —  there’ve \nbeen plenty of rumours of, er,  palm greasing in recent years —  and some \npeople want it stopped.

But some are  bigger nutters than others, and this lot,  we \nreckon, are  the  nuttiest of  them all.  Each of  these ten  riders has a \nreputation for  some or  all  of  the  following: crashing a lot,  T-boning \nrivals on  a  regular basis or  just generally riding out of  control like \nthey’re totally immortal. Above all,  they just scare the  hell out  of us. \nOf  course, these men are  more than just nutters. If all  bike racers \nare  a  wee bit  crazy, those who make it  all  the  way to  the top  have \nother stuff going for them. While every racer requires a  certain \ndisregard for  his  own safety and for  the  safety of others if he’s to  race \ncompetitively, he’ll need the following characteristics and more to \nexalt himself beyond the ranks of  club and national racing: riding \ntalent, determination and intelligence (of a kind). \nPerhaps we  could distil those attributes down to genius and bravery, but \nwe  all  know that genius is  closely allied to  madness, as  bravery is  to \nstupidity. All  these riders have those four qualities in  the  mix. Kevin \nSchwantz was maybe three parts genius and  four parts bravery to two  parts \nstupidity and one  part madness, Christian Sarron perhaps four parts bravery \nand five parts madness to four parts stupidity and three parts genius. \nFinally, an  important word of advice: never share a  rentacar with a \nbike racer. \n1 -  Dave Croxford \nEven \nCarlos \n‘Chuckitaway’ \nCheca \ndoesn’t \ncrash \nas \nmuch \nas \nDave \nCroxford \nused \nto, \nand \n‘Crockers’ \nraced \nin \nthe \ndays \nwhen \nthe \nArmco \nwas"

He \njust kept on  crashing, from Brands Hatch to  the  Isle of Man, cheating \ndeath and broken bones in  more than 200 tumbles. Sometimes he \nbounced well because he was pissed, other times it was just sheer London \ngeezer luck. And Crox was always in the midst of any post-race piss-ups, \nwhich were very much the norm on  Sunday nights back then. \nBut he was also known as  a decent development rider. And he reckons \nhe  asked Norton to  make a slipper clutch three decades before they \nbecame the must-have accessory on  any race bike or  supersports bike. \n‘That Cosworth Norton, it was so  over-bored, with such a  short stroke \nthat it used to lock up the rear  whenever you  shut the throttle,’ he recalls. \n‘I told them something was wrong, but they said ‘no, it’s fine Crox”. So we \nwere testing at  Snetterton and it was pissing down with rain. I told them \n“right, you  stand by the  pits, I’ll come past, take my hand off the throttle \nto  show I’ve  shut the  throttle, then you  can  see  what it’s  like’. So  I come \nalong, take my hand off the throttle, the wheel locks and I crash. I get back \nto the pits and  say “there, told  you  so”,  but  they did nothing...’ \n2 -  Christian Sarron \nThe  maddest racing nutters always inspire fear and loathing from their \nrivals. Christian Sarron did  just that during the  late 1980s and early \n1990s when he was the  only European 500  rider to regularly hassle the \nex-dirt trackers from the  USA and Australia. \nEddie Lawson and his ex-dirt-tracking peers hated racing with Sarron \nbecause (a)  he  was nuts and (b)  his  old-school riding style didn’t fit \nwith theirs. While they would enter a  corner focusing on  a  rapid exit, \nSarron would career up  the  inside on  his  Gauloises Yamaha, trying to \nmake all his  time on  the way in, with predictable consequences. And on \nthe  way out  of corners he was an  accident waiting to  happen, for  this \nwas the heyday of highsides. Sarron, who won the  1984 250  title before \ngraduating to  500s, went over the top countless times, invariably \nknocking himself out  in the  process. \nFellow former 500 rider Niall Mackenzie remembers him well: \n‘Christian didn’t mean to  be dangerous, he just was. He’d come flying \npast, \nthen \ncrash \nat \nthe \nnext \ncorner. \nOnce \nhe \ncrashed \nin \nfront \nof \nme \nat"

Kevin Schwantz and Graziano Rossi were good at \nthis but  nowhere near as  good as  Carlos Lavado (Careless Bravado to \nhis  mates), winner of the 1983 and 1986 world 250 titles. Clutching \ndefeat from the  jaws of  victory was Lavado’s specialist subject —  he \ntumbled out  of first place three times in  ’84  alone. But that’s not all, \nLavado could do better than that, he  could even lead a  race, crash, get \nback up  with the  leaders and then crash again. No  one ever picked up \na fallen bike quicker, but  then he had a lot of practice at it. \nThe lovable Venezuelan was certainly a  nutter but he  was also \nastonishingly talented, almost as  if the bikes and tyres of his  era  hadn’t \ncaught up with his  riding ability. In  1985 Lavado gave Freddie Spencer \na  seriously hard time in the  250  world championship, even though his \nYamaha was way slower than Spencer’s Honda. Spencer rarely admitted \nto  the  skills of his  rivals, but  he  was moved to  say  that he  was really \nquite scared of Lavado. \nIt  should also be  noted that it was Lavado who began the  paddock \nfashion for wearing your helmet atop your head and backwards, a style \nnow adopted by London scooter kids. \n6 —-  Ron Haslam \nThis is not  Ron Haslam the elder statesman of British roadracing whom \nwe  all  know and love.

If McWilliams had been blessed \nwith more horsepower during his  ten  years in GPs, he might have been \nable to  channel his  undoubted talents into perfecting a  smooth and \ngracious riding style.

In  other words, he must’ve \nbeen seriously frightening. \nTenni made his  name during the  interwar years, dazzling fans with \nhis  fearlessness. They nicknamed him Death Defying Man but it didn’t \ndo  him any good, for  he  was killed in  an  accident during practice for \nthe  1948 Swiss grand prix. \nFrom a poor peasant background, Tenni started racing and winning \nas a teenager, quickly gaining a reputation for riding with total abandon. \nAfter landing a  factory Moto Guzzi ride he  terrified the  British on  his \nTT debut. While the Italians loved his fearless, wall-grazing riding style, \nthe  more uptight Brits found it all too  much and gave him yet another \nnickname: ‘Black Devil’. Nevertheless Tenni became the  first Italian to \nwin a TT when he  triumphed in the  1937 Lightweight TT.  He  also won \nthree Italian 500 titles and two Milan—Naples roadraces, losing two \ntoes in another attempt at  Milan—Naples victory. \n9 -  Noboru Ueda \nRacial stereotypes dictate that Japanese riders are  inscrutable, obscure \nand scary. Noboru Ueda was definitely scary but he  was neither \ninscrutable nor obscure. Nobby —  as  his  European fans liked to  call \nhim -  rarely stopped grinning during his  decade on  the GP  scene, \napart from those occasions when he  was gnashing his teeth after \nthrowing away another likely victory with another impossible \nmanoeuvre gone wrong. \nUeda was the  first breath of Japan’s storm from the  east that swept \nthrough 125  GPs during the  early 1990s. Within a  few years riders like \nUeda, Kazuto Sakata, Haruchika Aoki, Takeshi Tsujimura, Tomomi \nManako, Masao Azuma, Masaki Tokudome and  Youichi Ui made Japan \nthe  third most successful nation in  125s, most of them also reinforcing \nthe  kamikaze stereotype on  account of their out-of-control riding. \nUeda stayed faithful to  the  proper nutters’ class throughout his  GP \ncareer, probably substantially contributing to  profits at  the Honda \nMotor Company as  he demolished one Honda RS125 after another. He \ncame close to winning the  125 world title in 1994 and 1997; and suffered \nnasty hand injuries the  following year that would’ve put lesser hard \nnuts out  of racing for  good.

Rossi, his  mates and his  rivals recall how he  became a \nsuperstar overnight \nValentino Rossi was just another crash-happy teenage GP  rider when \nhe  commenced the 1997 125  world championship. The kid  had won \njust a  single race in his  rookie ’96  GP  season, so  back in  the  spring of \n‘97  no  one had any idea of the  greatness that lay ahead for  the  girlie- \nlooking Italian. However, by the  end of that year there was no  doubt \nthat Rossi was a bit  special —  at  the  age  of just 17  he  was already 125 \nworld champion and a bona fide superstar. \nDuring ‘97  he won 11  GPs from 15  starts on  his  factory Aprilia 125, \nall  the  while developing the  talent that would allow him to  go  on  to \ndominate every GP  category —  from 125s to  250s and from 500s to \nMotoGP. \nBut what really grabbed everyone’s attention that summer were \nRossi’s hilarious post-race theatrics. One weekend he  would take a \nblow-up doll for  a  ride on  his  victory lap, the  next he’d arrive on  the \npodium dressed like superman. These comic displays made him much, \nmuch more than just another fast  man on  a motorcycle. They turned all \nkinds of people on  to Valentino Rossi, ultimately transforming him into \nthe biggest bike racing star the world has  ever known. \nThus the  1997 season made Rossi the  man he  is today. Here we  look \nback at  that crucial year with the  help of  six  witnesses: Rossi himself, \nNobby Ueda, Rossi’s main rival for  the  '97  125  title, former Aprilia race \nboss Carlo Pernat who in 1995 had signed Rossi to a three-year deal, Uccio \nSalluci, Rossi’s best mate and constant companion since they were five \nyears old,  dad  Graziano, a three-time 250  GP winner in 1979 and myself."

There were ten  or  12  very fast riders in  125s, so  he  had to \nfight very much. There were some very beautiful races. \nValentino: In  96  my  bike was very slow, I had many good races but \nalso some big, crazy mistakes. For  ‘97  I had a  good bike, so  I knew in \nmy  heart I could win the  championship, though winning 11  races and \nnot  making too  many mistakes was a surprise. \nPernat: I signed Valentino the  first time I watched him ride in  ’95. \nGraziano had been a  friend for  many years and he  told me  ‘my son  is \nvery strong’, so  I went to  see. Unbelievable. I made a contract that day \nfor  three years —  ‘96, ‘97  and '98  —  and I signed it with his  father and \nmother because Valentino was only 15,  too  young to  sign. We  put  him \nin a  team with Mauro Noccioli as  his  engineer, because Mauro is very \ngood with young riders. \nUeda: I already knew Rossi when he was 11  because I lived only one \nkilometre from him in  Italy. On  weekend nights we’d go  to  minimoto \ncourses and enjoy racing together. I wasn’t as  fast as \nhim. When he  started GPs in  ’96, he  stayed at  my \nhouse in Japan. At  first my  friends thought he was a ‘A  rider like \ngirl but I  told them he  would be  the next world Valentino is born \nchampion. Before ’97  his  riding style was so  wild, he every 20 years —  he’s \ncrashed \nmany \ntimes. \nI  \nthink \nhe  \nwas \nstudying \nthe \nsimilar \nto \nguys \nlike \nlimit \nand \nhow \nhe  \ncould \ncontrol \nhis  \nmachine \n100  \nper \nPele, \nMcEnroe, \ncent. \nBy \n’97  \nit \nwas \nvery \ndifficult \nto  \nbeat \nhim. \nMuhammad \nAli \nor \nMaradona’ \nOxley: It was obvious that Rossi was really good, but \nthere’ve been plenty of great 125 racers who never \nmade \nit \nin \n250s, \nlet \nalone \n500s \nor \nMotoGP. \nIt \nturned \nout \nthat \nhe \nwas \nway, \nway \nbetter \nthan \nmost \nof \nus \nrealised, \nin \nevery \npossible \nway. \nPernat: \nA \nrider \nlike \nValentino \nis \nborn \nevery \n20 \nyears. \nFor \nme  \nhe’s \nsimilar \nto  \nguys \nlike \nPele, \nMcEnroe, \nMuhammad \nAli \nor  \nMaradona \n—  \npeople \nwho \ntower \nover \ntheir \nsports. \nTwo \nqualities \nmake \nhim \nspecial. \nFirst, \nhis \nsense \nof \nbalance \non \nthe \nmotorcycle \nis \nunbelievable; \nI’ve \nnever \nseen \nanything \nlike \nit. \nSecond, \nhe \nhas \nfun, \nhe \namuses \nhimself \nby \nracing, \nthat’s \nall \nhe"

While most riders have to  get  there step by step, his  sense of \nbalance allows him to get there so  quick. At first he crashed a lot trying \nto  find the  limit too  fast, he was lucky not  to  get injured. \nUeda: His riding skill is  about controlling his  weight on  the bike — \nthrough the  footpegs, the  seat, the  tank, the  handlebars. He  moves so \nwell, it’s  like  he’s dancing on  the bike. This allows him to move traction \nbetween the front tyre and rear tyre, depending where he is in the corner, \nand  it also helps turn the bike, especially when the  tyres are  finished. He \ncan  find side grip especially at the end of races by shifting backwards and \npushing on  the  outside ‘peg to put weight on  the  rear tyre. \nHe  was fun  to  race, he  never cut  me  up,  but  I knew I couldn’t play \nwith him, so  I just gave gas  all the  time. The  race I remember best from \n‘97  was Austria, because I won! He  made a  small mistake at  the  last \ncorner and I passed him just before the  finish line. \nSalucci: We  have been friends since we  were five. We  used to race each \nother on  minimotos, but  I stopped after that and started going to  races \nwith him. I always knew he was very fast but I never imagined the future. \nIn ‘97 we  were too  young to notice that he might be a really good rider. \nOxley: Rossi ran  away with the championship. He won two of the  first \nthree GPs and  would’ve won round two at  Suzuka if he hadn’t crashed \non  the  last  lap. That was when I first noticed he was a bit  special as  a \nperson —  he  didn’t pull a  strop, but  limped back to  the  pits, grinning \nand waving, then told us:  ‘At  first I thought I could win, now I just \nthink I’m an  idiot’. He  made us  laugh. It  was a  breath of  fresh air \nbecause GPs were pretty dull back then, Doohan was  breaking everyone’ \nballs in 500s and the paddock was so  serious, like  working in an  office, \na nightmare. The fun  really started at Mugello. \nValentino: Mugello is always crazy. Up on  the  hill  it’s  another world, \nthe  crowd is coming crazy: drink, naked people on  motocross bikes... \nIn  ‘97  I went up  in  the  evening and it was very dangerous, everyone \njumping on  me, shouting ‘Rossi! Rossi!’ There was this big  wall of \npeople and only one way out, through the  shower block, so  I rode my \nscooter through the  shower block."

A few months \nearlier Biaggi had been putting it about that he  had shagged Naomi \nCampbell but  no  one really believed him. The display had everyone in \nhysterics —  we  wondered what he’d think of next. \nGraziano: These gags weren’t so  much for  the fans, they were \nmore for  ‘his friends and for  his fan club, the people who were \nbehind him, the  people who loved him. I always knew what gags they \nwere planning. My favourite was Jerez ‘98  when he  won the 250 \nrace, then climbed inside a  marshal’s Portaloo halfway round the \nvictory lap. \nValentino: When I came to  GPs all  the  riders were very, very serious. \nSo  when I started winning, me  and my  friends decided we  should try \nto  make some big fun. \nSalucci: I was one of ten  people who would meet on  Tuesdays before \nraces to organise the gag. Then I would arrive at the track on Wednesdays \nto  find a  nice place to  do  the  gag. We  bought the  material for  the \n‘Superfumi’ cape and made it  ourselves for  Assen, but for  Mugello \nwe  rang someone from the fan club to  buy a  blow-up doll from a \nsex  shop. \nPernat: Valentino doesn’t like Biaggi. They are  different characters — \nValentino doesn’t like hanging out with movie stars, Biaggi is  the \nopposite, he likes to  be with famous people. \nValentino made a lot  of theatre at  this time —  he  entered the  hearts \nof \nordinary \npeople \nwho \nwant \nto \ndream. \nAnd \nit \nwas \nthis \nthat \nhelped \nbike \nracing \nappeal \nto \nthe \nwhole \nfamily: \nthe \nkids, \nthe \nmothers, \nthe \ngrandfathers, the  grandmothers. \nBut \nValentino \nis  \nclever, \nwhile \nhe  \namuses \nhimself, \nhe  \nalways \nhas \na \ngoal \nin \nmind. \nSome \npeople \nsay \nhe \nhas \nless \nego \nthan \nother \nriders \nbut \nI \nthink \nhe \nhas \na \nbigger \nego. \nHe \nis \nvery \nclever \npsychologically. \nBiaggi \nwas \nalways \nso \nmentally \nstrong \nagainst \nany \nenemy \nbut \nValentino \nis \nstronger. \nFor \nfour \nor \nfive \nyears \nthey’ve \nhad \nthis \npsychological \nwar. \nValentino \nhas \nwon \nit \nbecause \nhe \nhas \nfun; \nBiaggi \ndoesn’t \nhave \nfun, \nhe \njust gets angry."

Not  only did he do all this comedy \non  the  track, he’d also spend Sunday evenings in  the  media centre, \nchatting and joking with journalists. No other rider does that. Sometimes \nit was hard to get any work done! Of course, he doesn’t do it any more, \nthese days he needs to get away from the  media. \nIt was at Imola ’97  that I realised he’d become a superstar —  his  fans \ncovered half the  hillside on  the  pit  straight, so  he  was already more \npopular than Doohan and Biaggi. You’d go  to  his  motorhome and \nthere’d be  20  teenage girls hanging around outside, even though he \nhad a girlfriend at  the  time. \nSalucci: We  really enjoyed having so  many girls around! Maybe some \ntop riders or  superstars worry ‘Is this girl coming to  see  me  because I’m \nfamous or  does she really like me?’, but Valentino didn’t think like that, \nhe always said ‘I don’t care why she’s coming to  see  me, I’m just happy \nthat she  is coming!’ \nPernat: I’ve never seen so  many girls around a  rider, maybe \nSheene or  Lucchinelli but  never so  many. Valentino doesn’t like to  stay \nwith a  girl  more than two or  three months. He  lived like a  kid then \nand he  lives like a  kid now, with the same friends, the same way \nof  life. After the racing is  finished it’s impossible to  find him, \nno one knows where he  goes, maybe he’s in  London, maybe \nhe’s in  a  disco with some friends he’s known since he  was a  boy. He \nnever changes, he  doesn’t want to  be  famous, he  doesn’t want a \nmovie star girlfriend, he  doesn’t want to  be  in  the papers with \nfamous people. \nUeda: Frankly speaking, I feel sorry for him now, his  life  is too  busy — \ntoo many fans come to  see him, too many journalists, too many \ncameramen. He just loves riding bikes, otherwise he wouldn’t continue. \nAt the end of 97 I went to the Milan bike show and was surprised there \nwere so  many girls after him. He  had seven or  eight security around \nhim —  big macho men —  otherwise he wouldn’t have been able to move. \nI was on  the  stand of one of my  sponsors, who also sponsored Rossi, \nand he  arrived saying ‘Incredible, what can I do? I want to  get  away.’ \nSo  I went out  front to  sign autographs until there was a  crowd, so  he \ncould escape out  the  back."

Breathing is  therefore vital, to  provide \nenough oxygen for  brain activity and muscle movement. This may \nsound obvious but many riders tense up  when they’re on  board, \nwhich reduces their oxygen intake, just when they need to  increase it. \nAs  a  hugely experienced racer, Rossi’s breathing technique comes \nnaturally, but he  still wears athlete’s nostril flares to  improve his \noxygen intake. \n‘On the  bike you need to  stay concentrated and relaxed, and to  do \nthat you need to  have enough air  for  the  brain.’ \nLooking ahead \nLooking and planning ahead are  also fundamentals to  fast, effective \nand safe riding, wherever you are.

Rossi has  a simple way to  ensure he knows he’s made a mistake \n—  he talks to himself! \n‘Yes, I very much talk to  myself when I am  on  the  bike. If I brake a \nlittle early for  a  corner and lose some time, I will say  to  myself ‘Fack! \nBrake a little more deep next time!’ I talk to  myself more on  the  track \nthan on  the  street. On  the  street I am  always a little more nervous, \nbecause a car  can  exit from a  street at  any  moment, so  you  need to  be \nmore relaxed.’ \nMan-machine relationship \nWorking as  one with your machine is  vital. You need to  know your \nmotorcycle, so  you can  understand what you can  do  to  ride faster and \nmore safely. \n‘The rider is a big part of the  motorcycle, so  you need to  understand \nthat you are  a  part of the  bike. It’s  not the  bike and the  rider —  both \nneed to  be  like one thing. You also need to  think about having a \ngood relationship with the  bike and making a direct rapport with it. \nTry to  understand what she wants from you, so  you can ride \nthe bike differently, especially if  you want to  make good of \ndifferent settings, different tyres and other modifications.

I didn’t really do this so  much \nin  125s but  I started using the  technique a lot  in  250s, and the  more \npower you have, the more important it becomes, so  I use  this very much \nin 500s and also in MotoGP. You need to put some weight on  the outside \nfootpeg, work the  handlebars and also use  your body weight to  lift  up \nthe bike.’ \nFeeling for grip \nRacers usually have a  predictable amount of grip to  deal with —  they \nknow how grippy the  tarmac should be.  But  it’s very different for street \nriders who are  constantly changing from one tarmac to  another. \n‘When I am  on  the  street, I also use the  rear brake very much to \nmake the  rear slide so  that I can understand the  level of grip. But be \ncareful where you do  this!’ \nUsing your body \nSome of Rossi's racing rivals reckon that he  makes the  difference on \nthe track by using his  body weight more cleverly than other riders. \nRossi understands that you can  increase traction at the  front or  back of \nthe bike by adding weight accordingly. Likewise, you can  reduce traction \nat  either end if  you need to.  Perhaps this isn’t so  vital for  street \nriding, but  shifting your weight also affects the  way your bike handles \nand steers. \n‘Moving on  the  bike is very, very important to  weight the  front and \nadd traction to  the  rear. When braking you move over the  front of the \nbike to  weight the front, but not too  much because then the rear \nend comes up.  In  the  middle of  the  corner you need to  keep some \nweight \nup \nfront, \nso \nyou \nstay \nover \nthe \nfront. \nThis \nhelps \ntraction \nand \nhelps \nthe \nbike \nto \nturn. \nComing \nout \nof \nthe \ncorner, \nwhen \nthe \ntyre \nstarts \nto \nslide \nunder \nacceleration, \nyou \nneed \nmore \ntraction \nat \nthe \nrear, \nso \nyou \nneed \nto \npush \nback \ninto \nthe \nback \nof \nthe \nseat \nand \nalso \npush \non \nthe \noutside footpeg.’"

If it’s  a left-then-right esses, I get the rear spinning \nup  out  of the  left, then shut the  throttle a  bit  sharpish, which makes \nthe  tyre grip suddenly and flicks me  over the  highside, laying the  bike \ninto the  right, fast as  you like.’ \nMick Doohan: the do-it-yourself slipper clutch \n‘I  always liked using the  rear brake, which came from dirt tracking, \njumping on  the  brake to  get  the  rear kicked out  into turns. Back then \nthe four-strokes didn’t have slipper clutches, so  I found the  engine- \nbraking a problem because I preferred to use  the  brake to slow the  bike. \nI'd  heard that Gregg Hansford (1970s Aussie GP  winner) used to \ndisengage the  clutch going into turns when he raced four-strokes and I \nthought it made sense. \n‘If \nyou \nsaw \nme  \ngoing \ninto \na  \nturn \non  \nthe  \nRVF \nyou'd \nhear \nthe  \nengine \nshut \ndown \nand \nthere’d \nbe  \nnot  \nmuch \nnoise \nat  \nall.  \nI’d  \nshut \nthe  \nthrottle \nand \nhave \nthe \nclutch \nin, \ninstead \nof \nhaving \nthe \nthing \nrpm-ing. \nInto \nthe \nturn \nthe \nclutch \nwouldn’t \nbe \nfully \nengaged \nnor \ncompletely \nout, \nthen \nonce \nthe \nbike \nwas \nsettled \nin \nthe \ncorner \nId \nstart \nto \nlet \nthe \nlever \nout, \njust \nsmooth \ntransition \nback \ninto \nengaged, \nthen \nget \non \nthe \nthrottle, \na \nsmooth, \nseamless \nprogression.’"

On  the  way out \nof corners I’d  have a  finger on  the  clutch as  I got  on  the  throttle, so  if \nthe  rear started to  spin up,  I could pull some of the  power straight back \nout.

Gathering \ntogether the three of  them —  former 500 champs Kenny Senior and \nKenny Junior and former AMA Superbike winner turned Proton V5 \nrider Kurtis —  for  an  interview isn’t easy. And when we  do  get  them \ntogether, the  three of them are  chaos, a bit like  watching the  Simpsons \nin action. The comedy starts the  moment they gather in Homer’s front \nroom, sorry, the King’s luxury lounge on  the top deck of  the  Team \nRoberts paddock bus, the nerve centre of his  struggling Proton MotoGP \nsquad. There’s a non-stop torrent of wisecracks, cussing and dick jokes, \nmostly from the  King and Kurtis, while the more reticent Kenny Junior \nabsorbs himself surfing the  CNN website for  a  weather forecast. Then \nKurtis suffers a  minor panic attack when he realises someone’s cleared \naway the  plastic cup into which he gobs used chewing tobacco. \nThe quick-fire abuse that flows between them would embarrass the \nmore prudish onlooker but does suggest that they are  indeed a  happy \nfamily, confident enough in  each others’ love and respect to  know that \nthey can rip  the piss without anyone taking serious offence. Their \ncontrasting characters are  noticeable throughout, Kenny Junior always \nthe quietest, wearing an  amused, sometimes slightly embarrassed \ngrin at  his father’s and younger brother’s profane outbursts. And \nif Kurtis is the only one of the three who hasn’t won a world championship, \nhe  is definitely the  funniest, managing even to  out-wisecrack his  dad, a \nconsiderable achievement, and one  of which he should feel  very proud."

The man who won the  last  of his  three 500  crowns a \nquarter of a century ago  and scored his  last world title as  a team owner \nmore than a decade back still lives a high-stress lifestyle at  the  head of \nhis  struggling, Banbury-based Proton KR  outfit, which designs its own \nMotoGP bikes from the  ground up  in a hopelessly Quixotic attempt to \ncompete with Honda in the world’s fastest, richest bike racing series. \nBut then the  King always was a bit  crazy. He  is one of those weird \ndudes who get their kicks from attempting the  impossible, a have-a-go \nhero who’s not  afraid of anyone or  anything. That’s the way he was in \n1978 —  when he  won the 500 title at  his  first attempt against all \npredictions —  and that’s the  way he  is now. Maybe that’s not  quite it \nthough. The fact is that King Kenny is hopelessly addicted to  the  ritual \nof competition, even if nowadays that means weekly humiliation at the \nhands of  Honda, Yamaha and Co,  rather than more gongs and glory. \nAnd there’s something else too... \n‘Why am I still  here?’ he  ponders from behind mirror shades. ‘Well, \nobviously it’s a love of bikes —-  motorcycles have been a part of my life for a \nlong, long time.’ Now into his  50s, Roberts is still  a real  biker. When he’s \nnot  hooning on  his Harley, he’s thrashing around the dirt aboard a Bee  Em \nGS  or  motocrosser. And not  for  pure pleasure. ‘I still  can’t ride and just \nhave fun,’ he  says. ‘I’ve got  to  ride it to where it’s  skidding the  front and \nthe  rear. I’m  not  at  the  point where I can  ride around slowly. That’s why \nwhen I first came to  Europe I knew I would die  if I did  the  Isle  of Man. \nAnd it’s  still my problem. Someone watched me  ride  a motocross bike the \nother day and said “what the  fuck, you're going to  kill  yourself, crank it \ndown”, but  that’s the way I ride, I can’t crank it down.’"

What’s \nneeded is less professionalism, not more. \nThe other reason I love Rio is that it gets back to racing’s fundamentals \n—a  bunch of riders and mechanics, some bikes, a  racetrack and a big \npot of pasta in a Portakabin —  there’s none of the  suffocating corporate \nhospitality that has swamped the European paddocks, leaving little \nspace for what really matters. \nBut amidst MotoGP’s shameless headlong rush into full-on corporate \ncocksucking there are  a  few paddock people striving to  keep it  real, \napart from the aforementioned anonymous star. Stand up  Kurtis \nRoberts, younger son  of The  King, currently enduring a miserable debut \nGP  season on  dad’s Proton KR5. I’m glad to  say  that Kurtis is brash, \nbonkers and very badly behaved, in other words a  carbon copy of his \nfather as  a young man. Before telling this next tale, I should explain \nthat Max Biaggi owns a  Smart car  which his  motorhome driver uses to \ntravel from the  paddock to  his  hotel each night. Fair enough, but the \nself-styled Roman Emperor’s Noddy car  is  sprayed up  in  Camel blue \nand yellow and emblazoned in  huge Max logos. In  other words it’s \nasking to be done over. And, please forgive me  Lord, I’ve  been tempted \nmyself, but  Kurtis beat me  to it at Mugello, turning the  thing on  its roof \nand spinning it round and round. Then when a bike cop  rolled up  to \ninvestigate, he jumped aboard the  cop  bike and rode a couple of laps of \nthe  paddock, blue lights flashing, siren wailing. Proper behaviour for a \n25-year-old bike racer. \nSo please join me  in proposing a toast to  Kurtis Roberts Esquire and \nsaying a  fervent prayer to  the Big G  that Rio may be  spared from \nMotoGP’s death row.

He  was a  tough \nracer, who experienced more than his  fair share of hard knocks, and a \nhard partier, renowned for  his  nightlife exploits with Sheeney &  Co. \nAmazingly, he was still  racing at the  time of this interview, well into his \n60s  and competing in veteran races here and there. \nNixon won his  greatest successes in  the  late 1960s when he  rode \nfactory-supported Triumphs to  back-to-back titles in  America’s multi- \ndiscipline Grand National championship.

He would \nalmost certainly have become a  500 GP  star in  the mid-1970s if he \nhadn’t got badly smashed up while testing Suzuki's brand-new RG500 \nsquare four in Japan. \n‘I rode a lot of great bikes,’ he says. ‘The Triumph 500s were great, the \nTriumph \nCub \nwas \ngreat, \nthe \nbike \nthey \nbuilt \nme \nwhen \nDoug \nHele \ncame \nover \nin \n67 \nwas \ngreat \nand \nso \nwere \nthe \ntriples \nthey \nbrought \nover \nin \n’70 \nand \n‘71. \nAll \nthe \nbikes \nthat \nErv \nbuilt \nme \nwere \nspecial \ntoo, \nbut \nthe \nKawasaki"

Weighing less than eight and a half stone at  the \ntime, he won his  first drag race title at the  age  of 15,  started scrambling \non  a  Triumph Thunderbird the following year and commenced his \nprofessional career in  1958, aged just 17. \nHis  early years on  the  pro-dirt track circuit were anything but high \nrolling. Nixon lived a  Kerouac-style life  on  the  road, barnstorming his \nway from one town to  the  next, relying on  the  charity of rivals to  get \nthrough. ‘I used to go to races and  borrow two dollars to  sign on,  when \nyou  have to  do that you're fuckin’ broke,’ says the  man from Maryland \nwho hooked up  with AMA legend Dick Mann and fellow racer Neil \nKeen for much of his  travels. ‘If my engine blew, Dick would lend me  a \nspare and I’d  give him half my  prize money.

At  the  time it must have seemed like danger money — \nthe TDIC seized not  infrequently, throwing Nixon to the ground on  one \noccasion and breaking the  thumb on  his  throttle hand. ‘One day we \ngot through seven crankshafts.’ Only Nixon’s remarkable ability \nto  withstand pain allowed him to  keep racing towards his first \nAMA title. \nIn  ‘69  Nixon suffered the  first of several seriously injurious crashes, \nbut  this time a  rinky-dinky two-stroke wasn’t to  blame. He  was riding \na Triumph dirt  tracker at one  of the  many West Coast horse tracks that \nwere ‘converted’ for  bikes. ‘This thing didn’t have any midrange, so  I \npunched it  down a  gear and ran it  wide open, missed a  gear and \nhit  a  four-by-four post. They didn’t have any hay bales. I remember \nmy femur bone sticking out of my leather pants, blood \nsquirting everywhere.’ \nNixon never won another national dirt track race, that injury forcing \nhim to concentrate on  roadracing because his left leg, now held together \nby  an  18-inch steel nail, didn’t like going round in  anti-clockwise \ncircles. His  full-time move to  the  hard stuff was completed when he \nsigned to  Kawasaki. \nKawasaki's early H2  750s were evil  pieces of equipment. Their fragile \nair-cooled motors required riders to  focus much of their attention on \nengine noise, nervously listening for warnings of an  imminent seizure \namongst the  cacophony of open spannies. And when the  motors were \nrunning, they screeched out  more power than their flexi frames and \niffy tyres could handle. \n‘Hell, they were scary,’ Nixon admits. ‘But it was just something you \nhad to  do.  You're a  racer, you're out  there trying to  go  faster, and the \nTriumphs were running 150mph when the  two-strokes were running \n180. That’s a big difference. But  that Kawasaki would wobble so  bad at \nDaytona that Yvon [DuHamel] told me: ‘Well, just cut  an  inch or  two \noff  the  bars’. The thing still wobbled but  your hands didn’t go  so  far \nback and forth.’ \nNixon’s career on  these Grim Reaper two-strokes was saved by Erv \nKanemoto. \n‘Everybody \nwas \nsaying \n“that \nol” \nNixon \nis \na \nhas-been’, \nthen \nI \nsigned \nwith \nErv \nand \nI \nwas \nAMA \nroadrace \nchamp \nthe \nnext \nyear. \nBut"

Sheene had talked Suzuki into entering \nNixon in the ’74 Dutch TT, aboard one  of the factory’s brand new RG500 \nsquare four. On  his way to Europe Nixon stopped in Japan to test some \nTR750 chassis mods he wanted Suzuki to  adopt. \n‘Our 750  was running a 24 degree head angle, their 750 was 30 or  31. \nFirst lap  out Ken Aroaka (Suzuki's test rider) comes by me, and me \nbeing a dumb ass  I passed him back. Going into this fifth gear corner I \nbacked the throttle off and the thing seized. Ken clipped my back wheel \nand I went down. I woke up,  noticed my  arm was all  bent over, then \nthe  pain hit.  They put me  on  a workbench on  the back of a pickup with \na little Jap guy on  top of me  so  I wouldn’t fall  off. I was screaming and \nyelling till  they shot me  up  in  the  hospital. A few hours later I heard \nloud screams —  Ken’s on  the little bench next to me  with one of the Jap \ndocs pulling his  broken leg, while the  other guy’s got  a  foot-long drill \ngoing through his  knee...’ \nNixon broke both arms, three ribs and an  ankle in that accident, but \nhe  still wasn’t finished. In  ‘76  he  moved back to  Kawasaki to  have a \ncrack at  the  inaugural F750 world championship, riding a KR750 that \nhad been heavily breathed upon by Kanemoto. ‘I guess the ’76 Kawasaki \nthat Erv  built me  was the  start of what they have nowadays —  it had \ncantilever shocks, chrome-moly frame, the right head angle, all  the \nstuff like that.’ \nNixon made a great start to  the series —  taking second to  Johnny \nCecotto \nat \nDaytona \nand \nwinning \nround \ntwo \nat \nSan \nCarlos, \nVenezuela. \nOr \nso \nhe \nthought. \n‘The \nrace \nwas \nsponsored \nby \nthe \nlocal \nYamaha \nimporters, \nso \nthey \nfixed \nSteve \nBaker’s \nlaps \nso \nhe \nwon \nit \non \nhis \nYamaha. \nI \nfound \nout \nlater \nthat \nthe \nrace \nwas \nrun \nby \nthe \nMafia, \nso \nI \nwas \njust \nfuckin’ \nlucky \nI \nwas \nstill \nalive.’ \nThe \nrow \ndragged \non \nall \nyear, \nthe \nFIM \neventually \ndeciding \nto \npretend \nthe \nVenezuelan \nrace \nhad \nnever \neven \nhappened. \nIf \nthings \nhad \ngone \nNixon’s \nway, \nhe \nwould’ve \nwon \nthe \nworld \ntitle \nby \na \nsingle \npoint. \nNixon \nraced \nhis  \nlast  \nserious \nrace \nin  \n1979, \nafter \na \ncouple \nof \nreasonable \nyears \non  \nKanemoto-prepared \nYamaha \nTZ750s. \nSince \nthen \nhe’s \ncarried \non \nwith \nhis \nmotorcycle \nparts \nbusiness, \nmore \nrecently \ncreating \nhis \nown \nwebsite \nthat \nflogs \nthe \n‘Gary \nNixon \nEnterprises’ \nT-shirts \nmade \nfamous"

The guy did  so  much for  me, some \nstuff I can’t even tell people. We just hit  off, we  had some good times.’ \nIn  recent years Nixon has  returned to  the  tracks and still isn’t to  be \nmessed with —  he  can  still make the  podium at  Daytona on  his  classic \nHonda CB750: ‘We had it running good and I was running right along \nwith Springer (Jay Springsteen, a  recently retired AMA dirt track \nlegend), I was screwing with him and he was screwing with me...’ And \nthere’s no  plans to  retire just yet: ‘If people like to  watch me, I’ll  keep \ndoing’ it.  I just go as  fast as  I can  without crashing.’ \nTo  keep his  aching body moving between races, Nixon gets himself \nalong to the occasional MotoGP race to help look after Honda star Nicky \nHayden. He’s known the  Hayden clan for  years. ‘I  used to  race with \nNicky’s dad  in the  1960s, though I don’t remember him. Then I ran  into \nhis  dad when Nicky and his  brothers were first racing. I remember \ntalking to  Nicky when he  was 12.  I asked him “how old  are  you?”, he \nwas like (Nixon raises his  voice several octaves), ‘sixteen!’ I saw him \ndoin’ a  dirt race or  two and I thought this kid  is unbelievable. Then he \ngot on  a roadracer, and when he got on  a good bike he just took off.  He’s \na  great kid. At  dirt  track I’d  say  to  him “You look a little high here or  a \nlittle low there”, then when he started roadracing I’d go out  to comers to \nwatch him.

(If you’re looking for the  epicentre of today’s \nlet’s-get-out-of-it-to-make-life-bearable culture, Huxley’s your man, \nthough his  own intentions were honourable; he was no  binge drinker, \nhe consumed all his  drugs in precisely measured quantities, then noted \ndown the  effects in full  detail.) \nHuxley was very impressed with the effect that straightforward miles \nper hour could have on  the brain, at least until he discovered the warp- \ndrive effects of  designer drugs. ‘The inebriating effects of  speed are \nnoticeable at  about 20  miles an  hour,’ he  wrote, \nexplaining to  his  readers that 72mph is the  speed at \nwhich life  starts to get a bit  scary: ‘One begins to feel ‘lam a slave to \nan  unprecedented sensation —  it grows intenser with speed. On  my \nevery increase of  velocity.” And Huxley was proper tombstone they will \nscared of going much faster than that: ‘I have never carve: It never got \ntravelled at  much more than 80mph, but  those who fast enough for me’ \nhave drunk a  stronger brewage of  this strange sy ee z \nintoxicant tell me that new marvels await anyone \nwho has the  opportunity of passing the  hundred mark.

That’s a  bit  like asking some blingin’, \ntooled-up rapper from So  Solid Crew to  test drive the  latest Ferrari on \na zigzagging Alpine road. Just asking for trouble. \nAt  least Thompson did  fully understand the  dangers involved in \nriding bikes too  fast. ‘The final measure of any rider’s skill,’ he wrote in \nsumming up  the  big  red  Duke. ‘Is  the  inverse ratio of  his  preferred \ntravelling speed to  the  number of bad scars on  his  body.’ He  did  nearly \ncrash the  v-twin, of course: ‘I felt  nauseous and I cried for  my  mama, \nbut  nobody heard... This motorcycle is simply too  goddam fast to  ride \nat  speed in  any kind of normal road traffic unless you’re ready to  go \nstraight down the centreline with your nuts on  fire  anda silent scream \nin  your throat.’ He  also found the  bike’s ergonomics unsuited to  his \nsubstance-abused body: ‘I  was hunched over the  tank like a  person \ndiving into a pool that got  emptied yesterday’. \nBut however much Thompson suffered for  his  speed addiction you \njust know that the world’s number-one expert on  growing old \ndisgracefully never went soft and bought a  steady old  Harley: ‘Some \npeople will tell  you that slow is good —  and it may be,  on  some days — \nbut  I am  here to  tell you that fast is better.

That is why God \nmade fast motorcycles, Bubba...’ \nYears before HST, years before Huxley even, another literary genius \nwas getting into the joys of speed. Irish author James Joyce wrote these \nwords a whole century ago, after watching a road race rattling into the \nstreets of  Dublin: ‘Rapid motion through space elates one; so  does \nnotoriety; so  does the  possession of money’. That sentence blows me \naway, in  15  words written in  1905 Joyce exactly describes the  forces \ndriving every MotoGP star: speed, fame, money. In the  same chapter of \nThe Dubliners he  adds (referring to  a  big, blue Citroén racer): ‘The \njourney laid a magical finger on  the  genuine pulse of life and gallantly \nthe machinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses \nof the  swift blue animal.’ So  nothing’s changed —  all  racers and road \nriders make themselves feel  more alive every time they yank open the \nthrottle and challenge their nerves to  keep up."

Seventy miles per  hour can  be a yawn or  a  scream, \ndepending on  what you're riding and how you’re riding it.

With a cracked, quirky machine like that you will \nbe able to rediscover that long-lost sense of adventure on  wikis journey \nyou take, indeed on  every corner you take. \nMy own personal crock of  biking shite is  a  dirty, four-year-old \nBurgman 400 (okay, so  it’s  a scooter but don’t tell anyone) which rarely \nfails to  make me  laugh, or  at  least snigger, whenever I ride it.  It isn’t \nthat fast but  it is fast enough to  hurt. This hideous hunk of steel and \nplastic can surpass 90mph and when you go into a corner at that speed \nyou really feel  like  you're living, though you feel even more alive when \nyou make it out  the  other side. You see, that same corner taken on  a \n‘Blade or  a  999 would be  a  non-event —  in  and out, no  doubt. On  the \nBurgman it can  make you feel like Valentino. You’re heading into the \nturn, feeling the  under-damped suspension seesawing back and forth, \ntransferring too  much force to  the  pressed-steel frame which begins to \ntwist and flex like a  drunken lap  dancer. You’re holding your breath, \nwary that you  may be about to push things an  nth  too  far, your muscles \ntautened and ready to do whatever it takes if she  does get too  far out  of \nshape.

But some defy the \nrules of medicine and good sense to  force their battered bodies \nback into the saddle and ride just as  fast as  they did before. It’s \ntime to pay homage to  bike racing’s hardest men \nMotorcycle racing is populated by hard nuts. There’s a good reason for this \n—you don’t get far in bikes if you can’t shrug off bone-crunching, stomach- \nchurning pain like  you or  I might shrug off a  mild cold. Pain is such an \ninevitable part of  a  racer’s life that he  must learn to  live with it,  or  as \nlegendary racetrack medic Claudio Costa believes, make it his friend. \n‘By mutating pain’s dimension the  rider can  make it his  friend and \ncarry it  with him into the  race to  complete his  enterprise,’ says the \nItalian doctor who has spent the last few decades putting broken \nMotoGP and WSB riders back together. \nBut what drives racers to  torture their bodies so?  What made King \nKenny Roberts defend his  500  crown with a broken back, Mick Doohan \nreturn to  racing with a  leg  bent like a  banana or  British Superbike \nchampion John Reynolds start the 2005 BSB series just 38 eye-watering \ndays after breaking a  leg? Money and machismo, mostly, the  lust for \ngongs, gold and glory... \nReynolds amazed many people when he  began his  title defence at \nBrands Hatch in April 20005, just five weeks after breaking his  right leg \nwhile testing at Valencia in February. But all he was doing was continuing \na rich tradition of motorcycle racers overcoming the medical odds. \nRacing injured is the dark side of bike racing, when it all starts getting \na bit  ugly. Really, you shouldn’t be racing but  you're out  there because \nyou're scared of losing your crown, scare of losing your ride, scared of \nlosing your income. To a racer, ignoring the  agony of injury is  simply \nthe  flipside of quaffing the  ecstasy of success."

Only later did \nx-rays reveal that the  crash had broken bones in  his  right hand and \nankle.

It’s  there to  tell  you to  stop doing whatever \nyou're doing or  risk damaging yourself. The hard racer ignores those \nwarnings —  he feels pain from his  broken wrist, forces himself to ignore \nit and insists on  racing next Sunday. He  can  race despite stinging pain \nbecause he’s desperately determined, because he’s high on  dopamine \n(the body’s natural painkillers) and maybe because he’s undergone a \ncourse of pain-killing injections. \nOf  course, the tricky thing about pain is  that it’s impossible to \nquantify objectively.

The traditional 250  and 500  GP  classes \nhad become too  costly, while Superbike, Supersport and Superstock \nhad yet  to  be  introduced, so  bog-stock racing made sense, especially \nsince the  race-replica craze had just kicked off. \nThe 1980s was the age of  the R:  Suzuki’s GSX-R750 and 1100, \nYamaha’s FZR750 and 1000, Kawasaki's GPz900R and Honda’s VFR750, \nbig  four-strokes that were built as  much for  the  racetrack as  for  the \nroad.

Then J thought about it, two  weeks on  the Island, \nall  paid for  and not  much work... I got  on  the  phone to  Suzuki and \nblagged one of their latest RG250s. I wanted something nice and  slow \nbecause I’d  already decided that all  big bikes are  too  fast for  the  TT  — \nimagine full-throttling a  GSX-R1100 down your favourite mountain \nroad, in  sixth gear —  and that full-blown racers with lightweight this \nand that aren’t engineered to  be jumped off  humpback bridges at  80 \nmiles an  hour. \nI headed to  Douglas, the  Isle of  Man’s capital, a  few days before \npractice began, driving endless laps of the  38-mile course in a van with \nmy TT  tutors, fellow journalist Mac McDiarmid and classic racer \nAnthony Ainslie. With over 200  corners to learn, most of them fast  and \nlethal, with zero run-off, you need all the help you can  get because your \nfirst mistake will most likely be  your last. To  be \nhonest, the  place terrified me. I didn’t want to  race, \n‘My first sun-blessed so  I decided I’d  do  one practice lap, then go  home. \nearly morning But my  first sun-blessed early morning practice had \npractice had me me  hooked.

It was a \nbig leap forward from the  RG  and  RD  but  the competition was intense, \nwith Robert Dunlop (Joey’s brother), Gary Padgett and other young \nhotshots also on  NSRs. In  an  effort to  find an  advantage we  all  rode \nPro-Am-style, in  other words, pretty much out of  control.

We  filled the \nfuel tank upside down, through the tap aperture to ensure it was totally \nfull, then refitted the  tap. I rode three flat-out laps, stopping as  I came \ndown from Creg-ny-Baa for the third time, pretending I’d run  dry. Then \nI completed the lap at speed, as  if I’d begged some fuel from a spectator. \nThe news went round that the  NSR couldn’t make three laps, but  back \nin  our Douglas shed we  discovered I'd  still got  two litres left. It was \nworth the  risk. \nI led the  early stages of the race but  slowed too  much for a downpour, \nmy  old  Pro-Am rivals Padgett and Graeme Cannell (on  a  Yamaha RD) \nsneaking past as  we  headed up  the mountain. Both had started ten \nseconds behind me, so  my  hopes seemed doomed (the TT  course is  so \ndangerous that riders are  started at ten-second intervals, with race results \ndecided on  corrected time). We  spent another lap together, colliding once \nor  twice, Cannell’s riding verging on  the  homicidal. Usually these hard \nnuts beat me on  short circuits, but that day I had something in  me. I \npulled ahead on  the final lap, despite nearly losing it  when the NS \nsnapped sideways on  a damp patch at the  33rd, banked hard left, flat out \nin  sixth gear. Cannell finished ten  seconds down, Padgett (who hadn’t \nfallen for my  fuel ruse) crashed at  Governors’ Bridge. \nPost-race celebrations were a  panic.

His \nwinning ride at the  2005 British GP was one of his most awe-inspiring, \nindeed he rates the race as  one  of the most difficult of his career, simply \nbecause conditions were so  appalling. Donington was so  badly flooded \nthat riders had to  deal with both ends aquaplaning. \n‘That race was not  like  riding a bike,’ says Rossi. ‘It was like riding a \nboat because there was a  lot  of  water between the  wheels and the \ntrack, so  always spinning the rear and locking the front.’ [See also \nChapter 53.] \nHis  secret was to wait for his rain tyres to warm up,  then suss out  the \nconditions before pushing to  victory. ‘Biaggi crashed in  front of  me, \nthen Gibernau, there were a lot of people making mistakes, also me, so \nI preferred to wait.’ At half-distance, after several scary moments of his \nown, Rossi put the hammer down, clearing off  from nearest rivals \nKenny Roberts Junior and Alex Barros by more than two seconds a lap \neven though he had no  tyre advantage. \nAlthough Rossi was a  ropey 250 wet-weather men he  got  much \nbetter when he  graduated to  500s, preferring the  bigger bikes’ fatter \ntyres and torque curves. Indeed he  scored his  debut 500 GP  win at  a \nwet Donington in  2000 and the  first-ever MotoGP race at  a  soaking \nSuzuka, 2002. Like everything else, he  puts it  all  down to  practice."

The colours weren't as  patriotic but \nthat didn’t matter because the JPS  Norton rotary was a more successful \nmotorcycle than its  twin-cylinder predecessor. The bike won three \nBritish championships and dozens of races over four seasons, its success \nhugely magnified by the  fact that it was so  unexpected. \nWhen JPS Norton riders Trevor Nation and Steve Spray lined up  for \nthe  RCW588’s first serious season in  1989 the  British bike industry was \npresumed dead and buried. Nation, Spray and later Robert Dunlop, \nTerry Rymer and Ron Haslam proved otherwise and in doing so  brought \ncrowds thronging back to British circuits in a patriotic \nferment.

British racing had been \ndominated by Japanese machinery for  almost two decades and all of a \nsudden Norton was winning again. The RCW588’s unlikely existence \nwas thanks to  the  vision of Brian Crighton, who joined Norton to  look \nafter its  rotary police bikes, the fruit of  a  licence bought from NSU \nin  1972. \n‘I  told Norton this engine could go  really well in  racing but they \nthought I was mad,’ says Crighton, who began tuning a  scrap police \nbike in  his  own time. ‘I  couldn’t get  anyone interested until it did \n170mph at  MIRA. It all went from there, they kicked the  caretaker out \nof his  house and let me  have that as  the  race shop.’ \nWith a  tiny budget from Norton’s new owner, investment banker \nPhilip Le  Roux, Crighton got  Spondon to build a chassis and, following \nthe  bike’s first victories, started hunting for  serious sponsorship. ‘We \nthought we’d try John Player because the  link was already there. They \ncame to  Brands when Steve won his  first two races on  the  bike, they \nsaw the  crowd go mad and that clinched the  deal.’ \nOver the next four years the JPS  Norton was British racing’s jewel in \nthe crown, even when it  wasn’t winning. Of  course, not everyone \nloved the  bike. There were various theories about how to  measure a \nrotary’s capacity, and plenty of rivals believed that Norton was cut  too \nmuch slack by  the ACU and FIM, who fully realised its  value to \nbike racing. \n‘It  was mental fast,’ remembers Yamaha rider Rob McElInea, who \nraced against the  rotary for  several years, beating Haslam to  the 91 \ntitle. ‘When you were racing you thought “that fucking thing shouldn’t \nbe \non \nthe \ntrack, \nit’s \nnot \nlegal”. \nYou’d \nbe \nsqueezing \nbehind \nthe \nscreen \nand \nRon \nwould \ncome \nrocketing \npast, \nhanging \non \nfor \ngrim \ndeath, \nlaughing \nlike \nmad. \nBut \nyou \nput \nup \nwith \nit \nbecause \nit \ndragged \nin \nthe \ncrowds. \nBritish \nracing \nwas \non \nits \narse, \nthen \nthe \nNorton \ncame \nalong \nand \ngot everybody into it again.’ \nIt \nwasn’t \njust \nthe  \nbike’s \namazing \nspeed \nthat \nmade \npeople \njealous \n— \nJPS \npumped \nin \nproper \nmoney \nand \nushered \nmodern-day \nsponsorship \npractices \ninto \nBritish \nbike \nracing \nwith \na \nvery \nglitzy \noperation. \nMcElInea \nagain: \n‘They \nhad \ndouble \nthe \nset-up \nanyone \nelse \nhad \nand \nthey \nput \nas"

It was certainly a  significant \ninvestment. ‘Their contributions more or  less kept Norton going, apart \nfrom the aircraft engine sales,’ reckons Barry Symmonds, who managed \nthe team from 1990. One source reckons Imperial Tobacco spent £1 \nmillion over the  first three years. \nUnfortunately, the  money didn’t always make for  a  happy, united \nteam. Crighton and Symmonds clashed badly, prompting Crighton to \nquit and develop other rotary racers. ‘The whole thing was tainted by a \nlot of silly squabbles,’ remembers Nation, who was dropped at  the  end \nof  1991. ‘I  always said what I thought and maybe I wasn’t tactful \nenough, but a spade is a spade —I don’t know what else you're supposed \nto call it. The worst thing was the converted Koni car  shock, I was never \na fan  of copying the  front of  a Formula Ford and sticking it on  the back \nof a motorbike.’ \nThe final 1992 Norton rotary was almost certainly the  most effective. \nIt used a  new motor from the  FI  road bike and was renamed NRS588 \n(for Norton Racing Services), for the  simple reason that Norton needed \na  logo that looked like JPS, because tobacco logos had been banned \nfrom the  BBC-broadcast British championship. \nJPS enjoyed massive media coverage from its  Norton adventure but \nmissed the rotary’s most famous victory. Island genius Steve Hislop \nsigned to  ride the  bike in  the  ‘92  TT  but  JPS weren’t involved because \nthey were frightened by the TT’s safety record. Hislop rode an  all-white \nNRS to  victory in the  Senior, Norton’s first TT  success since 1961. \nJPS pulled out at  the  end of ‘92. ‘The deal had run its  course and \nanti-tobacco \nrestrictions \nwere \ngetting \ntougher,’ \nsays \nSymmonds. \nImperial \nmay \nalso \nhave \nbeen \nconcerned \nby \nallegations \nof \nfraud \nwithin \nthe \nNorton \nMotors \ngroup, \nwhich \ntriggered \na \nDepartment \nof \nTrade \nand \nIndustry \ninvestigation \nthat \nresulted \nin \nconvictions \nfor \nLe \nRoux \nand \nseveral of his  coterie. \nDespite \nthe  \nmarque \nbeing \nsold \nonce \nagain \nin  \n1993 \n(and \non  \nmyriad \noccasions \nsince), \nthe \nNorton \nname \ncontinued \nto \nenjoy \nracetrack \nsuccesses, \nIan \nSimpson \nwinning \nthe \n'94 \nBritish \ntitle \non \na \nCrighton \nrotary. \nBut \nthe \nDuckhams-backed \nmachines \nnever \nexcited \nthe \nBritish \ncrowds \nlike \nthe \nJPS \nbikes \nhad \ndone."

But \nnot  any  more, not  since the  day after September’s World Supers round \nwhen bulldozers rumbled in  to  desecrate the  place, turning half the \nDutch track into an  entertainment mall and car  park. \nWay to  go,  dudes. \n‘Looks like we  need Which means Phillip Island is  now MotoGP’s \nto call Ghostbusters’ fastest venue and the best place in the world to watch \nmotorcycle racing. Perched off Australia’s south-east \ncoast, a  bit  like they took the  old  and insanely fast \nSilverstone and dragged it to  a clifftop on  the  north coast of Cornwall, \nPhillip Island is a wide-fucking-open primal scream of a racetrack. If it \nwere a  band it would be  The Ramones, Led Zeppelin and The White \nStripes all rock ’n’  rolled into one. Which would make the  emasculated \nAssen The Ramones unplugged, with Ronan Keating on  vocals. \nBike racers love Phillip Island because it’s  crazy fast —  just gas  it up \nand bank it over. As  Nicky Hayden says, ‘it’s  got a lot of fast corners and \nthat’s what we  like  to do —  go fast around corners’, while Colin Edwards \nadmits ‘it  scares the shit out of  you’.

No one  else stands a chance on  the \nIsland. Rossi has  won every year since 2001. \nIn  the  middle of  the  Island’s Portakabin paddock, we're in  one of \nRossi’s media chat sessions. We  get  to  asking him about the  curse he \nallegedly inflicted on  Sete Gibernau at  the 2004 Qatar GP where Honda \nnotoriously had Rossi sent to  the  back of  the grid, since when the \nSpaniard has  apparently lost  the  ability to win.

Living out  of the  back of vans or  dossing \non  mates’ floors, ‘like most Aussies and Kiwis back then’, he hung out \nwith fellow Antipodeans and factory Suzuki mechanics Mick Smith \nand Dave ‘Radar’ Cullen, though this wasn’t the only reason Suzuki GB \nsigned him for  1980. \nPartnering Randy Mamola in  Texaco Heron colours, Croz did  it all \nthat year. In March he won the Daytona Superbike race on  a Yoshimura \nGS1000, in May he made his  500  GP  debut, in June he won his  first TT, \n(the Fl  race, then a one-race world championship), in July he won the \nSuzuka Eight Hours (beating Kawasaki's Eddie Lawson and Gregg \nHansford) and in  August he  scored his  first 500 GP  podium. Such \nversatility came naturally, he  says: ‘where we  came from we  raced on \nstreet circuits, short circuits, GP  style circuits, the  lot’. Nevertheless, \nSuzuki were so  impressed they doubled his  pay for  1981, to £25,000. \nContinuing his  two-stroke and four-stroke duties, Croz was just as \nsuccessful in  1981, winning two more TTs, taking his  first GP  pole \npositions and four podium finishes. But the doubts were already \ncreeping in.  That year’s TT  was marred by  death and controversy — \nHonda and Suzuki got involved in a  nasty wrangle over Croz’s Fl  win, \nHonda famously protesting by wearing all-black livery for the  Senior, in \nwhich Aussie privateer Kenny Blake died. \n‘It  was a  big Honda versus Suzuki fight, a  lot  of controver’y, ~vhich \ntook the  edge off the  enjoyment. And then we  lost  Kenny. I will always \nremember leaving the  paddock with Kenny’s van still parked there, \nclothing hanging on  the  line, that had a  huge impact. That’s why I \ndecided not  to  go back —  I'd won three races and that was enough.’ \nCroz also found himself embroiled in  a  messy tabloid wrangle with \nSheene, after he  had crashed out  of the  lead of the  British GP.  taking \nSheene with him. ‘I was a  bit  naive on  how to  deal with that; I was \nbeing told by various people what I should be saying and it backfired.’ \nAnd then he was axed by Suzuki, because Mamola didn’t want him as  a \nteam-mate, which may or  may not  have had something to do with Croz \nflushing Mamola’s head down the  toilets in the  Pukekohe paddock when \nthe  snotty youngster first raced in New Zealand during the mid-1970s. \nCroz was lucky to  start 1982 with Giacomo Agostini’s Marlboro \nYamaha team, or  so  he  thought.

It was the  only \nexcuse he needed to  head home. ‘All  of a  sudden racing lost  its  appeal; \nI'd  taken up  flying and that was consuming for me.’ \nOver the  next three seasons Croz rode occasional races for  Suzuki in \nJapan, though his heart wasn’t in it. ‘I’d be halfway through a race and \nI'd  go  “what the  fuck am  I doing here?”, every lap was a  real wrong \none, then all of a sudden it’d  click in and away I'd go and 20 laps would \ndisappear without me  even thinking and I’d  be  “shit what happened \nthere?” It was then that I decided enough was enough.’ \nNow 50,  Crosby isn’t too  worried that he  never achieved his  full \npotential. ‘You always have regrets but I’m still alive and I only ever \nbroke one collarbone, so  I came out  of it remarkably well; there’s so \nmany other people who aren’t around.’ Since retiring for  good, Croz \nhas run his  own motorcycle shop, sold cars and become a builder.

Now that \nreally is blue-sky thinking... \nHonda: two-wheel drive, active triple \nHonda came up with two designs, one for now, one for ten  years hence. \nTheir dream machine for  now is  a  250 horsepower, 834cc four-stroke \ninline triple with pneumatic valves, hub-centre steering, active geometry, \npart-time two-wheel drive, linked brakes, shaft drive, 16-inch tyres, \nactive suspension and a semi-automatic gearbox. \nThey reckon the  bike would rev  to  19,000rpm, surpass 350kmh and \nbeat most MotoGP lap  records by  about 10  per cent, which would \nequate to  an  improvement of  around ten seconds at  a  racetrack of \naverage length. And all performance factors —  both engine and chassis \n—  would adjust actively according to weather and track conditions. \n‘We chose hub-centre steering because we  wanted to  make a  bike \nwith active wheelbase and geometry, which would adjust itself for \ncornering, and this  would be impossible with telescopic forks,’ explains \nHonda Racing Corporation managing director Satoru Horiike. ‘We also \nthink two-wheel drive is a good way to  go in the  future, very useful for \nboth front- and rear-end traction. But this is just an  idea; so  far  HRC \ndoesn’t have any two-wheel drive prototypes.’ \nThe bike’s geometry —  wheelbase, ride height and so  on  —  would \nadjust automatically for  each corner and straight. During acceleration \nand deceleration the bike would be long and  low for stability, but during \ncornering the wheelbase would shorten from 1430mm to  1390mm and \nthe centre of  gravity would rise for quick steering and greater \nmanoeuvrability. HRC won't say  how they'd achieve this adjustment \nbut  it’d  take gyroscopes, sensors and plenty of electronics. The triple’s \nfront wheel would be driven by an  electric motor during corner exits to \nimprove traction and turning. \nHonda: way-out two-wheeler \nIs it a bird? Is it  a plane?

Their \nsolution to  this issue was creating a  super-fat, super-low-profile \n800/10-14 rear tyre and a  two-part carbon-fibre monocoque chassis \nthat is, quite literally, hinged in the  middle. The rider sits  in a reclined \n‘armchair-style’ sitting position in  the  front section, which leans fully \nduring cornering while the  rear rolls slightly through centrifugal force, \nthe barrel-shaped rear tyre delivering a  massive footprint. The 400 \nhorsepower supercharged 800cc engine is  housed in  the  rear section. \nWheelbase is  1500mm. \nKawasaki believe that this machine —  with huge horsepower, \nmassive grip, very low centre of gravity and ultra-slippery aerodynamics \n—  will deliver lap times that would give an  Fl  car a  run for \nits  money. \nAnd Furuhashi didn’t stop at  designing a  motorcycle. He  believes \nMotoGP needs more than just radical new bikes. ‘We propose that \nracetracks should be  shorter, so  spectators can see all  the course at \nonce, like the  Valencia MotoGP track or  like Supercross,’ he  says. ‘We \nwould also want all  teams to  run  engines of the  same specification, so \nthe  rider becomes the  main player of MotoGP, which will produce very \nclose and exciting races.’ \nOnly one problem: HRC’s Satoru Horiike reckons he patented a very \nsimilar idea some years ago! \nTom O’Kane: bat-mobile (with rocket launchers) \nChris Vermeulen’s Suzuki crew chief Tom O’Kane has  worked in  GPs \nsince the  late 1980s, first on  Team Roberts’ factory Yamahas, then on \nthe  squad’s own two-stroke triple and four-stroke V5.

Pedrosa is miniscule but he’s not  miserable, he just takes his job \nvery, very seriously. Although he  is now mentioned in the  same breath \nas  Freddie Spencer, because he’s the  first rider since Fast Freddie to \nachieve such success in a rookie premier-class season, Dani Boy is more \nlike Eddie Lawson or  Mick Doohan in his  attitude to  the  sport: first of \nall,  racing is a job, second, it is a  science and must be  treated as  such, \nthird, if people enjoy watching the  racing, so  be  it, though this is not \nreally his  concern. \nThese are  not  good times to  hold such dangerous beliefs, Valentino \nRossi has seen to  that. Nowadays every MotoGP star is expected to  be \na  party clown —  as  you sit  on  the  grid preparing to  get  nasty with the \nworld’s greatest riders you are  expected to  wave daftly at  the  cameras, \nlike you’ve just spotted your neighbour’s five-year-old son  on  your way \nto  the corner shop.

I am  not  worried if Rossi retires and then my  style isn’t the \nsame as  his  and people don’t like  it.’ \nQuite simply, Pedrosa prefers if people appreciate him for  what he \ndoes during a race, not  after it.  ‘It  is  a big emotion to  feel  that people \nlike  you for  what you do,  but  I like it more when I feel they like me \nbecause I have ridden a great race, not  because I make a great party on \nthe \npodium.’ \nIn \nthis \nrespect \nhe \nis \nvery \nsimilar \nto \nLawson \nand \nDoohan \n(his—all-time \nracing \nhero, \nwhich \nexplains \na \nlot), \nthough \nhe \nis \nless \nbrusque \nand \nmore \npolite \nthan \nGP \nracing’s \nbiggest \nwinners \nof \nthe \n1980s \nand  1990s. \nAnd \nyet  \nthe \n20-year-old \nhas \na  \nbig \nfollowing, \nespecially \nin  \nSpain, \nwhere \ngangs \nof \nteenage \ngirls \nthrong \nround \nthe  \nback \ndoor \nof \nthe  \nRepsol \nHonda \npit, \nscreaming: \n‘Dani! \nDani! \nDani’, \njust \nlike \nthe \nValenteeniboppers \nat  \nMugello. \nPedrosa \nis \nan  \nunlikely \nsex  \nsymbol \nand \nhe \ncertainly \ndoesn’t"

In fact Pedrosa is in no  hurry to make any friends in the paddock, \nwhether they be journalists, rivals or members of his own team. ‘I don’t \ngo out  fishing or  anything with my mechanics, we  do our  jobs, they go \nhome, I go  my  home.’ Casey Stoner, a  rival in  125s, 250s and now in \nMotoGP is  stunned by  Pedrosa’s chilly paddock persona. ‘He won't \ncommunicate at  all  or  make any eye  contact,’ says the  Aussie. ‘Maybe \nhe’s got a problem with me.’ \nThis is my second one-on-one interview with Pedrosa since he arrived \nin  GPs in 2001. When I first interviewed him in  2002 he hardly got  a \nword in  edgeways, Puig answering most of  the  questions. This time \nPuig is  again present in  the  interview room, along with two Repsol \nHonda media personnel who hover on  the sidelines, apparently nervous \nthat the  interview might prove all  too  much for their treasured charge. \nIn  fact Pedrosa seems to enjoy the  chat, absolutely confident but  never \ncocky, sometimes funny, sometimes raising an  eyebrow if he thinks I’m \ngetting a bit  too  tasty with my  line of questioning. \nNot surprisingly, the subject of Rossi comes up several times. He is aware \nthat MotoGP’s long-time ruler has taken a  few swipes at  him, most \nfamously at  Donington 2006, where a  journalist asked Rossi if he  was \nexcited about sharing a podium for the  first time with MotoGP’s up-and- \ncoming star. ‘Oh yes,’ beamed Rossi. ‘So excited I pissed myself!’ \nPedrosa is more oblique when talking about his  most famous rival, \nperhaps because he knows he could never win a war of words with the \nglobally popular Italian who has  been premier-class champ five times \nsince Pedrosa arrived in GPs. I ask him if he’s impressed by his MotoGP \nrivals. ‘I think they have good talent but  for  sure I know other people \nwith more talent,’ he  replies, referring to  his  childhood heroes Ayrton \nSenna and Lance Armstrong. Even Rossi? ‘I don’t know if it’s  talent or \nexperience, or  the  team and the  whole package, I just feel he’s very \nstrong and he always tries to win.’ And you know Pedrosa is a real racer \nwhen he implies that Rossi’s god-like status is just another target: ‘For \nme  he is a good opportunity to prove my  ability as  a rider.’ \nHis  abilities have so  far  taken him to  the  125  world title at  his  third \nattempt (Rossi managed that in his  second season), to  the  250 title in \nhis \ndebut \nyear \n(Rossi \ntook \ntwo \nseasons \nto \nwin \nin \n250s) \nand \nto \nhis \nfirst"

Mussolini was well impressed when he visited the  factory \nin  1940, so  much so  that Ducati was pressed into manufacturing \nmilitary equipment, first by  Mussolini, then, after the Italians \nsurrendered in  1943, by the  Nazis. Hence the  1944 visit by hundreds of \nFlying Fortresses in the  aptly named Operation Pancake. \nWith their factory flattened and the war over, the Ducati brothers \ndecided to build a new factory and have a go at making motorcycles to get \nwar-ravaged Italy back on  the road. Their first bike, Il Cucciolo (the Puppy), \nwas no more than a bicycle with a tiny 1.5bhp engine attached, very similar \nto  Soichiro Honda’s first bike, the Putt Putt, also created in 1946. \nStrange beginnings for a  company now nicknamed ‘the Ferrari of \nmotorcycling’, the only biking brand outside Japan capable of \nhumbling the mighty Honda. Ducati’s achievements in racing —  both in \nMotoGP and World Superbike —  are  remarkable when you consider the \nsize of  the company. In  a  good year the Bolognese production lines \nmake 40,000 bikes, while Honda churns out  several million. \nBut  to  fully understand Ducati’s racetrack prowess you need to  look \nat  some different numbers. Of Ducati’s 1000 staff, 100  (or  10 per  cent) \nwork at  Ducati Corse, while 125 engineers toil at  Honda Racing \nCorporation, around 0.4  per  cent of Honda’s 30,000 workforce.

So  Ducati’s \ncommitment to  racing is 25  times greater than Honda’s and 130 times \nbigger than Kawasaki's. \nIn other words, Ducati is a large race shop with a smallish production \nline attached. And the  company lives or  dies by its  race results. Few \npeople remember that just two decades ago  Ducati seemed doomed to \ncollapse. Two things saved it from those dark days —  the  seminal 748cc \neight-valve v-twin built by Massimo Bordi, understudy to the legendary \nFabio Taglioni, and the  creation of the  World Superbike series.

The 20-year-old qualified \non  pole for the 2006 Qatar GP making him the second youngest premier- \nclass pole-sitter after American legend Freddie Spencer. ‘I expected it to \ntake two years to  get a pole, not  two races,’ said the  former 125  and 250 \nGP winner who went on  to lead that race until leg cramps and a dose of \nthe  ‘flu  slowed him.

If you don’t \nhave the setting pretty much perfect in  125s and 250s you're pretty \nwell buggered for the  race. In MotoGP it’s a little easier to pull it out  of \nthe bag if the bike isn’t perfect, as  you’ve seen Rossi do many times. He \nqualifies terrible, then wins the  race. \nIn  MotoGP the  main thing you've got  to  do  is get  the  power to  the \nground and towards the end of the race is when that gets real important. \nIf you've got the  riding style and a  good feeling to  get the  power to  the \nground, you can  pretty much make whatever you want out  of the bike. \nDoes your style change much during the course of a race? \nYeah, \nat \nthe  \nstart \nof \nthe \nrace \nyou \ntrust \nthe  \ntyres \na \nlittle \nbit \nmore \nand \nyou \npush \nthe \nbike \ninto \nthe \ncorners \na \nlittle \nbit \nmore \nbecause \nthe \ntyres \nare \nthere. \nTowards \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \nrace \nyou \ntake \nit \na \nlittle \neasier, \nyou \njust \ntry \nand \nconcentrate \non \ngetting \nthe \nrear \ngrip \nto \nhook \nup \nand \nthat \nmakes \na \nlot \nof \ntime. \nIs that easy with traction control? \nI \ndon’t \nknow \nwhat \nthe \nYamaha \nand \nthe \nother \nbikes \nare \nlike. \nWith \nthe \nHonda \nthe \ntraction \ncontrol \nis \nthere \nto \na \ncertain \ndegree \nbut \nit \ndoesn’t \nhelp \na \nheck \nof \na \nlot. \nYeah, \nwhen \nthe \ntyres \nare \nterrible \nat \nthe \nend \nof \na \nrace \nthen \nit \ncan \nhelp \nbecause \nit \nsaves \nyou \nenergy \nand \nyou \ndon’t \nhave \nto \nconcentrate \nso \nhard \non \nkeeping \nthe \nthing \nhooked \nup. \nBut \nthe \nbikes \nare \na \nlot \nmore \npowerful \nthan \nanything \nelse \naround \nso \nthey \nneed \ntraction \ncontrol, \nif \nyou \ndidn’t \nhave \nit \nthe \ntyres \nwould \nbe \nbuggered \nin \na \nfew \nlaps, \nso \nit \ndefinitely \nhelps \nwhen \nthe \ntyres \naren’t \ngreat. \nIn  \npractice \nat  \nthe  \nSachsenring \nmy  \ntraction \ncontrol \nwasn’t \nworking \nbut \nI \nwas \nonly \na \ncouple \nof \ntenths \noff \nwhat \nI \nwas \nnormally \ndoing. \nIt’s \nno"

I’m  impressed by the  fact that every week they’re up \nfront and they’re always fighting hard, there’s no  easy race. In  125s or \n250s, if you have a  good set-up and some people are  having a bad day, \nthat’s it, they’re nowhere to  be  seen. In  MotoGP everyone has a  good \nday at  every race pretty much, they’re always running up  front. That’s \nthe  hardest thing to  get your head around. \nWho impresses you  the most? \nValentino, of course, and I’ve  got a lot of respect for Dani. What Dani has \ndone this year is very impressive, I’m kind of proud to step up to MotoGP \nat  the  same time as  him. He  is running second in the  championship in \nhis first year; he can’t really be too  upset about that. If I had finished the \nraces I hadn’t finished I'd  be in a lot better place as  well, but  we  didn’t \ncome in this season to  even think of running where we  are  running, so \nI’ve got to  be happy with what we  are  doing. \nDo you gauge yourself against Dani? \nNot really, because we’re racing so  many more people. Last year in 250s \nit was kinda just us  two consistently running up  front. In MotoGP the \ntop five are  always running up  front, it’s  a lot harder work, it’s  not  just \nbetween me  and him. \nAre you mates? \nWe  used to  be  until we  were in  the  same class. He  doesn’t seem to \ncommunicate with me, at all, or  make any  eye  contact. I’ve  never had a \nproblem with him and I respect him as a racer, but  maybe he’s got  a \nproblem with me. I don’t know why, maybe because we  came through \nat  the  same time. We  both came through Alberto Puig’s schooling. But \nI've  got  no  problems with him and at  one stage we  got on  pretty well. \nAre you  sad you never got to race 500s? \nI’m  sure Dani's got  the  same opinion as  me.

This is how JB learned \nhis  legendary problem-solving skills \nEngines and engineering would seem to run in Jeremy Burgess’ blood. \nA  century before JB  won his  first world championship with Wayne \nGardner in 1987, his great-uncles David and John Shearer were creating \nAustralia’s first motor car, a  wood-burning, steam-driven vehicle \nequipped with a  differential, a decade before Henry Ford’s seminal Tin \nLizzy featured a  diff. The Shearer creation now takes pride of place in \nAustralia’s national motor museum, near Adelaide, JB’s hometown. \n‘The car  looks like  anything that Benz built in the  first days when all \nthose guys realised that trains ran  on  rails and that a  smaller steam \nengine would drive something on  the  road,’ says Burgess, a self-taught \nengineer who isn’t so  sure that engines do run  in his blood. He  reckons \nhis  love of engineering is a factor of nurture, not  nature, of his  growing \nup  on  the  family farm, surrounded by agricultural machinery. \n‘My father always insisted that my mechanical knowledge came \nfrom the  Shearers but  my brother is a lawyer and my  sister is a  doctor, \nso  I’m  not  so  sure,’ he adds. ‘I think any  young bloke growing up  on  a \nfarm in  the  Adelaide hills with machinery all  around would’ve picked \nup  on  all of that.’ \nWhat seems more certain is that the rough and tumble of rural Aussie \nlife and then of the Aussie bike-racing circuit equipped JB with the ability \nand the resolve to get stuck in and solve problems quickly.

Compared to the  Suzuki \nthe TZ didn’t have the calibre, it just wasn’t a purebred racing motorcycle \nlike  the  RG,  it was cheap, but  they made bucket loads of them and they \ndid  a good job.’ \nBy now JB  was starting to  dream about joining Hansford and the \nrest in Europe. But in the  end he made the  trip as  a holidaymaker, not \nas  a  racer. His  own racing career lost momentum after his  travelling \ncompanion got killed in a streetbike crash. ‘I never retired, I just stopped \ndoing it!’  At  the  end of ’79  JB  sold his  race bikes, took six  weeks off \nwork and headed to  Europe, part holiday, part recce, just in  case he \ndecided to  continue racing. Inevitably his  savings ran  out  sooner than \nexpected and he applied for a job as  mechanic to racing prodigy Randy \nMamola, who had just signed for  Suzuki. \nJB’s bike preparation in Australian championship racing had always \nbeen immaculate and it was this reputation that got him the job working \non  Mamola’s factory RG500s. ‘The guys at  Suzuki knew my RG ran  when \nothers broke,’ says JB, who still works by his  father’s axiom, the  five  Ps: \nperfect preparation prevents poor performance. So  his  fascination with \nall things mechanical was starting to pay big dividends and had put him \non  the road to world-class success. ‘When I was racing back home, mates \nwould drive up  the  driveway with their girlfriends and I’d  be up  to  my \nelbows in a TZ  gearbox or  an  RG  rotary valve or  whatever. They'd hang \naround for  half an  hour and then go  off,  but  I never felt  compelled to \ndrop the  tools and go with them, I was doing what I wanted to  do.’ \nBurgess fettled Mamola’s bikes for  three years, winning five GPs, \nthen when Suzuki downsized to  a  one-man team in  1983 he  got  a job \nwith HRC, spannering for Ron Haslam. He worked with Freddie Spencer \nduring the  American’s unique 250/500 title-winning year in  1985 and \ngot his  first crew chief job with Gardner the  following season. In  1987 \nJB  and the Wollongong wild one defeated reigning champ Eddie \nLawson to win the  500 title.

So you're 500 miles from the  city and you can’t get a new \npart, so  you've got  to  fix what you've got, so  you heat it, weld it, cut  it, \nwhatever. The mentality is there —  how can  we  keep it going?’ \nAlthough the make-do mentality no  longer applies in top-level racing \nwhere parts mileage is automatically logged by computer and everything \nis  replaced in  good time, the process of  thinking your way through \nproblems does still count. JB’s approach is  always straightforward, \nunlike many engineers who seem to get too  caught up in the complexity \nof it all,  and it is ironic that the  more complicated racing becomes, the \nmore vital it is to  have a  simple approach.

Two-stroke advocates argue that the  acute nature \nof the two-stroke race bike —  both in its set-up and behaviour —  educates \nracers better. This is why, they say,  MotoGP is packed with former 125 \nand 250 riders, not  ex-Superbike or  Supersport men. ‘Top MotoGP guys \ncome from categories in which you don’t just use  the  bike, you must \nknow about set-up,’ says Harald Bartol, KTM’s 125  and 250 engineer. \n‘To  me, 600s is donkey racing. A 600 is not  a  race bike, it’s  not  a race- \nhorse.’ The ACU, who axed the  250 British series in  favour of  600s, \nshould ponder Bartol’s words as  they consider the lack of British talent \nin MotoGP. \nBut perhaps it won’t always be  so.  Racing technology is  getting so \ngood that a  two-stroke education may soon be  unnecessary. Burgess \nadds that MotoGP engines are  already largely ‘self-adjusting’. And \nMorris admits that while changing a  gearbox ratio by less than 2mph \ncan  crucially affect a two-stroke’s performance, 4mph either way is fine \non  a MotoGP bike. So who needs the  finely trained ear  of a  two-stroke \nracer? Then there is  Bartol complaining that some KTM GP  rookies \nwho don’t even know when an  engine has seized. But there’s good \nreason for  this. Massive improvements in lubrication, carburation and \nmetallurgy mean that youngsters may never have experienced a seizure, \nso  they don’t have ears tuned to  anticipate the  stroker’s death rattle or \nthe  gunslinger clutch-hand reactions that may have saved their lives a \nfew decades ago. \nThe 250s and 125s aren’t set  to  disappear from GPs any time now \n(250s are  safe till 2012, 125s to 2014) but  they will go eventually, which \nwill be a  tragedy because there is nothing more graceful on  a racetrack \nthan a 250 GP bike.

It was a recipe \nfor  disaster and great television with crashes aplenty and ten-rider \ndogfights for  the  lead. They even used to  get  Barry Sheene to  do  the \ncommentary. ‘Blimey,’ he’d say.  ‘You need a Valium to watch this.’ \nWith no  way of gaining a  technical advantage over \nyour rivals, Pro-Am came down to  knees, elbows and \n‘You were racing some of the dirtiest riding ever seen on  a racetrack.

During those years he rode pretty much everything —  from official \nYamahas and Hondas to  the  Britten and a BMW K100 proddie bike. \nJefferies, now in his  50s, comes from a Yorkshire family in the  north \nof England that is inextricably linked to  the  event, through both glory \nand tragedy. His  father Allan rode his  first TT  in  1933 and finished \nsecond to  Geoff Duke in  his  last, the 1949 Clubmans Senior TT.  His \nbrother Tony won three TTs  in  the  early 1970s and his  nephew Dave \nbecame an  Island great by scoring three consecutive hat tricks from \n1999 to 2002 before losing his  life in a high-speed crash during practice \nfor  the  2003 races. Remarkably, Jefferies was back on  the  Island just a \ncouple of  months after DJ’s death, doing the  Manx GP  classic race \naboard a Manx Norton. \nYou grew up in a  TT family; what made it so attractive? \nIt’s  the  nearest thing to  riding your road bike on  that imaginary road \nyou had in  mind when you were falling asleep at  night, that road in \nWales or  Scotland or  wherever, where you could really have a  go.  The \nTT  did  all that for me. Before I started racing, when I was trials riding, \nI was always tear-arsing around the  Yorkshire roads. I had my  own \nimaginary TT course, of similar length to the TT, and I used to  go out  in"

So when I first rode the TT, \nthe circuit was so  good compared to  what I’d  been doing on  the \nYorkshire roads that it didn’t seem that hard. Not to  say  it was easy. \nI did all the road circuits —  Macau, the  North West 200, Scarborough, \nand I won the  Ulster GP.  I used to  find Donington and other short \ncircuits a real challenge and I loved them but  I got a bit dizzy and it was \nall a bit frenetic. The TT was all more gentlemanly, they line you up one \nat  a  time, then they come to your number and it’s  ‘Right, Mr  Jefferies, \nit’s  your turn to  go,  off you go  now’. I felt  it was a  more gentlemanly \nway of racing. I wasn’t a very good dicer, I wasn’t good at  pushing the \nfront wheel underneath other riders. I wasn’t good at that, it didn’t suit \nme. I just love the  Isle  of Man, being given the  freedom to  ride at  my \nown pace, it just suited me.

The first big one, I had just been passed by Carl Fogarty, it was in the \nwet 1990 Senior TT.  He  passed me  and I was on a slick rear and treaded \nfront. I just rode it too hard on  the wrong tyres trying to keep up with him. \nI lost it after Sarah’s Cottage, going onto the  Cronk-y-Voddy straight. I \nknocked myself about a bit: bad ankle, bad shoulder, bad lots of things. \nThe other one was when I had an  experimental gearbox seize on  a \nCBR600 in  morning practice. I’d  just caught Joey Dunlop going into \nGreeba Castle and that was the  last thing I knew. I was quite poorly \nfrom that, lost  all the ligaments in me  knee from that one, that was an \nunconscious job. \nThe third one was when the  suspension collapsed on  my  RC45. It \nwas our  fault, we’d modified the  shock. The whole back end collapsed \nbefore the  left  hander after Ballacraine. I was off  the  bike before I got \nto the bend. That was another airlift [helicopter] job. I lost the ligaments \nin  me  other knee, broken toes, broken arm, broken shoulder, I broke \nquite a  few things. But they’re not  serious injuries compared to  what \nyou can  have on  the  Isle  of Man at  those sorts of speeds. I always got \nback on  again, I didn’t want to  finish on  a low. \nApart from the win, what's your best  TT memory? \nIt was a  privilege for  me  to  ride in  teams alongside Carl Fogarty, Steve \nHislop and Joey Dunlop. Bearing in mind that I started life as a trials rider, \nI used to pinch myself that I was actually riding alongside these giants of \nthe  sport. Believe me, to  follow these legends around the  TT  course or \nMacau or  the Ulster or  the  North West 200  was a sight to behold and  will \nlive  with me  for  the  rest of my  days. The things they could do  with a \nmotorcycle, and I would highlight Hizzy [Hislop] here, beggars belief. \nWhat's important when you  ride the TT? \nTo  accomplish what I call  a  clean lap —  it might not  be  absolutely the \nfastest you  can  do, but it’s  a bit like a good round of golf, you're trying to \naspire to the best you can  do. If you  can  achieve a lap where your braking \npoints are  right, you  put  the power on  at  the right place, your apexes are \nclipped and you  come out  of the corners on  line, on  the power and in the \nright gear, if you just do all that without trying too  hard and if you  know \nexactly where you're going, it'll  still be a very good lap."

So \nwhat makes him so  good? \nNot very long ago Valentino Rossi was bike racing’s King Midas, the \ngolden boy who could do  no  wrong. He  was a  genius motorcycle racer \nand it  seemed he  was even more than that, because while his  talent \nwon him dozens of races and a pile of world titles he seemed to have an \nalmost supernatural power to  make things go his  way, even when the \nodds were stacked heavily against him. \nNot any more, though. Things have changed over the  past year and \na half; Rossi has  lost the  crown he  had made his  own, proving that he \nis  in  fact only human. ‘Unbeatable superheroes only exist in  movies, \nreal life  is different,’ he  said after losing the  crown in 2006. \nSo Rossi is human and a fallible human at that. Nowadays bad  things \nhappen to  the  former MotoGP king, he  makes mistakes and he  loses \nraces, so  the  glitter is tarnished. But  despite the bike problems, the  tyre \nwoes and the  crashes, there’s no  doubt that he  is one of the  greatest \nriders of  all  time. So  what’s so  great about the seven-time world \nchampion’s methods, his psychology, his talent and his racecraft? \nWe decided to  ask the people who really know, those who get to \nwatch him up  close, both on  the track and in  the pits: the man \nwho made him king, his  crew chief Jeremy Burgess, the  man who \nfirst stole his crown, Nicky Hayden, and his Yamaha team-mate \nColin Edwards. \nThis trio  of paddock personalities call  Rossi a lot of things —  foxy, sly, \nvicious, crazy, serious, focused, aggressive, clean —  but perhaps it’s \nBurgess who gets to the root of it all.

Perhaps JB  helped format Rossi's racing brain to \nwork unerringly logically, but  Rossi would probably have worked it out \nanyway. His  intelligence is obvious to all —  you see  it in his  eyes, hear it \nwhen he  opens his  mouth, witness it at  work when he  cuts another \nmasterful manoeuvre on  the  track. \nThis brain power is  also the most vital ingredient in  his  talent, \nbecause he has  the ability to decode what he feels on  the bike, either to \nride faster or  to  make the  bike better. This isn’t easy; many riders get \nlost in  the  labyrinth of  machine settings —  they focus on  the  wrong \nissues, give confusing feedback to  their technicians, waste time trying \nto fix problems that can’t be fixed. Rossi isn’t like  that, he knows where \nhe  wants to  go,  he  gives crystal clear feedback and never expects the \nbike to  be  100 per cent perfect. This is  hugely important because \nmotorcycle racing is  a  technical sport, it  involves ultra-high-tech \nmachinery so  it requires a  scientific mind. As  his  Ohlins suspension \ntechnician Mike Norton says: ‘Valentino is very good because he’s very \nmethodical... he  doesn’t dwell on  problems... he’s very black and \nwhite, very clinical. It’s  very rare he  can’t tell  you what’s going on  but \nif he can’t feel  any difference, he'll say  so.’ \nTrue, Rossi does appear to  have an  amazingly natural feel for \nmotorcycle riding but that comes from a  combination of brainpower \nand miles covered, which seems to  have created some kind of \ninformation superhighway between the  tyres, his  brain and everything \nin between. Rossi and his  motorcycle are  apparently wired together, so \nthey work as  a  single unit. \nRossi’s psychology is  also very strong, though it’ll be  interesting to \nsee  how he reacts in  the  long term to  Stoner’s current domination. He \nreally enjoys what he  does and that’s another major factor in  his \nsuccess. Racing isn’t only a job, it’s  something he  loves, he  loves it all, \nfrom poring over computer data readouts with his  engineers to  playing \nmind \ngames \nwith \nhis \nrivals, \nto \nsticking \nit \nup \nthe \ninside \nof \nthose \nrivals \nat  the  hairpin. As  Edwards says, he is sly."

      "text": "408 THE FAST STUFF \nHis  upbringing probably has a lot to do with his  psyche. His  dad was \na wise, open-minded teacher who didn’t bring Valentino up  as  a racer \nfirst and a human being second. Many modern-day racers who've been \nracing since they were four years old  aren’t rounded human beings \nbecause they’ve never had the chance to  become rounded human \nbeings. Rossi is mature and worldly wise, that’s why he  is  so  good at \ndealing with people, which helps him excel in pit lane and outside in \nthe  everyday world. \nHe  seems an  objective person, aware that there is a bigger world out \nthere, so  he  fully understands that he  is only playing a  game, albeit a \ngame he plays to win. Many other riders are  apparently engulfed by the \nenormity of what they’re involved in  —  they truly believe that what \nthey’re doing is the  most important thing in  the  world. Rossi’s make- \nup is the opposite of the  standard template for modern sporting success \n—the no-life sports star who eats, breathes and sleeps his  sport to ensure \nhe  is  always one step ahead of  the competition. Rossi does work \nincredibly hard at  his  racing, but  he’s got  a  life  beyond it, which is  a \nvital counterpoint to  his  brilliance on  the  racetrack. \nRossi is also very brave, incredibly brave. In fact he is a bit of a nutter, \nprepared to win pretty much by any  means necessary. We have seen his \ndark side in  action on  plenty of occasions, most memorably when he \nrammed the  hapless Sete Gibernau off the  track at  Jerez in 2005. Troy \nBayliss called him a  maniac, which is  pretty rich. Edwards calls him \nvicious, which is fair  enough, because however nice you might be  off \nthe  racetrack you need to  be  very nasty on  the  track if you’re going \nanywhere. As  George Orwell wrote: ‘Serious sport has nothing to  do \nwith fair play. It  is  bound up  with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, \ndisregard of all  rules and sadistic pleasure in  witnessing violence. In \nother words, it is war minus the shooting.’ \nSo  if you want to  be  another Rossi, this is what you need in  your \ncharacter make-up: plenty of brains and bravery, a bit of ebullience and \na  certain viciousness. Couldn’t be easier, eh? \nThe team-mate: Colin Edwards : \nColin Edwards first partnered Rossi in  the 2000 Suzuka Eight Hours and he’s \nbeen his full-time MotoGP team-mate for three seasons. \n‘We started as  team-mates at the  Suzuka Eight Hours in 2000. It’s  cool, \nwe  get  along great and I have the  luxury to  go  in the  garage and look"

There are  times when I feel like I’m hitting my  head \nagainst a wall, it’s like  “Why am I losing so  much time in section three? \nOr whatever”. It’s  pretty easy, you overlay the  data and you go “Ah, all \nright, now I see  how fast you can go  through that corner”, so  it helps \nout. And nowadays with GPS you can even look at  what lines he’s \ntaking. Sure, it’s  not  as  easy as  that, you don’t just hold the  gas  on  for \nanother sécond, you have to  analyse it and work out  how. \n‘My own assessment of Valentino is that he’s like  a  16-year-old who \nnever grew up.  He’s always having fun  and he’s fun to  be  around. He \nlooks at riding a motorcycle like my daughter looks at riding her bicycle \n—  it’s  something fun to  do.  It’s a little bit  different to  the  approach of \nmost guys on  the grid who are  maybe gritty, hard faced and determined. \nValentino has  got  all that, he just has  a  different way of showing it, he \ngoes out  there and enjoys the  battle. \n‘I’ve never really felt like he  gets enough credit for  how hard he \nworks, there’s always that myth that he  always has the  best bikes and \nso  on.  But until I arrived at  Yamaha I’d  never seen anybody work as \nhard as  I do,  so  I was like Wow, he  does work hard as  well”. I don’t \nthink many people realise that.

When he \nmakes the  kind of  mistake that would have most people sliding on \ntheir asses into the gravel, he  seems to  somehow gather it  back. \nOccasionally he’ll overcook it but  the  way he  gets away with it makes \nyou go  “how the  hell?”. \n‘Like Donington 2005, that really wet race. I locked up  the  front a \ncouple of times and it scared the  shit out  of me, so  I was cruisin’ with \nthe  pack and the  next thing you know he just pisses \noff. I looked at  his  data and it was scary. That guy \n‘I looked at his data was locking the  front in  the  rain on a shitty track \nand it was scary — that was slicker than snot, every other corner he just \nhis front was locked had it  locked. I  said to  him “Was your front \nevery corner — this locked?”and he  said “Oh yeah, a  couple of  times \nguy’s crazy!’ pretty bad”. Then I looked at  the computer and it was \nlike, a couple of times? Fuck, it was every corner, this \nguy’s crazy! That was probably the  most impressive \nride, I could look at  the  computer and actually see  how much locking \nwas going on,  it was crazy. I almost crashed a  couple of times and my \nlocks weren't as  bad as  his. I was like “oh fuck!” and he’s just like, \nsssrrrccccchh, that'll be  all  right, yeah! (Edwards mimes the act  of \nflicking the  bike into a  turn with the  front end ploughing sideways.) \n‘T really don’t think he’s got  any weaknesses. Guys keep saying he’s \ngonna go F1  or  rallying and I say  “no  way”. He  looks at all that stuff as \nfun, he  gets an  opportunity to  drive the  cars, it’s  just fun. He’s smart, \nhe  plays the  part so  people think this is what he’s thinking about. He \nloves and enjoys rallying and maybe later he  may do  that but I don’t \nthink he’ll give up  motorcycles the way it is at  the  moment. \n‘To  him motorcycle racing is  a  puzzle. If you put it  into climbing \nterms he’s got to work out  how to  get up  the wall. As  far as  making the \npass and pulling away, that’s the  crux, he has  to  figure out  that puzzle, \nwhere he needs to pass before the three or  four corners where he knows \nhe  can pull a  little gap and demoralise the  guy, that’s what he’s doing \nthe  whole time. Valentino doesn’t make unnecessary passes. Even at \nQatar in 2007 he was passing Stoner to  play with him, to  see  what he \nhad. He doesn’t do anything too  hasty, except maybe the first lap or  two \nwhen he'll do  some hasty things to  get up  front.’"

Clearly the  methods we  used to  use  on  500s \nand now use  in MotoGP differ somewhat from the methods he used at \nAprilia, the  basic is to  understand that the  bike won’t be  exactly how \nyou want it when you wheel it out  of  the  trailer, so  you have to  set \nabout attacking the  problems in  a  logical order in  a  given amount of \ntime.

There are  days when it might grind you the  wrong way and I’m \nsure there are  days when Valentino would rather be  in  Ibiza. But as \nlong as  he enjoys the  challenge of his  employment on  most days, that’s \nall we  need. \n‘He only uses mind games when people make a serious challenge, then \nhe pulls out  that extra tool  in his armoury, which he did with Max, with \nSete and to  a lesser degree with Marco. Then there’s Loris, who is also a \nserious challenge, but  there’s a  different understanding between them, \nthere’s a respect. When I first worked with Valentino he was mates with \nMarco.

In  the \nmeantime society’s attitudes were turned upside down, not least its \nattitude towards youth, while sport metamorphosed from a  game for \nmoneyed amateurs into a form of dynamic advertising. \nBack in the  1940s kids didn’t even get out  of school shorts until they \nwere well into their teens. Surtees had to  wait until he was 13  for  his \nfirst bike ride and a further three years before his  first roadrace, having \nspent the  previous ten  learning to  put bikes together with little more \nthan a screwdriver and a piece of string. \nStoner and Rossi grew up  in  an  age obsessed with youth, when \nteenagers can do  things they never dreamed of  doing half a  century \nearlier. Stoner was sitting on  the back of a minibike working the throttle \nwhen he was 18  months old  and riding around the  garden at  three. A \nyear later he  competed in his  first dirt track race and aged six  he won \nhis  first Australian title. Rossi rode his  first minibike aged two and a \nhalf, was Italian champion by the  age  of 15, contested his  first GP at  16 \nand was a multimillionaire before leaving his  teens. \nThere are  similarities in their upbringings, however. Surtees, Stoner \nand Rossi didn’t have pushy fathers. Colin Stoner, Graziano Rossi and \nJack Surtees were delighted that their kids got a  kick out of  bikes, \njust as  they did, but there was never any question of their sons being \npushed into racing. Dad Surtees was still pursuing his  own racing \ncareer when John first got into riding, so  the young teenager was \nmerely happy that his  father showed ‘no resentment, just lots of \nencouragement’. Years later Stoner wanted nothing more than to  go \nracing. During his schoolboy racing days he  saw many kids being \npushed into racing by their fathers, but as  he  says: ‘the good riders \nhave always wanted to  do  it all  their lives’. Rossi was also the  driving \nforce behind his  own entry into competition, initially in go-karts. ‘But \nthe  problem with go-karts is  that they cost very much money,’ he \nrecalls. ‘So  I said to  my  father “Maybe it’s  better we  race with a bike,” \nand he  say  “Ah, bo, really?” \nAnyway, all that really mattered was that Stoner was out  there at the \nyoungest-possible age, as  were Rossi, Surtees, Hailwood and Spencer \nbefore him, learning the  art  of  machine control, as  well as  strategy,"

Stan was a hard-nosed businessman who \nthrew serious money at  Mike’s career from the outset; he  was \ndetermined his  boy would succeed. He  bought the best bikes and \nharangued the media to  get  Mike the best coverage; in  that sense \nHailwood Senior was way ahead of his  time. \nAlthough Hailwood wasn’t legally allowed to  start racing until 17, \nwhen he was working his  apprenticeship at Triumph (making the  tea), \nhis  father gave him a  hand-made miniature motorcycle at  the  age  of \nseven, to  ride around the  grounds of the  family’s Oxfordshire home. \nThat creation, powered by  a  100cc Royal Enfield two-stroke, gave \nHailwood something of a  head start in  an  age  when no  one had even \nthought of mass-producing minibikes. \nLike Surtees and Stoner, Hailwood and Spencer were also made in \ndifferent eras and different cultures. While minibikes didn’t exist when \nHailwood was caning his little Enfield around his dad’s garden during the \n1950s, Spencer grew up in the  1970s, when minibike racing was exploding \nacross the  United States. Spencer’s father dedicated himself to  helping \nFreddie make it in the gritty world of US dirt track, collecting his son  from \nschool on  Friday evenings and spending the weekend driving thousands of \nmiles across the States. They’d do a dirt track Friday night, drive to another \nstate to  roadrace on  the  Saturday, then maybe another dirt track before \nheading back to  school. By the  time he  was 12,  Freddie was already a \nrenegade pro-racer, competing in  ‘outlaw’ dirt track events against real \npros at rodeos, and  then sharing the drive home with his exhausted dad. \nStoner’s dad put  in the  hard yards too  for his  son, driving thousands \nof kilometres across Australia.

Yes, if you listen to  the  riders. Even 800s \ngenius Casey Stoner thinks so.  ‘These things should be 1500s, not  800s,’ \nhe says. ‘In fact I’d rather be on  a  500  two-stroke, they weren't stacked \nout with computer control systems. These 800s, everyone can ride \nthem’. Valentino Rossi thinks the  same: ‘I prefer the  990s because the \nlatest control systems make it harder for the rider to make the difference.’ \nIn other words, the most talented riders want nastier bikes, so  they can \nuse  their rare skills to  beat their lesser rivals. \nRossi’s 2007 Fiat Yamaha team-mate Colin Edwards agrees that \nelectronics have taken some of the  talent out  of MotoGP. ‘You go into a \nturn, you take your line, you open the  gas  and the bike somewhat takes \ncare of itself,’ he  says, which doesn’t sound very difficult at  all.  ‘In  the \nold  days you used to  come out  of a  turn, get  on  the  gas  and you'd go \n“Man, I could’ve got on  it five  metres earlier”, next lap you’re on  it five \nmetres earlier and then you’re flying to  the moon, so  that’s where \ntraction control really helps.’ \nRiders fully rely on  the  technology to keep them out  of trouble. At the \nstart of  2007 I eavesdropped on  Stoner debriefing his  engineers after \npractice. The Aussie had been flicked over the highside when he had got \ntoo  eager with the  throttle, and he  was angry. ‘I  should never have \ncrashed,’ he  told his  crew chief. ‘The traction control should have taken \ncare of it.’  So  Stoner believed that the electronics should have translated \nhis  greedy fistful into exactly the  correct amount of power that the  rear \ntyre could handle at  that moment. This would seem to  be  irrefutable \nevidence that traction control does take the  skill out  of riding. \nAnd yet  if electronics trickery has stolen something from MotoGP \nwith one hand, it  does at  least give something back with the  other \n(when the  technology works, that is). ‘These days we  start a lot of GPs \nwith full  and healthy grids,’ says Edwards. ‘In  years past I don’t know \nhow many times guys like Schwantz, Rainey and Doohan rode with"

In fact, it may even \nmake him slower, as  Stoner says: ‘The engine cuts reduce the power.’ \nThat’s why most riders prefer minimum traction control, so  the \nelectronics cut  the  power just in time to  prevent a  highside. Edwards: \n‘I’ve tried Valentino’s traction control set-up and I didn’t like it, because \nI couldn’t get  the  bike to  spin to  finish the  turn, it kept running me \noff  the  track. You don’t spin the  800s like the  990s, but  you still need \nsome spin.’ \nSince traction control does allow riders to be braver with the  throttle \nthe  fastest guys must find another part of the  corner in which to  make \nthe  difference. Edwards again: ‘Now it’s  all about how you get into the \nturn, and that is only something a  racer can do.

If everyone \nrides the  same and uses the  same lines, how do  they overtake? With \ndifficulty. Most riders agree that passing is less easy with the  800s, and \nnot  only because it’s  difficult to  find an  alternative line to  get  a  way \npast. The 800s have shorter braking zones because they are slower \ndown the  straights and faster into the  turns, so  it’s  more difficult to \novertake on  the  brakes. . \nThis has  required MotoGP engineers to change their focus on  chassis \nsetup, proving that changing riding styles can  affect technology just as \nchanging technology affects riding styles. ‘Braking stability has become \nmore important,’ says O’Kane. ‘And turning has become much more \nimportant, so  the rider can  carry speed into the corner when he gets off \nthe  brakes without the  thing picking itself up  and running wide. For \nbike setup, the  800s are  a different set  of problems.’ \nThe end result of  the  samey riding styles and reduced overtaking \nopportunities is  less close racing. MotoGP used to  be  renowned for \nultra-close battles up  front, but the  800s are  spreading out  the  action. \nDuring the  last three 990 seasons the  average winning margin in  dry \nraces was just 2.07 seconds. During 2007 the gap from winner to second \nplace more than doubled to 4.54 seconds. \nThis isn’t simply because the  800s are  one-line motorcycles which \nmake overtaking so  difficult —  new tyre regulations have also played a \npart. Riders are  now limited to  the number of tyres they can  use  during \na  GP  which must be  chosen before practice starts. Inevitably, some \nriders choose more suitable batches of  tyres than others, so  the \ncompetition is  less equal than before (though some argue it’s  fairer"

So  there’s zero chance of MotoGP diverting from its \ncurrent path. \nWhich might just give World Superbikes a chance to  get one over on \nits  glitzier rival. If WSB boss Paolo Flammini bans traction control by \nequipping bikes with a  ‘control’ ECU, he  might be  able to  offer a \nspectacle that MotoGP has  wilfully denied itself. Then the final decision \nwill come down to  you lot  sitting at  home in  front of the  TV:  do  you \nwant high-brow technology, like Fl  cars, or  lowbrow fun, like Nascar? \nYou decide... \nMotoGP Mutterings: January 2008 \nI’ve \nsmelt \nthe \nfuture \nof \nMotoGP, \nand \nboy, \nit \ndon’t \nhalf \npong \nSmell \nis  \nthe \nmost \nevocative \nof  \nall  \nthe \nsenses, \nwhich \nis  \nwhy \nI’m \nimmediately \ndragged \nback \nto \nmy \nschooldays \n— \nin \na \nwibbly-wobbly \nmovie \nmemory \nkind \nof \na \nway \n— \nupon \nentering \nthe \ncavernous \nRed \nBull \nRookies \nawning \nwithin \nthe \nMotoGP \npaddock. \nThe \natmosphere \nis \nthick \nwith \nthat \nbitter, \nnose-puckering \nstench \nI \nremember \npermeating \nthe \nlocker \nroom \nafter \neach \nmean \nand \ndownright \nvicious \ngame \nof \nrugby \nI \nplayed \nin \nmy \nteens. \nExcept \nthat \nin \nRed \nBull \nRookies’ \nworld \nthe \nreek \nof"

And perhaps that’s what really makes your \nnasal hairs stand on  end: it’s  the  heady stench of youthful ambition \nintermingled with the  odour of fear of failure. \nThere are  futures at  stake here, big futures for the riders (and for the \nparents) who only have to  let  their eyes wander a  few yards up  the \npaddock to  see  what ostentatious thrills might one day be  theirs: the \npalatial motorhomes of MotoGP’s gilded elite, gleaming Ferraris and \nPorsches and a coterie of silver-tongued managers and fixers, grinning \nhangers-on and girlfriends with ten-thousand dollar smiles and plastic \ntits. What wide-eyed pubescent wouldn’t risk it all for a  stab at  that? \nThe Red Bull recruits have already made it  this far,  from a  list  of \nmore than 1100 applicants from 60 countries, and from here on  in every \ngear change is  going to  be  the  most important gear change of  their \nlives. These kids’ minds are  set  on  their futures like most kids’ never \nare when they’re just 13 or  14.  I was getting severely beaten for smoking \nNumber Tens down fag alley and dreaming of riding an  RD400 when I \nwas their age, not  focusing on  becoming champion of the  whole wide \nworld. \nYou can see  it in  their faces, hear it in  their voices as  they describe \neach and every moment of  their latest race with a  glorious intensity \nthat only someone relatively new to  this life  can feel. It almost makes \nme  want to  be  an  adolescent again. Their eyes aren’t quite rolling \naround in  the  backs of their heads from all  the  adrenalin, but  it’s  not \nfar off.  Ironically, the last people on  this earth who would actually need \na can  of Red Bull are  these 22  boys and one  girl. They're already flying, \nthey don’t need wings. Not so  the  affable Red Bull marketing reps, \ndashing around making this dazzling enterprise -happen while \nenthusiastically quaffing can  after can  of their speedy brew and hoping \nthat somehow this show will add to  the  three billion cans they already \nsell  each year. \nThe \nRookies \nraces \nare  \nusually \nhugely \nentertaining, \nif \nonly \nfor \nthe \nwild"

But  then I can’t help but feel  a nagging sense of moral \nunease about the  whole thing —  allowing a  bunch of schoolchildren to \ntear-arse around a  racetrack at  120mph, flogging energy drink and \nentertaining a  hundred thousand trackside fans and a  few hundred \nmillion TV viewers. \nIsn’t 13  a  bit  young to  be  sucked deep into the drive train of  the \ncorporate motorsport machine? Shouldn’t the  youngest of these stars \nof the future be back home swapping ringtones, bullying teacher, doing \nsome heavy petting, some studying, maybe even a  bit  of  schoolboy \nmotocross or  minimoto? Or maybe it’s  time to allow 13-year-olds to  do \nall the  other supposedly adult things we  currently don’t allow them to \ndo  —  like driving on  the  road, drinking in  pubs, working in  factories, \ngoing down the mines, owning guns, voting, smoking, joining the army \nand having sex.

      "q": "who’s \nbeen \nputting \nwhat \nin \ntheir \ngreen \ntea? \nSuzuki \ncrew \nchief \nTom \nO’Kane \nand \nformer \nGP-winning \nengineer \nHamish \nJamieson \nalso \ndreamed \nup  \ntheir \nown \nrace \nbikes, \ncreated \nwith \none  \nidea \nin \nmind, \nto \ncut  \nthe \nfastest \nlap \ntimes \never. \nAmongst \nthe \nfeatures \n356 THE FAST STUFF \ndesired by these cutting-edge designers are  jet power, two-wheel drive, \nvariable wheelbase, supercharging, nitrous-oxide, hub-centre steering, \nABS braking, active suspension, semi-auto gearshifters, Bonneville- \nstyle streamlining, 14-inch barrel-shaped tyres and, most bizarrely, a \ntwo-track motorcycle with its wheels side by side, not  in line. Now that \nreally is blue-sky thinking... \nHonda: two-wheel drive, active triple \nHonda came up with two designs, one for now, one for ten  years hence. \nTheir dream machine for  now is  a  250 horsepower, 834cc four-stroke \ninline triple with pneumatic valves, hub-centre steering, active geometry, \npart-time two-wheel drive, linked brakes, shaft drive, 16-inch tyres, \nactive suspension and a semi-automatic gearbox. \nThey reckon the  bike would rev  to  19,000rpm, surpass 350kmh and \nbeat most MotoGP lap  records by  about 10  per cent, which would \nequate to  an  improvement of  around ten seconds at  a  racetrack of \naverage length. And all performance factors —  both engine and chassis \n—  would adjust actively according to weather and track conditions. \n‘We chose hub-centre steering because we  wanted to  make a  bike \nwith active wheelbase and geometry, which would adjust itself for \ncornering, and this  would be impossible with telescopic forks,’ explains \nHonda Racing Corporation managing director Satoru Horiike. ‘We also \nthink two-wheel drive is a good way to  go in the  future, very useful for \nboth front- and rear-end traction. But this is just an  idea; so  far  HRC \ndoesn’t have any two-wheel drive prototypes.’ \nThe bike’s geometry —  wheelbase, ride height and so  on  —  would \nadjust automatically for  each corner and straight. During acceleration \nand deceleration the bike would be long and  low for stability, but during \ncornering the wheelbase would shorten from 1430mm to  1390mm and \nthe centre of  gravity would rise for quick steering and greater \nmanoeuvrability. HRC won't say  how they'd achieve this adjustment \nbut  it’d  take gyroscopes, sensors and plenty of electronics. The triple’s \nfront wheel would be driven by an  electric motor during corner exits to \nimprove traction and turning. \nHonda: way-out two-wheeler \nIs it a bird? Is it  a plane? Hang on,  is it a motorcycle? If you  think HRC’s \n834cc active triple is  radical, its  vision of  MotoGP racing in  2016 is \nMOTOGP \nRACING \nWITH \nNO  \nRULES \n357 \nabout \nas  \nfar \nout  \nas  \nyou \ncould \npossibly \nimagine. \nIn \ndesigning \nhis  \ndream \nMotoGP \nbike \nof \nthe  \nfuture, \nSatoru \nHoriike \ntook \nour  \n‘no  \nrules’ \nconcept \nto  \nthe  \nlimit, \nchanging \nthe  \nentire \ndynamics \nof \nthe  \nmotorcycle \nin \nsearch \nof \nultimate \ncornering \ngrip \nand \ntherefore \nultimate \nlap \ntimes. \nHe \nhas \ndesigned \na \ntwo-track \nmachine, \nwhich \nstill \nfits \nthe \nOxford \nEnglish \nDictionary’s \ndefinition \nof \na motorcycle \nas \n‘a two-wheel \nvehicle \nthat \nis \npowered \nby a motor’. \n‘The only stipulation of a  motorcycle is that it must be  two wheels, \nthat’s all,’ Horiike smiles. ‘This kind of bike wouldn’t necessarily be \nsafer but  it would be much faster. With an  inline two-wheeler you can’t \nachieve more than 1g but if you put the  wheels side by side you can \nachieve more g.  This would mean more grip and lap  times closer to \nFormula One cars. At  the  moment MotoGP lap times are  much slower \nthan F1,  even though top  speeds are  quite similar. I think it would be \npossible to  build this kind of machine in  ten  years. Already Segway \n(the self-balancing two-track scooter) has  done something similar. It’s \nsimple, you just need a  giro and some electronics. I first had this idea \nin  1989; I’ve  already made the  patent.’ \nThe two-track Honda uses the  company’s jet-plane know-how with \na  turbojet engine that would produce massive horsepower with a \nsmooth delivery. Like something out of  Star Wars, the machine \nharnesses the jet’s thrust by  using vectored nozzles to  help steer \nthe machine through corners. Air brakes would also play an \nimportant role in  cornering, helping the  bike to  tilt, developing extra \ndownforce and therefore grip for  the  inside tyre. An  active-controlled \nwing \nwould \ncontrol \npitching \nduring \nacceleration \nand \ndeceleration. \nBut \nit’s \nnot \nall \ncomputer \ntrickery, \nthe \nrider \nwould \nalso \nuse \nhis \nbody \nweight \nto \nimprove \ncornering \nspeed, \njust \nlike \nbike \nracing \nand, \ner \nsidecar racing. \nOne \nwonders \nif \nthis \nwas \nthe  \nbike \nthat \nValentino \nRossi \nwas \ntalking \nabout \nwhen \nhe \nsaid: \n‘When \nI \nwas \nracing \nfor \nHRC \nI \nkept \nhearing \nthat \nin \nJapan, \nin \nsome \nsecret \ndrawer, \nthere \nwere \nprojects \nthat \nwould \nrevolutionise \nmotorbikes...’ \nKawasaki: \nBonneville-style \nstreamliner \nKawasaki \nwant \nMotoGP \nbikes \nto  \nbe  \nsuper-radical, \nmuch \nless \nlike \nsupersport \nbikes \nthan \nthey \nare \ncurrently, \nso \nthey'll \nbe \nunique \nmachines \nwhich \nwill \nfascinate \nfans. \nThat’s \nwhy \nTeam \nGreen \nMotoGP \nengineer \n358 THE FAST STUFF \nKenichi Furuhashi has come up  with a  semi-tilting, streamliner with \nhub-centre steering, supercharged motor and enormous rear tyre which \nhe believes will be super safe and crazy fast. \nLike Honda, finding extra grip was a key factor in their design. Their \nsolution to  this issue was creating a  super-fat, super-low-profile \n800/10-14 rear tyre and a  two-part carbon-fibre monocoque chassis \nthat is, quite literally, hinged in the  middle. The rider sits  in a reclined \n‘armchair-style’ sitting position in  the  front section, which leans fully \nduring cornering while the  rear rolls slightly through centrifugal force, \nthe barrel-shaped rear tyre delivering a  massive footprint. The 400 \nhorsepower supercharged 800cc engine is  housed in  the  rear section. \nWheelbase is  1500mm. \nKawasaki believe that this machine —  with huge horsepower, \nmassive grip, very low centre of gravity and ultra-slippery aerodynamics \n—  will deliver lap times that would give an  Fl  car a  run for \nits  money. \nAnd Furuhashi didn’t stop at  designing a  motorcycle. He  believes \nMotoGP needs more than just radical new bikes. ‘We propose that \nracetracks should be  shorter, so  spectators can see all  the course at \nonce, like the  Valencia MotoGP track or  like Supercross,’ he  says. ‘We \nwould also want all  teams to  run  engines of the  same specification, so \nthe  rider becomes the  main player of MotoGP, which will produce very \nclose and exciting races.’ \nOnly one problem: HRC’s Satoru Horiike reckons he patented a very \nsimilar idea some years ago! \nTom O’Kane: bat-mobile (with rocket launchers) \nChris Vermeulen’s Suzuki crew chief Tom O’Kane has  worked in  GPs \nsince the  late 1980s, first on  Team Roberts’ factory Yamahas, then on \nthe  squad’s own two-stroke triple and four-stroke V5.  He joined Suzuki \nin 2005. \nLike \nsome \nengineers, \nO’Kane \nstruggled \nwith \nthe \nconcept \nof \ntotal \nengineering \nfreedom. \n‘I  \ntried \nto  \nwork \non  \nthe  \nbasis \nof  \n“let \nyour \nimagination \nrun  \nwild”, \nbut  \nafter \nwracking \nmy  \nbrains \nto \ncome \nup  \nwith \na  \ntwo-wheeled \nbat-mobile, \nI \ngave \nup.  \nMotorcycles \nsimply \ndon’t \nwork \nthat \nway. \nSo  \nwhat \nI’ve \ncome \nup  \nwith \nis \na  \nwish-list \nof \nwhat \nI \nthink \nis \nachievable, \ngiven \na  \nno-rules \nsituation \nwith \nmaybe \na  \nfew \nbat- \nbike \nparts.’ \nMOTOGP RACING WITH NO  RULES 359 \nO’Kane’s creation is thus a  lot  less wild than those dreamed up  by \nHRC and Kawasaki. He  reckons a  V5  four-stroke would be  the  ideal \npower plant, but  with nitrous-oxide injection. ‘More power is always \nnice,’ he  adds. ‘In  the  lower gears, the  important thing is to  limit the \npower to what the  rider can  use  and provide good throttle connection. \nBut on  long straights, in  the  higher gears, we  could benefit from the \nuse  of nitrous oxide, controlled by the  ECU.’ And to  improve corner- \nentry performance O’Kane’s bike would have anti-lock brakes. ‘I believe \nin  keeping computer control to  a  minimum,’ he  adds. ‘But an  ABS \nsystem that allowed the  rider to  keep both brakes on  hard up  to  mid- \ncorner would be worth its weight in silicon chips.’ \nBecause O’Kane works in  the pits he’s also keen to  create a  bike \nthat’s not  merely user-friendly for the  rider. ‘The bike would be easy to \nwork on,’ he explains. ‘The designers would have to  practise \ncommon tasks such as  wheel and shock-absorber changes, then \nredesign the bike accordingly. The designers would also be  on  a \nparts-count bonus scheme. That is,  every time they reduced \nthe  parts count without reducing the  bike’s performance, they would \nreceive a  pay bonus. Performance in  this sense means lap-time, \nreliability and how easy the bike is to work on.  Every time they managed \nto  make one part (or system) do  two jobs, they would receive a \ndouble bonus.’ \nSafety is also a  priority for  O’Kane. ‘Materials should be chosen for \nsafety. Billet parts, particularly those subject to  stress cycles, will be \nmade from 2024-T3 or  T4  aluminium. Although 7075-T6 is a little \nstronger, \n2024 \nis \nless \nnotch \nsensitive \nand \nmore \nfatigue \nresistant, \nthat \nis, \nfatigue \ncrack \npropagation \nis \nslower. \nMotorcycle \nparts \nshould \nnot \nfail \nwithin \ntheir \ndesign \nlifetime, \nbut \nmaterials \nmust \nbe \nchosen \nso \nthat \nif \nthey \nfail, \nthey \nshould \ndo \nso \nprogressively, \nnot \ncatastrophically. \nBrittle \nmaterials \nand \nmaterials \nwhich \ndo \nnot \nshow \noutward \nsigns \nof \nimpending \nfailure have no  place on  this bike.’ \nAnd \nO’Kane \nhas \none \nfinal \ntrick \nup  \nhis  \nsleeve. \n‘Finally, \nif  \nweight \nwasn’t \ntoo \nmuch \nof \na  \nproblem, \nand \nonly \nto  \nbe  \nused \nas  \na  \nlast \nresort, \na \ncouple \nof \nheat-seeking \nmissiles \nwould \nbe \nnice...’ \nHamish \nJamieson: \nsuper-light \nand \nturbocharged \nHamish \nJamieson \nwas \nthe \nman \nwho \nadapted \nYamaha’s \nYZR500 \nso \nthat \nwild-sliding \nGarry \nMcCoy \ncould \nwin \nGPs. \nAfter \nthat \nthe \nScot \nworked \non \n360 THE FAST STUFF \nKawasaki's MotoGP project before taking time out  in Africa, working \nfor the  Riders for Health charity. \nHis  dream concept is  a  small and light bike that delivers excellent \nfeel. ‘The overall ethos of this machine is feel and weight, both static, \nhence the small-capacity engine and dynamic, hence my choice of \ncarbon-fibre wheels.’ The engine is  a  300cc inline four-cylinder four- \nstroke with twin turbochargers, water injection and a  very low inertia \ncrankshaft rotating backwards. The frame is a  Ducati-style steel trellis \nunit with a  swingarm made from cast magnesium. The bike would \nweigh just 115kg. \nJamieson reckons feel is  crucial in  allowing a  rider to  extract the \nbike’s full potential over a  17-race season. ‘The machine needs to  be \nkept at its maximum feel, that is why I’ve  chosen carbon wheels, which \nare  20 per cent lighter than forged magnesium, allowing the suspension \nto be better tuned, which helps give the  rider more feedback.’ \nAdjustability will be  another key feature. ‘The rider will be  able to \nadjust the power output via the  turbo waste gates, especially important \nconsidering the high power output, and the suspension, allowing \noptimum use  of available grip. The ECU will take care of other functions \nlike traction control.

He’s leaning heavily on  a walking stick but still \nlooks like he  might teeter over at  any moment. No  wonder really \nbecause the  former MotoGP world champ is 77 years old. It’s  2059 and \nold  man Melandri is watching intently as  grandson Fabrizio eases out \ninto pit  lane to  commence his  debut season in  motorcycle racing’s \npremier class, ElectroGP. . \nFab  made his name winning the  100kW scooter world championship \nin 2052, before moving on  up  to  conquer the  200kW supersport class. \nOh  yes, GP  racing has  changed a lot  in recent years. The stinky 125cc \nand 250cc two-stroke categories were axed in 2010, replaced by 200cc \nand 400cc four-strokes. Then internal-combustion engines were run \nout  of GPs in 2046. Petrol now costs 40  quid a litre, if you can get your \nhands on  any, because the  world’s shrinking oil  reserves have either \nbeen commandeered by the  military or  bought by China and Russia, \nwho have become firm friends with oil-rich nations like  Venezuela and \nKazakhstan, Iran and Iraq. \na \nOO ———— \nTHE \nFUTURE \nOF  \nMOTOGP \nIS  \nELECTRO \n363 \nFab Melandri rides for the  Panasonic team, which is due to launch a \n200kW street version of its  300kW ElectroGP bike at  the  Milan show \nlater this year. Meanwhile Honda are  working on  a \n250 watt Electroblade... \nA  fanciful scenario? Possibly, but oil  is  a  finite ‘Electric-powered \nworld resource, it’s going to run  out  one  day, probably vehicles aren’t slow — \nwithin the  next half century, and there are  plenty of the White Lightning \npeople already preparing for that moment. streamliner has \nHRC recently built their first electric competition \nbike, US  company Electric Moto Corp are already \nracing a  hyper-trick leccy Supermotard in the  States \nand Mitsubishi are  developing a  Lancer-based electric rally car  (with a \nmotor in each wheel, making three times the  torque of a  conventional \nengine at  very low rpm). Electric-powered vehicles aren’t slow either. \nFastest so  far  is  the  White Lightning streamliner which has reached \n245mph at Bonneville.

I didn’t have \nany particular skill in the wet, I just knew I could always go as  quick as \nanyone else on  the  day and, if I stayed on I did  all right, and if I fell  off \nI fell  off. I never believed Falappa had any great skill on  a  bike, he \nwas just rock hard and prepared to  push himself beyond what he \nshould’ve done. \n‘At  Brands Hatch in ’93  it was really pouring down, there were puddles \neverywhere, just stopping on  your bike was an  achievement.

He  was so \nfucking impressive that day, I used to  think I knew how to  ride a bike \nin the wet but  apparently I didn’t.’ \nNicky Hayden, former dirt-tracker, 2006 MotoGP champ: Scott Russell's crash- \nand-win ride at the 1995 Daytona 200 \n‘I  would say  the  big  memory that’s always stuck with me  is  Scott \nRussell crashing and winning at Daytona in 95.  I was there at  the  first \nhorsehoe turn, standing on  this other dirt-track kid’s box van. Russell \ncrashed early in  the  race, right in  front of me, then ran and jumped \nover the  bike and picked it  up,  they made a  big  deal about that in \nthe  US. \n‘The thing I remember more than anything is when he  came by the \nnext lap. I mean this was Russell, he  owned Daytona, everyone loved \nhim there and he was cocky, he’d told everyone he was going to win. So \nwhen he  came back by the  next lap, the  whole place went wild. Then \nhe  was just charging through the  pack, picking them up  and laying \nthem down, it was impressive. He  wasn’t hurt too  much but his  bike \nwas torn up. \n‘I  must’ve been about 13  at  the time, in  eighth grade, so  about \nhalfway though Friday school I said I needed to  go  home because I \nwasn’t feeling too  good, so  then me  and my  older brother drove down \nfrom Owensboro to Daytona to watch the racing. Of course, I had school \non  Monday morning so  we  couldn’t stay for  the  whole race, we  had to \nbeat the  crowd and get home, so  we  were listening to it on  the  radio as \nwe  were leaving the  track and I just remember thinking, man, this is \nunheard of, some guy  crashing and still winning the  thing. Sure, he got \nsome help from the  pace car  later in  the  race, but the  way he  was \ncoming through the  pack is  still right there in my  memory, I can still \nsee  it all.’ \nJeremy McWilliams, rock-hard former GP winner: Wayne Rainey’s Lazarus-style \ncomeback at the 1991 Japanese GP ; \n‘Valentino Rossi's ride at  Phillip Island in  2003, when he  beat a ten- \nsecond penalty to  win, is right up  there in  my  mind but the  one that \nreally blew me  away was Wayne Rainey in  Japan in  1991. I’d  started \nracing \na \nfew \nyears \nbefore \nthough \nI \nwasn’t \na \nrace \nfan, \nI \nwanted \nto \nrace, \n“HE \nJUST \nFUCKED \nOFF \nAND \nI \nDIDN’T \nEVEN \nKNOW \nHOW \nHE  \nWAS \nDOING \nIT’ \n367 \nI \njust \nnever \nthought \nit \nwas \nthat \nimportant \nto  \nsit \ndown \nand \nwatch \nraces. \nBut \nI’d  \ncome \nover \nfrom \nIreland \nto  \ndo  \nthe  \nBritish \nchampionship \nin  \n’91 \nand \nthat \ngave \nme \na \nbig \nkick \nup \nthe \nbackside \nbecause \nI \ncould \nsee \nwhat \nracing \nwas \nall about. \n‘At  the time some riders had an  influence on  me  and Rainey was \nobviously the  man. That race was at  Suzuka, he was on  Dunlops while \neveryone else was on  Michelins. He  was up  there but  then he  made a \nmistake and dropped way back. Then he  starting coming through, he \nwas smoking the  Dunlop around the  left-hander at  the  top  of the  hill \n(Dunlop curve) and you  didn’t see  that kind of thing back then. He was \nsmoking the thing up  and I was thinking no  way, that can’t last, he \ncan’t sustain that, but  he went on  and won it. \n‘From that point, that was it, Rainey was set  in stone, as  far as  I was \nconcerned he was the god. That ride had a big influence on  me  because \nyou see  what can  be  achieved, you think that’s it, he’s not  going to  do \nit, but  then you see  the  determination, he just rode the  wheels off the \nthing. I saw so  many things in  12  years of GP  racing, so  my  memory is \nclouded, but that ride had such an  impact that I remember it from even \nbefore I got  into GPs. It’s  absolutely the  most awesome race you could \nwatch, I still tell  people to  get  the  video. \n‘Rainey reckons he had an  out-of-body experience at  Suzuka and you \nonly get  that when you’re really in  the  zone, when you're riding and \nyou can do  no  wrong. It  probably only happened to  me  once in  my \nwhole career, when I beat Rossi and Capirossi in  Germany in  1998. \nRossi was having a  go  at  me  on  the  last  lap and I had a major moment \nin a  fast left, I lost the  front and I remember thinking, that’s okay I’ve \ngot  it, and you’re never in control of a  front-end slide. Rossi reminded \nme  on  the  podium, he  said how did  you save that?’ \nKing \nKenny \nRoberts, \nthree-time \n500  \nchamp, \nbike \nbuilder, \nmotor \nmouth: \nMakoto \nTamada’s \nJapanese \nrunaway \nMotoGP \nwin \nin \n2004 \n‘It’d \nbe  \nwhen \nMakoto \nTamada \nran  \naway \nwith \nthe  \nrace \nat  \nMotegi, \njust \nbecause \nof \nhow \nmuch \nsidegrip \nhe  \nactually \nhad. \nI \njust \nsat  \nthere \ngoing, \nwow, \nthis \nguy \nis \nnot \ngoing \nto \nfinish \nthis \nrace \nand \nI \nwas \namazed \nthat \nhe \ndid. \nIt \nwas \njust \nthat \nhis \nBridgestones \nhad \nso \nmuch \ngrip, \nI \ncouldn't \nbelieve \nit. \nThat \nwas \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nI’d \nseen \nthat \nand \nValentino \n[Rossi, \nwho \ntook \nsecond \nplace, \nsix \nseconds \ndown] \ncommented \nafterwards \nthat \nit \nwas \nlike \nTamada \nwas \non \nqualifiers. \n368 THE FAST STUFF \n‘I guess you could say  I more pay attention to  the  technical side of- \nwhat happens than to anything else. At this level everybody has  natural \nability and some pull out  more than others, but  the  differences are  so \nminute that I can’t think of  a  ride where I was, like, wow, that’s \nunbelievable. At  Motegi it  was just impressive that Tamada could \nachieve that much grip and I remember thinking at  the  same time that \nif this is  the  way racing is going, we  don’t have much hope for  good \nracing anymore. As guys get more mid-corner grip they use  more corner \nspeed, which means they'll all be on  one line, which means there will \nbe  a  lot  less passing, a  lot  less manoeuvring. It’s  pretty close to  that \nalready, these bikes are  like big  250s and I  think the 800s will be \nWOTSe.” \nValentino Rossi, seven-time champ and maybe the greatest racer ever: Going head \nto head with 250  rival Loris Capirossi at Assen in 1999 \n‘I think I’m  very good at  understanding when. another rider is fast and \nthere have been a few times when some rider has  impressed me, for sure \nmore at  the  beginning of my  career, because when you arrive from the \nEuropean championship to world grand prix, you say,  fuck, for me  it will \nbe impossible in all my  career to  go like  the  guys up front. \n‘I suppose Capirossi has  impressed me  many times, Barros for a short \nperiod in the last  races of 2002 and sometimes Gibernau has  been very, \nvery fast. Also, Pedrosa impresses me  a lot now because he’s a different \nrider because he is so  tiny, so  he needs to  ride different. \n‘Maybe the  most impressive was Capirossi at  Assen in  ‘99. Usually \nanother rider impresses you when you are  in good shape, with a  good \nbike, and he’s still able to  beat you. That day I was very fast and \nCapirossi was faster than me,  he was in fantastic shape. He  amazed me \nat  the  last chicane; what he  did  that day was impossible! That race \nwasn’t \na \nrace, \nit \nwas \na \nbattle. \nThat \nsometimes \nhappens, \nyou \nstop \nwith \nthe right lines and just fight, like remove one chip from your brain and \nput  in another.’ \nSteve \nParrish, \nBritish \nchamp \nand  \nGP \nracer \nturned \nBBC \ncommentator: \nBayliss \nv \nEdwards, \nImola, \nfinal \nround \nof \nWorld \nSuperbike \n2002 \n‘I \ncan’t \nthink \nof \na  \nrace \nI’ve \nenjoyed \nmore \nthan \nwhen \nthey \nwere \ngoing \nhead \nto  \nhead \nfor  \nthe  \ntitle. \nThe \nstakes \nwere \nso  \nhigh, \nit \nwas \nthe  \nfinal \nround \nand \nwhoever \nwon \nwould \nbe \nworld \nchampion. \nTroy \nhad \nbeen \n“HE \nJUST \nFUCKED \nOFF  \nAND \nI \nDIDN’T \nEVEN \nKNOW \nHOW \nHE  \nWAS \nDOING \nIT’ \n369 \nromping \naway \nwith \nthe  \nchampionship \nuntil \nhe  \ncrashed \nat  \nAssen, \nand \nColin \nwon \neight \nraces \non  \nthe \nrun  \nafter \nhe \ngot \nnew \nparts \nfrom \nthe  \nSuzuka \nEight \nHours. \n‘Race \none \nwas \na  \nhuge, \nhuge \nbattle, \nit  \nseemed \nlike \nit  \nwould \ncome \ndown \nto \nwho \nfell \noff, \nbut \nColin \nbeat \nTroy \nby \na \nbike’s \nlength \nto \ngo \nsix \npoints \nahead. \nWhat \nmade \nrace \ntwo \neven \nbetter, \nthe \nmost \nenthralling \nrace \nI’ve \never \nwitnessed, \nwas \nthat \nit \nwas \nanother \nenormous \nbattle, \nbut \nalso \nbecause \nTroy’s \nonly \nchance \nfor \nthe \ntitle, \nif \nColin \ndidn’t \ncrash, \nwas \nto \nback \nColin \ndown, \nbecause \nRuben \nXaus \n(Bayliss’ \nteam-mate) \nwas \ncoming \nthrough. \nThe \nplan \nworked \nto \nstart \nwith \nbecause \nXaus \nwas \ncatching, \ncatching, \ncatching \nand \ngot \nto \nwithin \ntwo \nseconds. \nWe \nthought \nthe \nshit \nwas \ngoing \nto \nhit \nthe \nfan, \nbecause \nwho \nwould \nwant \nXaus \nin \nthe \nmiddle \nof \nit \nall? \nThen \nColin \nbit \nthe \nbullet \nand \npassed \nTroy, \nthen \nTroy \nwent \nback \npast \nhim, \nthey \nwere \nclashing \nfairings \nand \npushing \neach \nother \nwide. \n‘Seeing those two duking it out  for  a championship with three laps \nto  go was quite extraordinary; it’s  one race I'll never forget. The gloves \nwere off,  nothing was being held back. I’m  surprised that Colin didn’t \njust take Troy out. Maybe I would’ve done that because it was the  short \nway of winning it.

He rode like  that all day long in the  dry, so when \nthe  rain came he’d ride the  same. It was normal for \nhim to  have a  moment every corner and save it. \n‘Schwantz was so far Normal people have a  couple of  big  moments and \non  the edge all the think, fuck me, that’ll do, but  he’d just have another \ntime, it’d be on  his one  at  the  next corner. \nknee, he'd roll  the ‘It was front tyre stuff that he was unbelievable at. \nfront round and just He  rode the  bike so  weird, pushing on  the  front so \nsave it’ hard, but  he had such a mega feeling for it, the  thing \nwould roll  around underneath him and he’d keep it \ngoing. So  when it came to  shitty conditions he  had \nsuch a  natural feel for  where he  was at  that he  was prepared to  keep \npushing it and keep saving it. \n‘I remember the  party at  the  team hotel afterwards. We  did  all  the \nnormal juvenile stuff, like pinching Shirley’s (Schwantz’s mum) camera \nand taking photos of my  schlong in  the  toilet and filling her  handbag \nfull  of cutlery. \n‘Suzuki brought me  into the  team to  look after him. Then the  first \ntime we  went to Ryuyo (Suzuki's test track), he broke his wrist after six \nlaps, so  it was left  to  me  to  do  all  the  testing. At  the  end of three days \nthe  Suzuki engineers sat  me  down and asked me  what I thought. I told \nthem maybe they’d make the  top  ten  at  the  first race at  Suzuka. They \nwere pretty shocked. So  Schwantz didn’t do any more testing, came to \nSuzuka with the  wrist all  fixed up  and won the  race. But that was all \nhim, it wasn’t the  bike.’ \nMotoGP Mutterings: June 2006 \nOn  the passing of MotoGP’s oldest and only \ntruly unique racetrack \nI write to  tell  you of the  sad  loss of an  old  and much-loved friend. We \nvisited GP racing’s old  dame during June and although she  is not  quite \ndead, she  may as  well be,  for  she has been hideously mutilated by \nbrutal thugs. \nAssen was once a  thing of  great beauty, a  unique racetrack that \nON \nTHE \nPASSING \nOF  \nMoTOGP’s \nONLY \nTRULY \nUNIQUE \nTRACK \n371 \noffered \nunique \nchallenges \nto \nboth \nman \nand \nmachine. \nBut \nno \nlonger, \nshe \nhas \nbeen \ndismembered, \nher \nnorthern \nloop \nhacked \noff \nto \nmake \nroom \nfor \n‘TT \nWorld’, \nan \nentertainments \ncomplex \nwith \nhotel, \ncar \npark \nand \nshops, \nbecause \nthe \nworld \nneeds \nmore \nshops. \nYes, \nI \nam  \na  \nsentimental \nold  \ngit \nand \na  \nGrumpy \nOld \nMan \ntoo, \nbut \nI \nmourn \nnot \nso \nmuch \nfor \nthe \nsacred \ntarmac \nnor \nfor \nits \nhistory \nbut \nfor \nthe \nloss \nof \nseeing \neven \nthe \nworld’s \ngreatest \nriders \nthrown \nheadfirst \ninto \nanother \nwhirling \ndimension \nby \nAssen’s \ntricky, \ncambered \ncurves \nand \nforced \nto \nride \nlike \nthey \nride \nnowhere \nelse. \nThe \nmean \nlittle \nkink \nthat \nreplaces \nthe  \nbutchered \none-mile \nnorthern \nloop \nsimplifies \nthe \ncircuit \nno  \nend \n(dare \nI \nsay,  \ndumbs \nit \ndown) \nbut \nracers \ndon’t \ngo \nracing \nbecause \nthey \nwant \nan \neasy \nlife. \nThey \nloved \nthe \nold \nAssen \nbecause \nit \nforced \nthem \nto \ndig \ndeep \ninside \nthemselves \nto \nfind \na \nwhole \nnew \nway \nof \nriding, \nreformatting \nmind, \nbody \nand \nmotorcycle \nto \nunlock \nthe \nsecrets \nof \nits \ninsanely \nfast \nsweepers, uniquely crowned in  the middle like a ‘Assen was once a \npublic road. thing of great \nAround normal racetracks, racers essentially go left beauty, a  unique \nor  right. But around the  old  Assen riders negotiated racetrack, but no \ncorrugations of  camber while zigzagging back and longer, she  has  been \nforth at  crazy speeds, like riding the  back of a  giant, dismembered, her \nwriggling snake, swerving right and left over the northern loop \ncentre crown, positive camber one instant, negative hacked off’ \ncamber the next, then positive, then negative, the \nslightest slip and you were gone. That’s why riders \nused to variously call  Assen bike racing’s university, its cathedral, temple \nor  Mecca. Racers were in awe of the  place. Even Mick Doohan. \n‘The camber has bitten some of  the  best riders in  the  world,’ said \nColin Edwards a few years back. ‘It makes you feel  so  comfortable, then \nyou get  to mid-corner and the  track drops away, so  if you’re not  careful \nit’s  “Sayonara!”, you’re out  of there! And man, it’s  so  fast, every time \nyou go  there you have to  adjust your eyes because everything goes by \nso  quick.’ This is what Edwards had to  say  at  the  2006 Dutch TT.  ‘The \nnew circuit is  crap, it’s  just like anywhere else, it’s  lost the  challenge \nand the  history.’ \nIn \nfact \nAssen \nis \nstill \nheavy \nwith \nhistory. \nIn \nbetween \nthe \nwhiff \nof \nchip \nfat \nand \nweed \nsmoke \nyou \ncan \nalmost \ntaste \nthe  \nsweet \nold  \nsmell \nof \nCastrol \nR. \nMike \nHailwood \nwon \nraces \nthere, \nso  \ndid \nBarry \nSheene, \nKing \nKenny \nRoberts, \n372 THE FAST STUFF \nGiacomo Agostini, Freddie Spencer, Kevin Schwantz, Mick Doohan and \nValentino Rossi (Graziano too). There is no  other GP  track in  the  world \nwhere you can  say that because Assen is the sole  survivor from GP racing’s \ninaugural 1949 season. But Assen is no  longer unique, so  even though it’s \nbetter than some GP tracks, it’s only half the place it used to be. \nYou  may wonder why I consider racetracks to be so  important, why I \nget  excited rolling up  somewhere fast and open, like Mugello, Phillip \nIsland and Istanbul, but become strangely depressed when I turn up at \nmean little layouts like Losail, Motegi and Shanghai. I feel like that \nbecause great circuits promote great racing, with riders mugging each \nother at  every other turn, while poor layouts encourage Fl-style \nprocessions. That’s why circuits matter, possibly even more than bikes \nand riders. \nCHAPTER 48 \nPEDROBOT: \nSMALL MAN, BIG TALENT \nAugust 2006 \nThey \ncall \nhim \n‘Pedrobot’, \nso  \nwhat \nis \nthe \nsecret \nof \nsuccess \ninside \nMotoGP’s \ntiniest \nsuperstar? \nFirst of all,  an  apology. I once referred to  Dani Pedrosa as  a  cheerless \nmidget. On  closer inspection I realise I was wrong, or  at  least half \nwrong. Pedrosa is miniscule but he’s not  miserable, he just takes his job \nvery, very seriously. Although he  is now mentioned in the  same breath \nas  Freddie Spencer, because he’s the  first rider since Fast Freddie to \nachieve such success in a rookie premier-class season, Dani Boy is more \nlike Eddie Lawson or  Mick Doohan in his  attitude to  the  sport: first of \nall,  racing is a job, second, it is a  science and must be  treated as  such, \nthird, if people enjoy watching the  racing, so  be  it, though this is not \nreally his  concern. \nThese are  not  good times to  hold such dangerous beliefs, Valentino \nRossi has seen to  that. Nowadays every MotoGP star is expected to  be \na  party clown —  as  you sit  on  the  grid preparing to  get  nasty with the \nworld’s greatest riders you are  expected to  wave daftly at  the  cameras, \nlike you’ve just spotted your neighbour’s five-year-old son  on  your way \nto  the corner shop. Most MotoGP racers now indulge themselves in \nthis sad  ritual, doing their damnedest to  tell  the  world that they are \nreally fun characters but  ultimately failing. Pedrosa doesn’t mug up  to \nthe  cameras before races, nor  after races, even when he’s won. He  has \ncopped \nsome \nserious \nflak \nfor \nhaving \nthe \naudacity \nto \nbehave \nin \nsuch \na \nmanner \n— \nhow \ndare \nhe \nnot \nenjoy \nwhat \nhe’s \ndoing? \n— \nwhen \nreally \nhe \nis \njust \na \nbit \ntoo \nshy, \na \nbit \ntoo \nnervous \nwhen \nhe’s \nin \nthe \npublic \neye. \nNevertheless, \nsome \ncritics \nhave \nnicknamed \nhim \n‘Pedrobot’, \nothers \ncall \nhim \n‘Minnie \nMick’ \n(after \nrelentless \nwinner \nDoohan). \nSo  \ndoes \nbike \nracing’s \npuniest \nsuperstar \n—  \nall  \nfive \nfoot \nthree \nof \nhim \n— \nreally \nenjoy \nracing \nor  \nwould \nhe  \nbe \njust \nas  \nhappy/unhappy \nworking \nat \n374 THE FAST STUFF \nMcDonald’s? ‘For sure I enjoy racing, that’s why I’m here,’ he says with \na  quiet assuredness that characterises his  answers throughout this \ninterview. ‘The thing I enjoy most is the  feeling I get in myself when I \nfinish a race, when I see  my  guys are  happy because \nthe  team is very important to  me.’ \n‘Iam not  worried if So  why doesn’t he  smile more? ‘Just because I \nRossi retires and don’t always smile doesn’t mean I’m not enjoying \nthen my style isn’t myself. I think some racers smile but they don’t enjoy \nthe same as  his and racing as  much as  me.  I don’t feel  I’m much different \npeople don’t like  it’ to  the others, I just feel that some of  them show \nanother face when they are  off the  bike.’ \nThe former 125 and 250 world champ is  almost \ncertainly correct in  his  assumption that many racers are  only acting \nwhen they play up  to  the  crowd. They are  not  being real, they merely \nfeel that it’s  part of their job  to  salute the  fans and do  the  occasional \nburn-out. There is no  doubt that Rossi enjoys his  victory celebrations, \nbut the  Italian also knows that these shows are  an  investment that \npays rich dividends. Barry Sheene was the same, he  happily signed \nthousands of autographs, each and every one of them part of a  career- \nlong brand-building exercise. \nPedrosa will sign autographs and wave to the crowd but he’s definitely \nnot  in the  business of showbusiness. ‘If making a  show was natural to \nme, then maybe I would,’ he  explains. ‘But when something doesn’t \ncome naturally I don’t feel I have to  do  it to  give enjoyment to  other \npeople. I am  not  worried if Rossi retires and then my  style isn’t the \nsame as  his  and people don’t like  it.’ \nQuite simply, Pedrosa prefers if people appreciate him for  what he \ndoes during a race, not  after it.  ‘It  is  a big emotion to  feel  that people \nlike  you for  what you do,  but  I like it more when I feel they like me \nbecause I have ridden a great race, not  because I make a great party on \nthe \npodium.’ \nIn \nthis \nrespect \nhe \nis \nvery \nsimilar \nto \nLawson \nand \nDoohan \n(his—all-time \nracing \nhero, \nwhich \nexplains \na \nlot), \nthough \nhe \nis \nless \nbrusque \nand \nmore \npolite \nthan \nGP \nracing’s \nbiggest \nwinners \nof \nthe \n1980s \nand  1990s. \nAnd \nyet  \nthe \n20-year-old \nhas \na  \nbig \nfollowing, \nespecially \nin  \nSpain, \nwhere \ngangs \nof \nteenage \ngirls \nthrong \nround \nthe  \nback \ndoor \nof \nthe  \nRepsol \nHonda \npit, \nscreaming: \n‘Dani! \nDani! \nDani’, \njust \nlike \nthe \nValenteeniboppers \nat  \nMugello. \nPedrosa \nis \nan  \nunlikely \nsex  \nsymbol \nand \nhe \ncertainly \ndoesn’t \nPEDROBOT: \nSMALL \nMAN, \nBIG \nTALENT \n271.) \nfeel \ncomfortable \nin  \nthe  \nrole. \nI \nask  \nhim \nhow \nhe  \nfeels \nwhen \nhe  \nhears \nthose \nstrident \ncries. \nHe  \ngrins \nwidely \nand \nsays: \n‘Suspicious!’ \nNot \none \nfor  \nthe  \ngroupies, \nthen, \nwhich \nbrings \nus  \nonto \nthe  \nsubject \nof \ngirlfriends. \nPedrosa \nreveals \nthat \nhe \ndoes \nhave \na \ngirlfriend \nbut \nlaughs \nuncomfortably \nwhen \nI \nask \nif \nshe’s \nSpanish \nor \nEnglish. \nHe \ndoesn’t \nwant \nto \nanswer \nthat \none. \nThe \nCatalan \nlad \nis \none \nof \nmany \nMotoGP \nstars \nwho \nchoose \nto \nlive \nin \nthe \nUK \nto \ntake \nadvantage \nof \ncomplex \nEU \ntax \nlaws. \nHe \nrecently \nmoved \ninto \nNotting \nHill, \nLondon’s \nluvvie \ncentral, \nand \nsome \ntwisted \npart \nof \nmy \nmind \nwants \nto \nsee \nhim \nout \non \nthe \ntown \nwith \nthe \nlocal \nglitterati, \nperhaps \ndating \nKelly \nOsbourne. \nBut \nthe \nceleb \ncircuit \nisn’t \nhis \nscene, \nhe’s \nmore \nlikely \nto \nbe \nseeing \na checkout \ngirl \nfrom \nTesco \nMetro \nin \nthe \nPortobello \nRoad. \n(Subsequent \nresearch \nreveals \nthat \nhis \nlady \nis \nSpanish, \nnot \nEnglish.) \n‘I  am  a  simple man,’ he  insists. So  what would be  his  ideal night \nout? ‘Maybe take supper with my girl or with friends, go to the cinema, \nthen go out  and talk about the movie or  anything. I mainly don’t drink, \nexcept on  the  nights when the  situation tells you this is the night to do \nit, but  by two o'clock I am  finished.’ \nPedrosa is indeed an  old  man for  his  20  summers. His  racing career \ngot  serious when he was just 13, so  he never enjoyed a normal, carefree \nadolescence. A  few years ago I spotted him dining on  Phillip Island \nwith his mentor Alberto Puig, Dorna boss Carmelo Espeleta and two \nother fiftysomething suits. That is not a normal way for  a  16-year-old \nto  spend his  Saturday nights —  the poor kid  looked bored to death —  but \nthat’s the  price you pay for  doing a  dream job. \nHe  is  aware that the  lifestyle he  has lived over the  last seven years \nmakes him somewhat abnormal but  he has  strategies to deal with that. \nLike Rossi, he  prefers to  hang out  with old  mates who treat him like \nDani the  childhood friend, not  Dani the  teeny-weeny superstar. ‘People \nI’ve known since I was little don’t look at  me  any different, so  that’s \nwhen I don’t feel different, this  is a good thing,’ he says. ‘But sometimes \nother \nfriends \nmake \nyou \nfeel \ndifferent \nbecause \nthey \nlook \nat \nyou \nwith \nother eyes.’ \nIf \nPedrosa \nis \nwary \nof \nstar-fucking \nmates \nand \ngold-digging \ngirls, \nhe \nis \neven \nmore \ndistrustful \nof \nthe \nmedia. \nPuig \nhas \ninstilled \nmuch \nof \nthis \nsuspicion \nand \nrightly \nso, \nbecause \nthe \nmedia \nis \na \nferociously \nfickle \nbeast, \nbigging \nyou \nup \none \nmoment, \nknocking \nyou \ndown \nthe \nnext. \nThis \nis \nanother \nreason \nwhy \nPedrosa \nenjoys \nliving \nabroad \nwhere \nhe \nis \nrelatively \n376 THE FAST STUFF \nsafe from the  Spanish tabloids: ‘In  London I cannot read the  Spanish \npress, which is nice’. \nSo  this is  one rider who counts no  journalists among his  paddock \nmates. In fact Pedrosa is in no  hurry to make any friends in the paddock, \nwhether they be journalists, rivals or members of his own team. ‘I don’t \ngo out  fishing or  anything with my mechanics, we  do our  jobs, they go \nhome, I go  my  home.’ Casey Stoner, a  rival in  125s, 250s and now in \nMotoGP is  stunned by  Pedrosa’s chilly paddock persona. ‘He won't \ncommunicate at  all  or  make any eye  contact,’ says the  Aussie. ‘Maybe \nhe’s got a problem with me.’ \nThis is my second one-on-one interview with Pedrosa since he arrived \nin  GPs in 2001. When I first interviewed him in  2002 he hardly got  a \nword in  edgeways, Puig answering most of  the  questions. This time \nPuig is  again present in  the  interview room, along with two Repsol \nHonda media personnel who hover on  the sidelines, apparently nervous \nthat the  interview might prove all  too  much for their treasured charge. \nIn  fact Pedrosa seems to enjoy the  chat, absolutely confident but  never \ncocky, sometimes funny, sometimes raising an  eyebrow if he thinks I’m \ngetting a bit  too  tasty with my  line of questioning. \nNot surprisingly, the subject of Rossi comes up several times. He is aware \nthat MotoGP’s long-time ruler has taken a  few swipes at  him, most \nfamously at  Donington 2006, where a  journalist asked Rossi if he  was \nexcited about sharing a podium for the  first time with MotoGP’s up-and- \ncoming star. ‘Oh yes,’ beamed Rossi. ‘So excited I pissed myself!’ \nPedrosa is more oblique when talking about his  most famous rival, \nperhaps because he knows he could never win a war of words with the \nglobally popular Italian who has  been premier-class champ five times \nsince Pedrosa arrived in GPs. I ask him if he’s impressed by his MotoGP \nrivals. ‘I think they have good talent but  for  sure I know other people \nwith more talent,’ he  replies, referring to  his  childhood heroes Ayrton \nSenna and Lance Armstrong. Even Rossi? ‘I don’t know if it’s  talent or \nexperience, or  the  team and the  whole package, I just feel he’s very \nstrong and he always tries to win.’ And you know Pedrosa is a real racer \nwhen he implies that Rossi’s god-like status is just another target: ‘For \nme  he is a good opportunity to prove my  ability as  a rider.’ \nHis  abilities have so  far  taken him to  the  125  world title at  his  third \nattempt (Rossi managed that in his  second season), to  the  250 title in \nhis \ndebut \nyear \n(Rossi \ntook \ntwo \nseasons \nto \nwin \nin \n250s) \nand \nto \nhis \nfirst \nPEDROBOT: \nSMALL \nMAN, \nBIG \nTALENT \nBAT. \nMotoGP \nvictory \nafter \njust \nfour \nraces \n(Rossi \ntook \nnine \nraces \nto  \nwin \nhis \nfirst \n500 \nGP). \nBut \nall \nhe  \nwants \nto  \nsay  \nabout \nhis  \nremarkable \nsuccess \nis \nthis: \n‘I \nfeel \nvery \nfortunate \nto \nhave \nwhat \nI \nhave \n— \nthe \nbike \nand \nthe \nteam \n— \nto \nhelp \nme \nget \nwhere \nI \nam.’ \nHe \ndoesn’t \nwant \nto \ntalk \nabout \nwhat \nhe’s \ngood \nat, \nonly \nwhat \nhe’s \nbad \nat. \n‘I \nstill \nneed \nto \nimprove \nmy \nriding \nin \nthe \nrain, \nalso \nmy \novertaking, \njust \nbecause \nthese \nbikes \nare \nquite \nbig \nand \ndifficult \nto \nmanage, \nand \nalso \nbecause \nof the \nspeed.’ \nOh \nyes, \nthe \nspeed, \nso \nhow \ndid \nit feel \ngraduating \nfrom \na \n170mph \nmotorcycle \nto \na 210mph \nmachine? \n‘Once \nyou \nare \nriding \nfull-on \nyou \nforget \nit, \nbut \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nyou \narrive \nat \nthe \ntrack \nwhere \nyou \nare \nused \nto \nriding \na \n250 \nyou \nfeel \na \nbig \ndifference, \nlike \nwhoa!’ \nPedrosa has  adapted seamlessly from 125s to  250s to MotoGP bikes. \nHe  still  uses the  same spot-on, inch-perfect technique he used on  125s \nand 250s, maybe because he’s just too  small to  muscle a bike around. \nHis crew chief Mike Leitner believes he  succeeds by using brains, not \nbrawn. ‘Dani is very intelligent. He  is quite small so  he has to  ride the \nbike in a different way to  the  others. A MotoGP bike is too  big and too \nheavy for him but  he  thinks and then adapts to  the  situation.’ \nNo  doubt Pedrosa is a thinker. But  the MotoGP bullies who taunt him \nwith cries of  ‘Pedrobot’ don’t worry him. After all,  in  bike racing it’s \nprobably more of a  compliment to  be called a robot, because that is the \nstate that racers spend their lives working towards —  being able to hit the \nsame braking points and the  same lines lap after lap after lap. \nAnd how long before the  batteries run flat  on  this particular robot? \n‘T don’t know, because many things can  happen,’ says Pedrosa. ‘But maybe \nmy \nmid-30s \nwould \nbe \na \ngood \nmoment \nto \nretire.’ \nWhich \ntakes \nus \nto \n2020 \nor \nthereabouts. \nLove \nhim \nor \nloathe \nhim, \nbetter \nget \nused \nto \nhim... \nMotoGP Mutterings: August 2006 \nDucati \ncelebrated \nits  \n60th \nyear \nof  \nmotorcycle \n‘If \nthe  \nUS \nAir \nForce \nproduction \nin \n2006. \nBig \nup \nthe \nBolognese! \nhadn't \nbombed \nthe \nhell \nout \nof \nthe \n‘War, \nwhat \nis \nit \ngood \nfor? \nAbsolutely \nnothing,’ \nsang \nDucati \nfactory \nin \nEdwin \nStarr, \namong \nothers. \nHe \nwas \nright, \nof \ncourse. \n1944 \nwe \nwould \nnever \nWell, \nup \nto \na \npoint. \nBecause \nif \nit \nhadn’t \nbeen \nfor \nthe \nhave \ngot \nto \nsee \nthe \nUS \nAir \nForce \nbombing \nthe \nhell \nout \nof \nthe \nDucati \nwondrous \n916’ \nfactory \nin  \n1944 \nwe  \nwould \nnever \nhave \ngot  \nto  \nsee  \nthe \n378 THE FAST STUFF \nwondrous 916 or  watch Loris Capirossi grappling with his loopy \nDesmosedici. \nUntil the  USAF appeared over Bologna 62  years ago, Ducati had no \ninterest in bikes. Inspired by local electronics genius Guglielmo Marconi, \nthe Ducati brothers manufactured radios, electric shavers, cameras and \ncondensers. Mussolini was well impressed when he visited the  factory \nin  1940, so  much so  that Ducati was pressed into manufacturing \nmilitary equipment, first by  Mussolini, then, after the Italians \nsurrendered in  1943, by the  Nazis. Hence the  1944 visit by hundreds of \nFlying Fortresses in the  aptly named Operation Pancake. \nWith their factory flattened and the war over, the Ducati brothers \ndecided to build a new factory and have a go at making motorcycles to get \nwar-ravaged Italy back on  the road. Their first bike, Il Cucciolo (the Puppy), \nwas no more than a bicycle with a tiny 1.5bhp engine attached, very similar \nto  Soichiro Honda’s first bike, the Putt Putt, also created in 1946. \nStrange beginnings for a  company now nicknamed ‘the Ferrari of \nmotorcycling’, the only biking brand outside Japan capable of \nhumbling the mighty Honda. Ducati’s achievements in racing —  both in \nMotoGP and World Superbike —  are  remarkable when you consider the \nsize of  the company. In  a  good year the Bolognese production lines \nmake 40,000 bikes, while Honda churns out  several million. \nBut  to  fully understand Ducati’s racetrack prowess you need to  look \nat  some different numbers. Of Ducati’s 1000 staff, 100  (or  10 per  cent) \nwork at  Ducati Corse, while 125 engineers toil at  Honda Racing \nCorporation, around 0.4  per  cent of Honda’s 30,000 workforce. And if \nyou  can’t understand why Kawasaki Heavy Industries can’t kick arse in \nMotoGP, try  these numbers for  size —  Kawasaki's race shop numbers \njust 30  souls, or  0.075 per  cent of  KHI’s 40,000 workers. So  Ducati’s \ncommitment to  racing is 25  times greater than Honda’s and 130 times \nbigger than Kawasaki's. \nIn other words, Ducati is a large race shop with a smallish production \nline attached. And the  company lives or  dies by its  race results. Few \npeople remember that just two decades ago  Ducati seemed doomed to \ncollapse. Two things saved it from those dark days —  the  seminal 748cc \neight-valve v-twin built by Massimo Bordi, understudy to the legendary \nFabio Taglioni, and the  creation of the  World Superbike series. Bordi’s \n748 \nbegat \nthe \n851 \nwhich \nbegat \nthe \n888 \nwhich \nbegat \nthe \n916, \nwhile \nWSB \nprovided \nthe \nstage \nupon \nwhich \nDucati \nshowed \nthe \nworld \nwhat \nit \ncould \nWHAT THE USAF pip FOR DUCATI 379 \ndo.  And World Supers success allowed Ducati to  dare to  dream that \nthey might also humble biking’s Japanese overlords in MotoGP. \nDuring its  60-year history Ducati has been through more ups and \ndowns and ins  and outs, through more hairpin bends and multiple \npile-ups than an  Italian autostrada or  parliament. And it  may well \nalways be  so,  because while Ducati bosses talk in public about passion \n(‘Our company is glued together by passion,’ says CEO Federico Minoli, \nwhich sounds a  bit  messy), behind closed doors they probably talk \nmore about private equity. The factory has  just changed hands again, \nback in Italian ownership after some years with US  backers. \nCoincidentally, Ducati’s museum was completed at  about the  same \ntime. The final piece of the jigsaw —  a  1956 triple camshaft desmo 125 \nGP  bike —  was recently discovered in  the  corner of  a  French garage \nwhere it  had been for  four decades. The museum —  almost certainly \nEurope’s best collection of race bikes —  is  worth a visit, packed with \neverything from Cucciolos to  Hailwood’s TT-winning 900SS, half a \ndozen Foggy Superbikes and Capirossi’s MotoGP machine. The museum \nis  cool, dark and quiet, like a  chapel, and crammed with relics and \nicons, \nincluding \nthe \nvery \ndrawing \nboard \nat \nwhich \nTaglioni \nworked. \nIt  \nis \nperhaps \nodd \nthat \nDucati \nhas \nonly \nrecently \nawoken \nto  \nthe  \nvalue \nof \nits \nhistory, \nbecause \nwhile \nmachines \nlike \nthe \nDesmosedici \nRR \nconvince \nthe \nworld \nof \nits \ntechnical \nbrilliance, \nperhaps \nits \nfinancial \nsaviour \nwill \nbe \nbikes \nlike \nthe \nSport \nClassics \nwhich \nemulate \nthe \nHarley \nmodel \nof \nbuilding \nlow-tech \nbikes \nthat \ncommand \npremium \nprices. \nLet’s \njust \nhope, \nhowever, \nthat \nDucati \ndoesn’t \ncheapen \nits  \nlegend \ntoo \nmuch \nby \ncopying \nHarley \nin \nflogging \ncratefuls \nof \nHarley \nshaving \ncream \nat \nTesco. \nI’m \nnot \noptimistic, \nhowever, \nbecause \nFerrari \nhas \nalready \nstarted \nselling \nits \nown \nbrand \nof \naftershave \ncalled, \nwait \nfor \nit, \n‘Passion’. \nCHAPTER 49 \nSTONER: ‘I EXPECTED IT  TO  TAKE \nTWO YEARS, NOT TWO RACES’ \nAugust 2006 \nCasey Stoner’s debut MotoGP campaign proved he  had the \nspeed to  race with the best, but problems with his  equipment \nalso caused him to  crash, so  what went right and what went \nwrong for  MotoGP’s hottest new star in 2006? \nAussie youngster Casey Stoner has  always had the mark of genius about \nhim and now he’s made his  mark on  MotoGP. The 20-year-old qualified \non  pole for the 2006 Qatar GP making him the second youngest premier- \nclass pole-sitter after American legend Freddie Spencer. ‘I expected it to \ntake two years to  get a pole, not  two races,’ said the  former 125  and 250 \nGP winner who went on  to lead that race until leg cramps and a dose of \nthe  ‘flu  slowed him. Eventual victor Valentino Rossi was stunned by the \nnew boy’s speed: ‘He was racing like he’s been in this  class for ten  years’. \nStoner’s secret? An even earlier start to his career than Rossi: ‘I was doing \nthe throttle of  a Pee Wee when I was 18 months old, my cousin sitting on \nthe  back.’ Youth may be  wasted on  the  young, as  nineteenth-century \nIrish wit  Oscar Wilde once opined, but  not  always. \nSo  Stoner and  his  LCR Honda made their mark with impressive speed \nduring 2006, though they also made a few dents in MotoGP’s surrounding \nscenery. But  like  the feisty Australian says, people shouldn’t criticise him \nfor trying too  hard. And Stoner always tries hard. He is the exact opposite \nof former 250  rival Dani Pedrosa. He is not  reticent, he never likes to take \na  step back, he  is always on  the  attack. His  style is all-action, from the \nmoment he leaves pit lane to when he returns. And he’s the same off the \nbike, happy to  fire  off a  volley at  anyone who dares criticise his  riding. \nExcellent, the paddock needs people like that! \nDo you  enjoy MotoGP more than you  enjoyed 125s and 250s? \nIt’s  a little bit more my  style, what I’ve grown up  to deal with, which is \nSTONER: ‘I EXPECTED IT TO  TAKE TWO YEARS, NOT TWO RACES’ 381 \ndirt track —  sliding and moving the bike around. That way of riding is a \nlittle more enjoyable for me, so  I feel more relaxed on  these bikes. \nSo your dirt-track training is now coming into play? \nWith MotoGP bikes it’s  not  so  much to do with the  settings. Of course, \nyou've still got to  get the best setting you can, but it’s not  all to do with \nthat. At  the  end of the  day you can  ride what you've got  and still be \ncompetitive, whereas with 125s and 250s it’s  very hard to make up  the \ntime if your settings aren’t any good. \nWe have more time to work on  set-up in MotoGP but if it’s not perfect \ngoing into the  race you can still get a good result out  of it. If you don’t \nhave the setting pretty much perfect in  125s and 250s you're pretty \nwell buggered for the  race. In MotoGP it’s a little easier to pull it out  of \nthe bag if the bike isn’t perfect, as  you’ve seen Rossi do many times. He \nqualifies terrible, then wins the  race. \nIn  MotoGP the  main thing you've got  to  do  is get  the  power to  the \nground and towards the end of the race is when that gets real important. \nIf you've got the  riding style and a  good feeling to  get the  power to  the \nground, you can  pretty much make whatever you want out  of the bike. \nDoes your style change much during the course of a race? \nYeah, \nat \nthe  \nstart \nof \nthe \nrace \nyou \ntrust \nthe  \ntyres \na \nlittle \nbit \nmore \nand \nyou \npush \nthe \nbike \ninto \nthe \ncorners \na \nlittle \nbit \nmore \nbecause \nthe \ntyres \nare \nthere. \nTowards \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \nrace \nyou \ntake \nit \na \nlittle \neasier, \nyou \njust \ntry \nand \nconcentrate \non \ngetting \nthe \nrear \ngrip \nto \nhook \nup \nand \nthat \nmakes \na \nlot \nof \ntime. \nIs that easy with traction control? \nI \ndon’t \nknow \nwhat \nthe \nYamaha \nand \nthe \nother \nbikes \nare \nlike. \nWith \nthe \nHonda \nthe \ntraction \ncontrol \nis \nthere \nto \na \ncertain \ndegree \nbut \nit \ndoesn’t \nhelp \na \nheck \nof \na \nlot. \nYeah, \nwhen \nthe \ntyres \nare \nterrible \nat \nthe \nend \nof \na \nrace \nthen \nit \ncan \nhelp \nbecause \nit \nsaves \nyou \nenergy \nand \nyou \ndon’t \nhave \nto \nconcentrate \nso \nhard \non \nkeeping \nthe \nthing \nhooked \nup. \nBut \nthe \nbikes \nare \na \nlot \nmore \npowerful \nthan \nanything \nelse \naround \nso \nthey \nneed \ntraction \ncontrol, \nif \nyou \ndidn’t \nhave \nit \nthe \ntyres \nwould \nbe \nbuggered \nin \na \nfew \nlaps, \nso \nit \ndefinitely \nhelps \nwhen \nthe \ntyres \naren’t \ngreat. \nIn  \npractice \nat  \nthe  \nSachsenring \nmy  \ntraction \ncontrol \nwasn’t \nworking \nbut \nI \nwas \nonly \na \ncouple \nof \ntenths \noff \nwhat \nI \nwas \nnormally \ndoing. \nIt’s \nno \n382 THE FAST STUFF \nbig deal; personally I just think it stops a  lot  of highsides and, yeah, \ninstead of the  tyre constantly spinning when it steps out, it only lets  it \ngo to  that certain place and it’s  still  hookin’ you up. \nAre you  impressed by the riders in MotoGP? \nYeah, definitely. I’m  impressed by the  fact that every week they’re up \nfront and they’re always fighting hard, there’s no  easy race. In  125s or \n250s, if you have a  good set-up and some people are  having a bad day, \nthat’s it, they’re nowhere to  be  seen. In  MotoGP everyone has a  good \nday at  every race pretty much, they’re always running up  front. That’s \nthe  hardest thing to  get your head around. \nWho impresses you  the most? \nValentino, of course, and I’ve  got a lot of respect for Dani. What Dani has \ndone this year is very impressive, I’m kind of proud to step up to MotoGP \nat  the  same time as  him. He  is running second in the  championship in \nhis first year; he can’t really be too  upset about that. If I had finished the \nraces I hadn’t finished I'd  be in a lot better place as  well, but  we  didn’t \ncome in this season to  even think of running where we  are  running, so \nI’ve got to  be happy with what we  are  doing. \nDo you gauge yourself against Dani? \nNot really, because we’re racing so  many more people. Last year in 250s \nit was kinda just us  two consistently running up  front. In MotoGP the \ntop five are  always running up  front, it’s  a lot harder work, it’s  not  just \nbetween me  and him. \nAre you mates? \nWe  used to  be  until we  were in  the  same class. He  doesn’t seem to \ncommunicate with me, at all, or  make any  eye  contact. I’ve  never had a \nproblem with him and I respect him as a racer, but  maybe he’s got  a \nproblem with me. I don’t know why, maybe because we  came through \nat  the  same time. We  both came through Alberto Puig’s schooling. But \nI've  got  no  problems with him and at  one stage we  got on  pretty well. \nAre you  sad you never got to race 500s? \nI’m  sure Dani's got  the  same opinion as  me. I’m a little frustrated with \nwhat some other riders have been saying, like we  wouldn’t be  going \nSTONER: \n‘I \nEXPECTED \nIT \nTO  \nTAKE \nTWO \nYEARS, \nNOT \nTWO \nRACES’ \n383 \nanywhere \nnear \nas  \nwell \nas  \nwe  \nare  \nnow \nif \nwe  \nwere \non  \n500s, \nthat \nyou've \ngot \nto \nride \nthe \n500s \ndifferently, \nstand \nthem \nup \nmore \nand \nall \nthe \nrest \nof \nit, \nbut \nat \na \nlot \nof \nthe \ntracks \nDani \nand \nI \nare \nstanding \nour \nbikes \nup \nmore \nthan \nthe \nseasoned \nguys, \nso \nthey \ncan’t \nreally \ntell \nus \nwe \nwouldn’t \nhave \nbeen \ngood \non \n500s. \nI think \neveryone \nshould \nkeep \ntheir \nopinions \nto themselves \nuntil \nthey’re \nproven. \nI \nwould \nreally \nhave \nliked \nto stayed \ntwo-stroke \nand \nraced \n500s. \nI \nmean, \nI’m \nimpressed \nwith \nthe \nfour-strokes \nand \nwhat \ntheir \npower \nis \nlike, \nbut \nI \nwould \nsay \nthat \nthey \nare \na \nlot \neasier \nto \nrider \nthan \nthe \n500s. \nI would’ve \nliked \nto \nhave \ntried \nthe \nsavage \npower \nof \nthe \n500s, \nI \nsuppose. \nWho is your coach these days? \nI just do  my  own thing, I have been for  a  few years now.

This is how JB learned \nhis  legendary problem-solving skills \nEngines and engineering would seem to run in Jeremy Burgess’ blood. \nA  century before JB  won his  first world championship with Wayne \nGardner in 1987, his great-uncles David and John Shearer were creating \nAustralia’s first motor car, a  wood-burning, steam-driven vehicle \nequipped with a  differential, a decade before Henry Ford’s seminal Tin \nLizzy featured a  diff. The Shearer creation now takes pride of place in \nAustralia’s national motor museum, near Adelaide, JB’s hometown. \n‘The car  looks like  anything that Benz built in the  first days when all \nthose guys realised that trains ran  on  rails and that a  smaller steam \nengine would drive something on  the  road,’ says Burgess, a self-taught \nengineer who isn’t so  sure that engines do run  in his blood. He  reckons \nhis  love of engineering is a factor of nurture, not  nature, of his  growing \nup  on  the  family farm, surrounded by agricultural machinery. \n‘My father always insisted that my mechanical knowledge came \nfrom the  Shearers but  my brother is a lawyer and my  sister is a  doctor, \nso  I’m  not  so  sure,’ he adds. ‘I think any  young bloke growing up  on  a \nfarm in  the  Adelaide hills with machinery all  around would’ve picked \nup  on  all of that.’ \nWhat seems more certain is that the rough and tumble of rural Aussie \nlife and then of the Aussie bike-racing circuit equipped JB with the ability \nand the resolve to get stuck in and solve problems quickly. Where others \nget sidetracked by  the bullshit and complexity of  modern racing, \nJB  always gets to  the  nub. It is this  no-nonsense attitude and a straight- \nforward intelligence that has made him bike racing’s most successful \nTHE JB  MANTRA: KEEP IT  SIMPLE, STUPID 387 \nengineer of the  past two decades. Burgess followed Gardner’s 1987 500 \ntitle with a further ten  premier-class world championships between 1994 \nand 2005, five with Mick Doohan and five with Valentino Rossi. \nJB  started his  love affair with internal combustion engineering at \neight years old, in  1961. ‘I was driving at eight and bought my  first car \nat  12.  The idea of buying the  car,  as  the  old  man saw it, was to  tinker \nwith it, but  my  idea was to  get it going as  fast as  we  could and milk his \ntank for petrol.’ \nAt  15  he got his  first bike, an  ancient Velocette scrambler. ‘Someone \nhad converted it to  run on  alcohol and it kept bending valves, so  we \nplayed around with that.’ He  didn’t know it at  the  time but he  was \ngetting sucked in.  He  bought his  first road bike, a Suzuki T500 twin, a \nyear or  so  later, and then a Kawasaki 750  triple in  1972. ‘Your first years \nout  of school you  never really know what you're going to do and I don’t \nknow why I suddenly went out  and bought a  Mach 4 but  I did  and as \nsoon as  I got it I was racing it.  I suppose my  mates were doing it, that \nwas the  starting point, then you realise you enjoy it. \nSome things just take over your life.’ \nIt  might all  have ended there if  JB  had been ‘I was exceptionally \nconscripted \nto \njoin \nthe \nAustralian \narmy, \nwhich \nwas \nclose \nto \ngetting \nmired \nin \nVietnam \nwith \nthe \nAmericans. \n‘I \nwas \nconscripted \nfor \nexceptionally \nclose \nto \ngetting \nconscripted. \nI \nhad \nto \nVietnam, \nbut \nI \nwas \nregister \nby \nDecember \n31 \n1973 \nto \ncome \nup \nfor \nthe \ngoing \nto \ndodge \nit, \ndraft \nin \nthe \nfirst \nsix \nmonths \nof \nthe \nnext \nyear, \nbut \nanyway’ \nfortunately \nour \ngovernment \nchanged \nin  \nDecember \nere \nee \nand \nwe  \ndidn’t \nhave \nto  \nworry \nabout \nit.  \nI \nwasn’t \ngoing \nto  \nregister \nanyway, \nI \nwas \ngoing \nto  \ndodge \nit.  \nMy  \nfather \nhad \nalways \nsaid \nhe  \ndidn’t \nraise \ntwo \nsons \nto  \nhave \nthem \nkilled \nin \na  \nstupid \nwar.’ \nSaved \nfrom \nVietnam, \nJB  \ngot  \nserious \nabout \nracing. \nHe  \nbought \ntwo \nTZ350s \nto \ngo \nwith \nthe  \nKawa \ntriple, \nthen \nin  \n1976 \ntraded \nthem \nin \nfor \none \nof \nSuzuki’s \nnew \nRG500s. \nHe \nwas \nearning \ngood \nmoney \nworking \nfor \na \ndrilling \ncompany \nand \nthe \nlocal \nbrickworks, \nwinning \nplenty \nof \nraces \nand \ndriving \nplenty \nof \nmiles \n— \n26 \nhours \nto \nPerth, \n23 \nhours \nto \nSurfers \nParadise \non \nthe \nGold \nCoast. \n‘Racing \nconsumed \nme. \nI \nfelt \nI \nwas \npretty \ngood \nat \nit, \nI \nmade \nit \nall \nthe \nway \nto \nA \ngrade \npretty \nquickly, \nwhere \nI \nwas \nup \nagainst \nguys \nlike \nGregg \nHansford, \nthe \nWilling \nbrothers, \nJohn \nWoodley \nand \nKenny \nBlake, \nall \nthe \nguys \nwho \nwent \non \nto \nEurope.’ \nJB  \ndecided \nhe \nneeded \nmore \nhorsepower \nto  \nstay \nwith \nthis \nremarkable \n388 THE FAST STUFF \ngeneration of Aussie riders, so  he  sold the  RG  in  1979 and bought a \nTZ750. ‘It wasn’t the  smartest thing I ever did. Compared to the  Suzuki \nthe TZ didn’t have the calibre, it just wasn’t a purebred racing motorcycle \nlike  the  RG,  it was cheap, but  they made bucket loads of them and they \ndid  a good job.’ \nBy now JB  was starting to  dream about joining Hansford and the \nrest in Europe. But in the  end he made the  trip as  a holidaymaker, not \nas  a  racer. His  own racing career lost momentum after his  travelling \ncompanion got killed in a streetbike crash. ‘I never retired, I just stopped \ndoing it!’  At  the  end of ’79  JB  sold his  race bikes, took six  weeks off \nwork and headed to  Europe, part holiday, part recce, just in  case he \ndecided to  continue racing. Inevitably his  savings ran  out  sooner than \nexpected and he applied for a job as  mechanic to racing prodigy Randy \nMamola, who had just signed for  Suzuki. \nJB’s bike preparation in Australian championship racing had always \nbeen immaculate and it was this reputation that got him the job working \non  Mamola’s factory RG500s. ‘The guys at  Suzuki knew my RG ran  when \nothers broke,’ says JB, who still works by his  father’s axiom, the  five  Ps: \nperfect preparation prevents poor performance. So  his  fascination with \nall things mechanical was starting to pay big dividends and had put him \non  the road to world-class success. ‘When I was racing back home, mates \nwould drive up  the  driveway with their girlfriends and I’d  be up  to  my \nelbows in a TZ  gearbox or  an  RG  rotary valve or  whatever. They'd hang \naround for  half an  hour and then go  off,  but  I never felt  compelled to \ndrop the  tools and go with them, I was doing what I wanted to  do.’ \nBurgess fettled Mamola’s bikes for  three years, winning five GPs, \nthen when Suzuki downsized to  a  one-man team in  1983 he  got  a job \nwith HRC, spannering for Ron Haslam. He worked with Freddie Spencer \nduring the  American’s unique 250/500 title-winning year in  1985 and \ngot his  first crew chief job with Gardner the  following season. In  1987 \nJB  and the Wollongong wild one defeated reigning champ Eddie \nLawson to win the  500 title. In  1989 Burgess was assigned the  task of \nhoning \nHonda’s \nnew \nsigning, \nthe \nfast \nbut \nscary \nDoohan. \nThe \npair \nwon \nfive \nback-to-back \ntitles \nfrom \n1994, \nthen \nwhen \nDoohan \nquit \nin \n1999, \nHRC \nsigned \nRossi \nand \nput \nhim \nto \nwork \nwith \nBurgess. \nSome \ncritics \nsuggest \nthat \nJB \nhas \nbeen \nlucky \nto \nwork \nwith \ngenius \nriders, \nbut \nthat’s \nnonsense; \nHRC \nunderstood \nhis \ntalent \nfor \ngetting \nthe \nbest \nout \nof \nboth \nman \nand \nmachine \nand \nthus \ngave \nhim \ntheir \nmost \nvaluable \nriders. \nTHE \nJB  \nMANTRA: \nKEEP \nIT  \nSIMPLE, \nSTUPID \n389 \nJB’s \nwinning \nsecret: \ndon’t \ncomplicate \nthings \nBurgess \nis  \nfamously \nblunt \n(‘When \nyou \nsay  \nI’m \nblunt, \ndo  \nyou \nmean \nrude?’) \nbecause \nhe \nbelieves \nthere’s \nno  \ntime \nin \nracing \nfor \ncloaking \nwhat \nhe’s \ngot \nto \nsay \nin \ndiplomacy. \nIf \nsomething’s \nnot \nright \nor \nsomeone’s \nnot \ndoing \ntheir \njob \nproperly, \nhe \ncalls \na \nspade \na \nbloody \nspade. \nHis \ninsistence \non \nalways \nstanding \nhis \nground \n— \neven \nwhen \nhe’s \nworking \nwith \na \nsuperstar \nrider \n— \ngets \nhim \nrespect \nand \nresults. \nBut it is his  problem-solving abilities that have contributed most to \nhis  success, and JB  believes that this talent comes from his  days of \nmaking do.  ‘When I worked for  that drilling company we  were always \nin the  bush. So you're 500 miles from the  city and you can’t get a new \npart, so  you've got  to  fix what you've got, so  you heat it, weld it, cut  it, \nwhatever. The mentality is there —  how can  we  keep it going?’ \nAlthough the make-do mentality no  longer applies in top-level racing \nwhere parts mileage is automatically logged by computer and everything \nis  replaced in  good time, the process of  thinking your way through \nproblems does still count. JB’s approach is  always straightforward, \nunlike many engineers who seem to get too  caught up in the complexity \nof it all,  and it is ironic that the  more complicated racing becomes, the \nmore vital it is to  have a  simple approach. Burgess is a big picture man, \nalways determined to  simplify and demystify, so  here comes another \nfavourite maxim: the  KISS principle —  keep it simple, stupid. \n‘It’s the  same in  all  sports,’ he  says. ‘Look at  soccer, there are  three \nsides to  the  game —  when they’ve got the ball, when you've got the ball \nand when no  one’s got the ball. How much more difficult than that can \nit be? It’s  the  same in motorcycle racing, everything on  a motorcycle is \nmechanical, so  it either works or  it doesn’t.

Four others have managed the \nfeat at similarly young ages: Freddie Spencer won the  1983 500  title at 21 \nyears and 258  days, Mike Hailwood secured the  1962 500  crown aged 22 \nand 160  days, John Surtees took his first 500  championship in 1956 at 22 \nyears and 182  days and Valentino Rossi wrapped up  the  2001 500 title \nwhen he was 22  years and 240  days old. \nThose five title successes must rank amongst the greatest \nachievements in racing history; I mean, what do most of us  achieve by \nthat age? A  first proper job, passing your bike test, maybe getting \nthrough university, certainly nothing as  grand as  climbing to  the \nsummit of one  of the world’s most vicious sports. \nSo  what makes the young Stoner, Rossi, Spencer, Hailwood and \nSurtees so  different from the young you  and  me? Why were they on  top \nof the  world when you were maybe festering in  student digs, dispatch \nriding on  a  shagged-out Honda NTV, on  the dole or  simply getting \npissed up  and shagging around? And what makes them stand so  high \nabove other racers who also started young? \nRiding talent, for  a  start, towering mountains and raging rivers of \nthe  stuff, plus intelligence and unfaltering dedication, *or, as  Surtees \ncalled his  own brand of  world-beating determination, ‘the inherent \nSurtees family cussedness’. That’s all downright obvious, but where did \ntheir talent come from and how was it applied so  successfully and so \nearly? In  short, it’s  all nature and nurture, the  two factors that control \nTOWERING \nMOUNTAINS \nAND \nRAGING \nRIVERS \nOF  \nRIDING \nTALENT \n415 \nall  \nour \ndestinies. \nNature \nis  \nyour \ngenes, \nthe \nstuff \nthat’s \npassed \ndown \nfrom \nyour \nparents, \nwhile \nnurture \nis \nhow \nyour \nupbringing \ndeveloped \nyour \ncharacter. \nIn \nother \nwords, \na \nlot \nof \nit’s \ndown \nto \nparents, and  fathers in particular. ae \nStoner’s \ndad \nreckons \nhis  \nson’s \nskill \nis \nin \nhis  \nDNA: \n‘Casey \nwas \ndoing \n‘Like \na \nlot \nof \nkids \nit \nwas \nobvious \nfrom \nan \nearly \nage \nthings \non \na \nbike \nthat \nCasey \nhas \nthe \nskills \nlevel \nrequired,’ \nsays \nColin \naged \nsix \nyou \nStoner. \n‘He \nwas \ndoing \nthings \non a \nbike \naged \nsix \nyou \nwouldn't \nbelieve, \nwouldn’t \nbelieve. \nPlus \nhe’s \ngot \nthe \nmentality \nto go \nplus \nhe’s \ngot \nthe \nwith \nit. \nHe’s \nvery, \nvery \nmentally \nstrong. \nAnd \nlike \nall \nmentality \nto go \nthe \nothers, \nhe comes \nfrom \na petrol \nbackground.’ \nwith \nit’ \nStoner, Rossi, Spencer, Hailwood and Surtees share \nseveral characteristics and life  factors in  common, \nbut perhaps most important of all,  their dads were all  into bikes and \ninto speed. More than that, in  fact, their dads all  raced. Colin Stoner \nstarted riding on  Australian roads when he  was 14,  borrowing his \nbrother’s streetbike, and became a very handy roadracer and kart racer \nduring the 1970s, though he  admits ‘I  didn’t have a  clue what I was \ndoing’, which is why he got  involved with his  son’s racing, to help him \navoid the  pitfalls. Rossi’s father Graziano was a  top  GP  racer and  won \nthree 250 GPs in  1979, the  year Valentino was born. Freddie Spencer \nSenior was up  for  racing anything with an  engine —  dirt bikes, drag \nbikes, sprint cars and eventually powerboats. Hailwood’s old  man and \nSurtees’ dad raced sidecars before the  Second World War, pop Hailwood \nlater earning the  nickname Stan ‘The Wallet’ as  owner of a  chain of \nmotorcycle \nshops, \nwhile \nJack \nSurtees \nwas \nat \none \nstage \nthe \nUK’s \nbiggest \nVincent dealer. \nSo \nbikes \nand \nracing \nloomed \nlarge \nin \nthe \ngene \npools \nof \nthese \nthrusting \nyoungsters, \nbut \nthat \ndoesn’t \nmean \nthat \ntheir \ndads \nor \ntheir \nupbringings \nwere \nthe \nsame, \nfar \nfrom \nit. \nTake \nSurtees, \nRossi \nand \nStoner \nand \nyou \ncould \nhardly \nimagine \nmore \ndifferent \nbackgrounds: \nSurtees, \nthe \ngrubby- \nkneed \nkid \ngrowing \nup \nduring \nthe \nBlitz, \nscraping \ntogether \nenough \ncash \nto \ngo \nracing \non \na \nweekly \napprenticeship \nwage \nof \n£2.50, \nRossi \nthe \nfirstborn \nof \na \nbeaming \nGP \nstar, \nmotorhoming \nit \naround \nEurope \nwith \nBarry \nSheene \nand \nKing \nKenny \nRoberts \nin \nan \nage \nof \nvivid \nsporting \nglamour, \nStoner \ngrowing \nup \nthe \nAussie \nway \nin \nthe \nbig \noutdoors, \na \nfew \nminutes \nfrom \nthe \nbeach, \nmucking \nabout \nin \nboats, \non \nhorseback \nand \non \ndirt bikes. \n416 THE FAST STUFF \nTheir childhoods span generations, during which time the  world \nchanged a great deal. Europe was transformed from war torn, bombed \nand exhausted to rich, bangin’ and economically united, while Australia \nboomed and became arguably the world’s sportiest nation. In  the \nmeantime society’s attitudes were turned upside down, not least its \nattitude towards youth, while sport metamorphosed from a  game for \nmoneyed amateurs into a form of dynamic advertising. \nBack in the  1940s kids didn’t even get out  of school shorts until they \nwere well into their teens. Surtees had to  wait until he was 13  for  his \nfirst bike ride and a further three years before his  first roadrace, having \nspent the  previous ten  learning to  put bikes together with little more \nthan a screwdriver and a piece of string. \nStoner and Rossi grew up  in  an  age obsessed with youth, when \nteenagers can do  things they never dreamed of  doing half a  century \nearlier. Stoner was sitting on  the back of a minibike working the throttle \nwhen he was 18  months old  and riding around the  garden at  three. A \nyear later he  competed in his  first dirt track race and aged six  he won \nhis  first Australian title. Rossi rode his  first minibike aged two and a \nhalf, was Italian champion by the  age  of 15, contested his  first GP at  16 \nand was a multimillionaire before leaving his  teens. \nThere are  similarities in their upbringings, however. Surtees, Stoner \nand Rossi didn’t have pushy fathers. Colin Stoner, Graziano Rossi and \nJack Surtees were delighted that their kids got a  kick out of  bikes, \njust as  they did, but there was never any question of their sons being \npushed into racing. Dad Surtees was still pursuing his  own racing \ncareer when John first got into riding, so  the young teenager was \nmerely happy that his  father showed ‘no resentment, just lots of \nencouragement’. Years later Stoner wanted nothing more than to  go \nracing. During his schoolboy racing days he  saw many kids being \npushed into racing by their fathers, but as  he  says: ‘the good riders \nhave always wanted to  do  it all  their lives’. Rossi was also the  driving \nforce behind his  own entry into competition, initially in go-karts. ‘But \nthe  problem with go-karts is  that they cost very much money,’ he \nrecalls. ‘So  I said to  my  father “Maybe it’s  better we  race with a bike,” \nand he  say  “Ah, bo, really?” \nAnyway, all that really mattered was that Stoner was out  there at the \nyoungest-possible age, as  were Rossi, Surtees, Hailwood and Spencer \nbefore him, learning the  art  of  machine control, as  well as  strategy, \nTOWERING MOUNTAINS AND RAGING RIVERS OF  RIDING TALENT 417 \ntechnical \naptitude, \ncoolness \nof \nhead \nand \nhow \nto \ndeal \nwith \nthe \ndowns \nas \nwell \nas \nthe \nups. \nBut \nmost \nof all, \nhaving \nfun. \nIf Rossi’s and Surtees’ casual rise  to greatness lacked any grand plan, \nthings were a little different for Hailwood, arguably the most naturally \ntalented of all, and Spencer, whose fathers seemed more intent on  their \noffspring achieving success. Stan was a hard-nosed businessman who \nthrew serious money at  Mike’s career from the outset; he  was \ndetermined his  boy would succeed. He  bought the best bikes and \nharangued the media to  get  Mike the best coverage; in  that sense \nHailwood Senior was way ahead of his  time. \nAlthough Hailwood wasn’t legally allowed to  start racing until 17, \nwhen he was working his  apprenticeship at Triumph (making the  tea), \nhis  father gave him a  hand-made miniature motorcycle at  the  age  of \nseven, to  ride around the  grounds of the  family’s Oxfordshire home. \nThat creation, powered by  a  100cc Royal Enfield two-stroke, gave \nHailwood something of a  head start in  an  age  when no  one had even \nthought of mass-producing minibikes. \nLike Surtees and Stoner, Hailwood and Spencer were also made in \ndifferent eras and different cultures. While minibikes didn’t exist when \nHailwood was caning his little Enfield around his dad’s garden during the \n1950s, Spencer grew up in the  1970s, when minibike racing was exploding \nacross the  United States. Spencer’s father dedicated himself to  helping \nFreddie make it in the gritty world of US dirt track, collecting his son  from \nschool on  Friday evenings and spending the weekend driving thousands of \nmiles across the States. They’d do a dirt track Friday night, drive to another \nstate to  roadrace on  the  Saturday, then maybe another dirt track before \nheading back to  school. By the  time he  was 12,  Freddie was already a \nrenegade pro-racer, competing in  ‘outlaw’ dirt track events against real \npros at rodeos, and  then sharing the drive home with his exhausted dad. \nStoner’s dad put  in the  hard yards too  for his  son, driving thousands \nof kilometres across Australia. And all that effort surely had some effect \non \nthe \nkid’s \ndetermination \nto \ndo \nwell. \nStoner \nis \nrenowned \nfor \nnever \ndoing \na \nlazy \nlap \nand \nhis \ndad \nthinks \nthat \ngoes \nback \nto \nhis \ninterstate \ndirt- \ntracking \ndays. \n‘We'd \ndrive \n2000 \nkays \nto \na \ndirt \ntrack \nrace \nand \nCasey \nwould \nget \nfive \nlaps \nof \npractice, \nso \nhe \nhad \nto \nmake \nevery \nlap \ncount,’ \nsays \nStoner senior. \nPerhaps \nthe  \nStoner \nfamily \nmade \nthe \nbiggest \nsacrifice \nof \nthese \nfive \nbike- \nmad \nfamilies, \nselling \nup  \nDown \nUnder \nto  \nbring \n14-year-old \nCasey \nto \n418 THE FAST STUFF \nEurope. But Colin Stoner doesn’t see  it like that. ‘The way I look at  it \nthere were no  sacrifices,’ he says. ‘We set  off on  an  adventure just to  see \nwhere it ended up.  The adventure really started when he was four years \nold  and we  went racing. The trip to  Europe was another adventure, it \nwasn’t going to kill us  if we  failed but we  were determined not  to  fail.’ \nNineteenth-century Irish novelist and wit Oscar Wilde jokingly \nobserved that youth is wasted on  the  young, but not, apparently, on \nmen like these, though you could always argue that Stoner, Surtees, \nHailwood, Spencer and Rossi never really had their childhoods. While \nnormal boys are  out  and about necking alcopops, puffing on  cigarettes \nand putting their hands up  girls’ skirts, these youngsters were getting \nstuck in early, learning how to do areal man’s job. Maybe that’s cheating \nbut everyone’s at it these days; bike racing, tennis, golf, football and car \nracing are  all ruled by former child prodigies. As former 500  King Kenny \nRoberts, says: ‘If you start as  a  three-year-old and you’ve got a lot  of \ntalent, you’re going to beat the  guy who startedas a  15-year-old with a \nlot  of talent. Stoner and Rossi are  natural-born motorcycle racers, like \nTiger Woods is a natural-born golfer.’ \nIn  other words, it’s  both the  blood and the  guts, passed down by \nyour dad, and Roberts knows that better than anyone, for  he  was the \nfirst world champ to  father another world champ, Kenny Junior, who \nwon the  500  crown in 2000. So don’t be surprised if Stoner sires a child \nwho brings home the  world championship around about 2035. \nHistory’s youngest premier-class kings \nJohn Surtees \nBorn: 11  February 1934, Surrey, England \n500  world champion 1956, 1958, 1959, 1960 \n350  world champion 1958, 1959, 1960 \nSurtees \nrode \nroaring \nMV \nAgusta \nmultis \nto  \nfour \n500 \ncrowns, \nlater \nswitching \nto  \ncars \nand \nwinning \nthe  \n1964 \nF1  \ntitle \nwith \nFerrari. \nHe’s \nthe \nonly \nman \nto \nhave \nwon \nworld \ntitles \non \ntwo and \nfour \nwheels. \nSon of a sidecar racer, Surtees grew up in the  London suburbs during \nand \nafter \nthe \nSecond \nWorld \nWar, \nriding \na \nbike \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nwhen \nhe \nwas \n13. \nHe \ncompeted \nin \nhis \nfirst \nrace \na \nyear \nlater, \nas \na \nlast-minute \nsub \nfor \nhis \nfather’s \nregular \npassenger, \nonly \nto \nbe \ndisqualified \nbecause \nhe \nwas \nunder \nage. \nAt \n15 \nhe \nmade \nhis \ngrass \ntrack \ndebut \nand \nthen \nstarted \nTOWERING MOUNTAINS AND RAGING RIVERS OF  RIDING TALENT 419 \nroadracing, quickly amassing wins on  a  Vincent Grey Flash, then \nfactory Nortons before the MV  call came. Surtees won a total of 22  500 \nGPs and also took three 350  titles for MV. \nMike Hailwood \nBorn: 2 April 1940, Oxfordshire, England \n500  world champion 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965 \n350  world champion 1967, 1968 \n250 world champion 1961, 1966, 1967 \nHailwood is generally considered to be the greatest racer ever. Supported \nby his  rich father, Mike the  Bike made amazing progress through the \nBritish racing ranks after his  debut in  1957, winning three national \ntitles the  following year. \nDuring 1959 he  won all  four British titles and his  first GP  success. \nTwo summers later he leased a  factory Honda 250 four to  win his  first \nworld title and was quickly signed by the  then-dominant MV factory, \nfor  whom he  won four back-to-back 500 crowns, before returning to \nHonda. He  won four more titles for the Japanese but  ill luck prevented \nhim from giving Honda-san his  first 500 crown. Hailwood then went \nFl  car  racing, before making a fairytale return to bikes in the late 1970s. \nHe  died in a  road car  accident in  1981. \nFreddie Spencer \nBorn: 20 December 1961, Louisiana, USA \n500  world champion 1983, 1985 \n250  world champion 1985 \nA  dazzling natural talent, right up  there with Hailwood, Spencer was \none of  the  first modern generation riders who started not long after \nthey could walk. The Bible Belt kid  made his  dirt  track debut at  the  age \nof six  and was roadracing by 12. \nHoning the art  of  sideways riding, Spencer was soon signed by \nHonda, \nwith \nwhom \nhe \nwon \nthe \nUS \nSuperbike \ntitle \nbefore \nembarking \non \na \nfull-time \nGP \ncareer \nin \n1982. \nThat \nyear \nhe \nbecame \nthe \nyoungest-ever \nwinner \nof \na500 \nGP \nat \n20 \nyears \nand \n196 \ndays, \nclaiming \nthe \nchampionship \nthe \nfollowing \nseason \nafter \na \ntitanic \nduel \nwith \nKenny \nRoberts. \nIn \n’85 \nhe \nbecame \nthe \nfirst, \nand \nstill \nonly, \nman \nin \nhistory \nto \nwin \nthe \n250 \nand \n500 \ntitles \nin \nthe \nsame \nseason, \nbut \nhis \nlater \nyears \nwere \ndogged \nby \ninjury \nand \nill luck. \n420 THE FAST STUFF \nValentino Rossi \nBorn: 16 February 1979, Urbino, Italy \n500  world champion 2001, MotoGP world champion 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 \n250  world champion 1999 \n125  world champion 1996 \nIf Surtees and Hailwood were rare teenage winners in  their era, Rossi \nwas one  of a whole brood of teen stars when he burst on  to  the GP  scene \nin  1996. He  rode his  first minibike aged two and his  first minimoto race \nat  11, after starting his career in karts. Italian 125 sport production champ \nat  15,  he  was ushered into the  Euro 125 series by Aprilia in  1995 and \nthen into the world series the  next year, when he won his  first GP. \nThe following season Rossi walked the 125s, establishing a  pattern \nhe’d repeat on  250s and 500s: learn the  first year, dominate the  second. \nHe  switched to  250s in ‘98, becoming the  youngest-ever 250 champ in \n‘99, aged 20  years and 250 days, then graduated to  500s in  2000, \nwinning the  final 500 title in 2001 and the  first four MotoGP crowns. \nCasey Stoner \nBorn: 16 October 1985, Kurri Kurri, NSW, Australia \nMotoGP world champion 2007 \nStoner, like Rossi, belongs to  the  modern generation of kid  racers who \nget  serious about racing before they can  even read or  write. By the  age \nof three he  was riding a  minibike around the  garden, a  year later he \nhad competed in his  first dirt-track race and he won his  first Australian \ndirt-track title aged six. \nBy  the  time Stoner was a  teenager he  knew he  was ready for  the \ntarmac but  Australians aren’t allowed to  roadrace till  16,  so  his  family \nmoved to  the UK soon after his 14th birthday so  he  could start \nroadracing, and he won a  national title in his  first season. In  2001 he \nmade his  GP  debut. Casey won his  first GP  victory in  2003, finished \nsecond in  the  2005 250 World Championship, scored his  first MotoGP \npole position in 2006 and his  first MotoGP win in March 2007. \nCHAPTER 55 \nCOMPUTER \nSAYS NO \nJuly 2007 \nMotoGP is  turning tame -  these days there’s less sideways \naction, riding styles are getting more samey and races are  more \nspread out. So  are computerised control systems taking the \nnuttiness out of the world’s maddest motorsport? \nValentino Rossi and Casey Stoner are neck and neck, rocking out \nof  a  slow right-hander, wrenching their machines upright as  they \ngrab big  handfuls of  throttle and take aim at  the  next corner. They \nare out of  sight in  an  instant, gone in  a  blaze of  sound, leaving \nonly a  lingering stench of hot metal and scorched rubber. But, if I’m \nnot mistaken, something was missing from this assault on  the \nsenses. No  wheelspin, no  wheelies, no  sideways silliness. Just mind- \nboggling speed. \nIn  case you hadn’t already noticed, MotoGP has changed. Fast- \naccelerating technology has transformed the bikes from unruly monsters \nto  machines that hardly ever put a  wheel out of  line. If you are  an \nengineer, you  would be justifiably proud of this achievement, but  if you \nare  a  fan, you may be  a  teeny-weensy bit  disappointed. Perhaps you \nused to  enjoy watching MotoGP riders employ increasingly outrageous \ntechniques \nto \nwrestle \ntheir \n250 \nhorsepower \nmissiles \ninto \nsubmission. \nI \nknow I did. \nBut  \nthey \ncall  \nthis \nprogress, \nand \nprogress \nis \na \nroad \nalong \nwhich \nwe  \nare \nalways \ntravelling. \nIn \nthe \n1980s \n500 \nGP \nbikes \nwere \nmade \nmore \nmanageable \nby \nthe \nperfection \nof \nreed-valve \ntechnology. \nIn \nthe \n1990s \nthey \nwere \nfurther \ntamed \nby \nthe \nintroduction \nof \nthe \nbig \nbang \nfiring \nconfiguration. \nIn \n1998 \nthey \nwere \nemasculated \na \nbit \nmore \nby \nthe \nswitch \nto \n‘greener’ \nunleaded \nfuel, \nwhich \nmade \nthem \n‘like \nbig \n250s’, \naccording \nto \n500 \nmaster \nMick \nDoohan. \nThen \nin \n2002 \nthey \nfully \nhad \ntheir \nbollocks \nchopped \noff \nwhen \nthe \nsport \nshifted \nto \n990cc \nfour-strokes. \nAs \nformer \n422 THE FAST STUFF \n500 \nwinner \nChristian \nSarron \nsaid: \n‘The \nfour-strokes \nare  \nnice \nbikes... \nfor \ngirls.’ \nSo \nMotoGP’s \nnew \n800s \naren’t \nanything \nrevolutionary, \nthey \nare  \nmerely \nthe product \nof where \nwe are \nat \non \nthe road \nof \ntechnological \nprogress. \nThey \nare \nvery \nmanageable \nmotorcycles \nbecause \nthey \nare \nvery \nwell \nmanaged \nmotorcycles. \nBut is engine management -  traction control, wheelie control, launch \ncontrol, engine-braking control —  really sucking the glory out of MotoGP, \njust like it did  with F1  cars? Yes, if you listen to  the  riders. Even 800s \ngenius Casey Stoner thinks so.  ‘These things should be 1500s, not  800s,’ \nhe says. ‘In fact I’d rather be on  a  500  two-stroke, they weren't stacked \nout with computer control systems. These 800s, everyone can ride \nthem’. Valentino Rossi thinks the  same: ‘I prefer the  990s because the \nlatest control systems make it harder for the rider to make the difference.’ \nIn other words, the most talented riders want nastier bikes, so  they can \nuse  their rare skills to  beat their lesser rivals. \nRossi’s 2007 Fiat Yamaha team-mate Colin Edwards agrees that \nelectronics have taken some of the  talent out  of MotoGP. ‘You go into a \nturn, you take your line, you open the  gas  and the bike somewhat takes \ncare of itself,’ he  says, which doesn’t sound very difficult at  all.  ‘In  the \nold  days you used to  come out  of a  turn, get  on  the  gas  and you'd go \n“Man, I could’ve got on  it five  metres earlier”, next lap you’re on  it five \nmetres earlier and then you’re flying to  the moon, so  that’s where \ntraction control really helps.’ \nRiders fully rely on  the  technology to keep them out  of trouble. At the \nstart of  2007 I eavesdropped on  Stoner debriefing his  engineers after \npractice. The Aussie had been flicked over the highside when he had got \ntoo  eager with the  throttle, and he  was angry. ‘I  should never have \ncrashed,’ he  told his  crew chief. ‘The traction control should have taken \ncare of it.’  So  Stoner believed that the electronics should have translated \nhis  greedy fistful into exactly the  correct amount of power that the  rear \ntyre could handle at  that moment. This would seem to  be  irrefutable \nevidence that traction control does take the  skill out  of riding. \nAnd yet  if electronics trickery has stolen something from MotoGP \nwith one hand, it  does at  least give something back with the  other \n(when the  technology works, that is). ‘These days we  start a lot of GPs \nwith full  and healthy grids,’ says Edwards. ‘In  years past I don’t know \nhow many times guys like Schwantz, Rainey and Doohan rode with \nCOMPUTER SAYS NO 423 \nbroken \narms \nand \nlegs. \nThe \ntechnology \ndefinitely \nmakes \nit \nsafer, \nso  \nyou \ndon’t \nhave \nso \nmuch \nof that \nass \npucker \ngoing \non.’ \nChris Vermeulen’s Rizla Suzuki crew chief Tom O’Kane agrees. ‘I see \nit solely as  a  safety issue,’ he  says. ‘I don’t care what kind of traction \ncontrol you’ve got, if you open the  throttle on  one of these things at \nmaximum lean you better know what you’re doing, or  it'll  spit you off. \nI think traction control has been overestimated by people who don’t \nride the bikes.’ \nTraction control may make a rider’s life easier and safer but  it doesn’t \nnecessarily make him any faster around a racetrack. In fact, it may even \nmake him slower, as  Stoner says: ‘The engine cuts reduce the power.’ \nThat’s why most riders prefer minimum traction control, so  the \nelectronics cut  the  power just in time to  prevent a  highside. Edwards: \n‘I’ve tried Valentino’s traction control set-up and I didn’t like it, because \nI couldn’t get  the  bike to  spin to  finish the  turn, it kept running me \noff  the  track. You don’t spin the  800s like the  990s, but  you still need \nsome spin.’ \nSince traction control does allow riders to be braver with the  throttle \nthe  fastest guys must find another part of the  corner in which to  make \nthe  difference. Edwards again: ‘Now it’s  all about how you get into the \nturn, and that is only something a  racer can do.  The bike can’t get you \nin  the  corner any better, it can’t load the suspension for  you, so  that \naspect \nof \ngetting \ninto \nthe \ncorner \nreally \nis \n100 \nper \ncent \nrider, \nplus \na \nbit \nof \nbike \nset-up \nand \nengine-brake \nmanagement.’ \nSo \nthe \nemphasis \nhas \nchanged \nfrom \nhow \nhard \nand \nhow \nsoon \nyou \ncan \njump \non \nthe \nthrottle \nto \nhow \nfast \nyou \ncan \nget \ninto \na \nturn \nand \nhow \nfar \nyou \ncan \nlean \nover \nthrough \nthe  turn. \nBut \nnot \neveryone \nis  \nsure \nthat \nit’s \nhi-tech \nelectronics \nthat \nare \nresponsible \nfor  \nthe \ndramatic \nincrease \nin  \ncornering \nspeeds \nand \nthe \nloss \nof \ncorner-exit \ndramas. \nO’Kane \nsuspects \nit’s \nmuch \nmore \nbasic \nthan \nthat. \n‘It’s \nthe \n800s \nthat \nhave \nchanged \nthe \nemphasis \nto \ncorner \nentry,’ \nhe \nsays. \n‘The \n990s \nhad \nso \nmuch \nexcess \npower \nthat \nyou \ncould \ngive \nthem \nan \nideal \ntorque \ncurve. \nWith \nthe \n800s \nyou \ncan’t \nafford \na \nbig \nfat \ntorque \ncurve, \nyou’ve \ngot \nto \nuse \nthe \nengine’s \ncapacity \nfor \npeak \npower, \notherwise \nyou'll \nget \nhosed \non \ntop \nspeed.’ \nSo \nwith \nno \nbig \nwave \nof \ntorque \navailable \nto \nkick \nthem \nout \nof \nturns, \nriders \nnow \nuse \nsmoother \nlines \nfor \nhigher \ncorner \nspeeds \nto \nget \nout \nof \nturns \nat \nthe \nfastest \npossible \nrate, \njust \nlike \n250 \nriders. \n424 THE FAST STUFF \nAnd \nit  \nseems \nlike \nthere’s \nno  \nother \nway \nto  \nride \nthe \n800s. \nThe \n990s \ncould \nbe \nridden \nwheels \nin \nline, \nsideways, \nany \nwhich \nway, \nbut the \nknock-on \neffect \nof \nthe \n800s’ \nspecific \ndemands \nhas \nbeen \nto \nmorph \nriding \nstyles \ninto \none. \nWith \nthe \nglorious \nexception \nof \nSpanish \nnutter \nToni \nElias, \neveryone \nrides \nthe \n800s \npretty \nmuch \nthe \nsame \nbecause \nthey \nare \nall \nabout \nfinesse. \nKicking \nthem \nsideways \ndoesn’t \nwork, \nwhich \nis \nwhy \n990 \nchamp \nNicky \nHayden, \nveteran \nnutter \nLoris \nCapirossi \nand \nformer \n500 \nchamp \nKenny \nRoberts \nJunior \nhave \nstruggled \nwith \nthe \nsmaller \nengines. \n‘The \n800s \nhave \nboxed \nin \nthe \nriders \nas \nwell \nas the engine \ndesigners,’ \nO’Kane \nexplains. \n‘The \ndrop \nin \nengine \npower \nhas removed \nsome \nof the \nriders’ \noptions, \nso \nthey \nhave \nto \nride \nthe \nbikes \nmore \nhike \n250s.' \nAnd there’s a  knock-on effect to  that knock-on effect. If everyone \nrides the  same and uses the  same lines, how do  they overtake? With \ndifficulty. Most riders agree that passing is less easy with the  800s, and \nnot  only because it’s  difficult to  find an  alternative line to  get  a  way \npast. The 800s have shorter braking zones because they are slower \ndown the  straights and faster into the  turns, so  it’s  more difficult to \novertake on  the  brakes. . \nThis has  required MotoGP engineers to change their focus on  chassis \nsetup, proving that changing riding styles can  affect technology just as \nchanging technology affects riding styles. ‘Braking stability has become \nmore important,’ says O’Kane. ‘And turning has become much more \nimportant, so  the rider can  carry speed into the corner when he gets off \nthe  brakes without the  thing picking itself up  and running wide. For \nbike setup, the  800s are  a different set  of problems.’ \nThe end result of  the  samey riding styles and reduced overtaking \nopportunities is  less close racing. MotoGP used to  be  renowned for \nultra-close battles up  front, but the  800s are  spreading out  the  action. \nDuring the  last three 990 seasons the  average winning margin in  dry \nraces was just 2.07 seconds. During 2007 the gap from winner to second \nplace more than doubled to 4.54 seconds. \nThis isn’t simply because the  800s are  one-line motorcycles which \nmake overtaking so  difficult —  new tyre regulations have also played a \npart. Riders are  now limited to  the number of tyres they can  use  during \na  GP  which must be  chosen before practice starts. Inevitably, some \nriders choose more suitable batches of  tyres than others, so  the \ncompetition is  less equal than before (though some argue it’s  fairer \nCOMPUTER SAYS NO 425 \nbecause \nMichelin \ncan’t \nrush \nin  \nspecially \ntailored \ntyres \non  \nthe  \neve  \nof \nEuropean \nraces). \n‘Now \nit \njust \nseems \nlike \nso  \nmuch \nof \nyour \nrace \nis \ndecided \non  \nThursday \nafternoon, \nwhen \nyou \nchoose \nyour \ntyres,’ \nsays \nNicky \nHayden. \n‘If you \nchoose \nthe wrong \nbatch \nit’s \nhard \nto \ndig \nyourself \nout \nof \nthat \nhole. \nI think \nit’s \nhurt \nthe \nracing, \nwhereas \nbefore, \ncome \nSunday, \neveryone \nwas \npretty \nclose \nbecause \nduring \npractice \nyou'd \neventually \ntry \na \ntyre \nthat \nworked. \nI \nwas \nnever \na \nbig \nfan of \nthe \nnew \nrule, \nwhen \nthey \nwere \nkicking \naround \nthe \nidea \nI \nsaid \nI \ndon’t \nlike \nit, \njust \nbecause \neveryone \nwas \nreal \nclose \nas \nfar \nas \ntyres \nwent, \nso \nthe \nracing \nwas \nreal close.’ \nSo  there’s no  doubt that the  800s have changed MotoGP in  ways \nthat weren’t predicted, or  desired. And with teams already struggling \nwith sponsorship, MotoGP bosses Dorna should be  worried that the \nbikes are  less fun to  watch, because presumably fewer people will \nbother to  turn on  their TVs. But MotoGP’s technical rules are  looked \nafter by the factories, not Dorna, and the factories want more technology, \nnot  less, because that’s why they’re there in the  first place, to  develop \nnew technology. So  there’s zero chance of MotoGP diverting from its \ncurrent path. \nWhich might just give World Superbikes a chance to  get one over on \nits  glitzier rival. If WSB boss Paolo Flammini bans traction control by \nequipping bikes with a  ‘control’ ECU, he  might be  able to  offer a \nspectacle that MotoGP has  wilfully denied itself. Then the final decision \nwill come down to  you lot  sitting at  home in  front of the  TV:  do  you \nwant high-brow technology, like Fl  cars, or  lowbrow fun, like Nascar? \nYou decide... \nMotoGP Mutterings: January 2008 \nI’ve \nsmelt \nthe \nfuture \nof \nMotoGP, \nand \nboy, \nit \ndon’t \nhalf \npong \nSmell \nis  \nthe \nmost \nevocative \nof  \nall  \nthe \nsenses, \nwhich \nis  \nwhy \nI’m \nimmediately \ndragged \nback \nto \nmy \nschooldays \n— \nin \na \nwibbly-wobbly \nmovie \nmemory \nkind \nof \na \nway \n— \nupon \nentering \nthe \ncavernous \nRed \nBull \nRookies \nawning \nwithin \nthe \nMotoGP \npaddock. \nThe \natmosphere \nis \nthick \nwith \nthat \nbitter, \nnose-puckering \nstench \nI \nremember \npermeating \nthe \nlocker \nroom \nafter \neach \nmean \nand \ndownright \nvicious \ngame \nof \nrugby \nI \nplayed \nin \nmy \nteens. \nExcept \nthat \nin \nRed \nBull \nRookies’ \nworld \nthe \nreek \nof \n426 THE FAST STUFF \nteenage sweat and testosterone is  turbocharged with a  malodorous \nsoup of fetid leathers, smouldering rubber and acrid two-stroke smoke. \nExcuse me  while I go outside, I think I’m  going to puke... \nThe Rookies awning is populated by 23  of the  world’s fastest 13-  to \n16-year olds, chosen from a  nerve-jangling tearjerker of  a  global \nselection process that aims to  fast-track these youngsters —  via  a  series \nof races at  MotoGP events aboard identical KTM 125  race bikes —  to \nMotoGP fame and fortune. And perhaps that’s what really makes your \nnasal hairs stand on  end: it’s  the  heady stench of youthful ambition \nintermingled with the  odour of fear of failure. \nThere are  futures at  stake here, big futures for the riders (and for the \nparents) who only have to  let  their eyes wander a  few yards up  the \npaddock to  see  what ostentatious thrills might one day be  theirs: the \npalatial motorhomes of MotoGP’s gilded elite, gleaming Ferraris and \nPorsches and a coterie of silver-tongued managers and fixers, grinning \nhangers-on and girlfriends with ten-thousand dollar smiles and plastic \ntits. What wide-eyed pubescent wouldn’t risk it all for a  stab at  that? \nThe Red Bull recruits have already made it  this far,  from a  list  of \nmore than 1100 applicants from 60 countries, and from here on  in every \ngear change is  going to  be  the  most important gear change of  their \nlives. These kids’ minds are  set  on  their futures like most kids’ never \nare when they’re just 13 or  14.  I was getting severely beaten for smoking \nNumber Tens down fag alley and dreaming of riding an  RD400 when I \nwas their age, not  focusing on  becoming champion of the  whole wide \nworld. \nYou can see  it in  their faces, hear it in  their voices as  they describe \neach and every moment of  their latest race with a  glorious intensity \nthat only someone relatively new to  this life  can feel. It almost makes \nme  want to  be  an  adolescent again. Their eyes aren’t quite rolling \naround in  the  backs of their heads from all  the  adrenalin, but  it’s  not \nfar off.  Ironically, the last people on  this earth who would actually need \na can  of Red Bull are  these 22  boys and one  girl. They're already flying, \nthey don’t need wings. Not so  the  affable Red Bull marketing reps, \ndashing around making this dazzling enterprise -happen while \nenthusiastically quaffing can  after can  of their speedy brew and hoping \nthat somehow this show will add to  the  three billion cans they already \nsell  each year. \nThe \nRookies \nraces \nare  \nusually \nhugely \nentertaining, \nif \nonly \nfor \nthe \nwild \nTHE FUTURE DON’T HALF PONG 427 \ndisplays of  reckless teenage braggadocio and out-of-their minds \noptimism that characterise so  many of  the overtaking manoeuvres. \nAnd the  sense of fraternity among the  23  riders is refreshingly warm, \nnone of  the dead eyes and dead legs I remember from my  days in \nschoolboy sport. But  then I can’t help but feel  a nagging sense of moral \nunease about the  whole thing —  allowing a  bunch of schoolchildren to \ntear-arse around a  racetrack at  120mph, flogging energy drink and \nentertaining a  hundred thousand trackside fans and a  few hundred \nmillion TV viewers. \nIsn’t 13  a  bit  young to  be  sucked deep into the drive train of  the \ncorporate motorsport machine? Shouldn’t the  youngest of these stars \nof the future be back home swapping ringtones, bullying teacher, doing \nsome heavy petting, some studying, maybe even a  bit  of  schoolboy \nmotocross or  minimoto? Or maybe it’s  time to allow 13-year-olds to  do \nall the  other supposedly adult things we  currently don’t allow them to \ndo  —  like driving on  the  road, drinking in  pubs, working in  factories, \ngoing down the mines, owning guns, voting, smoking, joining the army \nand having sex. Just a  thought. \nINDEX \nFigures in italics refer to illustrations \nMotorcyles, teams \nand sponsors \nAprilia 90, 101, 137, \n165, 169, 172-174, \n197, 208-209, 212, \n235, 240, 249, 271, \n276,
