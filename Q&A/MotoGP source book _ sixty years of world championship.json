And, in addition, carefully chosen \nphotographs accompany each year. \nYear by year, the  MotoGP Source Book \nchronicles the  changing landscape of \nWorld Championship motorcycle racing \nin terms of the  machinery, the tracks and \nthe  politics. There was initial dominance \nby European manufacturers, especially \nItalian and British ones, but NSU of \nGermany briefly reigned with efficient, \nhigh-technology designs at a time when \nthe  German industry was the  largest in \nthe world. Then, of course, came the \nJapanese, spearheaded by Honda, and \ninto the  21st Century we  have seen the \nrevolution that is MotoGP. \nThen there are  the  riders. From \nthe  first 500cc Champion, Les  Graham, \nvia the  most successful racer ever, \nGiacomo Agostini, and the  legendary \nMike Hailwood, to Valentino Rossi, \nthis  book gives insights into the \nachievements of some of the  greatest \never motorsport heroes. \nCompiled by two co-authors \nrenowned for their knowledge and \nauthority, the  MotoGP Source Book is \nthe  ultimate reference book for \nmotorcycle racing fans. \n£30.00 \n\n\n\n© Julian Ryder & Martin Raines 2009 \nAll rights reserved.

Hopefully, you will be able \nto  recognise and follow trends in machinery \ndevelopment, riders’ careers, circuit safety, race \norganisation and other aspects as  well as  spotting \nthe  major landmarks such as  the  change from 500cc \nto  MotoGP. \nWe  have also attempted to  provide the most \naccurate record possible of the  first 60 years of \nmotorcycle Grand Prix racing within, of course, \ncertain constraints. Chief among them is space. Four \npages per  year was the  only sensible choice in a \nbook of this size, so  then we  had to  decide what to \nput on  those four pages. We  decided on  two short \nelements of text, the  first of which appears on  the \nopening spread for  each year and lists  the  major \nplayers on  factory bikes plus any important changes \nin regulations. The second story, printed on  the \nsecond spread, explores the  most significant event \nof the  year in deeper detail. The remainder of the \nfirst spread is taken up with bullet points for each \nclass: incidents that shaped the  season, statistics, \nlandmark events in the  careers of individual riders \nor  the  history of a  racing marque. On  the  second \nspread you will  find a full  championship table for \nthe  500cc/MotoGP class plus the  top ten  in all  other \nsolo classes. \nIn  presenting this information, we  had to  make \nsome decisions on  what we  could and couldn't do. \nHere are  the  ones you need to  know about: \nGRAND PRIX \nA Grand Prix is a  race that has  been part of the \nFIM  Grand Prix  World Championship. We  have not \nincluded the  sidecar class or  F750, or  any  other class \nwhether or  not  it had World Championship status. \nNAMES \nWe  have used the  form of address the rider \npreferred. Hence Les, not  Leslie, Graham; Tepi, \nnot Teuvo, Lansivuori; and Max, not Massimiliano, \nBiaggi. \nNATIONALITIES \nWe  have tried to  give a  rider’s nationality rather \nthan the  country in which he took out  his  racing \nlicence. Hence some riders born in  Northern Ireland \nhave been listed as  British, though they may have \nbeen described as  Irish by other sources. In cases \nwhere a  rider was born in one country and brought \nup  in another, such as  Gary Hocking or  Jim \nRedman, we  have used the  nationality the  rider \nofficially adopted. Three-letter abbreviations \nfor  countries and nationalities follow the  ISO's \nrecommendations. \nBIKE NAMES \nWe  have endeavoured to  give the  make of bike \nused. This is not  always a  simple matter, especially \nin the  50/80cc class where many machines were \neffectively home-made, or  in the  heyday of 250 \nand 350 TZ  Yamahas where a  variety of proprietary \nframes were used, often with heavily modified \nengines. The only names we  have specifically \nexcluded are  those adopted direct from a  sponsor. \nOPPOSITE On  their way \nto  the  first ever Grand \nPrix. Les  Graham, the first \n500cc World Champion, \nand his  team-mate Bill \nDoran push the  works AJS \nup  the  gang plank of the \nIsle of  Man ferry. (Doran \nFamily Collection) \nLEFT Triple World \nChampion Werner Haas, \nGermany’s first Champion \nand the lead rider in  NSU’s \ndomination of the  early \n1950s 250 and 125 classes. \n(Stuart Dent Archive) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 7 \n\nWe  have used the  title of the  Grand Prix, except \nin the  case of the  Grand Prix of Nations, as  the \nGP  held in  Italy was called from 1949 to  ‘90.  This \nwas effectively the  Italian GP,  so  we  have tagged \nit as  ITA  in table headings as  there was no  other \nGP  held on  Italian soil. We  are  well aware that \nthe  British race was until 1976 the  Isle  of Man TT \nand the  Dutch GP  still  is, officially, the  Dutch TT. \nHowever, for  simplicity we  call  them all  GPs. \nThe situation is more complicated where more \nthan one GP  was held in one country during \none season. Where these were scheduled races, \nthey were usually first given the  names of other \ncountries (such as  San Marino) then of regions (the \nPacific GP for the  second race held in Japan) or \ncities (Catalunya and Valencia for  races in Spain). \nOne-off events, usually to  replace races cancelled \nat  short notice, usually received odd names like \nVitesse du  Mans or  the  FIM GP. \nWhere we  say  that a  rider was the  ‘youngest \never’ or  ‘oldest ever’ we  mean that was the  case \nat the end of the relevant season. For  instance, in \n1989 when we  say  Alex Criville was the  youngest \n8  MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \never World Champion we  mean as  of the  end of \nthat season. Obviously, as  you get towards more \nrecent years that record is more likely to  stand, for \ninstance Scott Redding’s record as  the  youngest \never GP  winner set  at  Donington Park in  2008. \nThere have been several systems over the past 60 \nyears, and the  one in force for  each year is noted \non  the  championship tables. \nWhere riders finished on  equal points, there \nhave been two systems of tiebreaker. Until 1964, \nwhen not  all  results were counted, the  system \ntook into account the  best discarded result. \nFrom 1965 onwards, there has  been a different \nsystem that compares riders’ best scoring results \nor  number of wins, or  second places, and so  on. \nThis obtained whether a  net  or  gross scoring \nsystem was in force; in other words after 1964 \ndiscarded results were not  used to  split riders \ntied on  points. \nMany people have helped in trying to  make this \nbook as  accurate as  possible. In  particular, the \nauthors would like  to  thank the  following: \nABOVE Jarno Saarinen \nabout to  start his  first race \nas  World Champion —  the \nFrench 250cc GP  of  1973 \nat  Paul Ricard.

Nello \nPagani, the  most experienced and reliable of the \nteam’s riders, was kept on  the  single-cylinder \nSaturno until Assen thanks to  his  prickly relationship \nwith designer Piero Remor. \nThere was a second Italian 500, Moto Guzzi’s \n120-degree V-twin but, despite being raced by \nEnrico Lorenzetti, the  factory's longest-serving \nrider, the  bike was outclassed. BMW, who had been \nvery competitive before the  Second World War — \nsupercharged Boxer BMWs finished first and second \nin the  1939 TT -  were banned from taking part, \nalong with the  other German factories like  DKW. \nAJS  fielded British riders Les  Graham, Ted Frend \nand Jock West, all  stars of pre-war racing, alongside \nBill  Doran who had impressed with second place \nat the  ‘48 TT  on  a  private Norton. Ireland’s Reg \n10 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nArmstrong also rode in the  350s. Norton fielded a \nvariable number of works bikes —  seven in Ulster! \n—  but their contracted British riders were Artie Bell \nand Johnny Lockett in the  500s and Harold Daniell \nin the  350s. Velocette had DOHC versions of their \npre-war singles in both big classes, but  only the  350 \nwas competitive. \nThe 250 class was dominated by Moto Guzzi and \ntheir Gamablunghino (‘Little Long Legs’) flat  single. \nAs well as  Italian works rider Bruno Ruffo, stars like \nIrishman Manliff Barrington (a protégé of the  great \n1930s star Stanley Woods) and the  veteran Scottish \nracer/journalist Fergus Anderson rode Guzzis. Only \nthe  Benellis of Italians Dario Ambrosini and Umberto \nMasetti offered a  challenge to their rival marque. \nIn the 125s three Italian factories -  MV  Agusta, \nMondial and Morini —  fought it out. Only Mondial \nused a four-stroke, a  beautiful DOHC single; the \nother two were two-strokes (yes, an  MV  stroker) but \nby the  following season both Morini and MV  had \nsimilar designs on  track. \nABOVE Les  Graham and \nthe  twin-cylinder AJS E90 \nPorcupine on  the  way \nto  winning the Dutch \nTT  at  Assen.

All  the  motorcycles and  their riders would have \nbeen at  home on  a  pre-1939 grid. In the  1930s, forced \ninduction was the  way to go,  so  AJS’s E90  twin and \nGilera’s four were both designed with supercharging in \nmind, but  that was banned after the  war. \nA look at the  grid shows that telescopic forks and \nhydraulic rear  suspension were far from the  norm on  a \n500, let alone a  125, and  that streamlining was a thing of \nthe  future. In fact, the  British factories were vehemently \nagainst any  type of fairing on  the  grounds that fairings \nhad  no  relevance to  road-going motorcycles. Weight \nwas carried far  back —  ‘for traction’ —  and  handlebars \nwere flat;  to  modern eyes the  first  World Championship- \nwinning motorcycles look like  antiques. But  things \nchanged very quickly. \nThe  racetracks, however, did  not  change. There \nwere only six venues for the  first  championship, all of \nthem in Europe: the  Isle  of Man, Berne, Assen, Spa- \nFrancorchamps, Clady and Monza. Only Monza was a \npurpose-built circuit; closed roads and their attendant \ndangers would be the  norm for two decades and more. \nA second factor foreign to the  modern spectator was \nthat not  every event ran  every class, with only the  500s \nappearing at every round in  1949. The 350 championship \nconsisted of five  rounds, the  250  four and  the  125  only \nthree events. Championship rounds would multiply, but \nit would be well into  the  1980s before it was normal to \nsee  every class at  every venue. Indeed, it was common for \neven factory teams to  miss races that  were too  expensive, \nor  too  dangerous, until the  demise of the  Isle  of Man TT \nas  a  Grand Prix  World Championship round in  1976. \nHowever, the  importance of the  TT to  the  whole \nindustry, not  just the  British factories, cannot be \noverstated. It was regarded, both before and  after the \nSecond World War, as  the  ultimate test. The Italian GP, \nor  the  Gran Premio delle Nazioni, as  it was called, ran  It \na very close second, especially, of course, for the  Italian \nfactories. \nThe  third oddity to  modern eyes was  the fact that \nracers not  only rode in more than one  class but also for \nmore than one  factory. It was common for  riders to  have \na factory contract for the  500s, say with Gilera, yet ride  a \nMondial in the  125s. That was  exactly what Nello Pagani \ndid  for this  first  season, finishing runner-up in the  big class \nand  World Champion in the  little one. \nOPPOSITE The first 250cc \nWorld Champion Bruno \nRuffo (ITA) ready for  the \nstart of the  Italian GP \nat  Monza with his  Moto \nGuzzi single.

Geoff \nDuke joined Artie Bell  and Johnny Lockett and the  old \n‘garden gate’ chassis was replaced by the  revolutionary \nnew twin-loop frame dubbed the  ‘Featherbed’ by the \nveteran Harold Daniell, who retired at the  end  of the \nyear. The combination was immediately a sensation: \nTT race and lap records were smashed and Norton \nmonopolised the  rostrum in the  500  and 350cc races. \nHowever, Gilera did  not  send their team to the Isle \nof Man, well aware of both the difficulty of beating the \nBritish racers who'd grown up on  the  Mountain circuit \nand the  expense of attending the  event. They hit back \nat the second round, Spa, with a  relatively unknown \nnew man, Umberto Masetti, replacing Arciso Artesiani. \nNello Pagani and Carlo Bandirola were retained with \nthe team under the  management of the great polymath \nPiero Taruffi following Piero Remor’s acrimonious \ndeparture to  MV where Count Domenico Agusta \nwas anxious to enter the  500cc class. Not  surprisingly, \nRemor built him  an  across-the-frame four not  unlike \n14 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nthe  Gilera. However, the  rest  of the  machine was far \nfrom orthodox. The gearbox was aligned down the  axis \nof the bike, the final drive was by shaft and the rear \nsuspension by friction damper. Artesiani was  the  rider. \nAJS  lost  Bill  Doran for the  season when he  broke \nhis  leg in practice for the TT,  so  Les  Graham was \nbacked up  by Ted Frend. In the  350cc class, 1949 \nWorld Champion Freddie Frith had retired so  Bob \nFoster was joined at Velocette by Reg Armstrong (IRL) \nand Bill  Lomas, with Foster retaining the  title for the \nfactory. The other contenders were Norton and AJS, \nwith their 500cc class riders doubling up. \nThe two smallest classes were almost exclusively \nItalian affairs. Benelli and Moto Guzzi contested the \n250s with DOHC and SOHC singles, respectively. The \nBenelli was much more sophisticated, the  Guzzi had \nreliability on  its side, but the  factory withdrew before \nthe  end of the  year to  develop a  DOHC four-valve \nmotor. Mondial dominated the 125  class with their \nDOHC single, Morini providing some opposition with \ntheir chain-driven SOHC single. \nABOVE Flat, fast and with \nan  audience well in  excess \nof  100,000; it could only \nbe  Assen.

In fact, the  design can  be traced back to \ntwo newly graduated engineering students, Carlo Gianni \nand Piero Remor, who built a number of across-the- \nframe four motors in the  1920s under the  patronage of \nvarious noblemen. As far as  is known, these were the  first \nacross-the-frame fours ever built. According to  Raymond \nAinscoe’s history Gilera Road Racers (Osprey, 1987) they \nwere getting the  bike to  rev  to  7000rpm in  1928 but \nwithout the  reliability to win  races despite having the \ngreat Piero Taruffi riding. (Taruffi was an  engineer, Italian \n500cc champion, international tennis player, summer and \nwinter Olympian, Mille Miglia and  Targa Floria winner, \nfactory Ferrari and  Mercedes driver, and  holder of 50 \nspeed records on  two, three and  four wheels.) \nIn  1934, with Taruffi now a co-designer as  well as \nteam-manager, the  bike was reborn under the  banner of \nthe  CNA aeroplane company as  the  Rondine (‘swallow’ in \nItalian). The  52x58mm water-cooled motor had  a semi- \nautomatic gearbox and  a Taruffi-designed supercharger, \nand  the  cylinders were inclined forward at a very \nmodern-looking 45  degrees. CNA was sold to  another \nplane-maker, Caproni, which quickly sold the  racers on  to \nGilera. Taruffi tested the  first  Gilera at  137mph/220km/h \n—  unfaired —  and  reckoned it made 7Ohp at 8800rpm. \nThis  was  the  bike that Dorino Serafini took to the  1939 \nEuropean Championship. There was  just time for Taruffi to \nset  an  absolute speed record of 170.37mph/274.18km/h \nand  a one-hour record of 127  miles/204km before the \nItalian aerospace industry had  things other than racing on \nits mind. \nAfter the  Second World War, Remor redesigned the  old \nmotor to take account of the  new World Championship \nregulations: no  forced induction was allowed so  the \nengine could be air cooled. However advanced the \nmotor, pre-war orthodoxy on  chassis design still  ruled. \nWeight distribution was  distinctly rearwards biased, and \nsuspension was by girder forks and  friction dampers. \nThere was  no  doubt that the  Italian fours made enormous \namounts of power, but  not  everyone was convinced that \nmultis were the way forward. What was the  use  of all that \npower if it couldn't be used? This  argument would recur at \nregular intervals over the  next 60 years. \nOPPOSITE The first four: the \nGilera was the  original high- \nrevving, multi-cylinder racer, but \ncheck that suspension: girders at \nthe  front, friction dampers at  the \nrear. This is Massimo Masserini \non  the  very first post-war design. \n(Elwyn Roberts Collection) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 17 \n\nilera were cottoning on  to what made the \n|  handling of the  Nortons so  good. Two of their \nthree riders, Umberto Masetti and Nello Pagani, \nstarted the  year with their fours equipped with \ntelescopic forks and swinging arms. After the  TT, \nwhich Gilera again did  not  attend, Alfredo Milani \n(who had started the year on  a Saturno single) also \ngotafour. - \nMV  Agusta fitted their bikes with modern \nsuspension systems too, but  kept the  shaft drive, \nand lured Les  Graham to  sign for them. The first \nWorld Champion was instrumental in taming the \nfour-cylinder MV, which was considered a  big, heavy \nand brutal beast even by the  standards of the  early \n1950s, although his  results during the  season failed \nto  show it. His  Italian team-mates Carlo Bandirola \nand Arciso Artesiani fared better in the  points table. \nNorton again fielded Geoff Duke, now recognised \nas  the  best rider in the world despite having not  yet \nwon a title, and they also signed Dickie Dale. Illness \nprevented Dale riding so  Duke was backed up  by \n18 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nfellow-Britons Jack Brett and Johnny Lockett, with \nKen Kavanagh (AUS) joining later in the  season. Bill \nDoran, fit again after his  1950 Isle  of Man crash, was \nback for AJS  with Irish rider Reg Armstrong as  his \nteam-mate. \nThe contracted 500  riders also rode 350s for their \nfactories, except Graham who was only signed to  MV \nfor the  500  class. He  rode a Velocette in the  350s. \nMoto Guzzi completely dominated the  250cc \nclass after Benelli pulled out  following the  death of \ntheir champion Dario Ambrosini.

Young Dave Bennett was added to the team \nas  an  investment for the  future. Jack Brett went \nfrom Norton to AJS  to join Bill  Doran and New \nZealander Rod Coleman. Injury and worse, however, \nwould seriously affect the  Norton team. Bennett \nwas killed at the  first race of the  year, his  bikes later \nbeing given to  Ray Amm, the  Rhodesian who had \nimpressed on  a  private Norton in the  first race of \nthe year. Duke crashed in  a non-championship race, \nbroke an  ankle and missed the  second half of the \nseason, while Amm was hurt in practice for the \nGerman GP and replaced for two races by Briton \nswinging arm and shaft drive to  be  replaced \nby conventional cnain-drive transmission.

BMW, who had  been pre-war winners with \ntheir supercharged flat twin, did  not  re-enter the \nfray immediately, but  DKW and  NSU took part. Like \nthe  rest, these factories had  been working on  forced \ninduction when hostilities commenced so  had  had  to \ncome up with brand-new designs to suit  GPs  where \nsupercharging was specifically banned. \nIn the  1930s DKW had  raced a strange two-stroke \ntwin with an  extra smaller cylinder acting as  a pump to \npressurise the  intake side, and  they now kept their faith \nwith the  two-stroke, fielding a 250  twin and  then a \n350  triple. They maintained the  tradition of the  pre-war \nbike by producing machines that were incredibly loud, \nvery thirsty, wayward both in corners and  on  straights, \nand  extremely fast. \nNSU used their 1939 supercharged DOHC twin as \nthe  starting point for a generation of racers, producing \na  new motor with unit  gearbox, wet-sump lubrication \nand  giant camboxes. It looked, and  was, the  most \nmodern and  efficient engine in the  world and  for years \nwas the  only naturally aspirated motor with a specific \npower output of over 125hp per  litre. The 125cc \nRennfox single and  Rennmax twin both had  pressed \nsteel forks, and  spine frames like  the  company’s SOHC \nroad bikes that  they were designed to  promote, \nto which end  the  company ran  the  largest racing \ndepartment in the  world. \nThe  NSU factory's efforts were enhanced by the \ndiscovery of a very talented young racer called Werner \nHaas. He  won first  time out  on  the  Rennfox with a \nteam-mate fifth, and  at  Monza chased new 250cc \nWorld Champion Enrico Lorenzetti (Moto Guzzi) home \non  the  Rennmax. There were other German makers \nwho looked as  if they could be competitive, notably \nHorex and  Adler, but  NSU’s attack on  GP  racing was \na thoroughly modern, high-technology effort by a \nlarge company intent on  promoting its products. NSU’s \nbikes and  methods of working were much admired by \none  Soichiro Honda when he saw the  factory team in \noperation on  his first visit  to  Europe. \nOPPOSITE Fergus \nAnderson (Moto Guzzi) \nand Werner Haas (NSU) \ncheck out each other's \nbikes before the 250cc GP \nat  Monza. (Stuart Dent \nArchive) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 25 \n\nhe tide turned finally and decisively against \nthe  British single-cylinder 500. Geoff Duke \njoined the  Gilera team and accelerated the  process \nof ‘Nortonising’ the  four to the  formula so  brilliantly \ndeduced by Rex McCandless. The Gilera was lower, \nwith shorter, stronger forks and rear suspension \nunits, and clip-ons replaced the  old  handlebars. Reg \nArmstrong and Dickie Dale also joined the  Italian \nsquad, while reigning champion Umberto Masetti \n(who walked out  after Assen) and fellow-ltalians \nAlfredo Milani and Giuseppe Colnago were retained. \nMV Agusta, and indeed the whole paddock, were \nbadly shaken by the  death of their lead rider Les \nGraham at the  TT.  The 1949 World Champion had \ndeveloped the  MV  to the  point where it could beat \nthe  Gileras, but  in the  aftermath of Graham's death \nCarlo Bandirola could not  continue the  progress. \nNorton only won at the  TT  and in Ulster, with \nRhodesia’s Ray Amm as  their lead rider backed up  by \nBriton Jack Brett and Ken Kavanagh. \nAnother Italian factory also upped their game. \n26 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nMoto Guzzi moved away from their traditional \npower base in the  250  class, with Fergus Anderson \nand Enrico Lorenzetti now also riding in the  350cc \nclass with what was essentially a bored and stroked \nversion of their 250. (MV were also experimenting \nwith a  350, a sleeved version of the  500.) The new \nGuzzi proceeded to  blow the  British singles, which \nhad dominated the  350cc class, out  of the  water. \nAnd Moto Guzzi didn’t stop there. They entered the \n500cc class with an  entirely new design, an  in-line \nfour with shaft drive and mechanical fuel injection. \nBMW had more sophisticated fuel injection on \ntheir new DOHC boxer twin raced by Walter Zeller. \nThe BMW factory also led  the  way in aerodynamics, \nfielding a fully enclosed bike at  Monza. NSU, well \non  their way to  becoming for a short but  glorious \nperiod the  biggest motorcycle manufacturer in the \nworld, arrived in the 125  and 250 classes in full  force. \nThe 125  revved to  at  least 1000rpm more than the \nMVs, the 250 twin to  over 2000rpm more than the \nGuzzi singles which were its main rivals. \nABOVE The Gilera team \nriders —  Duke, Colnago, \nMilani and Masetti — \nwith their mechanics \nand, between Duke and \nColnago, team manager \nPiero Taruffi.

When it was  finally \nadmitted there was no  possibility of the  rumours \nbecoming hardware, Duke decided to concentrate on \nhis burgeoning car  racing career with Aston Martin. \nThat didn’t go  quite to  plan either, so  he accepted \nan  offer from Gilera. This  was a  brave decision by \nboth parties. The British press regarded the  move as \nsomething akin to treason, while the  Italian media \nwasn’t keen on  the  idea of importing foreign riders. \nHow brave, then, was Piero Taruffi to  employ three of \nthem in  1953? He was rewarded with a clean sweep \nof the  top-three places in the  championship, with Duke \nand  Armstrong finishing first  and  second ahead of \nItalian Alfredo Milani. \nDuke was widely regarded as  the  best rider in the \nworld, and  not  just in the  UK.  Not  only was he a superb \nracer, he was also  technically very astute, and  became \nthe  first  example of a  new breed, a  rider on  whom \na factory could focus their efforts to  improve their \nmachine. Duke did  for Gilera what Les  Graham had \nbeen in  the  process of doing with the  four-cylinder MV. \nJohn Surtees would eventually do the  same job, just as \nGiacomo Agostini would with the  MV  Agusta triple and \nmen like Wayne Rainey and  Mick Doohan would do \nfor Yamaha and Honda respectively. Geoff's attention \nto  detail was legendary, and  not  merely on  the  bike. In \n1950 he  realised the  baggy riding kit of the  time was \naerodynamically inefficient and  asked his tailor to  make \nhim a  one-piece sult. \nGeoff Duke was also  the  first nationally famous \nmotorcycle racer in the  UK. He was awarded an  OBE \nin  1953, and  won one  of the  first  ‘Sportsman of \nthe  Year’ polls. Duke was, in short, the  first modern \nmotorcycle racer. \nOPPOSITE BMW came to  GPs a \nyear after NSU and DKW, but, like \nthe other German factories, they \nbrought some advanced thinking. \nThis streamliner, ridden by Walter \nZeller, appeared at the  final GP  of \nthe  year at  Monza and led  to  the \nuniversal adoption of ‘dustbin’ \nfairings on  faster circuits. Note the \nabsence of carburettors as  BMW \nused fuel injection; the  company \nhad also used telescopic forks on \ntheir pre-war racers. The German \nmotorcycle industry was booming \nand, for  a  few short but spectacular \nyears, would be the  biggest and \nmost innovative in the  world. \n(Stuart Dent Archive) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 29 \n\nilera significantly upgraded their engine for \nthe  men who had finished first, second and \nthird in the  previous year’s championship —  Geoff \nDuke, Reg Armstrong and Alfredo Milani —  plus \nUmberto Masetti and Frenchman Pierre Monneret. \nNello Pagani and Dickie Dale had been poached \nby MV  Agusta, who retained the  ever-combative \nCarlo Bandirola. \nMoto Guzzi gave Ken Kavanagh a full-time \ncontract after his try-out at the  end of 1953, and he \nand Fergus Anderson rode the  500-four for just a \ncouple of races; after that the  single, much preferred \nby all the  riders, was brought back out. The 350cc \nversion of Guzzi’s single was ridden by the  two 500 \npilots plus veteran Enrico Lorenzetti, with fellow- \nItalian Duilio Agostini as  reserve. \nNorton also had a  new works Manx for  Ray \nAmm and Jack Brett in both 500  and 350  classes. \nAJS  again fielded Rod Coleman with new team-mate \nBob Mcintyre (GBR). They persevered for  one last \nyear with the  Porcupine in the  500s but  had a \n30 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nmuch happier time in the  350s. \nOnce again, NSU dominated the  smaller classes. \nWerner Haas and Rupert Hollaus (AUT) became 250 \nand 125cc champions, respectively —  and up  until \nMonza, the  penultimate event of the  season, not \nonly did they win every race, but  every 250cc rostrum \nposition bar  one was also filled by an  NSU rider. It is \ndifficult to think of any  manufacturer dominating \nnot  one but two classes so  comprehensively. \nThis was the  year that Mr  Soichiro Honda visited \nEurope for the  first time, and was so  impressed by \nthe  NSU teams. Unhappily, their run  was bought to \nan  end by the  death of Hollaus in practice for \nMonza, after which the  team withdrew from the \nchampionship. Only the  great Carlo Ubbiali (MV \nAgusta) could give the  NSUs a  race in the  125cc class, \nalthough he and Mondial’s Tarquinio Provini were \nonly winners once NSU had gone home. \nAt the  end of the  season both NSU and Norton \nwould withdraw their works teams from GPs, but \nthey did  continue to sell  customer bikes. \nABOVE Geoff Duke \nprepares to  start the Isle \nof  Man TT.  He  finished \nsecond after the race was \nred-flagged early: Duke \nhad stopped for  fuel, but \nRay Amm (Norton) hadn't \nand won by a  minute. \n(Stuart Dent Archive) \nRIGHT Rupert Hollaus, \nmotorcycle racing's \nonly posthumous world \nchampion, on  the fully \nfaired 250 NSU.

They'd pioneered small nose-cone fairings, \noften integrated with the  long, thin  tanks of the  day,  and \nthen in  1952 they extended the  bodywork down around the \nengine to  produce a look not  unlike today’s ‘dolphin’ fairing. \nGuzzi, though, had  a  beak-like front mudguard projecting \nfrom under the  front number plate as  opposed to  attached to \nthe front forks. \nNSU followed a similar path, using the  wind tunnel at \nStuttgart Technical Institute, only their fairing for the  1954 \n125  bike covered the  handlebars and  the  whole engine. The \n250  sported a giant, flat-sided wedge. It was the  NSU team \nwho first used the  term ‘dolphin’ after someone decided \nthe  Rennfox fairing’s beak resembled the  nose of the  marine \nmammal. \nMoto Guzzi, aware that their highly evolved single-cylinder \ndesigns needed all the  help they could get against the  multis, \npioneered full  streamlining: the  so-called ‘dustbin’ fairing that \nfully enclosed the  front wheel. It was tried on  the  straight-four \nmachine at the  end  of  1953; not  everyone was convinced it \nWas a  good idea. \nMV  Agusta, conscious that their 500  still  had  a reputation \nas  a difficult-to-handle brute, tried a variety of designs. There \nwas a  strange fairing that looked like a  dustbin with the \nbit covering the  front wheel taken off,  something else  that \nlooked very like  a dolphin design, and  they also raced with \nno  fairing at all.  However, like every other manufacturer, MV \nhad  no  hesitation in adopting full  streamlining for the  smaller \ncapacity classes. Norton had  the  strange ‘proboscis’ fairing \nwith an  elongated nose; only AJS, who had  never used any \nstreamlining, did  not  experiment. \nGilera also  tried a dolphin design that  was really their \nintegrated nose-cone/tank design with panels added to cover \neither side  of the  engine, but  at  Monza they had a full  dustbin \nand  Geoff Duke promptly set  new race record and  lap speeds \nwith it. From the  following season onwards full  streamlining \nwas used by nearly every factory on  most courses, and \nespecially at the  fast  tracks like  Monza and  Assen. \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 33 \n\n» \n\" \nNAN \nNAN \nhis was meant to  be the  year that Geoff \nDuke had a  real challenger. When Norton \nannounced they would not  be contesting the  GPs, \nRay Amm, who had been Norton’s lead rider since \nDuke left, signed for  MV  Agusta, only to  be  killed in \nhis first race, an  international at  Imola. Thus the  old \nGilera team of Nello Pagani, Umberto Masetti and \nCarlo Bandirola found themselves reunited at  MV. \nThey were up  against what was now the  established \nGilera line-up of Duke and Reg Armstrong backed \nup  by Pierre Monneret, Libero Liberati and Giuseppe \nColnago. Gilera won every race they contested, \nexcept the  one that mattered most —  Monza. \nMoto Guzzi were still there, with Fergus Anderson \nnow team-manager. Ken Kavanagh was joined by \nDickie Dale, Diulio Agostini and, after the  TT,  Briton \nBill  Lomas. The 500  was not  competitive, although \nLomas did  win  on  it in Ulster, but the  350  was \nliterally unbeatable —  it won every GP. \nThe Norton factory, unhappy with the trend \ntowards streamlining and away from pure road \n34 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nGilera and Duke win again, Guzzi \ncontinue to dominate the 350s, but a \ncustomer bike wins the 250 title \ncircuits, only entered the  TT with a factory team: \nJack Brett backed up  by two British youngsters, John \nSurtees and John Hartle. The bikes were no  longer \nfull  works prototypes but  development versions of \ncustomer machines. BMW looked like  they might \nfill the  gap. They entered Walter Zeller (GER) and \nJohn Surtees at the  Nurburgring but  dithered about \nmaking the  commitment to field a  factory team. \nNSU may also have withdrawn their works \nmachines but they sold a tuned version of their \n250cc single-cylinder road bike, called the  Sportmax. \nIt was good enough to win the  championship and \nbe competitive for several years to  come. NSU’s \ncompetition in the  250  class came from the  previous \nyear’s factory Guzzi, in the  hands of Cecil Sandford, \nand from MV  with a  bored-out version of their \nDOHC 125cc single. At the  class minimum of 203cc it \nwas nevertheless fast enough for  Bill  Lomas to win \nthe  TT.  It would also give the  other Italian factories, \nMondial and Morini, a clue as  to  how they too  could \nbe competitive in the  250  class. \nABOVE You could buy \nan  NSU Sportmax over \nthe counter, Hermann- \nPaul Muller did  and \nwon the  250cc World \nChampionship.

Race organisers \nhabitually exploited riders, paying derisory start and \nprize money. As the  Dutch TT,  then as  now, attracted \nenormous crowds the  privateers decided this  was the \ntime for action. After the  demands of the  riders were \nrejected they told the  organisers they would pull out \nof the  350 race. Sure enough, a dozen riders pulled in \nafter doing one lap at  a  processional pace. \nFurther panicky negotiations now took place, with \nGeoff Duke and  the  rest  of the  Gilera team threatening \nto  back up the  privateers, thus putting the  500cc \nrace in jeopardy. That extracted some cash from the \nnotoriously tight-fisted promoters and  the  500 event \nwent ahead. \nSportsmen do  not  usually make good trades \nunionists, but  Duke and  Reg Armstrong acted in \nsolidarity because of events which had  taken place at \nthe  Italian GP  two years earlier, when the  promoters \nhad  arbitrarily decided not  to  pay  start money to  British \nriders racing for  Italian teams. On  that occasion Fergus \nAnderson, a  Scot riding for  Moto Guzzi, delivered \na  letter of protest signed by every competitor and \nthe  organisers relented. For  Duke and  Armstrong, \nsupporting the  privateers’ aims at Assen was repaying \nthat debt, although they did  not  approve the  threat of \nstrike action. \nThere was, of course, retribution. In  November the \nFIM's sporting committee suspended Duke, Armstrong \nand  twelve others from all competition for six  months, \nand  three Italian riders for four months. No  doubt the \nseverer punishment for  Duke and  Armstrong was pour \nencourager les autres. \nThe  FIM  eventually relented after Duke made a \npublic apology —  much against his better judgement — \nbut  only allowed him  to  race in domestic competition. \nThe  Grand Prix  ban  stood and  would ensure that he \nand  the  rest  of the  factory Gilera team missed the  first \ntwo races of the  1956 season, the  Isle  of Man TT \nand  Assen. \nLEFT Geoff Duke’s actions \nat  Assen would have \nsevere repercussions for \nhis  1956 season. Here he \nstands on  the German \nGP  rostrum of  1954 with \nAssen co-conspirator and \nfellow Gilera man Reg \nArmstrong (right) and \nNorton’s Ray Amm. (Stuart \nDent Archive) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 37 \n\nith  Geoff Duke and the  rest  of the  Gilera \nW team suspended for  six months in the \naftermath of the previous season's Assen strike, MV \nAgusta’s John Surtees was able to  rack up  victories \nat the  Isle  of Man TT and the  Dutch TT.  Umberto \nMasetti was the  other MV  rider. \nBMW finally decided to  contest a whole season \nwith Walter Zeller on  the  fuel-injected short-stroke \nRennsport flat-twin. The combination didn’t win \na  race but  Zeller did  get on  the  rostrum —  and not \njust when the  Gilera team was absent. Moto Guzzi \ncontested all  classes except the 125  with Aussie Ken \nKavanagh, Brits Bill  Lomas and Dickie Dale, and \nItaly’s Duilio Agostini. However, the  500cc single \nwas now uncompetitive and the  factory raced the \nstill  quite astounding water-cooled V8.  The Guzzi \n350  was still  good enough to  see  off the  new four- \ncylinder designs from MV  and Gilera comfortably, \nalthough the  screaming three-cylinder two-stroke \nDKWs of August Hobl (GER) and Cecil Sandford were \nmore of a  problem. \n38 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nJohn Surtees gave MV their first 500cc title as \nthe  Italian factory won three championships; \nonly Moto Guzzi held out  in the  350s \nMV's new 250  —  a full  249cc as  opposed to the \nold  enlarged 125, which would only stretch to  220cc \n—  was too  good for  even Enrico Lorenzetti and the \nMoto Guzzi. Carlo Ubbiali dominated both the  250 \nand 125  championships, winning 10 of the 12  races. \nAdd in the  very competitive and important Italian \nChampionship and he won 18  races out  of 20  in the \nseason! The 250  GP that Ubbiali missed out  on  was \nwon by Luigi Taveri on  another MV, but the  125 \nrace they failed to win was a victory for the  fast but \nfragile newcomer, Gilera’s twin, the  Gilerino. The \nrider was Romolo Ferri (ITA), poached from Mondial, \nwhose effort was again fronted by the  indefatigable \nTarquinio Provini. \nThis was the  year that MV  Agusta finally achieved \ntheir first 500cc title, plus three constructors’ titles \nto  go with their three riders’ championships. The \nhighlight was their clean sweep of all four races at \nthe  Belgian GP  at  Spa-Francorchamps, the  500 and \n350cc wins being taken by Surtees, the  two smaller \nclasses by Ubbiali. \nABOVE The 125s blast off  at \nMonza.

He \nunderstood that  the  only way for the  single to  compete \nwith multi-cylinder designs was with low  weight, efficient \naerodynamics and  increased revs. Over the  years, the \nhorizontal single was painstakingly refined with both \nSOHC and  DOHC heads. The  final 350  of 1957 weighed \njust 215lb/98kg thanks to  much use  of aluminium and \nmagnesium; it revved to  8400rpm and made 38hp. \nAlthough Carcano had  faith in the  single-cylinder \nlayout as  the  way forward in the  350  class, he was \nwell aware the  500  couldn't compete with the  Gileras \nand MVs. The in-line four of  1953 that was disliked by \neveryone who rode it was not  a Carcano design, and  the \nteam quickly reverted to  the  lightweight single. Carcano \nwas finally allowed to  pursue his vision, and  the  result \nwas the  V8.  The  90-degree across-the-frame motor had \na  one-piece magnesium crankcase, over-square bore and \nstroke, very narrow (5mm) valve stems, and it made 68hp \nat  12,000rpm. The motor weighed just 123lb/56kg, with \nall-up weight 331Ib/150kg. \nThe  original design was first  raced in  1955 but  suffered \nfrom serious handling problems in fast  corners, and  a \nlack of reliability: it always broke down, usually while in \nthe  lead, and  didn’t finish a  race until a  new crankshaft \ndesign was used for the  '57  season, by which time it was \nmaking 73hp. Reliability was much improved and Dickie \nDale scored fourths on  it in the  first  two GPs  of  1957. Spa \nwas the  nearest the  V8  came to winning a  GP.  Australia’s \nKeith Campbell was leading by a  distance, had  smashed \nthe  lap record and  been timed at  178mph/286km/h when \na  battery lead came off.  Giuseppe Colnago did,  however, \nwin  an  Italian Championship race on  it.  It is tempting to \nspeculate on  what could have been achieved had  the \nItalian factories not  withdrawn from Grand Prix  racing \nat the  end  of  1957. Nevertheless, the  V8  Moto Guzzi \nremains one  of the  great racing designs of any  era  and  a \nlasting reminder of Giulio Carcano’s genius. \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 41 \n\nhis was Gilera’s year. Libero Liberati won the \n500cc title, with team-mate Bob McIntyre \nrunner-up. Geoff Duke’s season was ruined by \nshoulder injury sustained in a  pre-season race at \nImola, and Aussie Bob Brown replaced him at the  TT. \nMV  Agusta’s hopes were carried alone by reigning \nchampion John Surtees, but  he only managed \none race win. MV  unveiled a six-cylinder 500 in \npractice for the  Monza GP  but  did  not  race it. Moto \nGuzzi's V8  added reliability to  its undoubted speed, \nalthough its high-speed handling led to  more than \none rider refusing to  race it.  Bill  Lomas, Dickie Dale \nand Keith Campbell started the season for  Guzzi, \nwith another Australian, Keith Bryen, joining them at \nSpa. Giuseppe Colnago was reserve, racing primarily \nin the  Italian Championship. \nThe 350cc Guzzi single was still  able to  dominate \nGilera’s smaller four and the  Norton Manx, while in \nthe  250 and 125  classes Mondial swept the  board \nwith riders Cecil Sandford, Tarquinio Provini and \nlreland’s Sammy Miller. A new single replaced \n42 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nGilera took the 500 title back from MV \nand  finally broke the  100mph barrier \non  the Isle of Man \nthe  twin in the  250  class and comprehensively \noutperformed the MV  to finish first, second and \nthird. Things were closer in the 125  class, but the \nuprated, seven-speed Mondial was good enough for \nProvini to  see  off the  MV  armada led  by Luigi Taveri \nand Carlo Ubbiali. \nAt the  end of the year the  Italian factories \nannounced their withdrawal from the  sport, \nalthough MV, who had originally planned to  go \nalong with the  pull-out, later thought better of \nit. Gilera’s decision was affected by the  death of \nFerruccio Gilera, son  of the  company owner and a \ndriving force behind the  team. Their bikes would be \nback on  track with Scuderia Duke in  1963. \nMoto Guzzi, with its three top riders badly \ninjured and its aerodynamic advantage about to \nbe  negated by the  banning of full  streamlining, \ncited the  downturn in street-bike sales, as  did  the \ncomparatively small Mondial concern. Single-cylinder \nGuzzis were still  raced, notably by British veteran \nArthur Wheeler. \nABOVE Libero Liberati on \nthe  fully-faired factory \n500 Gilera.

Geoff Duke had  come \nSO  near to the  magic ton  two years previously, in  1955, \nonly to  have what was announced as a lap at exactly \n100mph rounded down to 99.97mph. (The Gilera team \nwas then suspended for the  first  two GPs  of  1956.) In \n1957 Mcintyre started the  longest ever GP,  the  Senior \nTT —  eight laps of the  Island instead of the  usual seven, \nin honour of the jubilee —  with a  lap of 99.99mph from a \nstanding start. That was a  new lap record; then came a \nlap of 101.03mph and  three more at three-figure speeds: \n100.54, 101.12 and 100.35mph. His  race average was \n98.99mph. No  other rider, in a field that included John \nSurtees on  the  MV, Bob Brown on  the  other Gilera and \nthe  Guzzis of Dickie Dale and  Keith Campbell, could \nmanage even one lap at over a  hundred. Surtees, though, \nwould do the  ton  the  following year and  take the  lap \nrecord in  ‘59. \nWhen Gilera pulled out  of racing the  factory embarked \non  a spree of record breaking using both the  350 and \n500-fours at  Monza in November. Alfredo Milani set  a \nnew one-hour record of  134.4 miles/216.3km on  the  500 \nbefore flying to compete in a winter series in Argentina. \nMcintyre then used the  350 to  do  141.37 miles/227.5km. \nThat record wasn’t beaten until 1964, and it took the \ncombination of Mike Hailwood, MV  Agusta and  the \nDaytona banking to  do it. \nBob  Mcintyre died after a wet-weather crash at Oulton \nPark in  1962. At  a tribute meeting later that same year \nGeoff Duke rode one  of the  Gileras and  formed the  idea \nof running his  own team, Scuderia Duke. Thus the  Gilera \nfour, one  of the  seminal racing motorcycle designs of all \ntime, returned to  the  track for a final outing. \nOPPOSITE Bob Mcintyre \non  the  Gilera four during \nABOVE Bob Mcintyre, \nthe  very epitome of the \ngritty Scot.

The \nshape of sporting motorcycles as  we  now know \nthem was fixed. \nThe withdrawal of Gilera, Moto Guzzi and \nMondial left  MV  alone in the  bigger classes, \nbut they still  had stiff Italian competition in the \nsmaller ones in the  shape of Ducati in the 125s, \nplus Morini, making a comeback to  GPs, in the \n250s. There was also a  new challenge emerging \nfrom a  most unexpected quarter: the  East German \nMZ  factory and their Walter Kaaden-designed \ntwo-strokes. \nJohn Surtees dominated both the  500  and 350 \nclasses with support from new team-mate and \nfellow-Brit John Hartle. Geoff Duke started the \nyear on  a  BMW but  soon reverted to  Norton, as \ndid  most of the  ex-employees of the  Italian \nfactories. MV  had both Carlo Ubbiali and Tarquinio \n46 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nIn the absence of the other Italian \nfactories, MV Agusta won every class \nand Surtees was all  but unbeatable \nProvini in the  smaller classes, not  an  easy pair to \nmanage, but the  factory decided Provini should be \nthe  lead man for the  250s and Ubbiali for the 125s. \nThis arrangement kept these two very different but \nequally strong characters happy, at  least for  a while. \nDucati had  first raced, and won, with their 125 \nDesmo in  1956 but this  was the  first year they \ncontested the  full  World Championship. The team \nwas led  by Luigi Taveri with support from fellow- \nItalians Alberto Gandossi, Romolo Ferri, Bruno \nSpaggiari and Francesco Villa, plus Britain’s Dave \nChadwick. Morini’s new 250 only appeared for the \nfinal race of the  year, Monza, but  Italians Emilio \nMendogni and Gianpiero Zubani finished first and \nsecond there. The other challenge to  MV  in the \nquarter-litre class was from MZ’'s Horst Fugner, \nwith Ernst Degner (both DDR) backing him up  in \nthe  125s. \nA good rider could still  get on  the  rostrum with \nan  NSU Sportmax, however, as  a  British youngster \ncalled Mike Hailwood demonstrated. \nABOVE John Surtees on \nthe  500cc four-cylinder \nMV Agusta. \nUARROTTS.com) \nRIGHT Bob Brown and \nMike Hailwood on  NSU \nSportmaxes during the \nLightweight (250cc) TT. \nThis was Hailwood’s first \nGP  meeting —  he finished \nthird in the  250s and got \nto  the  flag in  all  four \nclasses.

He \nknew that efficiency came from harnessing the  pressure \nwaves that reflect and  resonate in the  exhaust. This gave \nrise  to the  expansion chamber. He  understood the  need \nfor asymmetric port timing, hence discvalve induction. \nFinally, he  rediscovered an  old  Zundapp concept, the  third \ntransfer —  or  boost —  port. \nUnfortunately, in post-war Communist East Germany \nit was difficult to  get  hold of modern metals, let alone \nstate-of-the art  ignitions or  carburettors. Nevertheless, \nthe  small team first scored points under the  IFA  name in \n1955, unnoticed by everyone except British journalist Vic \nWilloughby, who did  more than anyone to throw light \non  the  genius of Kaaden, a  man who was liked as  well as \nrespected by all who worked with or  rode for  him. \nBy 1958 the  bikes, now called MZs, were very fast  but \nfussy and  fragile. The  standard technique for a  rider on \nanother make of bike was to  try and slipstream the  MZs \nwhile keeping a sharp eye  on  the  two-stroke’s exhaust. \nAs  soon as  the  first tell-tale signs of blue smoke appeared \nit was necessary to  dive to one  side to avoid the  rapidly \nslowing MZ. \nHowever, a  rider with \nmechanical sympathy and \nan  acute enough ear  to \njuggle with an  air-lever \ncontrol (a bit  like  a choke) \nwhile racing these machines \ncould make them last. \nHorst Fugner was good \nenough to  do all that. He \nfinished the  season second, \nsplitting the  factory MVs \nand  taking the  MZ’s first \nGP victory. The  following season, foreign riders started \ntaking an  interest in riding MZs. The  factory went on  to \nwin 13  GPs, the  last  in  1971, but  never won the world \ntitle  that Walter Kaaden’s work deserved (see the  chapter \non  1961 for the  reasons why). However, that should not \nobscure the  fact  that one  man, working behind the  Iron \nCurtain without access to  modern techniques or  materials, \ndeduced the  principles of the  modern two-stroke racer. \nOPPOSITE An  original MZ \nfactory publicity postcard \nshowing their first GP \nwinner Horst Fugner.

(Stuart Dent \n(Elwyn Roberts Collection) Archive) \nABOVE Ernst Degner, \nMzZ’s lead rider who \nwould play such a  part in \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 49 \n\nnce  again MV  won everything, with John \nSurtees victorious in every 350 and 500cc \nrace, a unique achievement. His  back-up in the \nbig class was Remo Venturi (ITA) and, in the \n350s, John Hartle. In  both classes the  opposition \nagain came from privately entered and tuned \nNortons, with young Rhodesian Gary Hocking on \nthe Dearden Manx being particularly impressive. \nBMW tried for  a  final season, this  time with Dickie \nDale on  board. \nHocking was one of the  riders who had \nshrewdly assessed the  potential of MZ’s two- \nstrokes and, when Horst Fugner suffered career- \nending injuries at Spa, Gary rode the  250 MZ  and \nwon first time out. He  won next time out, too  — \nand MV  immediately signed him up for  1960. MZ’s \nWalter Kaaden later told the  Swedish journalist \nJan  Leek how Hocking never blew up  one of his \nultra-sensitive engines, despite being so  blazingly \nfast. By comparison Luigi Taveri, the  first non-East \nGerman rider to  sign for  MZ, started 16 races for \n50 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nthem but  only finished five, although as  Kaaden \nsaid in the  same interview, it was the  Swiss rider \nwho'd first showed that his bikes could win. The \nMZ  team’s 125  riders, Ernst Degner and Britain’s \nDerek Minter, couldn't get  near the MVs, apart \nfrom a brilliant Degner victory at  Monza. \nMV's Carlo Ubbiali and Tarquinio Provini \nwere by now as  intent on  stabbing each other in \nthe  back as  they were on  retaining their titles. \nUbbiali ended up winning both 125  and 250 \nchampionships, with Provini departing for  Moto \nMorini at the  end of the  year. In the  250  class \nMorini-mounted Emilio Mendogni and Minter, \nplus Mike Hailwood on  an  ex-works Mondial, were \nMV's other opposition. Hailwood again featured \nin the 125s, this time on  a  Ducati Desmo single, \nwith Bruno Spaggiari and Walter Villa receiving \nsimilar machinery. Luigi Taveri started the year on \na  Ducati twin before switching to  MZ, while Ken \nKavanagh bought a  DOHC single and received \nsome additional factory support. \nABOVE John Surtees \nblasts through Parliament \nSquare on  the 350cc MV \nAgusta during the \nJunior TT.

(Honda) ‘ \nx \nve) \n\nhis was truly MV  Agusta’s annus mirabilis. For the \nthird year running they won every championship, \nand this time they won every race but two. Britain's \nJohn Hartle, riding a  Norton, won the  500cc race in \nUlster, but  only after John Surtees had stopped to \nreplace a  broken gear pedal. Perhaps, therefore, the \nvictory of Ernst Degner on  an  MZ  in the  125cc Belgian \nGP should be counted as  the  only time MV were \nbeaten all year. The two-strokes really were getting \nrather fast, Degner’s race average for eight laps of the \nold  Spa circuit hitting over 100mph/161km/h. \nAt  MV, Surtees again had Remo Venturi as  team- \nmate along with the  experienced Emilio Mendogni, \nwho retired at the  end of the  season. John Hartle rode \nMVs in the  350  and 500  TTs  but thereafter reverted to \nhis  Nortons. There was an  interesting newcomer in the \n350  class, a bevel-drive DOHC twin from Jawa, ridden \nwith panache by Frantisek Stastny (CZE). \nIn the  250  and 125  classes the  MVs of Ubbiali and \nHocking carried all  before them. Tarquinio Provini had \nleft  MV  on  far from amicable terms and now rode for \n54 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nMorini. He  concentrated on  the  Italian Championship \nfor them while developing their bike into the  most \neffective 250  single, with which he would put the  fear \nof God into the  250  field for the  next four years. \nDegner led the  MZ  team and rode in both the  125 \nand 250  classes. Fellow-East German Werner Musiol \nrode a 250, and various non-DDR riders like John \nHempleman, Dickie Dale, Bob Anderson and Italian \nAlberto Gandossi backed him up  in both classes. \nAnother team with foreign riders was Honda, who \nsigned Aussie Tom Phillis to  ride alongside their \nJapanese teamsters. This was a vital cultural exchange, \nallowing the  factory to  receive critical input from \nan  experienced racer, not  automatic deference to \nsuperiors. However, it was a Japanese rider, Teisuke \nTanaka, who scored Honda’s first Grand Prix podium \nin the  250cc race in Germany. \nIn many ways, Phillis's most significant act  of the \nyear was  to  break his collarbone at Assen, because he \nrecommended that his ride be taken by Rhodesian \nracer Jim  Redman. \nABOVE John Hartle \n(MV Agusta) and Bob \nMcIntyre (AJS) hurtle \npast the coach parties at \nGinger Hall during the \nJunior (350cc) Isle  of \nMan TT.

Carlo \nUbbiali, seen here with \nNello Pagani —  another \nMV  great who went on  to \nbe team manager -  and, \non  the  far  right, John \nSurtees. (Stuart Dent \nArchive) \n\nAt the  end  of the  season, Count Agusta decided to \nwithdraw his machines from racing. The  expanding \nnumber of Grands Prix, including a  planned trip to \nArgentina in  1961, meant the  expense of running four- \nstrokes was prohibitive. Also, both John Surtees and Carlo \nUbbiali, with seven and  nine world titles, respectively, \nto their names, decided to  retire from motorcycle \ncompetition. (The 500 MVs did, however, appear at  most \nGPs In ‘61.  They were lent  to  Gary Hocking and  sported a \n‘Privat’ logo on  their tanks.) \nJohn Surtees, of course, went on  to  achieve the \nunique distinction of becoming World Champion on \nboth two and  four wheels. It is increasingly unlikely that \nthat  feat  will  ever be equalled. His  departure may have \nbeen slightly acrimonious, John feeling that  as  he wasn’t \nallowed to  race MVs in non-championship events, he \nwasn't getting enough racing. However, as  he  pointed \nout  in his autobiography, he was the  only MV  rider to \nhave been given one  of his bikes so  they must have \nforgiven him  for  leaving. It is often said  that Surtees had \nlittle competition in his championship years, and  that may \nbe true, but  it was his skill  which developed the  four from \nan  unruly monster into  something close to  four-stroke \nperfection. \nCarlo Ubbiali retired because he was now aged 30 and \nhad  business interests to  look after. Like  Surtees, he was \na  perfectionist about set-up and a  calculating racer who \nremained a little aloof from the  competition. Tarquinio \nProvini, for years his  main opponent, was Ubbiali’s polar \nopposite and  their clashes on  and  off the  track were the \nstuff of legend. By any  measure, Ubbiali was  among the \nall-time greats of motorcycle racing, and  he was certainly \nItaly's greatest before Giacomo Agostini and  Valentino \nRossi came along. \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 57 \n\nMinis ne \nan — \nARB se a \ne \nLabi scan aOR ANNAN \nount Domenico Agusta decided in January \nthat the  increased number of GPs  and the \nexpense involved meant he  had to  stop racing. The \nretirements of two MV  greats, Carlo Ubbiali and \nJohn Surtees, doubtless had their effect as  well. \nThankfully this  draconian decision was diluted by \nApril and 1960-spec MVs were supplied to  several \nracers, notably Gary Hocking, who promptly cleaned \nup  in the  500 and 350 classes. The word ‘Privat’ \nappeared prominently next to the  MV  badge to \nshow these weren't works bikes. \nHocking had also started the  season competing \nin the  250 class, and won the  first race, but  the \nstrength of six  Hondas, three factory and three \nleased, proved overwhelming —  one of them claimed \nHonda’s first world title, thanks to  Mike Hailwood. \nTwo other Brits, John Hartle and Bob Mcintyre, also \ngot bikes through the  UK  importer. The factory \nsquad comprised another Rhodesian rider, Jim \nRedman, along with Aussie Tom Phillis and Japanese \nKunimitsu Takahashi. In the  125  class Phillis and \n58 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nRedman rode alongside Swiss veteran Luigi Taveri. \nYamaha ventured into Europe for the  first time \nwith all-Japanese entries in the 125  and 250cc \nclasses. They didn’t do a full  season but  raced at the \nTT,  Assen and Spa-Francorchamps early in the  year \nbefore reappearing at the  last  round in Argentina. \nMike Hailwood won the  Isle  of Man TT ona \nprivate 500cc Norton tuned by Bill  Lacey, and \nfollowed Hocking home in the  next four races. \nCount Agusta knew talent when he saw it and \nprovided an  MV  for  Hailwood for the  Italian GP, \nwhich Mike won when Hocking fell  chasing him. \nThe Rhodesian got his  revenge next time out. The \nfinal race of the  year took place in Argentina, the \nfirst time Grand Prix  motorcycle racing had ventured \noutside Europe. However, not  many of the top \nrunners, especially in the 500cc class, went to the \ntime, trouble and expense of attending. This is \nwhy many of the  ‘one hit wonders’ of Grand Prix \nhistory appear in the  record books with their names \nattached to  early South American races. \nABOVE Welsh-born but \nbrought up  in  Rhodesia, \nGary Hocking was a \nnatural talent who could \nsurely have won more \nthan two championships. \n(JARROTTS.com) \nRIGHT The Nortons of \nJohn Hartle and Mike \nHailwood lead the field at \nthe start of the Ulster GP. \n(JARROTTS.com) \n\nGary Hocking opened the \nyear with a first Grand Prix \nvictory in the  500cc class \nMike Hailwood took his first \n500cc GP victory to  become \nthe youngest rider to win in \nthe top class at that time \nHailwood’s victory in the \n500cc class on  a  private \nNorton followed wins on \nHondas in the  125  and 250cc \nclasses, making him  the first \nrider to win three Grand Prix \nclasses at one event \nFrantisek Stastny became \nthe first Czech rider to win a \nGrand Prix, and also the  first \nto win riding a Jawa \nBritain’s Phil Read (Norton) \nTHE \n41961 \nSEASON \nGary Hocking took his sixth \nwin in the first seven races to \nclinch the 500cc world title \nMike Hailwood won first \ntime out  riding the  MV \nAgusta after Hocking crashed \nwhile battling for the  victory \nJorge Kissling (Matchless) \nbecame the  first Argentine \nrider to win a Grand Prix on \nthe first occasion a World \nChampionship event was \nstaged outside Europe \nscored his first GP win on  his \ndebut in Grand Prix  racing \nGary Hocking took victory, \nto  add  the  350cc title to the \n500cc championship he'd \nalready won \nGary Hocking gave MV \nAgusta their 26th and last \nGP victory in the  250cc class \nKunimitsu Takahashi (Honda) \nbecame the  first Japanese \nrider to  win a  Grand Prix. \nThis was also Honda’s first \n250cc win \nTom Phillis won the  250cc \nrace, having already taken \nvictory in the  125cc class — \nthe  first Honda rider to  win \ntwo classes on  the  same day \nPhillis won from Mike \nHailwood and Kunimitsu \nTakahashi —  the  first all- \nHonda podium in Grand \nPrix racing \nJim  Redman took his first \nGrand Prix  victory for  Honda \nMike Hailwood won the  race, \nto  become the  youngest ever \nWorld Champion and the \nfirst to win a championship \non  Japanese machinery \nTom Phillis gave Honda their \nfirst GP victory after Mike \nHailwood (EMC), leading \nby half a  minute with seven \nlaps to  go,  was slowed by a \nsplit exhaust \nErnst Degner (DDR) won the \nrace from Alan Shepherd \n(GBR) and Walter Brehme \n(DDR) -  the  only GP  race \nat which MZ  riders took all \nthree podium places \nYamaha entered Grand Prix \nracing for the  first time \nwith Japanese factory rider \nFumio Ito \nErnst Degner, riding an  MZ \nbuilt in East Germany, won \nthe  first ever GP  race to  be \nheld in that country \nIn the  absence of Degner, \nTom Phillis took the  required \nGP  victory to  give him and \nHonda the  125cc world title \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 59 \n\n1961 VWORLD CHAMPIONSHIP \nne\" \nTia \n1958 \nra \nOES \nee \nan \nNUE \nte \nCOME \naie \naE \nElena \nSix  best results were counted \nPos \nRider \nNat \nMachine \nGER \nFRA \nGBR \nNED \nBEL \nDDR \nULS \nITA \nSWE \nARG \nNett \nGross \n1.   \n= \nGary \nHocking \nRHO \nMV  \nAgusta \n8 \n8 \n- \n8 \n8 \n8 \n8 \n- \n8 \n- \n48 \n(56) \n2 \nMike \nHailwood \nGBR \n_Norton/MV \nAgusta \n3 \n6 \n8 \n6 \n6 \n6 \n6 \n8 \n6 \n- \n40 \n(55) \n3 \nFrank \nPerris \nGBR \nNorton \n6 \n- \n- \n2 \n- \n- \n- \n4 \n4 \n16 \n4 Bob Mcintyre \nGBR Norton \n- - 6 4 4 - - - : . 14 \n5 \nAlastair \nKing \nGBR \nNorton \n- \n- \n3 \n= \n- \n- \n4 \n6 \n- \n- \n13 \n6 \nBert \nSchneider \nAUT \nNorton \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n4 \n- \n2 \n3 \n- \n9 \n7 Jorge Kissling \nARG Matchless \n- - - - - - - - - 8 8 \n8 \nRon \nLangston \nGBR \nMatchless \n- \n- \n2 \n- \n2 \n- \n3 \n- \n- \n- \n7 \n9 Juan Carlos Salatino ARG Norton \n- - - - - - - - - 6 6 \n10 Paddy Driver \nRSA Norton \n- - - - 1 - - 4 - - 3) \n11.

Sweden was due  to  be \nthe  penultimate round, with Argentina completing the \nseason, but there were doubts over the  South American \nrace. The East German factory's 125  had  just become the \nfirst motor in history to  generate a specific power output \nof over 200hp/litre, and  lead rider Ernst Degner was \nheading the  championship and  favourite for the  title. \nHow had  a tiny company locked away in East Germany \nwith no  means of buying top  riders, modern alloys or \nstate-of-the-art parts like  carbs and  ignitions been able \nto  do this? The  answer was the  genius of one man, \nWalter Kaaden. Single-handedly he had  deduced the \nmodern two-stroke from first  principles by treating it as \na  resonating device not  as  a  pump —  like  a four-stroke \nmachine —  no  matter that he had  to  use  old  saw blades \nto fabricate disc  valves. And all this  took place with MZ \npitted against Honda’s highly paid works stars and  the \nItalian armada. \nNot  long before the  Swedish GP,  in September 1961, \nthe  situation of the  East German team was made even \nmore precarious because their government built the \nBerlin Wall, plunging the  Cold War well and  truly into  the \ndeep freeze. Some people think that Degner’s plans were \nalready well advanced before the  Wall went up,  and  on \nthe  way to  Kristianstad he learnt that his family had  been \nsuccessfully smuggled to the  West, drugged in the  boot \nof a Car. \nInstead of running a conservative race and  taking the \ntitle, Degner shot into  the  lead but the  engine only lasted \ntwo laps. Most histories state that Degener deliberately \nover-revved his  bike, but  why would a  man as  self-centred \nas  Degner pass up the  chance of calling himself a World \nChampion? Especially as  his status as  an  international \nsportsman enabled him  to travel freely and  he could \nhave escaped relatively easily once he knew his family \nwas  safe? \nWith the  help of Suzuki, he immediately defected and \njoined his family. Suzuki weren’t helping for  humanitarian \nreasons, though: their two-strokes were cringingly slow \nnext to  both Honda’s four-strokes and  the  MZs, and  they \nwanted Kaaden’s secrets. Degner provided a quick route. \nIn  1962 Ernst Degner became the  first rider to win  a \nWorld Championship on  a two-stroke —  a  50cc Suzuki — \nand  the  following year Hugh Anderson won both the  125 \nand  50cc titles for Suzuki. \nWhat did  Degner take with him? He  always maintained \nhe just took what was in his  head. Walter Kaaden \nthought otherwise, feeling sure Degner took a good deal \nof hardware too. Most of all, he resented the  selling of \nyears of his team’s work, and  when Suzuki painted their \nbikes blue and  silver, the  same as  MZ, Kaaden had  his \nmachines painted green and  silver. \nThere are  also fanciful stories about Degner’s death, \nsome claiming that he was murdered by the  East German \nsecret service, the  Stasi. The  truth is more prosaic. He  died \nyoung of a  heart attack, as  did  his father and  grandfather. \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 61 \n\nike  Hailwood joined Gary Hocking on  500 \n‘Privat’ MVs and the  pair won every race they \nattended. The only works bikes on  the  grid were the \nJawa twin of Frantisek Stastny and Phil  Read’s single- \ncylinder Manx Norton. The story was very different in \nthe smaller classes. Honda fielded Jim Redman, Tom \nPhillis, Luigi Taveri, Kunimitsu Takahashi, Bob Mcintyre \nand new recruit, Ulsterman Tommy Robb, as  factory \nriders. Mcintyre was supposed to  win the  350s, Redman \nthe  250s and Takahashi the  125s. Britain’s Derek Minter \ndid  his  best to  upset the  applecart by unknowingly \nbeating the  factory bikes at the  250cc Isle  of Man TT  on \na  Honda supplied by the  British importer. He  never rode \na  Honda again. \nIt was a  grisly year. Phillis died in the  350cc TT, \nMcintyre after crashing at  a  British national meeting. \nGary Hocking, appalled by the  death of his great friend \nPhillis, quit motorcycle racing and went back to South \nAfrica and a career on  four wheels. Before the  end of \nthe  year he too  was dead. Like Jarno Saarinen in the \n1970s, Hocking was an  astonishing talent cut  down \n62 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nrMdaliVWvOOQOQ \nwaive \nVINES \n- = pe - \\WiA a   | Fy io \" a , \na = yy    tt   = A nw iA \nin his  prime. He won 19 GPs, two on  MZs, the  rest on \nMVs. He  won the  first time he sat  on  a two-stroke, at \nSweden’s Kristianstad circuit in  1959, and he was good \nenough to  race Hailwood at  lap-record pace on  equal \nmachinery around the  Isle  of Man. No-one who saw \nhim or  raced against him doubts he could have added \nto  his two world titles. \nJim  Redman persevered grimly and won both the  250 \nand 350  championships. This was the  first year Honda \nraced in the  350  class, using their 250-four bored out \nto  285cc. They finished first and second, Tommy Robb \ntaking victory in the  last  race of the  season, in Finland, \nto  claim the  runner-up spot. In the  250s it was another \none-two, this  time with Mcintyre taking second place — \nand only three of the  championship top ten  weren't on \na  Honda. In the  125cc class Taveri won, with the  other \nthree Honda riders second, third and fourth. \nHowever, they didn’t have it their own way in the \nnew 50cc class. Taveri and Robb were faced with a  new \nphenomenon: two-strokes that were both fast and \nreliable, with Ernst Degner taking the  title on  a  Suzuki. \nABOVE Mike Hailwood \non  the 500c MV  Agusta. \n(JARROTTS.com) \n\nTHE \n4962 \nSEASON \nCSS) \nLSS \nSSS, \nFSP \nVER \nESOL \nI \nSSF \nISS \nGBR/Isle of Man TT \n@ Gary Hocking (MV Agusta) \nwon the  opening race of the \nyear and then retired from \nracing \nITA-NAZ/Monza \n@ Mike Hailwood (MV Agusta) \n-won for the fifth successive \nrace to  become the \nyoungest ever 500cc World \nChampion —  a  record he  held \nuntil Freddie Spencer won \nthe title in  1983 \nFIN/Tampere \n@ In the  absence of the MV \nTeam, Alan Shepherd \n(Matchless) won the 500cc \nrace at the  first ever Grand \nPrix event to  be  held in \nFinland \nARG/Buenos Aires \n@ Argentina’s Benedicto \nCaldarella (Matchless) took \nhis only GP victory ina \npoorly supported race in \nwhich the fourth rider home \nwas lapped five times \nGBR/Isle of Man TT \n@ Winner of the  opening two \nraces of the year, Kunimitsu \nTakahashi crashed on  the \nopening lap and suffered \ninjuries that kept him out  of \nracing for the  remainder of \nthe  season \nULS/Dundrod \nm@  In the  absence of Takahashi, \nLuigi Taveri’s victory at the \nUlster GP gave him his first \nworld title \nARG/Buenos Aires \nm  Hugh Anderson (NZE) gave \nSuzuki their first Grand Prix \nvictory in the  125cc class \nGBRi/Isle of Man TT \n@ Mike Hailwood won the \nrace after a tremendous \nbattle with MV  team-mate \nGary Hocking, less than six \nseconds covering the  pair \nafter more than two hours \nof racing \nReigning 125cc World \nChampion Tom Phillis \n(Honda) lost  his  life  after \ncrashing on  the  second lap \nwhile lying in third place \nNED/Assen \nm@ Jim  Redman gave Honda \ntheir first Grand Prix  victory \nin the  350cc class \nITA-NAZ/Monza \n@ Redman’s fourth victory of \nthe  year added the  350cc \nWorld Championship to the \n250cc title he’d already won \nSPA/Montjuich \nm@  Hans-Georg Anscheidt \n(Kreidler) won the first Grand \nPrix  for  50cc machines from \nhome rider José Busquets, \nriding a  Derbi —  the  first \nGP  points for the  Spanish \nmanufacturer \nSPA/Montjuich \n@ Jim  Redman won the \nopening 250cc race of the \nyear after Silvio Grassetti \n(ITA), giving the new Benelli \nfour-cylinder machine its \nfirst GP  outing, suffered \nmechanical failure while \nbattling for the  lead \nFRA/Clermont-Ferrand \n@ Just half a  second covered \nthe  three podium finishers, \nHonda riders Redman, Bob \nMcintyre and Tom Phillis, \nwith all three riders lapping \nevery other rider in the  race \nat  least once \nGER/Solitude \nm@ Bob Mcintyre finished \nsecond in  his  last GP  before \ntragically losing his  life  due \nto  injuries suffered in a  non- \nGBRi/Isle of Man TT \nm Ernst Degner (GER) gave \nSuzuki their first win in Grand \nPrix racing \n@ Beryl Swain (GBR, Itom) \nbecame the first female rider \nto  compete in a TT  race and \nfinished in 22nd position \n<= \nchampionship race at  Oulton \nPark in England \nULS/Dundrod \nlH Tommy Robb (Honda) took \nhis first Grand Prix  victory at \nhis  home event \nDDR/Sachsenring \n@ Nikolai Sevostyanov finished \nfifth to  back up  his sixth in \nthe  earlier 350cc race —  the \nfirst Russian rider to  score \nWorld Championship points \nARG/Buenos Aires: \n@ Arthur Wheeler (Moto Guzzi), \nwho made his GP  debut at \nthe  first championship race in \n1949, took victory at the  age \nof 46 —  the  oldest rider to win \na  Grand Prix. \nThis was also the  last  of 45 \nGP victories for  Moto Guzzi \nARG/Buenos Aires \n@  In the  final race of the  year, \nDegner finished second \nin front of his closest \nchampionship challenger, \nfellow-German Anscheidt, \nto  clinch the  world title —  the \nfirst ever by a  Suzuki rider \nOLDEST RIDERS TO  WIN ACROSS ALL SOLO GP  CLASSES \nRider \n1   Arthur Wheeler \n2   Fergus Anderson \n3   Hermann-Paul Muller \n4 \nEnrico Lorenzetti \n5   Jack Findlay \n6   Les  Graham \n7   Maurice Cann \n8   Marcellino Lucchi \n9 .

He \nhad secretly done a  deal with Suzuki and, over \nwinter, their bikes went from wheezing also-rans to \nState-of-the-art racers. Degner always maintained \nhe only took the  information that was in his  head, \nbut  in his seminal book Team Suzuki Ray Battersby \nquotes Suzuki team-managers and mechanics \naffirming that he brought plenty of hardware \nas  well. \nThe  MZ  factory, affected not  just by the  loss  of \ntheir star  rider but  also by even severer restrictions \non  their already strictly controlled movements, \nsimply didn’t figure. From now on  East German \nriders hardly ever appeared away from their home \nrace or  the  Czechoslovakian GP.  MZ’'s presiding \ngenius Walter Kaaden ran  the  racing effort by \nremote control, with Britain’s Alan Shepherd as \nhis  main 350cc rider and  guest appearances by a \nvariety of others, the  most memorable of which was \nMike Hailwood’s ride  at the  250cc East German GP \nat the  Sachsenring just a few  kilometres from the \nMZ  factory. In front of over a quarter of a  million \nspectators Hailwood duelled for the whole race with \nJim  Redman on  the factory Honda, over a  minute \nand  a  half  ahead of the  rest  of the  field, only losing \nout  on  the win  by a fifth of a second. \nIn the  50cc class, the  new Suzuki and  another \nGerman two-stroke, the  Kreidler, fought it out \nwith the  four-stroke Hondas. Kreidler was a West \nGerman moped factory and  their race team, \nincluding rider Hans-Georg Anscheidt, were all \nfactory employees. However, the  bike was ultra- \nmodern with disc-valve induction and  the first  use \nof silicate coatings on  cylinder bore. In the  125  class \nthe  Hondas were unbeatable, but  in the  50s  the \nnew generation of two-strokes was making itself \nfelt. Honda had  to start multiplying the  ratios in \nthe  gearbox to  get competitive.

Honda development \nwas stalled and the  team understaffed, Yamaha \nburst on  to  the  scene with a two-stroke twin and \nItalian double World Champion Tarquinio Provini \nhad a  new iteration of the  Morini single which he \nrode as  if his  life  depended on  it.  It was one of those \ntime windows when a lighter, less  powerful bike \nwas able to  compete with the  more powerful but \nclumsier machines, and Provini pushed Honda’s team \nleader Jim  Redman all the  way. The other Honda 250 \nriders were Tommy Robb and Luigi Taveri. Benelli \nhad a  new four-stroke four for  Silvio Grassetti, while \nMZ’s two-stroke twin in the  hands of Britain’s Alan \nShepherd was still  on  the  pace. \nThe real surprise was how competitive the \nYamaha RD56 was. Unfortunately the  team only \nhad finances for three races: the  Isle  of Man TT, \nAssen and Spa. Fumio Ito  finished second to  Redman \nin the first two races, then won the  third with his \nteam-mates getting two fourths and a second. Phil \n66 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nRead got to  ride the  Yamaha at the  last  race of the \nseason and immediately signed up  for  ‘64. Suzuki \ndebuted a square-four machine at the  same race. \nHonda’s trio had similar problems in the 125 \nclass. Their twin was outclassed by the  Suzuki disc- \nvalve two-strokes of Hugh Anderson, Ernst Degner, \nFrank Perris (GBR) and Bert Schneider (AUT). \nHonda didn’t contest the 50cc class, so  Suzuki's only \nopposition came from Kreidler, at  least until Honda \nraced a  new twin at  Suzuka and Taveri won on  it. \nThe 350  class was a straight fight between \nRedman and Mike Hailwood on  the  MV \nAgusta, which the  Honda man won. Mike the \nBike cakewalked the  500s on  the  MV  with the \ndogged and versatile Alan Shepherd second on \na  Matchless single. The Gilera fours were taken \nout  of mothballs for  one last  season and run  by \nGeoff Duke under the  banner of Scuderia Duke: \nBritish riders John Hartle and Derek Minter were \ncontracted, with Phil  Read taking over when Minter \nwas injured. \nABOVE Double World \nChampion for the  second \nyear running —  Jim \nRedman on  the 125 \nHonda at the French GP. \n(Honda) \nTOP RIGHT Luigi Taveri \n(Honda) prepares for \nthe start of the 125cc \nUlster GP.

It \nwas a  measure of how little the  500 class had  progressed \nin the  intervening five  years that the  bigger bikes were \ncompetitive, whereas it was quickly obvious that the  350 \nwas significantly inferior not  just to the  Honda and  the \nMV  but to Jawa as  well. It was quickly parked. \nHailwood’s MV  was generally superior and  only when \nit hit mechanical problems at Assen did  Scuderia Duke \nachieve a win, courtesy of John Hartle. This was not  a \nproper works effort, though, because the  only factory \ncontribution was a couple of mechanics. Promised \nsponsorship never materialised (some things never \nchange) so  Duke's riders were allowed to  ride  other bikes \nat events not  on  the  team’s schedule. Derek Minter, the \nScuderia’s lead rider, was hurt at  Brands Hatch and  missed \nthe  first  three GPs; Phil  Read took over. The  bikes looked \ndifferent, with dolphin fairings, but were essentially the \n‘57  machines. Only at the  Italian GP  did  Minter receive an \nupdated motor. However, the  effort was not  only short of \nfactory support and  finance but  also  riven by personality \nclashes. It was  the  last  time Gilera contested the  GPs  with \na team. \nThe  last  burst of Gilera glory came via  Benedicto \nCaldarella, winner of his  home 500cc GP  in Argentina in \n1962. He  had  an  ex-Scuderia Duke bike for end-of-season \ninternationals in South America and  was quick enough to \nbe allowed to  keep it for  ‘64.  At the  opening GP of the \nyear at  Daytona he gave Mike Hailwood a serious race \nbefore the  bike broke, proving that the  win  at  his sparsely \nattended home race did  mean something. However, \nCaldarella had  the  same problems as  Scuderia Duke, and \nhis only scoring ride  in  1964 was  a close second place \nbehind Hailwood at  Monza. Both Derek Minter and  Remo \nVenturi (ITA) tried to  race Gileras again in  ‘67,  but  to  no \navail. The  racing career of the  bike  that pioneered the \nubiquitous double-overhead-camshaft across-the-frame \nfour-cylinder layout was  over. \nLEFT Derek Minter on \nthe Scuderia Duke Gilera. \n(JARROTTS.com) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 69 \n\nTwo-strokes broke through to win the  250 \nchampionship for the first time, as  Hailwood \nand Redman added to their titles \nae | onda went on  the  attack in the  war against the  Italian Championship with a  promising young \nthe  invading two-strokes with their 50cc rider called Giacomo Agostini who caught all eyes \ntwin and 125cc four.

Suddenly, success in \ndomestic competition wasn’t enough and  Yamaha too \nhad  to venture overseas. They had  first  appeared at a \nGrand Prix  in  1961 with air-cooled discvalve two-stroke \nracers, a single-cylinder 125, the  RA41, and  a 250  twin, \nthe  RD48, for the  French, British, Dutch and Belgian races. \nThe bigger bike was good enough to  score points at  all \nbut the  first  race. Yamaha only raced once outside Japan \nin  1962, and that was in a  non-championship event, but \nthe  factory was busy applying the  lessons they had  learnt. \nThe result was the  RD56. The  motor was little changed, \nbut  the  chassis now looked modern: duplex cradle frame, \nGirling rear shocks, forks with internal springs and a flat- \nsided tank. With Fumio Ito  leading the  team, Yamaha \nmade a  massive impression when they raced at the  Isle  of \nMan TT, Assen and Spa  in  1963. \nStill  short of budget, the  Yamaha factory didn't want \nto  do a full  season in ‘64  but  Phil  Read talked them into \nit.  He  started the  250cc GP  season on  the  RD56 he  had \nridden at Suzuka at the  end of the  previous season, and \nreceived the  revised model in time for the  Isle  of Man \nTT,  the  fourth round of the year. It incorporated more \nmodern porting to  give it an  estimated 50bhp, but  it \nlooked even fresher thanks to that iconic red  and  white \ncolour scheme that would feature on  all Yamaha racers \nup to  and including the  YZR500. \nThe Honda, by contrast, was considerably more \npowerful but  also a  lot  heavier. The  Achilles heel of all \nthe  two-strokes was still  reliability, but  the  points-scoring \nsystem meant that in the  250cc class riders counted their \nsix best results from eleven races, so  the  failures that \nRead did  experience were not  as  damaging as  they would \nbe \nnowadays. \nRead \nthus \nbecame \nYamaha’s \nfirst  \nWorld \nChampion, \nbut  \nit \nis \neasy \nto  \noverlook \nthe  \ncontribution \nof \nFumio \nIto.  \nThe  \nJapanese \nrode \nat  \nCatalina \nin \nthe  \nUSA \nin \nFive best results were counted \nNett Gross Pos Rider Nat \n46 (64) 1 Hugh Anderson NZE \nsi) (ey) Ralph Bryans GBR \n34 3 Hans-Georg Anscheidt GER \n22 (24) 4 Isao Morishita JPN \n21 5 Mitsuo Itoh JPN \n12 6 Jean-Pierre Beltoise FRA \n10 7 Luigi Taveri SWI \n6 8 José Busquets SPA \n6 9 Rudi Kunz GER \n6 10 Peter Eser GER \n10 Angel Nieto SPA \n10 Cees van Dongen NED \n1958, the  factory’s first  venture outside Japan; he was the \nteam’s lead rider when they came to  GPs  and he scored \ntheir first  victory, although his first  GP  point actually \ncame when he was riding a  500cc BMW in  1960.

However, Yamaha \ndidn’t rest on  their laurels and came out  with their \nown monster in the 125  class. First a water-cooled \nversion of the  125cc twin appeared at the  TT and \nAssen, winning both races before being shipped home. \nThen, 12  months after Honda had unveiled their 250- \nsix at  Monza, Yamaha took the  sheets off their V4, \neffectively two contra-rotating RA97 125cc engines \nmounted in a  70-degree Vee. It turned out  to  be \nneither as  effective nor  as  pretty as  the  RA65. \nSuzuki's team of Hugh Anderson, Frank Perris \nand Ernst Degner were joined full time by Yoshimi \nKatayama who had scored a  rostrum finish on  the \n125  at Suzuka the  previous year. The square-four 250 \ncontinued to  be problematic and didn’t appear again \nafter Spa, despite Perris having got it on  the  rostrum \nat the TT —  the  RZ’s second and final top-three finish. \nHowever, Suzuki got their revenge in the  125  class as \n74 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nthey added water-cooling to their twin and so  outpaced \nthe  Honda fours of Luigi Taveri and Ralph Bryans that \nthe four-strokes were withdrawn after Assen. \nHonda showed their intention by unveiling their \nfive-cylinder 125  at the  final race of the  year at Suzuka, \nwhere it set  the  fastest lap, and some satisfaction \nwas obtained when Bryans won the  50cc title on  the \n20,000rpm nine-speed RC115 twin. At that Japanese \nGP the  250 race took place last, as  was then usual. \nHaving won the  350  race for  MV, Mike Hailwood \nhopped on a six-cylinder Honda and won the  250 race \nby a  minute and a half. \nHonda left Jim  Redman on  his own not  just in \nthe  250  class, but  in the  350s as  well, where he came \nunder serious pressure from MV  Agusta’s new recruit, \nGiacomo Agostini. MV were still  using their old two- \nvalves-per-cylinder four in the  500cc class —  and it was \ngood enough for  Mike Hailwood and his new team- \nmate to finish first and second in the  championship \n—  but  in the  350s they now had a lightweight four- \nvalve triple. \nABOVE MV Agusta team- \nmates at  Assen: Giacomo \nAgostini leads Mike \nHailwood.

Count Agusta had  been waiting \nfor an  Italian rider capable of winning on  his  machines, \nso  when Ago appeared the  triple was created specifically \nfor  him. It was built to the  Count’s specific orders to  be \nsmaller and  lighter than the  old  bike, and  was based on \nthe  250  twin that had  last  raced in  1961. The  machine \nfirst surfaced in 350cc form in domestic competition, \nnotably without the  ‘Privat’ logo on  the  tank, and  won its \nfirst Grand Prix  at the  Nurburgring in  Germany in  1965. \nMike Hailwood rode the  old  four. \nWhy did  MV  test  their new concept in the  350  class? \nThere was no  real  challenge to their domination of the \n500s with what was, essentially, a 15-year-old design, \nbut  in the  350s Honda had  won the  last  three titles with \nJim  Redman. Count Agusta wanted to fight back. The \nnew MV  was so  fast  that Redman crashed chasing it in \nGermany, but the  champ then hit back with a  run  of four \nstraight wins. Neither Redman nor  Ago scored in Ulster, \nthen Ago won two in a  row, so  the  fight went all the  way \ndown to  the  last  round in Japan. Agostini maintains to \nthis  day that he would have been champion if his ignition \nhadn’t malfunctioned, but  that failure allowed Redman \nto  cruise to second place behind Hailwood’s MV, and  the \nRhodesian rider retained the  title  for the  fourth year in \nsuccession. \nThe  advent of the  MV  triple was  just the  first  of a \nseries of seismic shifts in the  power balance of motorcycle \nracing. The  ‘65  350  crown was  to  be  Redman’s last world \ntitle; the  man who did  more than any  other to  put  Honda \non  the  racing map would soon have to  hand over to \nHailwood for the  company’s assault on  the  500cc class. \nThe combination of Giacomo Agostini and the  MV  triple, \nhowever, would bestride the  next seven years of Grand \nPrix  racing in the  two biggest capacity classes, first in epic \nconfrontations with Mike Hailwood and  the  Honda six, \nand  then fighting a  heroic rearguard action against the \nadvance of the  two-strokes. \ny 1965 \nnen a We  ae \nFive best results were counted \nNett Gross Pos Rider Nat Machine Nett Gross \n56 (62) 1 Ralph Bryans GBR _ Honda 36  = (38) \n44 (48) 2 Luigi Taveri SWI Honda 32, (39) \n28 (30) Hugh Anderson NZE = Suzuki S24 (37) \n23 4 Ernst Degner GER = Suzuki 26 \n14 5 Mitsuo Itoh JPN = Suzuki 16 \n12 6 Michio Ichino JPN = Suzuki 6 \n11 7 Hans-Georg Anscheidt GER Kreidler 6 \n11 8 José Busquets SPA Derbi 4 \n10 9 Jacques Roca FRA Derbi 4 \n8 10 Harou Koshino JPN = Suzuki 3 \n10 Charlie Mates GBR _ Honda 5 \nABOVE Giacomo Agostini - \ndevastatingly fast, impeccably \norganised, and handsome \nwith it.  VARROTTS.com) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 77 \n\nonda attacked on  all fronts as  they entered the \n500  class for the  first time. Jim  Redman and \nMike Hailwood rode the  RC181, like the  other Hondas \nan  air-cooled DOHC but, perhaps surprisingly, with \nonly four cylinders. Hailwood and Redman also rode \nsix-cylinder Hondas in the  250  and 350  classes while \nLuigi Taveri and Ralph Bryans contested the  50 and \n125cc classes. When Jim  Redman was injured at the \nBelgian GP,  Stuart Graham (GBR) was employed to \nback up  Hailwood. \nThe opposition to  Honda’s onslaught came, as  was \nnow the  pattern, from MV  Agusta in the  two biggest \nclasses, from Yamaha in the  125  and 250s, and from \nSuzuki in the  50s. The Italian factory concentrated all \nits efforts behind Giacomo Agostini and brought out \na 420cc version of their triple to counter the threat of \nthe  new 500cc Honda. Yamaha persisted with their \nunwieldy V4  in the  250  class but countered Honda’s \nfive-cylinder 125  with their own water-cooled V4  late \nin the  season. The (in)famous team of Phil  Read and \nBill  lvy (GBR) rode both classes, Little Bill  getting the \n78 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \njob after he replaced the  injured Mike Duff at the  last \nrace of ’65. \nSuzuki kept Frank Perris, Yoshimi Katayama and \nHugh Anderson on  their 125s and  the  latter two were \njoined by Hans-Georg Anscheidt on  the  50s.  The \nGerman was recruited after his previous employers, \nKreidler, quit GPs. Suzuki had  a  new water-cooled twin, \nthe  RK66, on  which Anscheidt would prove almost \nunbeatable over the next three years. However, he \nneeded a  Honda boycott of the  last race of the year, as \nusual the  Japanese GP, to win his first title. Ostensibly, \nHonda refused to race at the  Fisco Circuit (also known \nas  Fuji) because of safety concerns. The alternative \ntheory was  that the company was irked at the  event \nbeing moved from Suzuka, Honda’s own circuit. \nHonda may not  have won the  500  or  50cc \nRiders’ Championships but they did  something \njust as  remarkable.

He  first \nrode for  Honda in  1960 when he  replaced his  injured \nfriend, Aussie Tom Phillis, joining the  factory full  time the \nfollowing year. He  went on  to win  six titles, including two \n250/350 doubles, in four years. In  1964 he won the  125, \n250 and 350cc races at the  Dutch TT on  the  same day, a \nfeat equalled only by Hailwood. He  also acted as  Honda's \nteam captain, advising the  factory on  rider recruitment, \nand he  had  enough power to decide that the  team \nshould boycott the  US  GP  in  1964 and ‘65.  Jim  enjoyed \nthe  confidence and  respect of Mr  Honda himself and \nthe second President of the  Honda Motor Company, Mr \nKawashima. Company legend has  it that when the  bikes \nstarted becoming competitive and  there was a queue of \nbetter known riders asking to  ride  them, Mr  Kawashima \nsaid: ‘Jim-san and  Tom-san rode them when they were \nslow, they will  ride  them now they are  fast.’ That loyalty \nworked both ways. No-one ever heard Redman say \nanything bad  about his  bikes, no  matter how wayward \ntheir handling. Even though he was never a fan  of the  TT, \nJim  won the  same two races three years running on  the \nIsland, a fact of which he  remains extremely proud. \nNo-one has won more world titles on  a  Honda, \nand 1966 was supposed to  be the  year when Redman \nadded the  500c crown to  his two 250  and  four 350 \nchampionships. Hailwood was originally supposed to \nconcentrate on  the  250  and  350  classes. Jim  won the  first \ntwo rounds, then crashed at  Spa, badly breaking his wrist. \nHe  tried to come back four races later but  he  had  not  fully \nrecovered. He  retired at the  end  of the  season, as  he’d \nalways planned, without completing the  year and  without \na  500cc title  to  his  name. \nEnglish by birth, Redman emigrated to  Rhodesia to \navoid \nhis \nyoung \ntwin \nbrother \nand \nsister \nbeing \ntaken \ninto \ncare when he was called up for  National Service. Not \nsurprisingly, \nhe \nturned \nout \nto \nbe \na \ndifficult \nman \nto \nbeat. \ny \n1966 \nFour best results were counted \nNett Gross Pos Rider Nat Machine Nett Gross \n46 (58) 1 Hans-Georg Anscheidt GER Suzuki 28 (31) \nAQ Wa (44) 2 Luigi Taveri SWI Honda 26  = (29) \n32 (33) 3 Ralph Bryans GBR Honda 26 (30) \n2 Os (3i/)) eee Hugh Anderson NZE = Suzuki 1Om(22) \n15 5 Yoshimi Katayama JPN = Suzuki 10 \n14 6 Mitsuo Itoh JPN = Suzuki 3 \n10 6 Ernst Degner GER = Suzuki 3 \n> 8 Barry Smith AUS _ Derbi 3 \n4 9 Tommy Robb GBR_ Bridgestone 2 \n4 9   = Angel Nieto SPA Derbi 2 \n9 Oswald Dittrich GER Kreidler 2 \n9 Brian Gleed GBR Honda 2 \nHe  wasn’t just tough on  the  track, Redman was one BELOW Jim  Redman, \nof the  first riders to  challenge the  exploitation of riders Honda's most successful \nby organisers.

This was the  year of the  epic duel \nbetween Giacomo Agostini on  the  three-cylinder \nMV  Agusta and Mike Hailwood on  the  much- \nimproved but  still  wayward-handling Honda four. \nTheir confrontation at the  Isle  of Man saw Hailwood \nset  a  lap record that would stand for  nine years \nand, by common consent, the  1967 Senior TT was \nthe  greatest race ever on  the  Mountain circuit. The \nHonda RC181 500  wasn’t good enough for  Hailwood \nto  get on  terms with Ago, but  the  six-cylinder 350, \nthe RC174, which was actually a  250 over-bored to \n297cc, was perfection. Mike won every GP  he  rode \nit in. \nThe resources taken up  by Honda’s attack on \nFormula 1 —-  or  it may have been the  inexorable \nmarch of the  two-strokes —  led  to  a  reduction in \nthe  factory's effort on  two wheels. Mike Hailwood \ncontested the  three big classes —  250, 350, 500cc — \nwith Ralph Bryans supporting him in the  two smaller \nclasses; Mike was on  his  own in the  500s. Honda did \n82 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nnot  contest the  50 and 125cc championships. \nGauge the  status of the  250s by the  fact that \nevery GP  promoter ran  the  class —  13  rounds — \nwhereas 10  ran  the  500s and just 8 the  350s. \nYamaha again had the  pairing of Phil Read and Bill \nIvy on  V4s  in both the 125  and 250cc classes. Nothing \ncould touch their 125, and although Hailwood won \nmore 250 races than Read, only seven races were \ncounted for the  scoring system, which put the  pair \nlevel on  points. Hailwood won on  countback. Suzuki \nwere as  dominant in the  50cc class as  the  Yamahas \nwere in the  125s. Hans-Georg Anscheidt just rode \nthe  50  (and won the title again), Stuart Graham and \nYoshimi Katayama doubled up  with the 125  as  well, \nand Graham got to  ride the  new V4  125cc Suzuki at \nthe  Japanese GP. \nAs  usual, the  end-of-season Japanese Grand Prix \nwas awash with rumours of exotic new machinery \nfor the  following year —  a  50cc Suzuki triple, a  six- \ncylinder Honda 500, even a V8  250.

Suzuki followed suit  shortly \nafterwards, but  agreed to  supply Stuart Graham with \na  125  twin for  non-GP events. Hans-Georg Anscheidt \ndid  a  similar deal with Suzuki but  he was given a  50cc \nbike as  well, which he was allowed to  race in the \nWorld Championship —  and that turned out  to  be a \ngood decision, because the  German rider made it a \nhat-trick of titles and then retired from racing. \nNeither Suzuki nor  any  other manufacturer could \nhave lived with Yamaha in the  intensely competitive \n250  class, now most definitely the  race with the  most \ninterest. The V4  Yamahas of Ivy and Read were the \nmost advanced motorcycles in the  paddock and they \ndominated both the 125  and 250 classes, winning \nevery race bar  one. A third Yamaha finished fourth in \nthe 250 class, ridden by Rod Gould (GBR). This was an \nover-the-counter racer, a TD1C -  Yamaha had actually \nbeen producing them since 1962 —  but  it was the \nfirst time one was sent to the  GPs. Gould housed the \n86 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nWith Honda gone Giacomo Agostini \ncruised to two more titles, attention \nfocused on  the civil war at Yamaha \nmotor in a  Bultaco chassis. A factory MZ  prevented a \nYamaha one-two-three in the  250s. \nThe Spanish industry was now taking a serious \ninterest in the smaller classes. Ginger Molloy (NZE) and \nSalvador Canellas (SPA) put  Bultacos on  the  rostrum in \nthe  125  class, while Barry Smith (AUS) and Angel Nieto \ndid  the  same for  Derbi in the  50s. There was also a win \nfor the  Dutch Jamathi bike in the  50s. \nIn the  bigger classes Giacomo Agostini embarked \non  arun of sustained domination by winning every \nrace on  the  350  and 500cc calendar.

Yamaha were so  far ahead of the  competition \nin ‘68  that they could effectively decide who should be \nthe  125  and 250 World Champions. Their decision was \nthat Bill  lvy should win  the  250s and Phil  Read the  125s. \nlvy, very much an  innocent abroad compared to the \ncalculating Read, duly rode shotgun for his team-mate \nuntil the  125  championship was decided. At the  Czech GP, \nhowever, Read announced that he was riding to win  the \n250cc class as  well. This  was more than simple double- \ndealing. Read had  his reasons, prime among them a desire \nto get Yamaha to commit to the  ‘69  season, or  at  least to \ntell  him  whether they would be racing or  not  because it \nwas  strongly rumoured that they would be pulling out  at \nthe end  of the year. When he received no  such assurance \nRead made his announcement. There is also  no  doubt \nThree best results were counted \nNett Gross Pos Rider Nat Machine Nett Gross \n40 (60) 1 Hans-Georg Anscheidt GER Suzuki 24 (30) \n34 2 Paul Lodewijkx NED Jamathi 17 \n15 3 Barry Smith AUS _ Derbi 15 \n12 4 Angel Nieto SPA Derbi 10 \n11 5 Rudi Kunz GER__ Kreidler 6 \n11 5 Chris Walpole GBR Honda 6 \n11 6 Rolf Schmaizle GER Kreidler 6 \n10 7 Les  Griffiths GBR Honda 4 \n8 7 Aalt Toersen NED Kreidler 4 \n6 9 Jan  de Vries NED Kreidler 3 \n8 Ludwig Fassbender GER __ Kreidler 3 \n9 Dave Lock GBR _ Honda 3 \nthat Phil  felt that it was he who had  done the  hard work \ndeveloping the original 250, he who had  won the  first  titles \nfor Yamaha, and  that he should be allowed to  race for \nanother one. The  250  class, don’t forget, was the  one  that \nmattered most. According to  his friend and  biographer Alan \nPeck, Bill  lvy saw  the  world in a  much simpler light. He  simply \ncouldn't imagine reneging on  a deal. \nIt came down to  the  last  race of the  year, at  Monza, \nwhere Read won the  race and  the  title. Both riders were \nprepared to  protest against the  other —  and Ivy did  so  on,  it \nmust be said, trivial grounds which deflected some of the \ncriticism from Read. Peck's book, No  Time to  Lose, records \nthat lvy became much more difficult to  deal with after this \nepisode and  that he really wanted to  quit bike racing. He \ndabbled in cars, where his talent was as  obvious as  it was \non  two wheels. Ivy announced his  retirement from bike \nracing but would, tragically, be tempted back. Phil  Read had \nbeen right about Yamaha, though: they pulled their works \nteam out  of GPs  at the  end  of the  season. \nLEFT Yamaha team-mates \nRead and lvy, not seeing \neye-to-eye as  usual. \n(Elwyn Roberts Collection) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 89 \n\na \nhe exotic multi-cylinder Japanese machines \ndisappeared from the  grids before the  new \nlegislation outlawing them came into force, leaving \na strange-looking assortment of machinery battling \nfor  honours. In the  350 and 500  classes Agostini and \nMV  Agusta again won every race they contested. In \nthe  500s the  Linto, basically two Aermacchi 250cc \ncylinders on  a  common crankcase, was now reliable \nenough to  put the  Hungarian-born Swiss Gyula \nMarkovszky regularly on  the  rostrum, and he took \nsecond place in the  championship. The completely \nhome-made Paton, brainchild of ex-Mondial engineer \nGiuseppe Patoni, was almost as  successful for  Billie \nNelson (GBR), but this was a  one-off motorcycle; it \nwas possible to  buy a  Linto. Ago’s hegemony of the \n350s was threatened by Bill  lvy and the  powerful \nbut fickle V4  Jawa two-stroke, but  that threat was \nsnuffed out  when Little Bill  died at the  Sachsenring. \nIn the  smaller classes, the  titles were really open \nto  anyone who could put together a good season. \nThat turned out  to  be  Kel  Carruthers (AUS) in the \n90 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nLal | ¢ J Au |   VY ( L  D | | } =i (  ‘nd i} ge \n5  SO  AgOStINI \n2 \n\\/ - are laft ta    ctaamroller a \nita IVEiW AUDI LG VI IVE Se a AM JHICT ei: \n. § \ner \ncS \n1    \n@ \n| \nTIC \niS \neS  \ngl \n= \nae \n| \nLah \nae \nteapots \n‘no \nc \nfh \n= ee en eT \n250  class: the  Benelli factory continued to  race their \nfour for one last  season and were rewarded with the \nlast  quarter-litre title to  be won by a four-stroke. The \ntwo-stroke banner was now carried by the  production \nparallel-twin air-cooled Yamahas rather than the \nwater-cooled V4s. Rod Gould got some Yamaha \nfactory parts at  Daytona, Kent Andersson (SWE) took \na  little longer but  still  won races, but  Spanish ace \nSantiago Herrero and the  monocoque-framed single- \ncylinder Ossa were the  surprise contenders. They won \nthree races and led  the  250  class until the  final race. \nIn the  125s, Britain’s Dave Simmonds nursed a \nfragile three-year-old Kawasaki to  eight wins and the \ntitle in front of similarly aged Suzukis. MZ  came up \nwith a  new tandem-twin design that proved fast but \nfragile; they also changed too  many things on  their \n250  twin. The 50cc championship was even closer \nthan the  250.

However, he had  tried car \nracing and  was good at it —  more than good, in fact, \nas  Jackie Stewart, Graham Hill  and  others noted. \nTypically, lvy wanted to  go straight into  Formula 2 and \nneeded to finance his  new career. The  Czech Jawa factory \nhad  a  radical 350cc V4 two-stroke bike  designed by \nZdenek Tichy, no  doubt after careful observation of \nMZ  and  Yamaha's progress. The  two underdogs liked \neach other. \nThe  Jawa was undoubtedly fast  and  powerful but  it \nwas underdeveloped, like  all the  other machines that \nemerged from behind the  Iron  Curtain. The  factory's lack \nof access to  modern ignition, suspension and  carburettors \nwas also  a  major handicap. Nevertheless, Ivy gave Ago \na \nserious \nscare \nat \nHockenheim, \nthen \ntwice \novertook \nhim \nat Assen before the  machine faltered. At the  next event, \nSix  best results were counted \nNett Gross Pos Rider Nat Machine Nett Gross \n90 (144) 1 Angel Nieto SPA Derbi 76 \n59 2 Aalt Toersen NED Kreidler 75 (93) \n51 3 Barry Smith AUS Derbi 69 (73) \n36 4 Jan de Vries NED Kreidler 643) \n338) 5 Paul Lodewijkx NED Jamathi 63 \n29 6 Gilberto Parlotti ITA  Tomos 31 \n27 7 Santiago Herrero SPA Derbi 28 \n26 8 Rudi Kunz GER __ Kreidler 26 \n24 9 Ludwig Fassbender GER Kreidler 25 \n20 10 Martin Mijwaart NED Jamathi 18 \nthe  East German GP,  the Jawa seized in practice and  lvy \nsustained fatal injuries. It was thought he might have \nbeen adjusting his  helmet when the  incident happened so \ndid  not  have time to grab the  clutch lever. \nThere is little doubt that lvy would have been \nsuccessful at car  racing. His few competitive events saw \nhim  racing with big names like  Stewart, Hill,  Jean-Pierre \nBeltoise and  Jochen Rindt —  he was  a  natural on  four \nwheels, just as  he was on  two. Bill  was the  first man to \nlap the  Isle  of Man at over 100mph/161km/h on  a  125 \nand  his  1968 250cc lap record of 105.5mph/169.8km/h \nstood until 1979. \nThe  V4  continued to  race but  never again showed the \nform it had  in Bill  lvy’s hands, and  those of veteran factory \nrider Frantisek Stastny who had won four GPs for Jawa, \nthree in the  350  class and  one in the  500s, earlier in his \nlong career. Versatile Italian Silvio Grassetti did  win  the \nfinal race of ‘69  on  it, in Yugoslavia, but  the  MV  team did \nnot  enter that event. \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK \n93 \n\nhere was still  no  coherent challenge to  Giacomo \nAgostini and the  MV  Agusta in the  500cc class \nin  1970. Nevertheless, Count Agusta saw fit to field \na second bike for Angelo Bergamonti from Monza \nonwards. There wasn’t enough time for the  Italian \nto  secure second in the  championship, but when Ago \ndid  not  attend the  final race of the year, at  Montjuich, \n‘Berga’ won both 350  and 500 races in record time and \nwith two new lap records to  his  name. Ago himself \nwon every race he contested, in both classes. It is \nworth noting, however, that despite the  lack of serious \nopposition the  MV  was continually refined —  perfected \nmight be a  better adjective —  and race and lap records \nwere often broken. Giacomo Agostini never did \ncomplacency, as  anyone who worked with or  for  him \nwill  readily testify. \nKawasaki sold a  run  of 40  H1R racers based on \ntheir three-cylinder road-bike engine. Experienced \nprivateer Ginger Molloy traded in his  Bultaco for one \nand made it on  to the  rostrum four times. This was in \nno  small part due to the  Kiwi rider’s abilities as  a tuner \n94 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nand mechanic, talents a  privateer needed if he were to \nmake a living, and he duly finished second in the  500cc \nchampionship table. \nIn the  350  class Ago had to cope with real pressure \nfrom Benelli riders Kel  Carruthers and Renzo Pasolini, \nand also Rod Gould on  a Yamaha. Gould and Kent \nAndersson were officially employed by Yamaha (unlike \nthe  previous season, when there was no  ‘works’ team). In \nwhat was now a familiar pattern, they rode development \nbikes that would form the  basis of the  B-model TR2 \nand TD2 that would be sold for the  ‘71  season. The TD2 \ninstantly turned the  250  class into a Yamaha benefit. \nOnly the  mercurial Spaniard Santiago Herrero and the \nremarkable Ossa single looked like  stemming the  tide, \nbut  a crash at the  Isle  of Man TT,  probably on  melting \ntar,  ended his  life. \nIn the 125s the  big German Dieter Braun and an \naging Suzuki somehow saw off  Nieto and the  Derbi, but \nthe  Spaniard made no  mistake in the  50s, retaining his \ntitle, again with Aalt Toersen in second, although the \nDutchman had abandoned Kreidler in favour of Jamathi. \nABOVE ABOVE Angel \nNieto, the  greatest ever \n50/125cc racer, retained his \n50cc title with the factory \nDerbi.

Chief among these were the Yamaha TD2 \nand  TR2 250  and  the  350cc air-cooled twins that could \ntrace their ancestry directly to the YR2 roadster. These \nbikes would lead directly to the  water-cooled TZs, and \nin both guises these Yamahas would be the  mainstay of \nprivateer racers for two decades.

This  was  a  home-built machine, \nthe  brainchild of two engineers, Jan  Thiel and  Martin \nMijwaart. The  50cc (later 80cc) class would continue to \nprovide a  home for this  sort  of enterprise, but the Jamathi \nis one  of a very small number of such ‘home-made’ bikes \nto  have won a  GP. \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 97 \n\nhere were some signs that the  established \norder was about to change. Giacomo Agostini \nand  the  MV  still  ruled the  500cc class, but the  old \nthree-cylinder design was at the end  of its life and  a \nfour was debuted at Monza by Alberto Pagani (son \nof Nello). Ago rode triples in the  350  and 500  classes \nand both had breakdowns -a   totally unprecedented \noccurrence. Pagani was drafted into the  MV team \nafter Angelo Bergamonti was killed in an  Italian \nChampionship race. Agostini won the first eight races \nof the  season on  the  bounce, and out  of the  remaining \nthree rounds only raced at Monza. That let in Jack \nFindlay (Suzuki) and Dave Simmonds (Kawasaki) to \ntake the first two-stroke wins in the  500cc class. MV's \nhonour was almost salvaged by Pagani’s win  at Monza. \nFindlay rode a TR500 supplied by the  Italian \nimporter, while Rob Bron (NED) and Keith Turner (NZE) \ngot semi-works Suzukis through similar arrangements. \nSimmonds took over Ginger Molloy’s Kawasaki H1R \nbut  housed it in a frame built by Reynolds’ legend of \nthe  welding torch, Ken Sprayson. \n98 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nAgostini’s majestic progress to  another 350  title \nwas interrupted only by mechanical failures, although \nthere was a warning of what was to come. Jarno \nSaarinen received 250  and 350  Yamahas through the \nFinnish importer and won races on  both. He  also set \na  new lap record at his home 250cc race. It is worth \nremembering, though, that despite being second in \nthe  350 race, Jarno was almost lapped by Ago! Apart \nfrom the  MV, the  250  and 350  classes were now \ntotally dominated by Yamahas, although MZ’s Silvio \nGrassetti managed two wins in the  250  class and \nPeter Williams (GBR) won a wet 350cc Ulster race. \nAnother youngster burst on  the  scene in the  125 \nclass.

Rod Gould rode the factory’s \ndevelopment bike, which formed the  basis for the  1972 \nTD3 and  TR3 models. After the  1968 bust-up with Bill \nlvy and  the factory over team orders Phil  Read was never \ngoing to  be one  of the  favoured few, so  he  bought his \nown Yamahas. With the  remarkable German engineer \nand  sidecar champion Helmut Fath tuning the  engines, \naided by Ferry Brouwer (later to  become the  European \ndistributor for Arai helmets), and  a  lightweight Reynolds \nframe, Read was  able to win  the  title  for the first  time \nsince '68, defeating the  factory men in the  process. \nPhil's bikes also  featured electronic ignition, which would \nquickly become a standard modification, and  a six-speed \nQuaife gearbox, dry clutch and  disc  brakes. Most of these \nmodifications anticipated the  ‘72  customer bikes’ features, \nbut  Read’s 250cc World Championship in  1971 was a true \nprivateer victory, albeit a well-financed one. \nSeven best results were counted \nNett Gross Pos Rider Nat Machine \n90 1 Phil Read GBR Yamaha \n63 2 Rod Gould GBR Yamaha \n39 3 Jarno Saarinen FIN Yamaha \n36 4 John Dodds AUS Yamaha \n34 5 Dieter Braun GER Yamaha \n33 6 Gyula Marsovszky SWI Yamaha \n30 7 Silvio Grassetti ITA MZ \n29 8 Chas Mortimer GBR Yamaha \n25 9  = Janos Drapal HUN Yamaha \n25 10 Theo Bult NED Yamaha \nNett Gross \n73 \n68 \n64 (67) \n57.

They provided the \nbasis for any  good rider to  prepare a  machine capable of \nwinning a  Grand Prix.  On  the  other side  of the  paddock, \nthe  company that led the  two-stroke-revolution, MZ, won \ntheir last  GP.  The  East German authorities were more \ninterested in motocross and  enduro, disciplines in which \nthey could win  not  just the  occasional race but world \ntitles. Events after the  East German 250cc GP  probably \nalso contributed. The  race was won by West German rider \nDieter Braun, which entailed the  playing of the  German \nanthem ‘Deutschland Uber alles’. The  massive crowd, \nhundreds of thousands of them, was  going wild. In his \nbiography Giacomo Agostini says hundreds of police \nemerged from under the  grandstand and  lined up facing \nthe  crowd with sub-machine guns. Silence fell.  The  East \nGerman GP  only ran  for one  more year. \nNone of which should detract from the  memory of the \ngenius of Walter Kaaden, a  man respected and  admired \nby every rider, German or  foreigner, who rode for  MZ. \nNett Gross \n5 OU) \n69  = (89) \n41 (45) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 104 \n\niacomo Agostini and MV  Agusta yet again \ndominated the  500 class, although there \nwas considerable pressure on  them in the 350s. \nAgo and team-mate Alberto Pagani won all the \n500 GPs they contested (Pagani won in Yugoslavia \nwhen Ago stopped). They didn’t bother going \nto the  last  round of the  year in Spain and Chas \nMortimer (GBR) won on  an  over-bored 350 \nYamaha. TZs  wouldn't be available until the \nfollowing year but  plenty of water-cooled pre- \nproduction models got to  GPs in the  hands of \nfactory-supported riders. Mortimer even tested \nhis  before the start of the season; his  bike \nwas assembled at Yamaha’s Dutch HQ by \nFerry Brouwer. \nThe Yamaha that really gave Ago trouble \nwas the  350  of Jarno Saarinen. MV  had seen \nthe  trouble coming and developed a  new four- \ncylinder 350, which they ran  alongside the  old \ntriple through the  ‘72  season. MV’s 500-four \ndidn’t appear until the  following year. Phil \n102 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nRead was recruited by MV  but  only rode in the \n350 class. Yamaha supported four other riders \nthrough various importers, as  well as  Saarinen and \nMortimer, but the  250 class was a fight between \nSaarinen and Italian Renzo Pasolini on  the  new \ntwo-stroke Aermacchi. The 125  class was won by \nAngel Nieto (Derbi) from the  factory Yamahas of \nMortimer and Kent Andersson (SWE), who was \ngiven free rein to  develop the  bike over the  next \ncouple of years. The story of the  class might have \nbeen very different but  for the  death of Gilberto \nParlotti on  the  Isle  of Man. \nThe real drama came in the 50s, where Nieto \nand his  great rival Jan  de Vries finished equal \non  points and couldn't be split on  countback. \nThe rules stated that the  title be decided on  the \naggregate time of the  races in which they both \nfinished, so  Nieto won the  title by 21.32 seconds. \nThe Derbi factory then quit racing, only returning \nin  1984 when they had another Spanish hero as \ntheir rider, Jorge ‘Aspar’ Martinez. \nABOVE Jarno Saarinen \nwon his  only world title \non  the Finnish importer’s \nYamaha 250.

The  Spaniard came back \nwith wins in Austria and Italy, but  Parlotti was on  the \nrostrum both times. This was shaping up to  be a tight \nchampionship; but  the  next round was at the  Isle  of \nMan TT. \nIn the  wake of the  death of Santiago Herrero, riding \nan  Ossa on  the  Mountain circuit two years earlier, the \nSpanish Federation had  banned its riders from competing \nin the TT and  saw no  reason to  alter their ruling. Parlotti \nfelt this was a way of taking an  advantage and  entered \nagainst the  advice of the  Morbidelli factory, seeking \nguidance from his good friend, Giacomo Agostini. Ago \neven took him  for a  lap in his car  the  night before the \nrace. The  weather was filthy and  Parlotti crashed at \nthe  Veranda, a succession of high-speed lefts high on \nSnaefell, \nwhile \nleading \non \nthe \nsecond \nlap. \nThere \nwas, \nof \ncourse, \nno \nrun-off. \nAgo \nwas \npreparing \nfor \nthe \nSenior \nTT \n(the  500  race) when news of the  fatal accident came \nthrough. He  raced, and  won, that afternoon but  had \nalready decided not  to  return to the  TT. \nBarry Sheene had  made his feelings known in  1971, \nthe  only year he raced on  the  Island, and  now Agostini \nwas backed up  by Count Agusta, Phil  Read, Rod  Gould \nand  most of the  top  GP  men —  although Read was \ntempted back for the TT  F1  series that was initially \ncreated as  a one-race World Championship in  1978 and \nthen extended to —  mainly —  roads circuits. (Technical \nregulations were not  unlike those for the  new MotoGP2 \nclass.) F1  survived for a couple of years after the  advent of \nthe World Superbike Championship in  1988. \nThe  Isle of Man TT continued as  the  UK's Grand Prix \nuntil 1976, but  the  factories never went back. Many of \nthe  one-hit wonders in the  record books won their sole \nGP  on  the  Isle of Man circuit against less  than stellar \nopposition, although that is not  a charge that can  only \nbe  levelled at the  TT:  there was still  no  compulsion to \ncompete in every round of the World Championship, so \nend-of-season races at tracks like  Imatra and  Montjuich \nwere often undersubscribed. \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 105 \n\nhil  Read won the  first of his two 500cc titles on \nan  MV -  despite the  fact that he was team-mate \nto the  great Agostini. The British rider was never a \nman to take too much notice of team orders, so  it \nis safe to  assume that MV, having had a  look at  him \non  their 350 the  previous season, put  him on  the  500 \nto  keep their multiple World Champion honest, just \nas  they’d done when employing Angelo Bergamonti \ntwo years earlier. However, for the  first time since \n1965, Giacomo Agostini did  not become 500cc World \nChampion. He failed to finish the  first four races of the \nyear, won three of the  final six,  but  Read took four \nvictories to  become the  oldest rider to  win the  500cc \nworld title since Les  Graham in  1949. \nAll  of these MV  victories might have been irrelevant \nbut  for the  events of 20  May at  Monza and the \naccident that killed Jarno Saarinen and Renzo Pasolini. \nThe Finn had been 250cc World Champion in  1972, and \nwas now racing in 500s too, on  the  new four-cylinder \nacross-the-frame Yamaha. He won the  first two races \non  it, and was leading the third, at  Hockenheim, \n106 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nwhen his chain broke. Then came Monza. \nThe next two rounds were the  Isle  of Man TT  and \nthe  Yugoslavian GP  at the  equally fearsome Opatija \ncircuit, neither contested by the  factory teams, so \nit wasn’t until Assen that the  championship really \ngot going again after a three-race hiatus. Ago was \nstronger on  the  run-in, but  Read was able to  protect \nhis  lead. The biggest surprise of the  season was \nthe  race win in Yugoslavia, and second place in the \nchampionship, for  New Zealander Kim Newcombe on \nthe  Konig, a  bike he’d help develop while working \nas  an  engineer for the  eponymous West German \noutboard motor company, using one of their flat-four \ntwo-strokes mated to  Manx Norton transmission parts. \nNewcombe died at a  non-championship race at \nSilverstone, and racing lost a man who could have \ntaken the  two-stroke challenge to  MV. In 2006 a film \nentitled Love, Speed & Loss was released. Narrated by \nKim's widow, Jeneen. It is worth seeing not  just for \nthe \ninsight \nit \ngives \ninto \nracing \n35 \nyears \nago \nbut \nas \na \nrecord of a  remarkable privateer achievement. \nABOVE Phil Read, MV's \nlast  500cc champion. \nUARROTTS.com) \nRIGHT It looked \nagricultural but it was \neffective.

What caused it? Was it Walter Villa’s \nBenelli leaking oil during the  closing laps of the  350  race, \nas  the  Italian toured round to try and  pick up a point? \nAustralian John Dodds thought so  and  tried to tell  the \norganisers. He was threatened with expulsion from the \nrace and  the  police were called to eject him  from Race \nControl. The  French journalist Christian Lacombe suffered \nsimilar treatment when he tried to  get  marshals to  show \nan  oil flag. \nPasolini arrived at the  corner first  and  fell.  His  bike \nthen bounced back off the  Armco that closely bordered \nthe  track, right into Saarinen’s path. Both men died on \nthe  spot. The  German journalist Volker Rauch collected \nstatements from Hideo Kanaya, Dieter Braun, Borje \nJansson, Kent Andersson and  others who all stated \ncategorically that  there was  oil on  the  track. \nThe  Italian inquiry decided that  the  accident was \ncaused by Pasolini’s bike seizing.

However, a  crash in Sweden due to water \nleaking from Barry Sheene’s Suzuki effectively \ntorpedoed the  Italian’s chances of the  500  title, \nalthough Ago still  believes that but  for this  crash and \nhis  ensuing broken shoulder he would have won the \n500  championship in his first season on  a two-stroke. \n(He didn’t have to wait too  long: the  following year \nsaw him claim victory.) Compensation in  1974 came \nin the  form of the  350  title, Yamaha’s first in the \nclass, on  the  magnesium-engined TZ  ridden by Tepi \nLansivuori the  previous year. The Finn stayed on  as \nAgo’s team-mate in both the  350 and 500 classes. \nRead did  race the  350  MV  in the  first few GPs  but \n110 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nsuffered mechanical problems and it was parked for \nthe  rest  of the  year. \nYamaha did  not  defend the  250  title with a factory \neffort and their customer racers were beaten by \nWalter Villa on  the  factory Harley Davidson. Phil Read \nbecame MV's lead rider and marched to the  500  title \nwith the help of Gianfranco Bonera (ITA) and the \nfour-cylinder MV. \nThe most significant event of the year was the \nappearance of a  brand-new 500cc Suzuki in the  hands \nof Barry Sheene and Australian Jack Findlay. The RG500 \nwas a square-four disc-valve two-stroke in which the \nDNA of Walter Kaaden’s work at MZ  could clearly be \ndetected. The bike was fast but fragile; nevertheless, \nSheene put  it on  the  rostrum first time out. \nPerhaps there was another candidate for event of \nthe  year: in the  250  class at Assen a young American \nYamaha rider called Kenny Roberts made his Grand \nPrix debut. He  set  pole position and fastest lap before \nfinishing third behind Villa and Bruno Kneubuhler \n(SWI, Yamaha). \nABOVE Jack Findlay (AUS) \non  the Suzuki RG500 at \nthe French GP,  the first \nrace outing for the new \nwater-cooled square-four \n500 two-stroke.

Between them, and  in the \nlast  years Fiorenzo Fanali, they understood every tiny \nnuance of their bikes’ behaviour.

The four-stroke rearguard \nwas led  by defending champion Phil  Read, riding as \nwell as  ever on  the  MV.

However, they needed the  help of the  points- \nscoring system to  overcome the  reliability of the  MV. Read \nonly failed to score once, in Finland, thanks to an  engine \nfailure, while Ago was stopped by seizures in Austria \nand Belgium (he also had  a  DNF in Sweden thanks to  a \npuncture). The  Suzuki, in its second year, was still  prone to \nmisfires and  niggling vibration-induced failures, yet such \nwas the  pace of development that the  factory supplied \nmost of the  grid with RGs  the following season. Yamaha's \nTZ250/350C did  the  same for their classes. \nHere was the  triumph of mass production over \nthe  hand-built MVs that had  relied on  knowledge \naccumulated by a  handful of dedicated technicians over \nmany years to extract the  best from their aging design. \nThis mirrored the  road-bike sector. It is no  surprise that \nHonda \ncould \nbuild \na \nmulti-cylinder \nDOHC \n750cc \nengine \ngiven \ntheir \nracing \nhistory; \nthe \nreally \nclever \nthing \nwas \nthat \nFive best results were counted \nthey could mass produce it on  an  industrial scale far \ngreater than MV, Benelli or  Gilera could dream of. \nThe first company to score points and get on  the \nrostrum with a stroker was DKW in the  mid-1950s. In the \nlater part of the  decade MZ  appeared from the  other side \nof the  Berlin Wall, getting their first rostrum and  victory in \n1958 (in the 125  and 250 classes, respectively). After lead \nrider Ernst Degner defected and  went to  Suzuki he won \nthe  first two-stroke title, the  50cc World Championship, in \n1962. New Zealand racer Hugh Anderson won Suzuki the \n125  title  in  1963, and  a year later Phil  Read and  Yamaha \ntook the  first  quarter-litre crown with a two-stroke. \nHonda and MV  then fought a four-stroke rearguard in the \n350 and 500cc classes for the  best part of a  decade, until \nGiacomo Agostini left  MV  for Yamaha and  promptly won \nthe  1974 350cc championship. One more season and  the \ntwo-strokes had  triumphed. They would be unbeatable. \nIt took the  biggest change ever in Grand Prix  regulations, \nthe  advent of MotoGP in 2002, to enable a four-stroke to \nwin  again. \nNett Gross \n75 (114) \n61 (79) \n43 \nBi (39) \n31 \nSh \n28 \n21 \n20 \n16 \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 117 \n\nweenie ibe SAA IOPR, \nhis was  the year when Barry Sheene transcended \nhis celebrity status and over-the-counter bikes led \nthe way. Sheene won his and Suzuki's first title with \nthree races to spare and declined to  race in Finland, \nCzechoslovakia and  West Germany for financial \nreasons. There really was only one other true works \nmotorcycle on  the  grid, an  MV Agusta, and  then only \nfor three races. It was in the  hands of Giacomo Agostini, \nreunited with the  Italian factory out  of necessity. After \nthe second race of the year he did what nearly all the \nfield had  done and switched to Suzuki, albeit returning \nto  MV to win  the final race of the year. \nThe Suzuki factory had  manufactured a  batch \nof RG500s and every ambitious privateer had one. \nFactory efforts were then scaled back, as  they put \nresources into development of the  GS street-bike \nrange, but three special RGs  with a new bore and \nstroke, the  classic 54x54mm, went to the  UK  for \nthe  importer, Heron, to  run  their own team with \nsponsorship from Texaco and Forward Trust.

The two Johns rode the \nprevious year’s bikes, with about 5kg (11lb) rnore \nweight and a  narrower power band. \nYamaha did  not  field an  official team, but Johnny \nCecotto got hold of Agostini’s bikes from the  previous \nyear and  finished second in the first race only three \nseconds behind Sheene. However, the  Yamaha was no \nlonger competitive and after too  many crashes caused \nby over-riding the  Venezuelan parked the  500  and \nconcentrated on  the  350cc class. \nThe impact of the  Suzuki customer bikes can  be \ngauged from a  look at the final points table. The  top \n12 were all  on  Suzukis —  although Ago, in seventh, had \nof course raced an  MV  as  well. The first non-Suzuki \nrider was Tom Herron, in  13th, and 15 of his  17  points \ncame from the TT,  an  event that was again boycotted \nby the top  riders. Herron (GBR) was given a  race on \nWilliams's Heron Suzuki in Finland but failed to finish \n—so maybe the top  non-Suzuki rider was actually the \nAustrian Yamaha privateer Karl Auer in  14th! \nPelt gna \na a rT OTE Ee \nABOVE Sheene crosses \nthe line in  Sweden \nto  become World \nChampion for the  first \ntime.

At the final \nround of the  500cc championship, held on  the  old \nNtirburgring, he  used both bikes in practice but  the  MV \nfor the  race. Ago admitted to  some ‘sleight of hand’ in \nthis  matter, but  he made the  choice because the four- \nstroke suited the  track and  conditions better —  not, as \nthe  romantics would have us  believe, because of the \nfans’ reaction to the  MV. Ago led  from the  start but \nreally pulled away when the  rain  came. He  had  over a \nminute over the  rest  going into  the  last  lap and  won by \n52  seconds. The MV, a  bike developed for and around \nAgo, made its power more predictably and was easier to \nuse  around the  ‘Ring in good conditions than the  disc \nvalve Suzukis, never mind in the  wet. The victory was a \ntriumph of experience and  Ago’s legendary attention to \ndetail, and  it is remembered not  just because it was  the \nfinal four-stroke win  in the  top class until the  advent of \nMotoGP, but  also  because it was  the  last  of Agostini’s 122 \nGrand Prix  wins. However, it should be noted that it was \nachieved in the  absence of Barry Sheene, who had  already \nwrapped up the  title. \nFor  \na  \nreal  \nswansong \ngo  \nback \nto \nthe  \n350 \nrace \nat \nAssen. \nAgo \ncampaigned \nthe \nsmaller \nMV \nthroughout \nthe \nseason, \nafter \ntwo \nyears \non \nTZ350s, \nagainst \na field \nof \nstrokers \nincluding \nthe \nYamahas \nof \nCecotto, \nTakazumi \nKatayama \n<a \nwo Soni Pi INO) Oy \nNett Gross Pos Rider Nat Machine Nett Gross \n/OmmEO 1 Walter Villa ITA Harley Davidson 90 117 \n65 2 ~=Takazumi Katayama JPN Yamaha isiger \n54 3 Gianfranco Bonera ITA Harley Davidson 61 77 \n41 45 4 Tom Herron GBR Yamaha 47 52 \n34 5 Pentti Korhonen FIN Yamaha 47 55 \n29 eS 2 6 Dieter Braun GER Yamaha 42 50 \n28 29 7 Chas Mortimer GBR Yamaha 31 \n2350 8 Bruno Kneubuhler SWI Yamaha 29 \nAy} 9 Olivier Chevallier FRA Yamaha 25 \nD7, 10 Victor Palomo SPA Yamaha 25 28 \nNett Gross Pos Rider Nat Machine Nett Gross \nS005 1 Angel Nieto SPA _Bultaco SSmeo \n67 2 Herbert Rittberger GER Kreidler 16 oa? \n64/4 3 Ulrich Graf SWI Kreidler 69 ~=80 \n46 4 Eugenio Lazzarini ITA = Morbidelli 530761 \n32 5 Rudolf Kunz GER __ Kreidler 34 86039 \n27 31 6 Julien van Zeebroeck BEL Kreidler 26 \n26 7  ~~ Stefan Dorflinger SWI Kreidler 25 \n25 8 Rolf Blatter SWI Kreidler 25 26 \n23 9 Hans Hummel AUT Kreidler 20 Zs \n18 10 Pierre Audry FRA  ABF 15 \nand  Chas Mortimer, the  Morbidelli of Dieter Braun and \nthe  Harley Davidsons of eventual (double) champion \nWalter Villa and Gianfranco Bonera.

Many would argue \nthat this  was a greater achievement than his win  at the \nNurburgring later in the year. \nGIACOMO AGOSTINI STATISTICS \n®  His total of 15 world titles is better than any  other rider, Angel Nieto (13)  being the \nnext most successful \n122  GP victories —  the  most successful racer of all time \n8 premier-class titles; Valentino Rossi, with 6, is the  next most successful \n7 350cc titles, beating Jim  Redman (4) \n68  race wins in the  premier class —  only Rossi has won more \n54  race wins in the  350cc class —  more than any  other rider \nOnly rider to win  500cc GP  races and  the  500  title  on  both two-stroke and \nfour-stroke machines \nOnly rider to win  the  350cc title  on  two-stroke and  four-stroke bikes \nLast rider to win  both a  500cc GP  and  a 350cc GP  on  a four-stroke \nLast rider to win  a  350cc world title on  a four-stroke \nFirst rider to win both the  350cc and 500cc titles on  a two-stroke \nAchieved a  perfect season of  10  500cc GP wins from 10  races in  1968 \nIn  1970 he won 19  GP  races (10 x 500cc, 9 x 350cc) to share the  record \nfor  most GP wins in a single season with Mike Hailwood \n20 successive 500cc GP  race  victories during the  1968 and  ‘69  seasons —  an  all-time record \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 1214 \n\narry Sheene retained his  500cc title \ncomfortably and, despite Yamaha fielding \na  new generation straight four without reed \nvalves, he was never beaten by one in a direct \nfight. Indeed, the  World Champion was very \nrarely beaten at all.  Sheene and his Suzuki won \nsix out  of the  nine races in which they competed, \nboycotting the  Austrian event along with the \nother big names. He was beaten by Wil  Hartog \n(NED, Suzuki) in Holland, and finished down the \nfield in Finland when his  motor overheated, but \nthat was enough to  win the title so  Barry didn’t \ngo to  Czechoslovakia. Then overheating stopped \nhim again at Silverstone, now the  venue for the \nBritish round. \nYamaha fielded Johnny Cecotto, Steve Baker \n(USA) and Giacomo Agostini on  their new bikes. \nThe American newcomer was the  most impressive \nof the  trio, and although he didn’t win a  race he \nfinished second overall.

There has  never \nbeen a faster World Championship race. It was held on \nthe  8.75-mile (14.12-km) version of the  circuit that was \nshrunk to a 4.32-mile (6.95-km) track two  years later. | \nFor  comparison, in 2008 the  fastest MotoGP race of \\! \nthe  year was at  Phillip Island, with Casey Stoner (AUS, \nDucati) winning at  109.36mph (176.00km/h). \nSpa was the  last  of the  old-style road circuits, laid  out \nin the  days when engine technology was giving riders \nplenty of horsepower but  chassis, brakes and  tyres had \nhardly moved on  from the  pioneer days. Look at  maps \nof tracks like  the  Sachsenring, parts of the  old  Brno \nroad circuit, Dundrod (home of the  Ulster GP), Monza \nbefore the  chicanes, and  even the  Isle  of Man Mountain \ncircuit. What they have in common is fast, long straights \nand  sweeping or  interlinked corners that don’t require \nmuch in the way of braking. In the  late  1970s Spa- \nFrancorchamps still  had  the  Masta straight at the  highest \npart of the  course, with its  130mph (209km/h) kink. The \nonly place riders dropped below 100mph was for the \nLa Source hairpin that ended the  lap.  Eugenio Lazzarini \n(ITA, Kreidler) won the  50cc race earlier in the  day at \nover 102mph (164km/h), which gives a  pretty good \nindication of what was required to win  at the  old  Spa. \nThis  was not  a trouble-free race for Sheene. His  rev- \ncounter bracket was repaired with duct tape after the \nwarm-up lap, and in the  early laps he was involved in a \nsix-man group and  after that in a  lap-record-shattering \ndice with Michel Rougerie (FRA, Suzuki). On  the  very last \nlap fuel  starvation nearly stopped Barry —  he was down \nto  60mph (97km/h) at one  point —  but  he still  won by \nten  seconds from Steve Baker. \nLd tae ;  x Ys ; \nSe ae $n ee \nmT   a hat 4 ign  iG \nRIGHT The start of the \nfastest race in  Grand \nPrix history, the 1977 \nBelgian 500cc race at \nSpa-Francorchamps. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 125 \n\n: @ \\way ,  @ ] \ndhs \nFW \nfLe \nee \n) \nff \n; \net \n| \nhis was  the  year when Yamaha finally got  it \nright. The OW35 got the  power-valve variable- \nheight exhaust-port system, and American Kenny \nRoberts was brought in to  partner Johnny Cecotto and \nTakazumi Katayama on  the  factory bikes, although \nthey all  ran  in different colours. Actually, Kenny's team \nwasn’t really a full  works effort -  the  other riders \ngot  parts first -  so  the  Yamaha America effort would \nprobably be called a  ‘satellite’ team today. Roberts \nwas the  only rider to  use  Goodyear tyres, which is \nnormally a handicap in this  situation, and he also had \njust one bike. No-one dreamt he could win  the title \nat  his first attempt, but  Kenny put together three \nback-to-back wins in the  first half of the  season, along \nthe way dealing mortal psychological blows to the \nopposition. \nSuzuki also had a  new bike, the  XR22 stepped- \ncylinder version of the  RG500, with the  rear pair \nof cylinders higher than the  front. Barry Sheene \nand Pat  Hennen were retained in the  Heron team, \nwhile the  Italian importer ran  Steve Baker who had, \n126 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nlaArre \nnoperts \nunaccountably, not  been re-signed by Yamaha. When \nHennen suffered career-ending injuries at the  Isle  of \nMan TT,  right after setting the  first sub-20-minute lap, \nWil  Hartog and later Michel Rougerie were drafted in \nto try and take points off  Roberts. For the  last  race of \nthe  year Virginio Ferrari (ITA) also got an  XR22, to  help \nSuzuki take the  Manufacturers’ Championship. \nSheene was off-colour up  until Assen, blaming a \nvirus picked up  in Venezuela. \nIn the  250  and 350cc classes Kork Ballington did \nthe  double on  the  almost unbeatable Kawasaki. In \nthe  350s Ballington or  his team-mate Gregg Hansford \n(AUS) won all  but  two races, and in the 250s they won \nall except four. However, one of those races was won \nby another Kawasaki rider, Anton Mang (GER), and \nthe two victories went to  Kenny Roberts, who quit the \nclass after six rounds because, he claimed, of Yamaha's \nindifference. The turning point was Spa, where the \nbike broke, at which point the  American was  just \nthree points behind Ballington and  two in front \nof Hansford. \n’ n nery TIV \nCAG EMA tiota Tl iy \nABOVE Sheene, Roberts \nand Cecotto —  the big \nthree of ‘78.

He  has  been \na champion as  both rider and  team owner, a  unique \nachievement in itself, but  he has  also been a  constructor. \nAlong the  way he has  been credited with everything from \nbeing the  first racer to  get  his knee down, the  first  to \nadopt the  hang-off riding style, and  the  first  deliberately \nto  use  rear-wheel steering. He  didn’t actually do  any  of \nthese first, but  he did  completely revolutionise the  way in \nwhich motorcycle racers were treated and  GPs  were run. \nIt was also very obvious that he didn’t care whom \nhe  upset. He was a  central player in the  World Series \nscheme that threatened to  break motorcycle racing away \nfrom FIM  control. The  plans never came to fruition, but \nthe  shock waves the  idea generated hastened the  end \nof races on  deadly circuits and  the  exploitation of riders \nby greedy organisers. Roberts clearly saw the  Catch 22 \nsituation: every racer wants to  be the  best and  that means \nbeing World Champion. However, to  be a champion riders \nhad  to subject themselves to  humiliation at the  hands of \norganisers, and  at tracks where capital punishment was \nthe  reward for a  mistake on  a  motorcycle. Kenny did  not \nlike  this, so  he did  something about it. \nFor  the  record, Kenny says it was by watching Jarno \nSaarinen (at Ontario in  1973) that he figured out  that \nshifting his weight around would help him  in corners. As \nfor  rear-wheel steering, Roberts says he learned from a \nGoodyear contact that American ace  Cal  Rayborn set  his \nbikes up to  push the  front in slow corners and  slide the \nrear  in fast  ones. That’s what Kenny did  in the  States, and \nthat’s what he  brought to  Europe. \nRIGHT Under the \nbubble with both \nwheels well off  the \nground: Roberts \nat  the Finnish GP. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 129 \n\nKenny Roberts retained his \ntitle despite injury and reduced \ni enny Roberts defended his title with a motorcycle \nthat was, to all  intents and purposes, the same \nas the  one on  which he’d ended the  1978 season. The \nOW45 did  have a new design of power valve and  the \nonly serious weakness —  rear suspension that ran  out \nof damping half-way through a race —  was addressed. \nRoberts had a  horrible crash while testing in Japan that \nresulted in him missing the first race while he recovered \nfrom back injury and an  operation to  remove his spleen. \nThe only other OW45 went to Cecotto, but a broken \nknee at the second round put the Venezuelan out \nuntil Assen. \nSuzuki gave three works bikes to the  Heron team for \nBarry Sheene, the  recalled Steve Parrish, and experienced \nprivateer and  TT ace  Tom Herron. The Ulsterman would \nbecome the first Suzuki factory rider to  be killed when \nhe crashed at the  non-championship North West 200. \nThere were also factory bikes for Wil  Hartog and Virginio \nFerrari. All the top  privateers were once more on  RG500 \nSuzukis, and  for the first time one  of them won a race: \nBoet van Dulmen (NED) triumphed in Finland. \n130 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nsupport from Yamaha \nDespite his injuries and the  lack of support, Roberts \nwas able to win  the  second race of the year and  then \nthree of the  next four races to establish a slim lead \nover Virginio Ferrari. Kenny’s final win  of the season \ncame after an  epic dice with Sheene on  the  old  high- \nspeed Silverstone. Fortunately, the  BBC filmed it and \nit still  crops up on  the sort of programme that has \n‘Greatest’ in its title. The  American won by a wheel \nafter Sheene was baulked by George Fogarty (Carl's \ndad) on  the  penultimate lap:  Barry tried to  ride round \nthe  outside of Roberts and set  a  new lap record, but  it \nwasn’t enough. Team members will  still  tell you it was \nSheene’s best ride  for Suzuki. \nThere were no  team orders imposed at Suzuki —  it \nwould have been difficult, as  their top  men rode for \ndifferent teams —  and their chances were blunted by \ninjury to  Hartog and two breakdowns for  Ferrari in \nthe Scandinavian races. The title was decided at the \nlast  round, when Ferrari crashed trying to  make up \nground after running off track while disputing the \nlead with Sheene. \nABOVE Roberts and the \nYamaha on  the gas  at \nAssen, in the colours of \nthe American importer. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nRIGHT Mr  Soichiro \nHonda himself came to \nSilverstone to  support his \nteam’s re-entry into GPs. \n(Henk Keulemans) \n\nTHE \n41979 \nSEASON \nCee \nEse \nPe \nseess \nVEN/San Carlos \n@ Barry Sheene took victory in \nthe  season's opening race for \nthe fourth successive year \nl@ Kenny Roberts didn’t go to \nVenezuela because of injuries \nreceived in a testing crash in \nJapan \nBEL/Spa-Francorchamps \n@ Dennis Ireland (NZE, Suzuki) \nwon a race boycotted by \nthe  leading riders on  safety \ngrounds, specifically the slippy \nnature of newly laid track \nFIN/Imatra \n@ Dutchman Boet van Dulmen \ntook his one and only GP \nvictory, riding a Suzuki \n@ Randy Mamola (USA, Suzuki) \nfinished second in only his \nthird start in the  500cc class \nto  become the youngest rider \nto stand on  the  podium in \nthe  premier class —  a  record \nhe still  holds \nGBR/Silverstone \nB Kenny Roberts and Barry \nSheene battled all the way \nto the finish and  were \nseparated by just 0.03s as \nthey crossed the  line.

The  NR500 was, without a doubt, the  most \nradical motorcycle ever built, the  result of giving young \nengineers a blank sheet of paper. Why? Mr  Honda really \ndidn’t like two-strokes. \nBut  how could they achieve enough power to  be \ncompetitive with the  strokers? The  answer was frankly \noutrageous: regulations demanded no  more than four \ncylinders so  Honda effectively built a V8,  then siamesed \nthe  bores. Each oval piston had  two connecting rods, \neach cylinder eight valves and  two spark plugs. The \ncycle parts were just as  advanced. Yamaha were still \nrunning their straight four, Suzuki a square four. The \nframe was an  aluminium monocoque at a time when \nsteel tubes were still  the  norm. The  forks were outer \nupper tube (upside down), with 16-inch wheels and \nrear  suspension rising-rate linkage years before they \nbecame the  norm; Sheene’s Suzuki still  used twin rear \nshock absorbers and 18-inch wheels. The  NR  even had \nside-mounted radiators to avoid feeding warm air to the \ncarbs ten  years before it became common practice. Next \nto the  opposition, the  NR500 looked tiny. \nSome Honda managers had  counselled caution and \nasked for a parallel two-stroke programme, or  at least \nsome shakedown races at national level. The  top  men \nfelt they wouldn't learn quickly enough that way. Of \ncourse, such a  radical machine was a  racing nightmare. \nIt needed to  run  at 7000rpm to start —  unfortunately \npush starts were still  in force. The  motor sounded like \nit stopped dead when the throttle was  closed, so  it \nis fair to assume that  there was  next to  no  flywheel. \nRiders Mick Grant and  Takazumi Katayama had  dreadful \nproblems even qualifying. \nTotal Pos Rider Nat \n120 1 Eugenio Lazzarini ITA \nDS 2 Rolf Blatter SWI \n50 3 Patrick Plisson FRA \n48 4  ~~ Gerhard Waibel GER \n47 5 Peter Looijensteijn NED \n40 6 Hagen Klein GER \n39 7 Henk van  Kessel NED \n36 8 Jacques Hutteau FRA \n36 9 Ingo Emmerich GER \n35 10 Stefan Dorflinger SWI \nSeeing the world’s largest motorcycle company \nsuffering such public humiliation engendered much \namusement, and  the  NR  never scored a World \nChampionship point. The  first  NR  may have been a racing \nfailure, but  it is also probably the  most misunderstood \nracer ever. Many top  Honda men, including the current \npresident, Takeo Fukui, started their careers on  the \nproject. Remember that  the  NR was  Honda's first V4. \nWithout the  several hundred patents and  the  knowledge \ngained in four years of racing, would the  RVF, RC30 and, \nindeed, the  NSR have been such elegant designs? \nMachine Total \nKreidler 75 \nKreidler 62 \nABF 32 \nKreidler 31 \nKreidler 30 \nKreidler 26 \nKreidler 23 \nABF 22 \nKreidler 19 \nKreidler 18 \nABOVE This is what the \nfuss was all  about: oval \npistons, each with two \ncon rods, two spark plugs \nand eight valves.

The American \nnow had a choice of aluminium or  steel frames but \notherwise the  bike was little changed. When the \nSuzukis got up to speed mid-season Yamaha reversed \nthe  outer cylinders of the  engine to  give all the \nexhaust pipes straight runs. \nThe factory also sold a  Roberts Replica, the TZ500G. \nIt differed from the factory bike in that the  power \nvalves were mechanically, not  electrically, operated. \nOne of these bikes did  win  —  courtesy of Jack \nMiddelburg, at home in Holland —  but  his machine was \nreally a  Nico Bakker chassis with RG  Suzuki forks, and \nno-one else got one on  the  rostrum. The Cagiva that \nappeared at the  last  round, ridden by Virginio Ferrari, \nwas built around a TZ500 bottom end. \nHeron Suzuki had  two new riders after Barry \nSheene left to  run  a private Yamaha with Akai \nsponsorship —  20-year-old Randy Mamola and New \n134 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nprivateer’s triumph in the  350  class \nRoberts and Yamaha made it a hat-trick \nof titles but the story of the year was a \nABOVE The final \nshowdown: Jon Ekerold \nand Anton Mang duel \non  the Nurburgring with \nno-one else in sight.

Despite the  problems of the \nprevious season, when the  Suzuki challenge had no \nclear leader, the  factory again supplied full  works \nbikes to their Dutch and Italian teams. Wil  Hartog \nreturned, while the  Olio Nava Fiat team had  two new \nriders: Graziano Rossi and Marco Lucchinelli. All the \nSuzuki riders had  problems with their new rising- \nrate suspension systems at the  start of the  year, and \nRoberts took full  advantage. \nHonda also returned late  in the  season with a \nmuch simplified version of their oval-piston NR500 \nin a conventional steel tube frame engineered by \nUK  specialist Maxton. The NR wasn’t the  only \nunconventional bike on  the  grid. Kawasaki fielded \nKork Ballington on  a  rotary-valve square four housed \nin an  aluminium monococque chassis, the  KR500.

It had been winning races since \n1973 but  disc-valve induction was now being used by \nevery other factory in GPs, so  Yamaha gave Kenny \nRoberts a  new square four with disc-valves and an \naluminium frame, the  OW54. It was powerful but \nunderdeveloped and caused Roberts problems both \nwith abrupt power delivery and handling. This was \nalso the  last year that Kenny, or  anyone else, used \nGoodyear tyres in GPs. A revised chassis appeared for \nthe  French GP,  along with a second square four for \nBarry Sheene from the  French round onwards. Barry \nimmediately went well on  it and won the  last  race \nof the  year. There were TZ500s as  well, the  model \nJ, for  privateers, and seven replicas of the 1980 bike \ncomplete with aluminium frames for senior men \nlike  Sheene, Boet van  Dulmen and Christian Sarron, \nthe  most successful of whom was Dutch rider van \nDulmen, with two third places. \nDespite all this  effort by Yamaha, it was Suzuki \n138 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nwho won the title with their factory bike and Suzuki \nwho supplied the  best privateers. Randy Mamola \nand Graeme Crosby stayed with the  Heron team, \nnow with Ingersoll sponsorship, with Japanese test \nrider Hiroyuki Kawasaki appearing for the  first few \nraces. The Italian Nava team had just one rider, \nMarco Lucchinelli, as  did the  Dutch squad, who kept \nWil  Hartog. All  were on  XR35 square fours with \nconventional steel chassis. The  exception was Mamola \nwho got a square-section aluminium chassis which he \nraced from the  Belgian GP  onwards. \nDutch privateer Jack Middelburg gave the  RG500 \nSuzuki what many consider its finest moment when \nhe beat Roberts in a straight fight on  the  fearsomely \nfast  old  Silverstone circuit. Kork Ballington continued \nwith the  Kawasaki, which had lost  some weight but \nwas still  too  long and too  heavy. He  did  get it on  the \nrostrum twice, the  only top-three finishes the  KR500 \never managed. Kawasaki had no  such problems in \nthe  350  and 250cc classes where Anton Mang put \ntogether a season of utter domination. \nABOVE ‘Lucky’ Lucchinelli \non  his way to  winning the \nFinnish GP  on  the closed \nroads of  Imatra.

Tall, stylish and instantly recognisable in (Henk Keulemans) \nhis white leathers topped with a  helmet in national \ncolours, he sparked what amounted to countrywide \nrejoicing when he became the  first Dutchman to \nwin  a top-class race at Assen in  1977. Wil  was also \nthird in that epic Silverstone confrontation between \nSheene and Roberts in  1979. His  speech from the \nrostrum tells us  a  lot about him: ‘The best men won, \n| could not  have any  faster gone.’ \nVan Dulmen’s win came in Finland in  1979. All \nthe top  men were there —  Mamola, Roberts, Sheene, \nCecotto —  but  the  Dutch rider beat them using a \ncustomer RG500 on  a drying track with a  narrow \ndry line. Despite his tough-guy demeanour, van \nDulmen was reckoned to  be one  of the  safest and \nmost consistent riders of the  era,  a fact  that may \nhave had  something to  do with the  number of \nclosed-roads circuits on  which Dutch riders then \nbegan their racing. \nJack Middelburg won two races, yet never \nreceived the  support his talent deserved. He  was \nalways on  the  brink of retiring, and  more than once \nwas kept on  track by Dutch fans having a whip \nround. Twice a triple champion at  home (350, 500 \nand 750cc in  1977 and ‘78), he was the  one  of the \ntrio  who had  a tendency to  crash through trying too \nhard. He  knew he had to take risks to  be competitive \nwith \nthe \nfactory \nriders \nso \nhe \ndid, \nknowingly \nand \nin \ncold \nblood. \nHis \nnickname \n‘Jumping \nJack’ \ncame \nfrom \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 141 \n\nhe  1982 season was almost a carbon copy of '81, \nthe  only real indication of changing times being \nthe use  of two old  road circuits, Imatra and Brno, for \nthe  last time. The Roberto Gallina-managed Italian \nSuzuki team put out  one rider on  a very well-sorted \nmotorcycle, which ran  even more perfectly than the \nprevious year, although there was a different colour \nscheme for their new sponsor and a change of rider. \nMarco Lucchinelli took his number-one plate and \njoined Honda's new two-stroke team, leaving Franco \nUncini to take advantage of the  opposition’s disarray. \nUncini’s team-mate was Loris Reggiani. \nThe UK-based Suzuki team kept Randy Mamola, \nbut  Graeme Crosby was pushed out  and joined \nGiacomo Agostini’s new Marlboro Yamaha team \nalongside Graziano Rossi. Another experienced \nItalian, Virgino Ferrari, became Mamola’s team-mate. \nYamaha’s much-improved OW60 square four also \nwent to  Kenny Roberts (the factory's entry), Barry \nSheene and Marc Fontan (FRA). Kawasaki persevered \nfor one final year with their now plate-frame square \n142 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nfour, ridden as  ever by Kork Ballington. \nHonda gave up  on  their quixotic NR  four-stroke \nand, swallowing corporate pride, came in with a full- \non  two-stroke effort with three riders: Lucchinelli, \nTakazumi Katayama and wonder kid  Freddie Spencer. \nThe bike was almost as  out  of step with current \npractice as  the  NR —a  small, lightweight, reed-valve \ntriple —  but  it was good enough to  be third first time \nout  and first in only its seventh GP. \nRoberts, now on  Dunlops, switched to  Yamaha's \nV4, the  OW61, early in the  season. It was far from \nready and, by common consent, the  worst bike the \nfactory ever built. Yamaha's hopes looked to  rest  with \nSheene, riding as  well as  he’d ever done. Yamaha were \nimpressed enough to  hand him a V4 for the  British GP, \nbut the  crash that produced the  most famous X-ray in \nthe  sport ended Sheene’s season. Ironically, Roberts's \nseason also ended the  same weekend, when he \ncrashed in the  first corner of the  race. Uncini won to \neffectively clinch the title, then failed to  score another \npoint in the  season's remaining three rounds. \nABOVE Franco Uncini \nleads the man he  was to \ndeprive of the number-

MBA \nGOODBYE TO  THE 350S \nThe  final GP  of the year, at  Hockenheim, also saw the \nend  of the  350cc class, but  it was a good day for German \nfans: Anton Mang had  lost  his 250  title  earlier in the  day \nbut  retained his 350 crown with a second place. He was \nbeaten by another German, local hero Manfred Herweh, \nwho hadn't scored a  Grand Prix  point before finishing \nseventh in the  250cc race earlier that day. There was \nactually precious little in the  way of mourning for the \n350cc class —  although, of course, there were privateers \nwho lost some earnings potential —  because the  250  and \n350cc races were now almost indistinguishable from each \nother. Machinery was identical save for different coloured \nbackgrounds for the  racing numbers and a set  of slightly \nbigger-bore cylinders. At Silverstone the  race speeds of \nthe two classes differed by less  than 0.2mph. \nThe  history of the  class shows how GPs  changed \nover time and riders started to  specialise as  opposed \nto  riding a different bike in every class —  the  first  500cc \nWorld Champion, Les  Graham, for  instance, rode 125s \nat the same meetings as  he competed with his  500. A \nrider's choice of class was obviously influenced by the \nmachinery available. Manx Nortons were made as  350s \nas  well as  500s, and  if you  rode an  MV  Agusta in the  500 \nclass you  also  got a 350. This changed considerably from \n1976 onwards when privateer riders concentrated on  the \n500cc class with an  RG  Suzuki, and  the  350cc class was \ndominated by Yamaha and  Kawasaki riders doubling up \nwith the  250cc class. It is interesting to  note that from \n1976 onwards no  rider who finished in the  top four of the \n500cc championship also  finished in the  350cc top four. \nIn every year from 1956 to  1975 at least one  of the  top \nfour riders in the  500cc class also  finished in the  top four \nin the  350cc class, while from 1956 to  1973 the winner \nof the  500cc title  always finished in the  top four of the \n350cc class. \nlf there was ever an  iconic machine in the  350  class \nit was  surely the  three-cylinder MV Agusta that  was \ndeveloped \nfor \nand \nby \nGiacomo \nAgostini, \nas \nis \nshown \nin \nthe \ntables. \nAfter \nthe \nfour-stroke \nera, \na \n350 \nbecame \nmerely \nan  over-bored 250. \n=O ON OU RWN = \nStefan Dorflinger \nEugenio Lazzarini \nClaudio Lusuardi \nRicardo Tormo \nGiuseppe Ascareggi \nHans Hummel \nTheo Timmer \nMassimo de  Lorenzi \nHans Spaan \nQO   Hagen Klein \n350CC STATISTICS: \nMANUFACTURERS \nAND GP  WINS \nWins \n76 \n67 \n—---WHHH BS \nManufacturer \nMV Agusta \nYamaha \nHonda \nKawasaki \nMoto Guzzi \nNorton \nVelocette \nAJS \nGilera \nHarley Davidson \nJawa \nChevallier \nMZ \nYamsel \nNat Machine Total \nSWI Kreidler 81 \nITA Garelli 69 \nITA “Villa 43 \nSPA  Bultaco 40 \nITA = Minarelli 38 \nAUT Sachs 19 \nNED Bultaco 15 \nITA ~~ Minarelli 14 \nNED Kreidler (2 \nGER  Massa-Real 10 \nRIDERS WITH MOST \nWINS IN  THE 350CC \nCLASS \nRiders Wins \n1.

(E/wyn \nRoberts Collection) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 145 \n\n~*~ \n—— \n: \n/ \nA \n\\ \nhis  pivotal year saw the  balance of power shifting \ndecisively away from Suzuki and the  American \ninvasion gathering momentum. Suzuki's RG500 was \nreaching the  end of its development, with only Randy \nMamola getting on  the  rostrum. Mamola and reigning \nWorld Champion Franco Uncini were the  factory riders, \nalthough they were run  by different teams; customers, \nincluding Barry Sheene, back after three years on  a \nYamaha, had a  miserable time. \nThe privateers who could afford it were turning to \nHonda RS500s, over-the-counter versions of the  factory's \nNS500 triple —-  now sporting ATAC, Honda’s variable- \ngeometry exhaust-port system. There were four factory \nbikes: Freddie Spencer, Takazumi Katayama and Marco \nLucchinelli all  returned, and were joined by British racer \nRon Haslam. \nYamaha's new OW70 was the  first generation of the \nline  of V4s  that would go on  to dominate the  500cc \nclass right up  until the  advent of MotoGP. The disc-valve \nmotor was housed in an  aluminium chassis that was \nobviously not  the  conventional double cradle that a \n146 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nManx Norton rider would have recognised. Fabricated \nspars ran  either side of the  top  of the  motor ina \nstraight line  from steering head to swingarm pivot with \nvestigial frame members running to  engine mountings. \nOhlins suspension was used for the first time. Kenny \nRoberts was joined by Eddie Lawson (USA). Marlboro \nsponsorship moved from Agostini’s team, which folded \nand Ago became the team’s figurehead. \nAluminium frames were now ubiquitous. Honda and \nSuzuki ran  Michelin tyres; the  factory Yamahas stuck \nwith Dunlop. \nIt was a year of epic confrontation between Roberts \nand Spencer, the  battle effectively decided at the \npenultimate round in Sweden when the  Honda rider \nwent inside Roberts at the  end of the  back straight. \nBoth men ran  off track but  Spencer regained it much \nmore quickly and won. All  Freddie had to do  at the  last \nround was follow Kenny home to  be champion. Roberts \nwon the  race —  his  last —  but  Spencer won the  crown. \nThat passing manoeuvre in Sweden is still a matter of \ndispute. \nABOVE Freddie Spencer \nand Kenny Roberts \nmoments before the  start \nof their final showdown \nin Sweden.

There was, however, a  narrow time window \nin which the  more usable bike could triumph. \nThis was true for the  NS500 in  1983, but  it needed \nthe  genius of Freddie Spencer to take that advantage. The \nother Honda riders ended the  season fifth, seventh and \neighth respectively. The  NS  and RS triples would continue \nto win GPs, but  not  another title. Chassis and suspension \nadvances and  the  development of the  radial tyre  helped \ntame the  V4s  but, as  the  boxing saying goes, a  good big \n‘un  will  always beat a  good little ‘un. \nHowever, when Kenny Roberts became a constructor \nthe  bike he built was a triple, designed to take advantage \nof the  lower minimum weight limit compared to that \nfor four-cylinder machines. Kenny’s triples could do \ncomparable lap times to the  V4s  on  a clear racetrack, \nalthough they had  to carry a  lot more pace in the  corners \nto  make up for their significantly inferior acceleration \nand  top speeds. If they lost  momentum, usually by \nbeing baulked by a V4  in a corner, they didn’t have the \npunch out  of corners to  keep up  with the  competition. \nHonda tried the  same formula with their V-twin 500, \nas  did  Aprilia. There was the  occasional pole position or \nrostrum, but  none of them ever won a race. The  finest \nmoment for the  little bikes was probably Donington Park \nin  1997, when Brazilian Alex Barros put  a customer Honda \nNSR500V on  the  rostrum. \nLEFT There wasn’t much \neye contact on  the \nAnderstorp rostrum. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nBELOW The last \nchampion of the 50cc \nclass —  Stefan Dorflinger \n(SWI) and the Kreidler. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 149 \n\nenny Roberts stopped riding and started \nmanaging, fronting the  250cc Yamaha team \nof Wayne Rainey (USA) and Britain's Alan Carter. \nYamaha’‘s men in the  500cc class were Eddie Lawson \nand Virginio Ferrari; the  American got the  new reed- \nvalve OW76, a  bike recognisable in every way as  a \nmodern racing machine. The French Yamaha importer \npulled its team from 500s to  concentrate on  Christian \nSarron’s successful attack on  the  250  title. \nHonda gave champion Freddie Spencer their take \non  the  V4,  the  first NSR500, the  bike that became \nknown as  the  ‘upside down’ V4.  They too  went the \nreed-valve V4  route with an  aluminium frame, but \nlocated the  petrol tank under the  engine and ran \nthe  pipes over the  top. This fitted cleverly with the \ncontemporary wisdom that a  low  centre of gravity was \nthe  route to  quick handling. It wasn’t. By the  end of \nthe  season it was realised that its mass centralisation \nlow polar moments of inertia were the  critical \nproperties. The NSR was so  unwieldy that Spencer got \nhis triple out  of mothballs for two races. It wasn’t the \n150 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nEddie Lawson took his first world title \nfor Yamaha as  Honda got their first V4 \ndesign badly wrong \nbike that lost  him  the  title, though, but  missing five \nraces through injury. Only Spencer got the  NSR. The \nother Honda riders were on  triples, Ron Haslam the \nfactory rider on  an  NS,  while Takazumi Katayama \nmissed most of the  season through injury. The stand- \nout customer bike rider was Raymond Roche (FRA), \nwho got some factory support later in the  year in an \nattempt to  stop Lawson’s march to the  title. \nSuzuki riders were headed by Barry Sheene, but \nthe  factory had ceased development of the  RG500 \nso  Sheene had an  old  Mamola motor put  in a chassis \nbuilt by Harris Performance. Barry was the  only \nSuzuki rider to  get on  the  rostrum all  season —  in \nSouth Africa, in the  wet. Having proved the  people \nwho said he was past it conclusively wrong, Barry \nretired from bike racing at the  end of the  year. \nRandy Mamola failed to  agree terms with Suzuki \nand sat  out  the  first two races of the  year until he got \na  deal from Honda.

(Henk \nKeulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 153 \n\nhis time Honda built their V4  NSR500 with the \npetrol tank in the  normal place. It worked and \nworked well. There was only one of them, for  Freddie \nSpencer, with again a squadron of triples for  Randy \nMamola, Ron Haslam and Aussie Wayne Gardner. \nWayne had ridden a few GPs in  1984, in between \nhis  British Championship commitments, but  he  now \nbecame a full-time Grand Prix rider. Like Haslam, he \nused Dunlops while Mamola and Spencer were on \nMichelin radials. This was the first year that Rothmans \nsponsored factory Hondas in both the  500  and 250 \nclasses. Belgian rider Didier de  Radigues also got a \nworks NS triple run  under the  banner of the Elf team. \nYamaha retained Eddie Lawson and brought in \nRaymond Roche as  his team-mate in the  factory \nset-up. However, the tough man from Toulon, who \nhad terrorised the  factory bikes on  an  RS  Honda \nthe  previous season on  his way to third overall, had \na dreadful year after crashing out  of two of the \nfirst four races. To add insult to  injury, his fellow- \ncountryman and reigning 250  World Champion \n154 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nFreddie Spencer doubled up in the \n500  and 250cc classes, a unique \nachievement in the modern era \nChristian Sarron also got a Yamaha V4,  entered by \nthe  French Yamaha importer Sonauto, on  which he \nnot  only finished third overall but won a race. The \nYamaha, now called the  OW81, was little changed, the \nmost significant difference from ‘84  being the  switch \nto  Michelin tyres as  the  French company’s radials now \nbecame standard fitment front (16in) and rear (17in). \nSuzuki tried one more time with RG500s for \nRoberto Gallina’s team, ridden by Franco Uncini and \nSito Pons. The company’s UK  importer, Heron, tried \na different approach with the  now outgunned \nRG500. They housed their square-four motor in \na composite chassis for  Rob McElnea (GBR). \nHowever, it wasn’t the  most radical bike on  the \ngrid —  that accolade belonged to the  Elf2, which \nused a  Honda triple motor with a swingarm bolted \non  either end. It looked like  no  motorcycle ever \nseen before —  no  telescopic forks, no  frame in the \nconventional sense of the  word —  and  was ridden at \nthe  start of the  year by Christian le Liard (FRA) and \nthen by Pierre-Etienne Samin (FRA). \nABOVE Spencer on  the \n500 V4  rides around the \noutside of Freddie Spencer \non  the 250 V-twin.

Ron Haslam \ntook over the  Elf, now in its third incarnation. \nBy contrast Yamaha fielded five  V4s, their \napproach being made clear by the  dropping of the \n‘OW’ designation used for full  factory bikes and the \nadoption of the  YZR500 nomenclature that had  a \nclose relationship to the  company’s street-bike range. \nEddie Lawson led the  Marlboro-sponsored factory \nteam, still  managed by Giacomo Agostini, with Rob \nMcElnea as  his  new team-mate. Christian Sarron \nstayed on  the  Sonauto machine and a  new Yamaha \n158 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nteam appeared managed by Kenny Roberts with \nLucky Strike sponsorship. Naturally the  riders were \nalso American: Randy Mamola and Mike Baldwin. The \nbike had only detail changes from the  previous year \nbut was now versatile enough to  suit  all  its riders, \nand it was completely reliable: none of the  five riders \nfailed to finish a  race because of mechanical problems. \nIt took Lawson just one race to  start winning, after \nwhich he won another three on  the  bounce and \nended the  season with seven wins out  of eleven races. \nThe only time Eddie wasn’t on  the  rostrum was when \nhe fell  on  the  first lap at Assen. \nSuzuki's teams were still  waiting for their own V4 \nbut  both Gallina and Heron squads raced reed-valve \nversions of the  old  square four. Pier-Francesco Chili \n(ITA) of the Gallina team was the top Suzuki scorer, \nwhile the  British operation gave 500cc GP debuts to \nScot Niall Mackenzie and Kevin Schwantz (USA). \nJuan Garriga (SPA) gave the  Italian Cagiva company \ntheir most promising season since they’d come to the \n500cc class in  1982 with their own Yamaha-like V4. \nABOVE Eddie Lawson \nand the  Yamaha YZR500 \n—  a  clinically efficient \ncombination.

The \nriders and teams remained the  same: Lawson \nand McElnea for  Marlboro and Agostini; Mamola \nand Baldwin for  Lucky Strike and Roberts; and Sarron \nfor Sonauto and Gauloises. The only significant \nchange was that Kenny Roberts’s team switched to \nDunlops. Honda, in contrast, did  not  rest on  their \nlaurels. The NSR got a complete revamp, with the \ndirection of crank rotation reversed and the  angle of \nthe V between the  banks of cylinders opened out  so \nthat the  carburettors could be housed there. Apart \nfrom the  single crankshaft there was now little to \ndistinguish the  Honda from the  Yamaha. \nThe difference turned out  to  be Wayne Gardner. \nThe Aussie arm-wrestled the  still  far from perfect \nHonda into submission to  become his country’s first \n500cc World Champion.

Lawson and the  YZR500’'s \nconsistency won them their third title. \nAnother great champion retired before the  end \nof the  season. Anton Mang had already made the \ndecision to call  it quits at the  end of the  year, but  a \ncrash at the  first corner of the  Yugoslav GP  hastened \nhis decision.

Generating heat is not \n1 Jorge Martinez SPA Derbi 137 a  problem when stopping a  747  with 400 people on \n2 Alex Criville SPA Derbi 90 board —  everything gets hot very quickly —  and  the  cold \n3 Stefan Dorflinger SWI Krauser 77 brake problem can  be solved by using massive clamping \n4 Manuel Herreros SPA Derbi 69 forces.

He  had Erv  Kanemoto as  his engineer \nand, vitally, they had the  freedom to  do what they \nwanted to the  bike. Lawson rode in Rothmans \ncolours but was not  part of the  factory team, which \nconsisted of Wayne Gardner and new tough Aussie \nMick Doohan. Pier-Francesco Chili (on Pirellis) and \nDominique Sarron were on  satellite bikes, while \nAmerican dirt-track legend Bubba Shobert received \nan  ‘88-spec Honda. \nLawson’s defection threw the  official Yamaha team \ninto chaos. Manager Giacomo Agostini summoned \nFreddie Spencer out  of retirement and signed Niall \nMackenzie as  his team-mate, but  still  prefers not \nto talk about Spencer. Kenny Roberts again fielded \nWayne Rainey and Kevin Magee, Christian Sarron was \nstill backed by Sonauto, and Alessandro Valesi (ITA) \ngot the  previous year’s bike. At Suzuki Kevin Schwantz \n170 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nwas joined by Ron Haslam, with Randy Mamola kept \non  by Cagiva. \nSito Pons retained his World Championship in the \n250s, with Spaniards winning both titles in the smaller \nclasses as  well. Unusually, neither was won by ‘Aspar’ \nMartinez, who was beaten by Alex Criville (JJ Cobas) \nin the 125s and by his  Derbi team-mate Manuel \nHerreros in the  last  ever 80cc championship. \nInjury and worse played a  big part in the  year, \nespecially in the  USA. Gardner broke his  leg badly, \nthen a  horrible slowing-down lap collision severely \ndamaged Magee’s ankle and left  Shobert with head \ninjuries which would prevent him racing again. British \nrider Rob McElnea took over the  American's Honda. \nSafety at GP circuits had most definitely improved \nin recent years, but  the  appalling response of \nthe  organisers to the  death of Ivan Palazzese at \nHockenheim showed that there was still  a  lot of \nwork to  do.  This was confirmed by such incidents \nas  the  thrice-started Belgian GP  and the  riders’ strike \nat  Misano. \nABOVE The 1989 NSR \nwas one of the most \nvicious racing motorcycles \never built; it took the \ncombined genius of \nLawson and race engineer \nErv  Kanemoto to  tame it. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nRIGHT Alex Criville \nbecame the  youngest ever \nWorld Champion to  date \non  the 125 Cobas.

This time, though, he joined \nKenny Roberts's operation. Wayne Rainey was the \nother factory Yamaha rider. Christian Sarron was \njoined in the  French Yamaha team by Jean-Philippe \nRuggia, and Juan Garriga came up from 250s in a \none-man team. \nHonda also recruited a  Spaniard from the  250s \nto  ride a satellite bike -  double champion Sito \nPons —  and Pier-Francesco Chili kept his satellite V4. \nThe factory team was cut  back to the two Aussies, \nWayne Gardner and Mick Doohan. At Suzuki, Kevin \nSchwantz was joined by Kevin Magee, but  a serious \nhead injury sustained at  Laguna Seca put the \nAustralian out  for the  season and Niall Mackenzie \nwas recalled from the  wilderness of a  privateer 250 \nride. Cagiva had  three riders: Randy Mamola, Ron \nHaslam and class rookie Alex Barros (BRA). \nThe Roberts team, now christened Marlboro \nYamaha, became the  dominating presence in the \n174 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nWayne Rainey took over where the \ninjured Lawson left off, with a clinical \ndemolition of the opposition \npaddock and Wayne Rainey duly won his first title \nwith a  near-perfect season. The only time he finished \noff the  rostrum was when he  had  to  retire from the \nHungarian GP  with a front-brake problem, and by \nthen he was already World Champion. \nAs  in ‘89, injuries played their part. While Rainey \navoided them, Lawson was sidelined for the  first \nhalf of the  year with a  crushed heel, Doohan started \nthe  year hurt, Gardner missed races, and Schwantz \nand Mamola both rode with injuries, while the \nabiding image of the  season was Doohan and Chili's \nsynchronised highside at the  Nurburgring. Things got \nso  bad there were only 16 starters and nine finishers \nat the  mid-season Yugoslav GP —  and the  last four of \nthem were off-the-pace privateers. \nFortunately the 125  and 250  championships threw \nup  new stars. Yamaha-mounted John Kocinski won \nthe  bigger class after a tough fight with Carlos \nCardus (SPA, Honda), and Loris Capirossi (ITA, Honda) \nwon the  125s, along the  way becoming the  youngest \nGP winner and the  youngest World Champion. \nABOVE Wayne Rainey and \nEddie Lawson: the newly \nformed Marlboro Yamaha \nteam.

He  had  already become the  youngest \nwinner at the  British GP.  Winning a world title  in  a debut \nseason would be reason enough to earn a place in the \nhistory books, but  Loris was still  gracing the  paddock 20 \nyears later. Along the  way he  retained his  125  title, added \na 250 World Championship and then won 500cc/MotoGP \nraces on  three different makes of motorcycle. At the  time \nof writing it is possible he could make that four. \nThe  win  at  Brno in 2006 on  the  Ducati made Loris’s \nwinning career the  longest in Grand Prix  history. His  first \nwin, the  British 125 race in  1990, had come 16 years and \n15  days earlier, breaking the  record of Angel Nieto whose \nwinning career in the  smaller classes started with the  50cc \nGP  of East Germany in  1969 and  ended with the  80cc \nrace at the  1985 French GP.  The  gap between those two \nraces is exactly a week shorter than between Loris’s first \nand  his win  in Brno. \nIf Loris wins again in MotoGP he will  also have the \nlongest winning career in the  top  class. His  first  500cc win \nwas  the  Australian race in  1996, 10 years and  338  days \nbefore his  last  win, in Japan in 2007. Giacomo Agostini, \nPhil  Read and  Alex Barros all have longer gaps between \ntheir first and last  500cc/MotoGP wins, with the  Brazilian \nholding the  record with 11  years and  204  days between \nJarama 1993 and Estoril 2005. \nBy the  end  of 2008 he had  made 282 Grand Prix  starts \n—  more than any  other rider in GP  history \nHe  has taken part in 37.9 per  cent of the  743  Grand \nPrix  events staged since the  start of the  World \nChampionship series back in  1949 \nHe  has  finished in a  points-scoring position a  record \n231 times \n2009 is his  20th year as  a full-time GP  rider —  equalling \nthe  record of Angel Nieto \nHe  has won GP  races on  seven different motorcycles: \n125cc Honda, 250cc Honda, 250cc Aprilia, 500cc \nYamaha, 500cc Honda, 990cc Ducati and 800cc \nDucati \nHe  is one of only two iiders who have won on  500cc \ntwo-stroke, 990cc four-stroke and  800cc four-stroke; \nthe  other is Valentino Rossi \nDuring his career he  has  competed at 41  different \nGrand Prix  circuits \nHe  still  holds the  record set  in  1990 of being the \nyoungest ever rider to  win a World Championship, at \nthe  age  of  17  years 165  days \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nBELOW Loris \nleads the \n125s. (Henk \nKeulemans) \n177 \n\nddie Lawson swapped bikes for the third year in \na  row, leaving Yamaha to  replace Randy Mamola \nat  perennial under-achievers Cagiva. Alex Barros \nkept his  ride with the  Italian team, which had been \nexpected to  stop racing until Eddie signed. Honda \nreduced their commitment to three bikes: the  factory \nRothmans team of Aussies Wayne Gardner and Mick \nDoohan plus Sito Pons, who got a second year on  a \nsatellite bike. \nWayne Rainey was back on  a  Roberts Yamaha to \ndefend his title, with 250  champion John Kocinski as \nhis new team-mate. The Roberts team also put Doug \nChandler (USA) on  a third Yamaha, run  in factory \nrather than sponsor’s colours. The French Yamaha team \npromoted Christian Sarron to  a management role, so \nJean-Philippe Ruggia became their leading rider with \nback-up from veteran all-rounder Adrien Morillas (FRA). \nNiall Mackenzie would ride a third Sonauto Yamaha \nlater in the  season. Juan Garriga also got a second \nyear on a satellite bike. Suzuki had, rather surprisingly, \ndecided not  to  re-employ Mackenzie, who had  finished \n178 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nfourth overall in 1990, choosing instead to field Belgian \nDidier de Radigues alongside Kevin Schwantz. Kevin \nMagee recovered from his terrible Laguna Seca crash \nthe  previous year to  ride the  first two races for Suzuki, \nthen discovered he hadn't got a contract. He  rode \nin the  last  race of the year, in Malaysia, for Roberts \nYamaha as  team-mate to Chandler. \nThere was another Yamaha on  the  grid, though, \nand a very significant one. Team Millar’s rider Eddie \nLaycock (IRL) had  a V4  leased from the  factory, not \noperated under the  aegis of a  national importer, a \nfirst for a  private team. This was by way of a test to \nsee  if a complicated beast like a YZR500 could be \nentrusted to  a  private team. The experiment was a \nsuccess. Laycock racked up enough points to finish \ntwelfth overall and it might have been even better if \nhe had not  damaged his shoulder when he crashed at \nAssen while lying seventh. \nThis season was the  last time a  points-scoring \nsystem which did  not  count all  rounds was used: riders \ndropped their worst two scores of the  year. \na ABOVE The ‘Evil Empire’: \nKenny Roberts’ Marlboro \nYamaha team of Wayne \nRainey and John Kocinski. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nRIGHT New star Noboru \nUeda leads double \n125  champion Fausto \nGresini. ‘Nobby’ was the \nspearhead of a  Japanese \ninvasion of the  class. \n(Henk Keulemans) \n\nThe rules were changed, with \nthe  minimum weight rising \nfrom 115  to  130kg \nKevin Schwantz won the \nopening race of the  year after \na tremendous battle, the  first \nfour riders covered by just \nover half a second at the flag \n—  the  closest ever top four in \na 500cc GP  at that time \nWayne Rainey won the  first \n500cc GP  race to  be  held at \nthe New South Wales circuit \nRainey made it three wins in \na  row at  Laguna Seca \nMick Doohan took his first \nwin of the  year to  head the \nWorld Championship table \nfor the  first time in his career \nTHE \n1991 \nSEASON \nJuan Garriga finished fourth \nat  his  home GP -  the  best \nresult by a  Spanish rider in \nthe  500cc class for  20 years \nEddie Lawson finished third, \ngiving Cagiva their first ever \ndry weather podium finish \nAfter a  race-long battle \nSchwantz crossed the line  just \n0.016s ahead of Rainey in the \nclosest ever finish between \nthe  two great rivals \nIn winning the  Dutch TT \nKevin Schwantz set  a  lap \nrecord which was not \nbettered until the  track was \nremodelled in 2002 \nRon Haslam finished 12th on \nthe  rotary-engined Norton, \nthe  last  points-scoring finish \nfor the  manufacturer that \nwon the  first 500cc GP  race \nback in  1949 \nWayne Rainey finished third \nto  retain the  world title with \none race remaining, in the \nprocess becoming the last \nrider to  win the  500cc crown \nusing Dunlop tyres \nNew champion Rainey and \nfellow-American Kevin \nSchwantz both missed the final \nrace of the year after suffering \ninjuries in pre-race testing \nJohn Kocinski took his  maiden \n500cc win on  the  first occasion \nthat a Grand Prix  event had \nbeen held in Malaysia \nLuca Cadalora won first \ntime out on  a  Honda, \nand maintained his \nchampionship lead \nthroughout the  year \nHelmut Bradl (GER, Honda) \nscored his first GP victory \nPier-Francesco Chili won \nfor the  first time on  a 250, \ngiving Aprilia only their \nsecond class win and their \nfirst victory for four years \nLuca Cadalora finished third \nto  win the 250cc world title \nfor  the first time \nNewcomer Noboru Ueda \n(JPN, Honda) qualified on \npole and won the  race —  the \nlast time that a GP was won \nby a  rider making his  Grand \nPrix debut \nUeda made it two wins from \nthree races in his first ever \nGP  in Europe \nAlessandro Gramigni (ITA) \nscored his first GP victory \nand the  first victory for \nAprilia in the  125cc class \nLoris Capirossi finished \nsecond to  retain the  125cc \nworld title \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 179 \n\n{| 500cc -  thirteen best results were counted \nPos \nRider \nNat \nMachine \nJPN \nAUS \nUSA \nSPA \nITA \nGER \nAUT \nEUR \nNED \nFRA \nGBR \nRSM \nCZE \nVdM \nMAL \nNett \nGross \n1 \nWayne \nRainey \nUSA-Yamaha. \n015.20. \n20815. \n7 \n9 \n17s \nete \neis \n20 \nee \n20 \nec \neee \n233 \n240 \n2 \nMick \nDoohan \nAUS \nHonda \nWh \nAWE \nWh \nAe \nAy \nA) \nEs \n17-415 \n15; \naz \n17 \n_ \n15° \n> \n2249239 \nI \n3 \nKevin \nSchwantz \nUSA \nSuzuki \noA \n3h \nSS \nCie \n9. \n520 \n5 \n152 \n13 \nSe \n20s \neee \nse \n11 \n20 \n- \n204 \ni \n4 \n= \nJohn \nKocinski \nUSA \nYamaha \n13 \n15 \n- \nWy \n“Wee \n= \n7 \nhi \nWO \n13 \n10m \n13. \n202361 \n5 Wayne Gardner AUS Honda 11 is) 9 . 11 ss 7B AB 11 13 13 11 17. +161 +167 \n6 Eddie Lawson USA Cagiva WO Ae UE We aI BP Ah) ei aby y= = 8 - - 126 \n7 Juan Garriga SPA Yamaha 9 - is} 8 -& Oia Omens 5 7 2 10 10:5) 13) 12125 \n8 Didier de  Radigues BEL Suzuki 2 SG Re 10s 6 Hh 8 8 9 8 8 105 107 \n9 Doug Chandler USA Yamaha 5 4 - 6 Ke) 2 9 7 5 10s 7 6 9 - 85 \n10 Jean-Philippe Ruggia FRA Honda - 9 3 Eye - 9 8 11 - 6 - - - 78 \n| 11.

Juan Garriga was back for \na third year on a satellite Yamaha, while the  French \nsquad kept Niall Mackenzie, who had guested for \nthem in ‘91,  and brought in Miguel DuHamel (CAN). \nMick Doohan and Wayne Gardner stayed as  Honda’s \nworks riders while Sito Pons handed the  leased NSR \nto  1989 125  champ Alex Criville and went into team- \nmanagement. Kevin Schwantz was again Suzuki's \nlead rider, although fellow-American Doug Chandler \nwould prove to  be the first team-mate capable of \noutperforming the Texan.

Mick Doohan’s crash, \nactually his second of the weekend, didn’t look too  bad \nbut  his right leg went under the  bike when it hit the \nkerbing and he fractured the tibia and  fibula. It looked a \nrelatively simple case, but then infection set  in and Mick \ncame terribly close to  losing the  leg. He was 53  points \nin front of the field —  65 in front of Rainey —  before the \nDutch race, with six of 13 races remaining, having won \nfive  races and  finished second twice. Doohan returned \nfor the  last two races, a ghostly presence, but couldn't \nprevent Rainey winning the championship again. \nABOVE Mick Doohan \nis carried into Assen‘s \nmedical centre with what \nstarted as  a  relatively \nstraightforward fracture \nbut  soon became a \nnightmare.

In the  search for  usability as  opposed \nto  outright power, HRC came up  with a  new engine in \nwhich all four cylinders fired within around 65-70 degrees \nof crank rotation —  the  ‘big-bang’ motor. For  reasons \nno-one was able to  explain satisfactorily for the  next \n15 years, this  new firing order transformed the  500cc \nV4 two-stroke from a  man-eater into  a  relative pussy \ncat.  The  out-of-balance forces generated necessitated \nstrengthened transmission components and a  power- \nsapping balance shaft, but  lap times came down. The \nbalance shaft also cured many of the  problems Honda \nhad  suffered from due  to the  gyroscopic effect of their \nsingle-crankshaft design —  all the  other manufacturers \nused contra-rotating twin-crank engines which, as  well \nas  being simpler to  produce and cheaper to  maintain, \ncancelled out  any  gyro effects. \nPower could be fed  in  earlier, tyres lasted longer and \nclass rookies could get on  the  rostrum —  as  Alex Criville \ndemonstrated in the  third race of the  year. That would \nhave been almost unthinkable with a  regular firing-order \n‘screamer’ motor, or  even the  slightly softer version that \nfired two cylinders together at  180-degree intervals. \nHonda’s innovation was so  spectacularly successful that \nthe  other manufacturers were forced to follow suit  as \nquickly as  they could. There is  no  doubt that Doohan and \nthe  big-bang Honda NSR would have won their first  title \nin  1992 but  for the  complications that followed Mick's \nAssen accident. \nEven in  the  MotoGP era  manufacturers continued to \nsearch for the  optimal crankshaft phasing. A variety of \nbig-bang and long-bang layouts were tried, without any \ntheoretical justification; the  stopwatch made its  empirical \njudgement. Improbable theories about the  rear  tyre \nslipping and gripping were eventually overtaken by Maseo \nFurusawa of Yamaha’s demonstration that torque flutter \ndue  to  acceleration and deceleration of the  crank, rods \nand pistons at  small throttle openings can  be significant \non  regular firing order motors. \nThe 1992 NSR50O0 looked very like  the  ‘91  model from \nthe  outside, but  the  rearrangement of its  engine internals \nhad  a  profound effect on  racing. It just  took a few years \nto  work out  why \nABOVE &  BELOW At  last, \nthe V4  was tamed thanks \nto  ‘big-bang’ firing orders. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 185 \n\nick  Doohan was back with Repsol Honda \nfor the  start of the  season but was  far from \nrecovered from his  leg injuries, and he also had  to \ncope with the  aftermath of a pre-season crash that \nbroke his  left wrist. He would have further operations \nto try and restore movement in his ankle, but  in the \nmeantime he pioneered a thumb-operated rear-brake \nsystem. Mick was joined by two new team-mates \n—  Daryl Beattie, another product of the  production \nline that took young Aussie hot-shots to  GPs  via the \nAll-Japan Championship, and a second ex-A-J champ, \nShinichi Itoh. The  Japanese rider was charged with \ndevelopment of the  fuel-injected NSR motor. Alex \nCriville continued on  the  lone satellite Honda. \nTriple champion Wayne Rainey was joined by 125 \nand twice 250  champion Luca Cadalora, but the  new \nYamaha chassis proved too  stiff and led to  Rainey \ntrying a  ROC customer frame. The French Yamaha \nteam bought Freddie Spencer out  of retirement for a \nsecond and disastrous comeback, alongside Bernard \nGarcia.

There was a \nveritable armada of ROC and Harris Yamahas, the \nfastest again being the  WCM team’s machine with \nNiall Mackenzie on  board. \nCagiva had  two new riders, Doug Chandler \nrecruited from Yamaha and young Aussie Superbike \nhot-shot Matt Mladin. When the team brought John \nKocinski in after his sacking by the  250  Suzuki team, \nthe  original riders were seriously undermined. \nSuzuki found another partner for  Kevin Schwantz \nin the  shape of Alex Barros, the  Brazilian rider who \nhad impressed in his three years on  the  Cagiva. \nSchwantz took full  advantage of the  opposition’s \ndisarray, ripping into a 23-point lead after nine \nrounds —  four of which he won —  but  next time out \nat  Donington he was skittled by an  errant Doohan. \nRainey hit back at  Brno, and  then came Misano and \nthe  crash that ended Wayne Rainey’s career. It also \nmade Kevin Schwantz World Champion, but in a \nmanner that fundamentally unsettled him and led \ndirectly to  his retirement. \n\nTHE \n1993 \nSEASON \nERS \nPSP \nSEP \nSESED. \nPOPUPS \nSTEELE \nSESS \nAUS/Eastern Creek \n@ In an  all-American podium, \nKevin Schwantz won the \nopening race of the year \nfrom great rival Wayne \nRainey, with Doug Chandler \nin third, making his debut on \nthe  factory Cagiva \nJPN/Suzuka \nm@ Rainey won from Schwantz \nand Daryl!

He  crashed alone, tumbled through the  gravel \ntrap and came to  rest  with a  broken back. \nWayne Rainey comes from Los  Angeles and \nworked his way up from local dirt-track races to the \nnational championship, then to  road racing —  first  with \nthe  underdog Kawasaki team, then Honda in AMA \nSuperbike racing, and  finally to  GPs  with Yamaha. Kevin \nSchwantz is Texan, the  son of a  motorcycle dealer, \nwho was talent-spotted by Suzuki very early on  and \nfast-tracked to  GPs. The  pair were implacable enemies \nwho brought their rivalry over to  GPs  from the  AMA \nSuperbike Championship, and they continued to  find \nreasons to  dislike each other. Rainey was a grafter, hard \nworking and  analytical; Schwantz seemed to  get  by on \nunadulterated natural talent. Their mutual dislike fuelled \nsome great racing in the  500cc GP  class in the  early \n1990s. Schwantz’s own decision to  retire came after \na  long ‘plane conversation with Rainey at the  start \nof 1995. \nDespite his grievous injuries Rainey was back in the \npaddock at the  start of the  ‘94  season, taking over from \nKenny Roberts as  team-manager for the  250  Yamaha \nsquad. No  matter that it was too  much too  soon after \nhis accident, Wayne persevered through his  rehabilitation \nand  then took over the  500 team when Kenny embarked \non  his  project as  a constructor. Eventually, though, \nRainey had  to  admit he found the  role unsatisfying and \nretired to what seems to  be a  happy family life.  He  has  a \npowerful speedboat and has  been known to  race a very \ntrick kart built for  him  by Eddie Lawson. Nowadays he \nis only seen once a year at a  bike race, at  Laguna Seca, \nwhich is close to  his  home —  and  where there.is a section \nof the  track named after him. \nFor  \nthe  \nfull,  \nat \ntimes \nharrowing \nstory \nof \nthe  \ntwo \nlives \nof \na \ndriven \nman \nget  \nhold \nof \na  \ncopy \nof \nWayne \nRainey \nby \nMichael \nScott \n(Haynes, \n1997). \nIt \nis \nout \nof \nprint \nbut \nwell \nworth \nthe \neffort \nof \ntracking \ndown. \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 189 \n\nSS TT \nhe  paddock looked very different in  1994: \nWayne Rainey was back but  in a wheelchair \nand as  a team-manager; Honda had lost  their works \nteam’s sponsor; and Kevin Schwantz was racing with \nnumber one on  his  Suzuki, not  his customary 34. \nWithout Rothmans, Honda ran  their three \nmen —  Doohan, Itoh and Criville —  in strangely old- \nfashioned-looking corporate colours. The lone lease \nNSR went to  Spaniard Alberto Puig in a satellite \nteam run  by Sito Pons. Mick duly marched almost \nunopposed to  his first title, on  the  rostrum for  every \none of the 14  rounds and taking nine wins. Honda \ndid  have another highlight, though, in the  stunning \nwild-card debut of Norifumi ‘Norick’ Abe at  Suzuka. \nThe reigning All-Japan 500cc champion was still  only \n18 and had  the  temerity to  race with —  and scare — \nDoohan and Schwantz before crashing out  at  high \nspeed with only three laps to  go.  A star was born. \nYamaha, struggling to  come to terms with what \nhad happened to Wayne Raine, had yet to  get their \nbike anywhere near right. Luca Cadalora was joined \n190 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nSE \nin the  Roberts team by Dary! Beattie: neither had an \nenjoyable season, although Cadalora won two races \nand finished second overall. There was a  veritable \nflood of ROC and Harris Yamahas, the  quickest of \nwhich was again Mackenzie on  the  WCM team’s ROC. \nCagiva stuck with Doug Chandler and retained \nJohn Kocinski full  time, while Schwantz and Alex \nBarros stayed at  Suzuki. However, Kevin injured \nhimself in a  pre-season mountain-bike crash, and then \nagain when he damaged his wrist —  always the  wrist — \nat Assen and aggravated the injury when he crashed \nin  France. More crashes followed at  Donington and \nBrno, until a  big highside coming out  of Laguna Seca’s \nCorkscrew ended his season. The opposition might \nhave had  their problems, but  it’s  actually doubtfui if \nanyone could have challenged Doohan and the  now \ndominant Honda NSR. \nThankfully, spectators saw enthralling 250  season, \nwith Max Biaggi on  an  Aprilia fighting a  bevy of \ntalented Honda riders. Aprilia also tried a  ‘super 250’ \ntwin, actually 380cc, in the  500 class. \nNn Re ee ay \nABOVE Mick Doohan \nwon his  first title by the \nastonishing margin of  143 \npoints.

in the  same season, a  remarkable enough \nachievement for a company of any  size  but  a  minor \nmiracle for a tiny factory that relied for  its existence \non  selling scooters to fashion-conscious Italian youth. \nThe  Aprilia story started with Loris Reggiani and  what \nwas basically a  Rotax motor in their own chassis. The \ncombination was good enough for a  rostrum in its first \nseason, 1985, despite Reggiani suffering a couple of nasty \ninjuries. Progress stalled the following season when Loris \nwent to  Honda, but  in 1987 he was  back and  gave the \nfactory its first  Grand Prix  victory in front of a  raucous \nhome crowd at  Misano. This was in a field stuffed with \nfactory Hondas ridden by aces like Anton Mang, Reinhold \nRoth and  Sito  Pons, and  Yamahas with Luca Cadalora and \nCarlos Lavado on  them. In  1988 Aprilia entered Corrado \nCatalano on  a  125; he gave the  factory their first podium \nin the  class at the  French GP. \nCustomer 250s were available in  1989 but only \nGermany's Martin Wimmer got one on  the  rostrum, in \nAustria. Next season Wimmer was on  the  rostrum twice, \nDidier de  Radigues and  Reggiani once. In ‘91  Reggiani \nand  Chili rode the  factory 250s, and 125s appeared \nfor the first  time in the  hands of Gabriele Debbia and \nAlessandro Gramigni. The last  named duly gave Aprilia \ntheir first world title  in  1992 after stalling on  the  line  at \nthe  last  round and  riding through the  field to third place. \nThe  250 crown eluded Reggiani, though, frustrated by \nthe  brilliance of Honda’s Cadalora and Kanemoto. The \nnext year it was Tetsuya Harada JPN, Yamaha) and Loris \nCapirossi (ITA, Honda) who thwarted Loris. Then Max \nBiaggi joined the team, and 1994 saw the  beginning of \nhis run  of three Aprilia-mounted championships (and one \non  a  Honda, just to  make a  point); 1994 was also  the year \nthe  125  crown went to  Kazuto Sakata, the  first Japanese \nrider to win  a world title  on  a  European machine. \nFrom the  early 1990s onwards Aprilia were at  least \nthe  equal of the Japanese companies in the  smaller \nclasses, and as  Japan Inc’s interest in two-strokes waned \nthe  Italian factory continued to develop their bikes and \nlease LE  models (replicas of the  previous season’s works \nmachines) to  customer teams. After Aprilia was absorbed \nby the  giant Piaggio group, other brand names such as \nGilera and  Derbi have been affixed to what are,  in fact, \nAprilias. Taking that into  account, the  only years since \n‘93  when Aprilia has  not  provided a World Champion \nwere 2004 and 2005, thanks to  Spanish youngster Dani \nPedrosa taking the  250  title  in both years, and  Andrea \nDovizioso (ITA) and  Thomas Luthi (SWI), the  respective \n125  champions. \nABOVE Max Biaggi won \nfive GPs in  1994.

(Henk Keulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 193 \n\nick  Doohan backed-up his first title by again \ndominating the  season, despite throwing \naway the  lead on  the  last  lap of the  third round, then \ncrashing while leading the  next two races. His crash at \nJerez handed the  championship lead to  Daryl Beattie, \nnow Suzuki's lead rider after the  retirement of Kevin \nSchwantz, but  a  run  of four consecutive wins in the \nmiddle of the  season put  Doohan 15 points in front \nof Beattie, and he was never headed again. Britain’s \nSean Emmett had a couple of points-scoring outings \non  the  Suzuki before the  1993 World Superbike \nChampion Scott Russell (USA) got the job full  time. \nYamaha’s challenge was led  by Luca Cadalora, the \nItalian starting the  season on  Dunlops, with which he \nfailed to  come to terms, so  Team Roberts got  him  onto \nMichelins, or  sometimes even a cocktail of Michelin \nfront and Dunlop rear. He won back-to-back races \nafter Doohan’s run  of four. Cadalora’s team-mate, and \nthe  only other full  factory Yamaha rider, was Norick \nAbe. The squadron of other Yamahas in the  results \nwere ROC and Harris-framed privateer machines. \n194 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nA second title for Mick Doohan \nin the  500s and  for Max Biaggi \nin the 250s \nThis was the  first year of Repsol’s sponsorship \nof the factory Honda team, as  well as  Doohan, \nwith Alex Criville and Shinichi Itoh also running in \nthe  Spanish oil  company’s colours. Barros and Puig \nrode leased Hondas, as  did  class newcomer \nLoris Capirossi. \nIt was a  promising year for Spanish riders. \nAlberto Puig had seemed to  be an  ordinary 250 \nrider, but in his second full  season in 500s he  looked \nfar from ordinary. He won at home and looked a \nlikely contender until he crashed in practice at  Le \nMans’s ultra-fast first turn and broke his left  leg very \nbadly, putting himself out  for the  rest  of the  season. \nHis  replacement in the  satellite Pons team, Carlos \nCheca, had also looked average in 250s but  also \ntook to  500s remarkably rapidly. In the  final race of \nthe year, the European GP  at  his home track, the \nCircuit de Catalunya, Checa came within five laps of \nwinning the  race, then crashed out  after a  heroic \nride, gifting the  victory to  another Spaniard —  and \nfuture 500cc World Champion —  Alex Criville. \n} \n| \nwe... \noo — \n% ;    = Nae \nms Us aft J \n~   Ub Fn \n4: \nBe \nFem |  | \ng ; i  ewe . \nABOVE Which way did  he \ngo?

There \nwere two more Repsol Hondas, this  time a  new \nV-twin, the  NSRS5OOV, in the  hands of Japanese duo \nTadayuki Okada and Shinichi Itoh. It might have \nseemed like the  same idea as  Aprilia’s twin but  it \nwasn't that simple. Where Aprilia pumped up their \n250, Honda built a  brand-new bike to the full  500cc \nlimit to take as  much benefit as  possible from the \n30kg minimum weight advantage for twins. Okada \npromptly put  it on  pole first time out. Satellite team \nNSRs went to  Alex Barros, Luca Cadalora and the \nSpanish Pons team, with Alberto Puig back from \ninjury alongside the  man who had replaced him after \nthe  accident, Carlos Checa. \nKenny Roberts and Wayne Rainey both managed \nfactory Yamaha teams. The former ran  Kenny \nRoberts Jnr, Jean-Michel Bayle (FRA) and Norick \nAbe; the  latter two former World Champions, Loris \n198 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nCapirossi on  a  500 and Tetsuya Harada on  a 250. \nAprilia’s 500  —  or  rather 410cc —  V-twin project \ncontinued with Doriano Romboni replacing Loris \nReggiani. Max Biaggi was the  factory’s only fully \nsupported works 250cc rider. He fought off  a \nsquadron of factory Hondas for  his third consecutive \ntitle. Suzuki stuck with very much the  same \nmachinery, and retained riders Aussie Daryl Beattie \nand American Scott Russell. \nAll  but two 500cc races were won by Hondas, and \none of them was the  result of Criville’s last-corner \nlunge in Australia, which took down both himself and \nDoohan to  let  in Capirossi. It could thus be argued \nthat the  only non-Repsol Honda winner in a straight \nfight was Norick Abe, who became the  first Japanese \nwinner of a Japanese GP.  It was a  reminder of that \nwild-card ride two years earlier when Abe burst on \nto the scene for the  first time. However, that was but \na  sideshow to  Doohan’s majestic progress —  and the \nimmense irritation the  persistent Criville’s back-to- \nback wins provoked in the World Champion. \nABOVE Two triple \nchampions together — \nDoohan and Biaggi.

His fellow-Honda \nV4  riders all  pressurised him at  one time or  another, \nbut  none of them could put together a consistent \nchallenge. Of the  Repsol men, Alex Criville and \nTadayuki Okada were on  V4s  while the  middle of \nthe three Aoki brothers, Takuma, took over on  the \nfactory V-twin, with older brother Nobuatsu riding \na  '96-spec NSR in FCC-Technical Sports colours. The \nMovistar team of Sito Pons retained both Carlos \nCheca and Alberto Puig. \nSuzuki's lead rider was Daryl Beattie but, still \ntroubled by injury, he had a  mediocre season and \nretired at the  end of the year. Scott Russell was \nreplaced by Anthony Gobert, a  naturally talented \nrider, but  when he failed a drug test Suzuki \nfound themselves needing the  services of another \nAustralian, tester Peter Goddard. \nYamaha's effort was somewhat shaken by Kenny \nRoberts departing to  build his own bikes and taking \nsponsor Marlboro with him, as  well as  riders Roberts \n202 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nThe Honda steamroller, driven again by \nMick Doohan, rolls to the top five places \nin the  500s; Max Biaggi joins Honda and \nwins the 250s for a fourth time \nJnr  and Frenchman Jean-Michel Bayle. When Loris \nCapirossi decided to  go  back to the  250  class Wayne \nRainey had to cast around for another rider, and \nhe signed Sete Gibernau (SPA) to  partner Norick \nAbe. Yamaha’‘s other team was essentially the  squad \nthat had taken Troy Corser to the  World Superbike \nChampionship in  1996. They partnered the  Aussie with \nLuca Cadalora early in the  season. After sponsorship \ndried up,  the WCM team took over the team’s bikes. \nKenny Roberts’s bikes were triples, allowed to  be  15kg \nlighter than a four, badged as  Modenas machines \nthanks to sponsorship from the  giant Malaysian \nProton automotive company. Aprilia’s V-twin got a  last \nrun-out, with Doriano Romboni staying as  the  rider. \nIn the  250s, Max Biaggi left Aprilia in a  huff with \nthe  intention of proving that it was the  man not  the \nbike who had  taken the  last three titles. All three \nclasses now had 26  permanent entries who were \ncontracted to  ride at all GPs. Up to six wild card \ncards were selected by the  FIM, IRTA and the local \nfederation. \nABOVE Tady Okada leads \nMick Doohan, Alex Criville \nand Takuma Aoki in a \nfactory Honda procession. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nRIGHT Jean-Michel Bayle \nabout to  set  off  on  Kenny \nRoberts’ Modenas triple. \n(Henk Keulemans) \n\ny_ 1997 \nTHE \n1997 \nSEASON \nCSAS \nESS \nFST \nELITES \nIP \nSSE \nSES \nMAL/Shah \nAlam \nINA/Sentul \nMAL/Shah \nAlam \nINA/Sentul \n™ \nMick \nDoohan \nopened \nhis \ntitle \n— \n™ \nTadayuki \nOkada \nwon \nhis \nfirst \n@ \nMax \nBiaggi \nwon \non \nhis \nfirst \n— \nBiaggi \ntook \nthe \nvictory, \nto \ngo \ndefence with victory from \nfellow-Honda riders Alex \n: Criville and 500cc debutant \nNobuatsu Aoki \nSPA/Jerez \n@ Alex Criville won the  Spanish \nGP  at Jerez for the first time \nNED/Assen \n@ Criville crashed during the \nsecond qualifying session and \nsuffered injuries that resulted \nin him missing five races \n Doriano Romboni's third \nplace was the first podium \nfinish for the V-twin Aprilia \nIMO/imola \nMick Doohan was followed \nacross the  line by Nobuatsu \nAoki and Takuma Aoki, the \nfirst time in the  class that \ntwo Japanese riders finished \ntogether on  the  podium and \nonly the  second occasion that \ntwo brothers have shared a \n500cc GP  rostrum \nGBR/Donington \n@ Alex Barros took third -  the \nonly podium finish achieved \nby a  private V-twin Honda \n500cc GP  by passing team- \nmate Doohan at the  last \ncorner and crossing the  line \nwith an  advantage of just \n0.069s \nMick Doohan’‘s second place \ngave him a  new record total \nfor a single season of 340 \npoints \nAUS/Phillip Island \n@ Mick Doohan started from \npole for the 12th time in  1997 \n—a  record that still  stands for \nmost poles in one season in \nthe  premier class \n@ Doohan crashed out  of his \nhome GP  on  lap 17 when \nleading by eight seconds, \nthe  only race all year that \nhe failed to finish on  the \npodium.

The  Spanish rider had  had a horrible accident in \npractice at Assen that  threatened to end  his career, so  it \nwas an  impressive win under any  circumstances. \nThe  team also hogged pole position: Okada was \nfastest at the  first  three GPs, Doohan at all the  rest. \nTakuma Aoki got  in on  the  action too, putting the  twin \non  the  rostrum three times. The Repsol Honda team also \nmonopolised the  rostrum on  four occasions. It wasn’t just \nthe  Repsol team that dominated, though, it was Honda \nas  a Whole. NSR500 riders finished in the  top  four places \nin the  championship, with Nobuatsu Aoki, a class rookie, \nthird overall and  his  little brother Takuma fifth on  the \ntwin. It was the  sort of domination that MV  Agusta had \nenjoyed in the  late  1950s, but then they didn’t have any \nfour-cylinder opposition. Biaggi’s win  in  the  250  class \ngave Honda their first  250/500 double in eight years and \nmeant the  only championship the  factory didn’t get  its \nhands on  was the  125  —  Valentino Rossi (Aprilia) won his \nfirst  title. \nWith hindsight this  was probably Mick Doohan at  his \nfinest. He won by a  massive points margin with four races r 2 peta     ape   a \nto  \nspare \nand  \nall \non  \nthe  \nold  \n‘screamer’ \nengine \nto \nwhich \neee \nPiet \naa \nhe’d decided to  revert.

Mick Doohan, Alex Criville and Tadayuki \nOkada all stayed as  the  Repsol Honda V4  riders, \nwhile Sete Gibernau took over the  factory V-twin \nfrom Takuma Aoki, who had been paralysed from \nthe  waist down in a testing crash. The other satellite \nHonda teams were Movistar Pons, which retained \nCarlos Checa —  and they were also given American \nJohn Kocinski, back in GPs  as  a  reward for  his World \nSuperbike Championship win —  and Team Gresini with \nrider Alex Barros, but  on  a V4  rather than a V-twin. \nYamaha again had  two teams. Wayne Rainey \nkept Norick Abe and brought in Jean-Michel Bayle, \nonly for the  Frenchman to  become another victim \nof a pre-season crash. He was replaced first by Kyoji \nNanba (UPN) and then by Luca Cadalora. WCM, \nrunning as  Red Bull Yamaha, went with Simon Crafar \n(NZE) and Regis Laconi (FRA). The Red Bull Yamahas \nwere the  only V4s  on  Dunlops rather than Michelins. \n206 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nSuzuki brought in Nobuatsu Aoki after his \nimpressive debut, and his  intended team-mate \nwas another Japanese, Katsuaki Fujiwara, but  he \ntoo  was hurt in pre-season tests. The second bike \nwas therefore ridden by Keiichi Kitagawa at the \nfirst round, and then by Yukio Kagayama, among \nothers. Kenny Roberts’s Team KR  lost  most of their \nsponsorship to  Biaggi, and their rider Bayle to  Rainey’s \nYamaha team. Kenny Jnr was retained and German \nRalf Waldmann brought in; they were the  other \nDunlop team. \nThe wild-card regulation for the  500  class was \nopened up to allow for a second entry nominated by \nthe  GP  Manufacturers’ Association. The other major \nchange was the  introduction of lead-free petrol — \n‘green gas’. \nValentino Rossi moved up to the  250  class on  a \nfactory Aprilia. Along with the  official factory team of \nTetsuya Harada and Loris Capirossi they dominated a \nposse of Hondas on  new twin-crank NSRs. Only Daijiro \nKato, a wild card at Suzuka, could win  on  it. \nABOVE Mick Doohan led \nanother Honda sweep of \nthe  top five places, but \nMax Biaggi did  get to \nhim just a  little bit.

His win  first time out  was helped by \ncircumstances, but  it served to  reignite Mick Doohan’s \nenthusiasm for  racing —  or,  rather, for  beating Max. \nThe  coming of ‘green gas’ had  several effects. First, \nit necessitated lower compression ratios and  therefore \nsoftened the  power of both fours and twins. However, it \nonly slowed down the twins and  effectively removed any \nhope they had  of being competitive, whereas flattening \nthe  peak power of the V4s  meant more people could ride \nthem nearer the  limit. Max Biaggi broke Mick Doohan’s \nSuzuka lap record by over a second at the  first  race  of the \nyear. Second, there were also  worries about how the  loss \nof the  petrol-borne lead’s lubricating properties would \naffect reliability. \nThe  more user-friendly nature of the  NSR500 certainly \nhelped Biaggi to  be instantly competitive. He  started the \nrace from pole and, as  just mentioned, set  the fastest lap \nof the  race. Doohan ran  off track early on,  at the first \ncorner, something that could only be interpreted as  rider \nerror, and  then he had  the  crankshaft break on  him  while \nhe was  climbing back through the field. This  was  the first \ntime Mick had  been let down by his bike since he came \nto  GPs. It is possible that the  motor ingested some debris \nduring its trip into  the  gravel trap, but with bulk seizures \nof 250  Aprilias in mind most mechanics worried about the \nnew fuel. \nAssisted by circumstance or  not, it’s  a measure of \nBiaggi’s feat in winning first  time out  on  a  500  that it had \nlast  been achieved by Jarno Saarinen, 25 years earlier. \nMax only won one  other race all season, at  Brno, a track \nthat suited his wheels-in-line style perfectly, but  he was \nimpeccably consistent and  ended the year second overall. \nIt also  helped that  the  Italian brought his usual abrasive \nattitude up from the  250 class, and that turned out  to  be \na major contributing reason for Mick Doohan to decide to \nkeep racing for one more year. \nki PANS \\ \n\\\\   be \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 209 \n\\F \nBELOW Max Biaggi \nexultant after winning \nat  Suzuka on  his  500cc \ndebut. (Henk Keulemans) \n\nhe  Repsol Honda team started the  year with \na familiar line-up —  Mick Doohan, Tadayuki \nOkada and Alex Criville on  V4s, with Sete Gibernau \nagain on  the  factory V-twin —  but  that all changed \nwhen Doohan fell  in practice for the  third race \nof the  year and sustained a collection of injuries \nserious enough to  persuade even this  toughest of \nmen it was time to  retire. Gibernau inherited his V4 \ntwo races later and the  Repsol V-twin was quietly \nshelved. There were two Honda satellite teams: the \nPons squad with Alex Barros and Juan Borja (SPA), \nand the  impecunious Kanemoto operation with John \nKocinski as  rider. \nYamaha lined up with two new men in the \nfactory team, both recruited from satellite Honda \nsquads: Max Biaggi and Carlos Checa. WCM (Red \nBull  Yamaha) opted to  keep Regis Laconi and Simon \nCrafar, but the  latter spectacularly failed to  come \nto terms with a switch to  Michelin tyres and was \nreplaced by ex-125 winner Garry McCoy from Assen \nonwards. A new satellite team, run  by Spanish ex-250 \n210 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nracer Luis d’Antin, got  a year-old YZR500 to  run \nNorick Abe. \nNobuatsu Aoki was retained by Suzuki, who also \nprised Kenny Roberts Jnr —  assisted by technical guru \nWarren Willing —  away from his dad’s team. They \nwere rewarded with their first wins since Beattie’s \nsuccesses in  1995. Both, note, involved beating \nDoohan fair  and square. \nTeam KR  re-employed Jean-Michel Bayle only \nto  lose him to  injury early in the  year, a fate which \nseemed to  befall everyone else they hired during \nthe  season. Aprilia brought back their V-twin after \nspending a year enlarging the  engine to  somewhere \nnear 500cc and put Tetsuya Harada on  it. It was the \nonly factory bike on  Dunlops. \nAfter Roberts and Suzuki blitzed the  first two \nraces, Alex Criville stepped into the  shoes of the \nabsent Mick Doohan and showed his six years as \nthe  great man’s understudy had not  been wasted \nto win six  races and become the  first Spanish 500cc \nWorld Champion. \nABOVE Alex Criville, \nSpain’s first 500cc \nWorld Champion.

Champions are  always fixated on  winning, \nbut  Mick piled up wins and took five  consecutive titles \nwith a  single-minded ferocity that intimidated not  just \nthe  opposition but  the  rest  of the  paddock as  well. He \nutterly dominated the  500cc class between 1994 and \n1998 with a  mixture of ruthless dedication and  physical \ncourage that few have equalled. \nIt is often claimed that he didn't have to  beat men \nof the  calibre of Rainey and  Schwantz, but  people who \nadvance this  argument should be forcibly reminded that \nMick was 53  points in front of a field containing those \ntwo as  well as  Gardner, Lawson, Kocinski and Mamola \nwhen he broke his  leg at Assen in  1992. That break \nnearly became amputation when infection set  in.  His \nrecovery and  premature comeback left  him  with severely \nrestricted movement in his  left  ankle, so  he adopted the \nthumb-operated rear brake. There were other injuries \nand  some terrifying crashes, especially at the  start of \nhis career, but  by what looked like  sheer force of will \nhe  mastered the  500 Honda and, with the  help of race \nengineer Jerry Burgess and his  mainly Aussie crew, \nshaped the  development of the  ultimate two-stroke V4. \nWhat engineers want from their rider is direction, \nand Mick always knew what he wanted and  refused \nto waste time on  distractions. Jerry Burgess took that \napproach on  to  his work with Rossi. It is also often said \nthat Mick had  the  best bike. Well, if that is true, it Is \nbecause he made it the  best bike. \nHow good was he?  Well only John Surtees, Giacomo \nAgostini and  Valentino Rossi have dominated the  top \nclass for extended periods of time in the  way Mick did. \nNot  bad  company. \n'~  \nMick \nDoohan \nwon \nfive \nsuccessive \ntitles \n—  \nthe \nonly \nother \nriders \nto \nhave \nachieved \nthis \nfeat \nare \necebkue \nand \nRossi \n-  \nDoohan \nwon \nmore \n500cc \nraces \non  \na \ntwo- \ndioke \nthan \nae \nother \nrider \n~  \nHis  \n12 \nrace \nvictories \nin \n1997 \nis \nan  \nall-time \nrecord \nfor wins in a season \n'  \nMick \nDoohan \nmade \n95 \npodium \nappearances \n— \nmore \nthan \nany \nother \nrider \nin \nthe \n500cc \nclass \n-  \nHe \nachieved \nmore \nrace \nvictories \non  \nHonda \nmachinery \nthan \nany \nother \nrider \n~  Doohan started from pole on  12 occasions in \n1997 — a record for most poles in a single season \nin the pelos class \n_  Of the 71  races Doohan started in  his five \nchampionship-winning years he finished on  the \npodium 61  times (86 per cent) and won 44 (62 \nper cent) of them \nABOVE Halfway through \nthe season Mick Doohan \nstill needed crutches to \nget  about; this picture \nwas taken at  Assen.

Alex Criville, Sete \nGibernau and Tadayuki Okada all  rode Hondas \nunder the  Repsol banner in the  factory squad. Class \nnewcomer Valentino Rossi was in  a one-man team \nsponsored by Nastro Azzurro with machinery one \nnotch down from the  works boys, while Sito Pons’s \ncustomer team ran  Alex Barros and 500-class returnee \nLoris Capirossi. \nPons’s old  sponsor Telefonica moved to the \nSuzuki team, which retained Kenny Roberts Jnr  and \nNobuatsu Aoki. Yamaha again led  with Max Biaggi \nand Carlos Checa in the  factory squad and the \nsatellite WCM team also went for continuity with \nGarry McCoy and Regis Laconi. Aprilia kept Tetsuya \nHarada on  their twin and promoted British veteran \nJeremy McWilliams from 250s. Team Roberts recruited \nyoung Spaniard David de Gea to  ride their Modenas. \nAll the  V4s  were on  Michelins. The Aprilias and \nthe  Modenas started the  season on  Dunlops but  had \nmoved over to  Michelin by the  middle of the  year, \n214 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nleaving only under-resourced privateers and V-twin \nHondas on  the  British rubber. \nIn the  250s Marco Melandri took over Rossi’s factory \nride at Aprilia and Daijiro Kato, a double GP winner \nas  a wild card, came aboard for  Honda. As  in the  500 \nclass, Yamaha kept their line-up from the  previous \nseason with Olivier Jacque and Shinya Nakano on  the \nworks bikes run  by the  French Tech 3 team. \nKenny Roberts Jnr  won the title with a brilliant mix \nof brave riding, clever tactics and bloody mindedness \n—  a  Roberts family characteristic if ever there was \none. There was no  doubt that the  Suzuki wasn’t the \nbest bike out  there, but team and rider extracted \nthe  maximum from it, and occasionally from the  rule \nbook too. Their crafty approach to  rain-interrupted \nraces caused an  unofficial revision of the  system. The \nyear was summed up  by the  way Kenny Jnr  won the \nchampionship, scoring an  underwhelming sixth in \nBrazil and  then coming out  the  following week at \nMotegi to  win by a distance on  a track that wasn’t \nsupposed to  suit  the  Suzuki. \nABOVE Kenny Jnr  on  his \nway to  becoming the  only \nson of  a World Champion \nto  himself become a \nWorld Champion.

However, they are  not  the \nonly Senior and  Junior to  have won Grands Prix. \nThe  very first 125cc World Champion, Italian Nello \nPagani, won in  1949 for  Mondial and  also rode a  Gilera \nto  second in the  500cc class. He won two 125  races (SWI, \nNED) and  two 500 GPs  (NED, ITA-NAZ) that year and \nwent on  to  manage the  MV  Agusta team. His  son  Alberto \nwon three 500cc GPs, one for  Linto (ITA-NAZ/1969) and \ntwo  on  MVs (ITA-NAZ/1971, YUG/1972). \nLes  Graham was the very first 500cc World Champion, \nriding an  AJS  Porcupine. The British rider won once on \na  125  MV  (GBR/1953), once on  a  350  AJS  (SWI/1950), \nonce on  a  350  Velocette (SWI/1951), twice in his  500cc \nchampionship year (SWI, ULS) and once in  1950 on \nthe  AJS (SWI), then twice in  1952 on  a  500 MV  (ITA- \nNAZ, SPA). In  1967 his son  Stuart won two GPs  for \nSuzuki (50cc GBR, 125  cc  FIN)  and  finished third in both \nchampionships. Stuart Graham also holds the  unique \ndistinction of have won the  Isle  of Man TT on  both two \nand  four wheels. \nThirteen-times World Champion Angel Nieto’s son \nPablo had  a  long 125cc career but won only one race \n(POR/2003). \nGraziano Rossi won three 250cc GPs in  1979 (YUG, \nNED, SWE) on  his way to third in the  championship on \na  Morbidelli. He  moved up  to  500s and  scored two \nrostrums in  1980 (ITA-NAZ, NED) on  a  Suzuki before \ninjury forced his  retirement. His  son  Valentino Is also quite \nwell known. \nThe  most recent offspring of  a GP winner is Germany’s \nStefan Bradl, winner of the  2008 125cc Czech GP.  Dad \nHelmut competed exclusively in  the  250cc class riding a \nHonda, making a  total of 84  Grand Prix  starts between \n1986 and 1993. His  best year was 1991 when he scored \nall of his five  victories (SPA, GER, AUT, CZE, FRA-VdM) \nand  finished second in the  final championship standings \nbehind Luca Cadalora. \n™~ ® \nABOVE A  little fatherly \nadvice from Roberts \nSenior to  Junior.

(Henk \nKeulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 247 \n\nANE RORT \nhe  last year of the  500s saw Valentino Rossi as \nHonda’s most favoured rider. He duly won the \nfirst three races of the year and was never headed in \nthe  points standings. The Italian again ran  on  his own \nin Nastro Azzurro’s yellow colours while the  notional \nworks team shrunk to two with only Alex Criville being \nretained but joined by 250  ace  Tohru Ukawa. The Pons \nsatellite team retained Loris Capirossi and Alex Barros \nand gained West sponsorship. The last  NSR went to \nChris Walker (GBR) but  he was gone by mid-season \nand  the team did  not  see  out  the year. \nSuzuki's defending champion Kenny Roberts Jnr \nwas joined by Sete Gibernau, but even before the \nfirst race the American was warning that the  bike was \nnowhere near being competitive: the  previous year’s \nvictory had led to assumptions that it was actually \nbetter than it was. However, the  Suzuki team-mates \nwere responsible for the  abiding images of the year. \nSete won at Valencia, in the  immediate aftermath of \nthe attack on  the Twin Towers, with ‘| Love New York’ \nwritten in tape on  his  leathers and carrying \n218 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nOne season to  learn, then win the title \nat the second attempt; Rossi won the \nlast ever 500cc championship in the same \ntimescale he’d won in 125  and 250 \nboth the American and Spanish flags to the rostrum, \nwhere third-placed Roberts wore a  New York Fire \nDepartment baseball hat. \nYamaha retained Max Biaggi and Carlos Checa \nfor the factory team for a third season, Garry McCoy \nstayed with WCM and was  joined by World Superbike \nace  Noriyuki Haga, and  the  d’Antin team went back up \nto two riders with Spaniard José Luis Cardoso joining \nNorick Abe. Team Roberts changed the  name of their \nbike to  Proton and brought in Dutch rider Jurgen van \nder Goorbergh. Two private teams, Sabre and Pulse, \nfielded V4s; the first was really a slightly updated old \nROC Yamaha, the second the  last  incarnation of the \nElf, MuZ and  Swissauto projects. The  Aprilia V-twin \ndid  not  return. \nThere was also a shrinking of factory involvement in \nthe  250  class. Yamaha handed their all-conquering 2000 \nbikes to the  Petronas team, Honda gave works bike only \nto the Gresini team of Daijiro Kato and Emilio Alzamora, \nand Aprilia’s favoured duo were old  champion Tetsuya \nHarada and young gun Marco Melandri. \nABOVE Rossi harassed by \nBiaggi —  the  story of the \nseason.

He  had never even \nbeen on  the  rostrum at  Suzuka, yet he won the  first race \nof the  2001 season (his third career win  in the  500 class) \nto  give Honda their 500th Grand Prix  win  at their home \ncircuit. HRC were desperate to  pass this  milestone at \nhome with Honda Motor Company royalty in attendance, \nand it was made very clear to  125  rider Masao Azuma \nthat he should win  or  not  bother turning up for work on \nMonday morning. His  demeanour when he just managed \nto  beat off the  challenges of Aprilia, Gilera and  Derbi \n(the next Honda was eighth) was not  the  usual delight of \naman who had  just won his  home Grand Prix.

Triples could weigh up to  135kg, four or  five \ncylinders up to  145kg, and  if six or  more cylinders were \ndesired then the weight limit was 155kg. Oval pistons \nwould attract an  extra 10kg in engines with fewer than \nsix cylinders. Two-stroke bikes of two, three and  four \ncylinders had  limits of 100, 115  and  130kg, respectively. \nThe bikes also had  to  be  prototypes, a word the  FIM \nhad  insisted on  including in the  regulations in order to \nensure clear blue water between the  new class and  the \nbikes running in the  World Superbike Championship. \nFuel-tank capacity was limited to  24  litres and \nnoise output to  130dB —  although limit isn’t quite the \nright word since the  new bikes were very, very loud. \nSome riders, notably Rossi, preferred to  use  silencers. \nTwo-strokes could only make 113dB and  could carry \n32  litres of fuel. The 25  per  cent reduction in fuel use \nfor the  new bikes, coupled to  massive performance \nincrease, showed why the  factories were willing to  put \ndevelopment budget into  the  new class but  not  into  the \nold  500cc two-strokes. \nThe  move to four-strokes meant electronic fuel \ninjection came to  motorcycle racing decades after cars \nand  engineers wrestled with the  problems of applying \nmodern digital electronics to two-wheelers. Making \npower was not  a  problem; controlling it was. Crude \ntraction control appeared, either using throttle kickers to \neffectively increase tickover in corners or  ‘dropping’ sparks \nif rear- and  front-wheel speeds differed significantly. Early \nefforts also  centred on  coping with engine braking —  or \nback torque. A variety of slipper clutches, some electrically \noperated, appeared as  ways were sought to  make 200 \nplus horsepower usable. \nOvernight, the  expertise needed to set  up  carburettors, \ncrucial to any  mechanic all through the  history of BELOW Just  how good \nmotorcycle racing, became redundant. Making the  fuel was  the  RCV? When Alex \nlast was an  issue, though, so  now the  vital men carried a Barros got  one  for the \nlaptop not  a  box  of needles and  jets. The  most astonishing last  four races of the  year \nchange was undoubtedly how two-stroke V4s, previously he  won two of them. \nregarded as  man-eaters, instantly became obsolete. (Henk Keulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 225 \n\nucati and Kawasaki entered MotoGP full  time. \nThe Bologna factory recruited Loris Capirossi \nand teamed him with their Superbike Champion, \nTroy Bayliss (AUS). Kawasaki picked up Garry McCoy \nafter WCM were unable to  guarantee him a  ride and \nteamed him  with fellow-Aussie Andrew Pitt, who \nhad ridden the  bike as  a wild card at the  end  of the \n‘02  season. Aprilia also upped their game, recruiting \ndouble Superbike Champion Colin Edwards (USA) and \nbringing Noriyuki Haga back to  GPs. \nAt  Honda reigning champ Rossi got a  new team- \nmate in Nicky Hayden —  the  youngest ever AMA \nchampion. Gresini snaffled Sete Gibernau and his \nsponsor from Suzuki to  run  alongside Daijiro Kato. \nMax Biaggi left Yamaha for a  Pons Honda, with \nTohru Ukawa moving from the  factory team to the \nsatellite squad. A seventh RCV was produced for \nMakoto Tamada who, uniquely among the  Honda \nriders, used Bridgestone tyres. Yamaha retained \nCarlos Checa and recruited Marco Melandri, Tech 3 \nkept Olivier Jacque and found a  home for Alex \n226 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nBarros while the  d’Antin team ran  Shinya Nakano. \nHaving lost  both their sponsor and Gibernau, the \nSuzuki team raced in factory colours, retaining Kenny \nRoberts Jnr for a fifth season and recruiting American \nteenager John Hopkins. The WCM team also lost their \nsponsor, and their Yamahas, so  they built their own \nbikes. As they initially used engine castings from a \nproduction bike, they fell  foul of the  scrutineers and \nran  their old two-strokes until they could produce \ntheir own crankcases, cylinders and heads. \nRossi and Honda were even more dominant than \nthey'd been in the first year of the MotoGP formula, \nwinning nine races, starting from pole nine times \nand finishing on  the  rostrum in every race. Valentino \nset  the  fastest lap of the  race 12 times, with a  new \nlap record each time. Yamaha, their riders hit  by \nearly-season injuries, managed only one rostrum all \nyear. The only non-Honda victory came when Loris \nCapirossi took advantage of a  rare Rossi error at \nBarcelona to give Ducati a victory in only their sixth \nrace in the top class. \nABOVE Daijiro Kato, \nHonda’s great hope for  a \nJapanese champion, who \ndied at  Suzuka.

The  factory \nwas on  the  longest run  in its history without a top-class \npodium, and  they hadn’t won a  MotoGP race since Max \nBiaggi’s victory in Malaysia towards the  end  of the  2002 \nseason. (It was also  Yamaha's longest ever time without a \nwin  across all the  GP  classes.) \nThe invaluable contribution of race engineer Jerry \nBurgess and his mainly Australian pit crew to Valentino \nRossi's GP campaign in 2004 cannot be overstated either. \nValentino had  expended considerable effort in persuading \nthem to  move to  Yamaha with him, where Burgess’s \nability to distil complex situations down to the  one  or \ntwo vital factors that he could do something about was \nsecond to  none. The  team gave Rossi a  bike that worked \nin the  places where it would enable him  to win, while the \nrider himself could ride  around problems on  other parts \nof the track. Yamaha moved Masao Furusawa to  head \nthe  project: he had  already hit on  his  irregular-firing-order \ncrankshaft design and  four-valves per  cylinder as  the way \nto  go.  Rossi concurred the  first  time he tested the  motor. \nIn the  tradition of Yamaha's 500c, the  M1  was never the \nfastest bike on  track but  it worked well everywhere. \nNevertheless, no-one seriously thought Rossi could \ntake the title. In fact, most paddock debate centred \non  whether he could even win  one  race in his first \nseason with Yamaha, so  by winning the very first race \nof the year, in South Africa, he effectively removed any \nlingering doubts about his  right to  be considered one \nof the  all-time greats. He also made it four crowns in a \nrow, something only Agostini, Hailwood and Doohan \nhad  achieved. Geoff Duke, Giacomo Agostini and  Eddie \nLawson had  previously won titles on  different makes of \nbike, but  only Lawson achieved that feat in consecutive \nyears. Valentino's win  at Welkom also beat Ago’s record \nfor consecutive podiums. \nRossi’s only serious challenger in  both 2003 and  ‘04 \nwas Sete Gibernau, the  second most successful rider \nof the  990cc years with eight wins. When Valentino \nwas relegated to  the  back of the  grid for the  Qatar GP \nbecause his  pit crew illegally cleaned his starting spot, he \nblamed Gibernau and his crew. Rossi crashed in the  race \nwhile chasing the  Spaniard, but  said afterwards that Sete \nwould never win  another race ...  what became known as \nthe  ‘Curse of Qatar’ appeared to  work. A week later Rossi \nwon in Malaysia and, on  the  slow-down lap,  he stopped \nto take a broom from a  marshal and  proceeded to  sweep \nthe  track for the  benefit of the  assembled photographers. \nABOVE Taking the  flag at \nWelkom for  that debut \nwin on  the Yamaha. (Henk \nKeulemans) \nLEFT The first test — \nyou could say  Rossi \nand Burgess have the \nundivided attention of \nYamaha's engineers. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 233 \n\nMe a \nalentino Rossi got a new Yamaha team-mate in \nthe  shape of Colin Edwards, the  Texan’s third \ndifferent team in his three years in MotoGP, with both \nmen running in Gauloises colours. Satellite outfit Tech \n3 was Fortuna branded and used as  a junior team for \ntwo promising young Spaniards, rookie Toni Elias and \nRuben Xaus. \nRepsol Honda brought in Max Biaggi as  team-mate \nto  Nicky Hayden while the  Gresini team retained \nSete Gibernau and signed Marco Melandri, whose \nrelationship with Yamaha had broken down half-way \nthrough the  previous season. Alex Barros was demoted \nfrom the  factory team to the  satellite Pons outfit and \npartnered with Troy Bayliss, out  of the  Ducati family \nfor the  first time in his World Championship career. \nWhen Bayliss was injured, late in the year, the team \nused a variety of replacements: Shane Byrne, Tohru \nUkawa, Aussie Chris Vermeulen and Ryuichi Kiyonari. \nA new team, JiR  Japan Italy Racing), was formed to \nrun  Makoto Tamada on  a seventh Honda with Konica \nMinolta sponsorship. \n234 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nLoris Capirossi was retained by Ducati, with Carlos \nCheca replacing Bayliss, and Roberto Rolfo moving \nup from 250s to  be d’Antin’s lone entry on  a year-old \nDucati. Kawasaki and Suzuki retained their riders: \nKenny Roberts Jnr  and  John Hopkins in blue, Shinya \nNakano and Alex Hofmann in green. WCM fielded \nJames Ellison (GBR) and Franco Battaini (ITA). Team \nKR started the  year with KTM engines, but that \nrelationship had  soured terminally by the  Czech GP. \nJeremy McWilliams rode the  bike at  Brno using the \nteam’s own V5,  as  did  Kurtis Roberts at Valencia. \nThe major surprise of the  year was Ducati switching \ntheir works team from Michelin to  Bridgestone \ntyres. Clearly this  was a  gamble, but  a clever one. \nThe  thinking went something like this: we  cannot \nbeat Rossi with the  same equipment so  we  will  use \nsomething different; that way although we  may be \nat a disadvantage at some tracks there will be others \nwhere we  have a vital advantage. Kawasaki and Suzuki \ncontinued to  run  Bridgestones, WCM and d’Antin were \non  Dunlops, and everyone else used Michelins. \nABOVE The pivotal \nmoment of the  year came \non  the last  corner of \nthe  first race when Rossi \nbarged past Sete Gibernau \nfor  the win.

No  computer would ever \nhave laid  out  the  high-speed snake of tarmac behind the \npits —  the Veenslang —  let alone retained the  crown in  the \nroad that complicated things so  much for  riders. Despite \nhaving nothing that could honestly be called a straight, \nAssen remained the  fastest track on  the  calendar. Rossi’s \nlap record from 2004 stood at  nearly 113mph/182km/h. \nLEFT The classic Assen layout \nused from 1984 to  2005: the \ncorner at  the bottom of the \npicture is the Duikersloot \nright-hander that is followed \nby the  ultra-fast run  back \nto  the final chicane.

This time, instead of going for experience, \ndouble 250  World Champion Dani Pedrosa moved \nup to the top  class, leaving Max Biaggi without a \nride. The Ducati factory team went for experience on \nboth sides of the  garage, bringing in Sete Gibernau \nto  partner Loris Capirossi. Kawasaki also went for a \nmix  of experience and a young gun up from the  250s, \nkeeping Shinya Nakano and signing Randy de  Puniet \n(FRA). Suzuki retained John Hopkins but  brought in \ntheir new blood from World Superbike in the  shape \nof 2005 runner-up Chris Vermeulen (AUS). \nGresini, now obviously Honda’s senior satellite \nteam, kept Marco Melandri and got Toni Elias (and his \nsponsor, Fortuna) from Yamaha. Lucio Cecchinello’s \nLCR  Honda team moved up from the  smaller classes \nwith an  RCV for Casey Stoner, while JiR again fielded \nMakoto Tamada. Honda’s most intriguing move was \nto  supply engines to Team KR to wrap their own \n238 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \neee ne ee ee eS eT eR chassis around, thus coming up with the  only truly \ncompetitive machine they ever had. Kenny Roberts Jnr \nrode it. \nThe d’Antin satellite team had  two bikes on  the \ngrid, year-old Ducatis for Alex Hofmann and José Luis \nCardoso (SPA). Tech 3 Yamaha only got back on  the \ngrid with the  help of Dunlop and Carlos Checa, who \nrode for free, alongside James Ellison. \nFor  once, the  Rossi/Yamaha/Burgess axis did  not \ncome up with an  improved motorcycle. Overheating, \nbreakdowns and the  first glimmerings of a far- \nreaching feud with Michelin had an  effect. This could \nhave been the  year Loris Capirossi added to  his  125 \nand 250cc titles, but  a  massive crash at the  first corner \nof the  Catalan GP  ripped the  heart out  of his season. \nHis form did  show, however, that it was now possible \nto win the  title on  a tyre other than a  Michelin. \nIn a thrilling end to the  season Nicky Hayden \novercame all  manner of obstacles —-  developing a  new \nbike on  his own, being knocked off  by his team-mate \n—  to win  the  last world title of the  990cc formula. \nABOVE Despite riding a \nprototype that no  other \nHonda rider used, Nicky \nHayden was consistent \nenough to  take the  title \nat  the last round.

Valentino Rossi won on  a  Honda and  a \nYamaha, as  did  Max Biaggi. With hindsight, Biaggi’s \ntwo wins in the  first year of MotoGP look better and \nbetter —  the  Yamaha didn’t win  again until Rossi got \non  it —  but  Max never put a sustained championship \nchallenge together. Biaggi and Rossi were the  only men \nto win on  the  990cc M1. However, the  Honda RC211V \nalso carried Tohru Ukawa, Alex Barros, Sete Gibernau, \nMakoto Tamada, Nicky Hayden, Marco Melandri, Dani \nPedrosa and  Toni Elias to victory. The  factory 990cc \nDucati Desmosedici was only ridden by four men and \ntwo of them won on  it —  Loris Capirossi and  Troy Bayliss \n—  although the  Aussie three-times World Superbike \nChampion won as  a  replacement rider in the  very last  race \nof 2006, not  when he was  a  regular. \nThat means only a dozen men stood on  top  of the \nrostrum in that  time, and  three of them did  so  only \nonce, two of them twice, which makes Rossi's tally of 45 \nwins from the  82  races quite astounding. The next most \nsuccessful was Sete Gibernau, with eight wins, one  of the \nvery few riders to  beat Rossi when there were no  weather \nor  machinery factors distorting the  picture. His  2003 wins \nin South Africa and Germany were the  highlights. \nIn their five  years the  990cc four-strokes obliterated \nevery record set  by the  old  two-strokes. On  tracks that \nremained unaltered and  in races unaffected by weather, \nrace times fell  by an  average of 1m  28s  (3.24 per  cent) \nand lap records by 3.4s (3.19 per  cent). Qualifying tyres \nreduced the  average pole time by even more: 3.7s. This \nmeans a  MotoGP machine would on  average take 31  laps \nto  gain a full  lap on  the  best 500. The  biggest reduction \nin the  record lap time was at  Donington Park, (3.9s), the \nsmallest Phillip Island (2.4s), a  reflection of the  nature of \nthe  two tracks. Donington’s stop/start final section was \ntricky for  500s, Phillip Island’s sweepers enabled them to \nmaintain corner speed. \nAll  this  was done on a third less  petro! than the \nstrokers, but  the  rate  of progress is  best shown by the  fact \nthat in the  five  years of the  990 era  there were only four \ndry races where the  lap record was not  broken. \nABOVE The first and \nlast V5  motors. (Henk \nKeulemans) \nBELOW HRC lined up \nevery version of the \nRC211V at  Motegi. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 244 \n\nA s the  regulations underwent the  biggest \nupheaval since the  introduction of MotoGP, \nteams tried to  limit the  number of variables by \nretaining both their riders and their brand of tyre. \nThe Honda, Yamaha and Suzuki factory teams did just \nthat, as  did  Gresini Honda. Hayden, Pedrosa, Rossi, \nEdwards, Capirossi, Hopkins, Vermeulen, Elias and \nMelandri all stayed where they had been in 2006. \nTeam KR  also kept their rider, Kenny Roberts Jnr, and \ntheir link  with Honda, but  all did  not  go well and the \nyounger Roberts brother, Kurtis, joined in at  Mugello \nand then saw out  the  season as  the  team’s lone rider \nafter Junior's retirement. \nDucati had to find a  new rider to  replace the \nretired Sete Gibernau and ended up with a  man \nrumoured to  be their third choice: Casey Stoner. The \nAussie was in turn replaced at  LCR Honda by Carlos \nCheca in what would be the  Spanish veteran’s last \nseason in MotoGP. Randy de  Puniet stayed with the \nfactory Kawasaki team and was, originally, joined by \nhis fellow-countryman Olivier Jacque, lured back to \n242 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nThe  800cc formula arrived, and Casey Stoner \nand the  Ducati Desmosedici wiped the floor \nwith the Japanese factories \nracing from his  preferred role as  a test rider. OJ  didn’t \nlast past the Catalan GP,  however, a  succession of \ncrashes reminding him of why he’d retired the \nfirst time round. Anthony West (AUS) eventually \nreplaced him. \nThe satellite teams, Gresini excepted, shuffled \nriders. Nakano replaced Tamada at JiR for  his first ride \non  a  Honda, while Tamada went to Tech 3 for  his first \ngo on  a Yamaha. He  was joined by top  250 privateer \nSylvain Guintoli (FRA). The d‘Antin Ducati team kept \nAlex Hofmann, although his season would be  blighted \nby serious injury, and brought veteran Alex Barros \nback from World Superbike for a  last  Grand Prix \nseason. He  and the  two Gresini men were the  only \nsatellite team riders to  stand on  the rostrum all  season. \nAfter their hopeful try-outs in the  final two races \nof 2006 the  Ilmor team returned with veterans Jeremy \nMcWilliams and Andrew Pitt  as  riders.

Only Honda had a totally new motorcycle, a V4 \ninstead of a V5.  All the  other factories re-engineered their \nbikes but  stuck to their existing designs. \nThe  first change meant bikes no  longer had  an  excess \nof power and now relied on  high corner speed, much \nlike  a pumped-up 250. The  fuel restriction had  a  greater \neffect than most people predicted, making ignition \nmapping and  engine management the  crucial part of race \nset-up. As for the  tyres, riders were now restricted to  31 \ntyres per  weekend, split 14/17 front/rear, to  be selected \non  a Thursday evening and barcoded by the  MotoGP \nscrutineer, Mike Webb. This rule  only applied to tyre \ncompanies that had  won races in the  past two years, so \nthe  Tech 3 Yamaha riders, the  only Dunlop users, had  no \nsuch restrictions. There was no  limit on  the  number of \nwet-weather tyres. \nThis rule  obviously favoured the  manufacturer that \ncould produce tyres which worked over a  broad spectrum \nof conditions —  and  that happened to  be Bridgestone. The \nJapanese company had  always worked that way, whereas \nMichelin, thanks to the  proximity of their Clermont- \nFerrand factory to  most European tracks, were known to \nmanufacture new tyres overnight and  thus could afford \nto  make their rubber work superbly in a very narrow \ntemperature or  humidity range. \nOne, and only one, combination of rider, tyre and \nmotorcycle got everything right. At the  first race of the \nyear Casey Stoner motored past Rossi's Yamaha on  the \nfront straight as  if the  Italian were on  a  250; Ducati \nhad  got their fuel  usage optimised, but  only the  Aussie \ncould use  the  peaky motor that was the  trade-off for \n_.

His  Bridgestone tyres, while not  perfect \neverywhere, did  a good job. Rossi and Michelin were \nfalling out  with each other, as  the  shadow of a financial \nscandal fell  across the  Italian. Valentino may have had  his \nproblems and distractions, but  there was no  doubt Stoner \nand  Ducati were the  perfect combination in 2007. \n__  Stoner’s MotoGP victory in Qatar made him the \nyoungest Australian rider to win-in the top class, \ntaking the  record from Daryl Beattie, and  the first \nAustralian to win in all three current GP classes \n|  His points total for 2007 — 367 - ccudiea the \nhighest ever single-season total, achieved by \nValentino Rossi in 2005 \n|  Stoner set a new record in  2007 of 18 points- \nscoring finishes in a single season \nABOVE Stoner drove \naway from the opposition \nat  Qatar like they were \nstanding still.

There was a  new man at the  factory \nYamaha team, too, double 250  World Champion Jorge \nLorenzo. His  arrival meant Colin Edwards moved to \nTech 3 to team with another new boy, British double \nWorld Superbike Champion James Toseland. Honda \nstuck with Dani Pedrosa and Nicky Hayden in the \nfactory team, but  changed both Gresini riders: Shinya \nNakano, whom the  factory thought deserved another \nyear, came in alongside another rookie, Alex de \nAngelis (RSM). JiR formed an  alliance with the Scott \nteam to  bring another 250  ace  to  MotoGP, Italian \nAndrea Dovizioso. Team KR,  after a disastrous 2007, \ncould not  raise the  budget to  race in ‘08. \nThe big-money signing was John Hopkins’s move \nfrom Suzuki to  Kawasaki; Anthony West, who'd \nstepped in mid-way through '07,  kept his job on  the \ngreen bike. Hopper’s seat at Suzuki was taken by Loris \nCapirossi, with Chris Vermeulen staying for  his third \n246 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nyear with the team. Randy de  Puniet moved from \nKawasaki to the  LCR  Honda satellite team. Ducati’s \nsatellite team started the  season under the  direction \nof Spanish founder Luis d’Antin, but when he was \nlevered out  after the  German GP the  Bologna factory \nstarted the  process of bringing the  operation closer \nto  home. \nThe big subject of the  year was tyres. Michelin had \na trio  of disasters in the  middle of the  season, and \nwith Rossi having engineered a switch to  Bridgestone \nover winter (for him, not for  his team-mate) \nmomentum was building for the  move to  a single \ntyre supplier. When, after the  San  Marino GP,  Dani \nPedrosa announced that he too  (but not  his team- \nmate) would be switching brands with immediate \neffect the  deal was all  but  done. \nEvery factory except Honda now used pneumatic \nvalve springs. HRC sent Tadayuki Okada to  Mugello \nto give their system its first outing, and Nicky Hayden \nfinally got to  race with them at Assen. Satellite \nHondas used conventional engines all season. \nABOVE Rossi and crew \ncelebrate his  record- \nbreaking win on  the \nIndianapolis Motor \nSpeedway’s line of bricks. \n(Henk Keulemans) \n\nTHE \n2008 \nSEASON \nCi \neee \nese) \nPISS \nES \nFosse \nLSS \nQAT/Losail \n@ Jorge Lorenzo became the \nfirst rookie to start from pole \nin his first premier-class GP \nsince Max Biaggi in  1998 \n@ The average age of the three \nriders finishing on  the  podium \n(Stoner, Lorenzo and Pedrosa) \nwas just 21  years 47  weeks — \nthe youngest ever podium in \nthe  premier class \nSPA/Jerez \n@ Dani Pedrosa’s win took \nhim to the top of the \nchampionship for the  first \ntime.

Just  how tough can \nbe gauged from the  fact  that only one  other rider, \nGiacomo Agostini, regained the  top-class title after \ntwo fallow years. On  the  way to  equalling one  of Ago’s \nachievements, Valentino broke another even more \nsignificant record. His win  at  Indianapolis was Rossi’s \n69th in the  top class, a  new record. Another of Ago’s \nrecord totals, 159 podiums in all classes, was in danger \nas  well, because this  was Rossi's 147th top-three finish \nacross all classes. \nAgostini won 68  500cc GPs  from 119  starts, a strike \nrate  of 57.1 per  cent, while Valentino’s 69  win  from 146 \nstarts equates to  47.2 per  cent, but  do the  calculation \nfor  rostrum finishes and Vale comes out  on  top, with \n76 versus 74  per  cent. However, Rossi himself has  said \nthat Agostini’s total of 122  wins and 15 world titles are \nprobably out  of reach. \nThe  win  at  Motegi gave Rossi his sixth title  in the \npremier class, one clear of Mick Doohan’s total, leaving \nonly Agostini with eight ahead of him. Add in Rossi's 125 \nand  250 titles to  get the  total of eight championships \nand  he has  only been beaten by Mike Hailwood and \nCarlo Ubbiali (9 titles apiece), Angel Nieto (13)  and, of \ncourse, Agostini (15). Rossi’s first title came in  1997, and \nonly Angel Nieto’s championship career was longer: the \nSpanish star  won the  50cc title in  1969 and  his final title \nwas the  125cc crown in  1984. \nThis was Rossi’s first  title under the  800cc MotoGP \nformula, so  he  became the  first man to take the  title  on \nfour different types of motorcycle, the  others being 990cc \nYamaha M1, Honda RC211V V5  and the  Honda NSR50O \ntwo-stroke. The  thing that pleased Valentino as  much as \nanything was that this  was his  37th win  and  third title  for \nYamaha, more than he achieved with any  other factory. \nHe  is Yamaha's most successful rider of all time (Eddie \nLawson won 26  GPs and three titles) and the  man himself \nis more than content that this  means he will  now be \nremembered as  a Yamaha rider. \nLEFT The best crash \nhelmet design ever? \nRossi's special self-portrait \nfor  the Mugello GP.

And, in addition, carefully chosen \nphotographs accompany each year. \nYear by year, the  MotoGP Source Book \nchronicles the  changing landscape of \nWorld Championship motorcycle racing \nin terms of the  machinery, the tracks and \nthe  politics. There was initial dominance \nby European manufacturers, especially \nItalian and British ones, but NSU of \nGermany briefly reigned with efficient, \nhigh-technology designs at a time when \nthe  German industry was the  largest in \nthe world. Then, of course, came the \nJapanese, spearheaded by Honda, and \ninto the  21st Century we  have seen the \nrevolution that is MotoGP. \nThen there are  the  riders. From \nthe  first 500cc Champion, Les  Graham, \nvia the  most successful racer ever, \nGiacomo Agostini, and the  legendary \nMike Hailwood, to Valentino Rossi, \nthis  book gives insights into the \nachievements of some of the  greatest \never motorsport heroes. \nCompiled by two co-authors \nrenowned for their knowledge and \nauthority, the  MotoGP Source Book is \nthe  ultimate reference book for \nmotorcycle racing fans. \n£30.00"

      "text": "INTRODUCTION \nJulian \nRyder \nand \nMartin \nRaines \nexplain \nthis \nbook’s \nunique \napproach \nto \nrecording \nGrand \nPrix \nmotorcycle \nracing’s \nfirst \n60 \nyears \noO ur  objective in writing this  book was to \nchronicle the  history of Grand Prix motorcycle \nracing's first 60 years in a way that would give \ntoday’s fan  an  insight into and feeling for the \nhistory of the  sport. Hopefully, you will be able \nto  recognise and follow trends in machinery \ndevelopment, riders’ careers, circuit safety, race \norganisation and other aspects as  well as  spotting \nthe  major landmarks such as  the  change from 500cc \nto  MotoGP. \nWe  have also attempted to  provide the most \naccurate record possible of the  first 60 years of \nmotorcycle Grand Prix racing within, of course, \ncertain constraints. Chief among them is space. Four \npages per  year was the  only sensible choice in a \nbook of this size, so  then we  had to  decide what to \nput on  those four pages. We  decided on  two short \nelements of text, the  first of which appears on  the \nopening spread for  each year and lists  the  major \nplayers on  factory bikes plus any important changes \nin regulations. The second story, printed on  the \nsecond spread, explores the  most significant event \nof the  year in deeper detail. The remainder of the \nfirst spread is taken up with bullet points for each \nclass: incidents that shaped the  season, statistics, \nlandmark events in the  careers of individual riders \nor  the  history of a  racing marque. On  the  second \nspread you will  find a full  championship table for \nthe  500cc/MotoGP class plus the  top ten  in all  other \nsolo classes. \nIn  presenting this information, we  had to  make \nsome decisions on  what we  could and couldn't do. \nHere are  the  ones you need to  know about: \nGRAND PRIX \nA Grand Prix is a  race that has  been part of the \nFIM  Grand Prix  World Championship. We  have not \nincluded the  sidecar class or  F750, or  any  other class \nwhether or  not  it had World Championship status. \nNAMES \nWe  have used the  form of address the rider \npreferred. Hence Les, not  Leslie, Graham; Tepi, \nnot Teuvo, Lansivuori; and Max, not Massimiliano, \nBiaggi. \nNATIONALITIES \nWe  have tried to  give a  rider’s nationality rather \nthan the  country in which he took out  his  racing \nlicence. Hence some riders born in  Northern Ireland \nhave been listed as  British, though they may have \nbeen described as  Irish by other sources. In cases \nwhere a  rider was born in one country and brought \nup  in another, such as  Gary Hocking or  Jim \nRedman, we  have used the  nationality the  rider \nofficially adopted. Three-letter abbreviations \nfor  countries and nationalities follow the  ISO's \nrecommendations. \nBIKE NAMES \nWe  have endeavoured to  give the  make of bike \nused. This is not  always a  simple matter, especially \nin the  50/80cc class where many machines were \neffectively home-made, or  in the  heyday of 250 \nand 350 TZ  Yamahas where a  variety of proprietary \nframes were used, often with heavily modified \nengines. The only names we  have specifically \nexcluded are  those adopted direct from a  sponsor. \nOPPOSITE On  their way \nto  the  first ever Grand \nPrix. Les  Graham, the first \n500cc World Champion, \nand his  team-mate Bill \nDoran push the  works AJS \nup  the  gang plank of the \nIsle of  Man ferry. (Doran \nFamily Collection) \nLEFT Triple World \nChampion Werner Haas, \nGermany’s first Champion \nand the lead rider in  NSU’s \ndomination of the  early \n1950s 250 and 125 classes. \n(Stuart Dent Archive) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 7"

      "text": "We  have used the  title of the  Grand Prix, except \nin the  case of the  Grand Prix of Nations, as  the \nGP  held in  Italy was called from 1949 to  ‘90.  This \nwas effectively the  Italian GP,  so  we  have tagged \nit as  ITA  in table headings as  there was no  other \nGP  held on  Italian soil. We  are  well aware that \nthe  British race was until 1976 the  Isle  of Man TT \nand the  Dutch GP  still  is, officially, the  Dutch TT. \nHowever, for  simplicity we  call  them all  GPs. \nThe situation is more complicated where more \nthan one GP  was held in one country during \none season. Where these were scheduled races, \nthey were usually first given the  names of other \ncountries (such as  San Marino) then of regions (the \nPacific GP for the  second race held in Japan) or \ncities (Catalunya and Valencia for  races in Spain). \nOne-off events, usually to  replace races cancelled \nat  short notice, usually received odd names like \nVitesse du  Mans or  the  FIM GP. \nWhere we  say  that a  rider was the  ‘youngest \never’ or  ‘oldest ever’ we  mean that was the  case \nat the end of the relevant season. For  instance, in \n1989 when we  say  Alex Criville was the  youngest \n8  MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \never World Champion we  mean as  of the  end of \nthat season. Obviously, as  you get towards more \nrecent years that record is more likely to  stand, for \ninstance Scott Redding’s record as  the  youngest \never GP  winner set  at  Donington Park in  2008. \nThere have been several systems over the past 60 \nyears, and the  one in force for  each year is noted \non  the  championship tables. \nWhere riders finished on  equal points, there \nhave been two systems of tiebreaker. Until 1964, \nwhen not  all  results were counted, the  system \ntook into account the  best discarded result. \nFrom 1965 onwards, there has  been a different \nsystem that compares riders’ best scoring results \nor  number of wins, or  second places, and so  on. \nThis obtained whether a  net  or  gross scoring \nsystem was in force; in other words after 1964 \ndiscarded results were not  used to  split riders \ntied on  points. \nMany people have helped in trying to  make this \nbook as  accurate as  possible. In  particular, the \nauthors would like  to  thank the  following: \nABOVE Jarno Saarinen \nabout to  start his  first race \nas  World Champion —  the \nFrench 250cc GP  of  1973 \nat  Paul Ricard.

Nello \nPagani, the  most experienced and reliable of the \nteam’s riders, was kept on  the  single-cylinder \nSaturno until Assen thanks to  his  prickly relationship \nwith designer Piero Remor. \nThere was a second Italian 500, Moto Guzzi’s \n120-degree V-twin but, despite being raced by \nEnrico Lorenzetti, the  factory's longest-serving \nrider, the  bike was outclassed. BMW, who had been \nvery competitive before the  Second World War — \nsupercharged Boxer BMWs finished first and second \nin the  1939 TT -  were banned from taking part, \nalong with the  other German factories like  DKW. \nAJS  fielded British riders Les  Graham, Ted Frend \nand Jock West, all  stars of pre-war racing, alongside \nBill  Doran who had impressed with second place \nat the  ‘48 TT  on  a  private Norton. Ireland’s Reg \n10 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nArmstrong also rode in the  350s. Norton fielded a \nvariable number of works bikes —  seven in Ulster! \n—  but their contracted British riders were Artie Bell \nand Johnny Lockett in the  500s and Harold Daniell \nin the  350s. Velocette had DOHC versions of their \npre-war singles in both big classes, but  only the  350 \nwas competitive. \nThe 250 class was dominated by Moto Guzzi and \ntheir Gamablunghino (‘Little Long Legs’) flat  single. \nAs well as  Italian works rider Bruno Ruffo, stars like \nIrishman Manliff Barrington (a protégé of the  great \n1930s star Stanley Woods) and the  veteran Scottish \nracer/journalist Fergus Anderson rode Guzzis. Only \nthe  Benellis of Italians Dario Ambrosini and Umberto \nMasetti offered a  challenge to their rival marque. \nIn the 125s three Italian factories -  MV  Agusta, \nMondial and Morini —  fought it out. Only Mondial \nused a four-stroke, a  beautiful DOHC single; the \nother two were two-strokes (yes, an  MV  stroker) but \nby the  following season both Morini and MV  had \nsimilar designs on  track. \nABOVE Les  Graham and \nthe  twin-cylinder AJS E90 \nPorcupine on  the  way \nto  winning the Dutch \nTT  at  Assen.

All  the  motorcycles and  their riders would have \nbeen at  home on  a  pre-1939 grid. In the  1930s, forced \ninduction was the  way to go,  so  AJS’s E90  twin and \nGilera’s four were both designed with supercharging in \nmind, but  that was banned after the  war. \nA look at the  grid shows that telescopic forks and \nhydraulic rear  suspension were far from the  norm on  a \n500, let alone a  125, and  that streamlining was a thing of \nthe  future. In fact, the  British factories were vehemently \nagainst any  type of fairing on  the  grounds that fairings \nhad  no  relevance to  road-going motorcycles. Weight \nwas carried far  back —  ‘for traction’ —  and  handlebars \nwere flat;  to  modern eyes the  first  World Championship- \nwinning motorcycles look like  antiques. But  things \nchanged very quickly. \nThe  racetracks, however, did  not  change. There \nwere only six venues for the  first  championship, all of \nthem in Europe: the  Isle  of Man, Berne, Assen, Spa- \nFrancorchamps, Clady and Monza. Only Monza was a \npurpose-built circuit; closed roads and their attendant \ndangers would be the  norm for two decades and more. \nA second factor foreign to the  modern spectator was \nthat not  every event ran  every class, with only the  500s \nappearing at every round in  1949. The 350 championship \nconsisted of five  rounds, the  250  four and  the  125  only \nthree events. Championship rounds would multiply, but \nit would be well into  the  1980s before it was normal to \nsee  every class at  every venue. Indeed, it was common for \neven factory teams to  miss races that  were too  expensive, \nor  too  dangerous, until the  demise of the  Isle  of Man TT \nas  a  Grand Prix  World Championship round in  1976. \nHowever, the  importance of the  TT to  the  whole \nindustry, not  just the  British factories, cannot be \noverstated. It was regarded, both before and  after the \nSecond World War, as  the  ultimate test. The Italian GP, \nor  the  Gran Premio delle Nazioni, as  it was called, ran  It \na very close second, especially, of course, for the  Italian \nfactories. \nThe  third oddity to  modern eyes was  the fact that \nracers not  only rode in more than one  class but also for \nmore than one  factory. It was common for  riders to  have \na factory contract for the  500s, say with Gilera, yet ride  a \nMondial in the  125s. That was  exactly what Nello Pagani \ndid  for this  first  season, finishing runner-up in the  big class \nand  World Champion in the  little one. \nOPPOSITE The first 250cc \nWorld Champion Bruno \nRuffo (ITA) ready for  the \nstart of the  Italian GP \nat  Monza with his  Moto \nGuzzi single.

      "text": "orton attacked the  Italians in the  500  class \nwith a  new rider and a  new motorcycle. Geoff \nDuke joined Artie Bell  and Johnny Lockett and the  old \n‘garden gate’ chassis was replaced by the  revolutionary \nnew twin-loop frame dubbed the  ‘Featherbed’ by the \nveteran Harold Daniell, who retired at the  end  of the \nyear. The combination was immediately a sensation: \nTT race and lap records were smashed and Norton \nmonopolised the  rostrum in the  500  and 350cc races. \nHowever, Gilera did  not  send their team to the Isle \nof Man, well aware of both the difficulty of beating the \nBritish racers who'd grown up on  the  Mountain circuit \nand the  expense of attending the  event. They hit back \nat the second round, Spa, with a  relatively unknown \nnew man, Umberto Masetti, replacing Arciso Artesiani. \nNello Pagani and Carlo Bandirola were retained with \nthe team under the  management of the great polymath \nPiero Taruffi following Piero Remor’s acrimonious \ndeparture to  MV where Count Domenico Agusta \nwas anxious to enter the  500cc class. Not  surprisingly, \nRemor built him  an  across-the-frame four not  unlike \n14 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nthe  Gilera. However, the  rest  of the  machine was far \nfrom orthodox. The gearbox was aligned down the  axis \nof the bike, the final drive was by shaft and the rear \nsuspension by friction damper. Artesiani was  the  rider. \nAJS  lost  Bill  Doran for the  season when he  broke \nhis  leg in practice for the TT,  so  Les  Graham was \nbacked up  by Ted Frend. In the  350cc class, 1949 \nWorld Champion Freddie Frith had retired so  Bob \nFoster was joined at Velocette by Reg Armstrong (IRL) \nand Bill  Lomas, with Foster retaining the  title for the \nfactory. The other contenders were Norton and AJS, \nwith their 500cc class riders doubling up. \nThe two smallest classes were almost exclusively \nItalian affairs. Benelli and Moto Guzzi contested the \n250s with DOHC and SOHC singles, respectively. The \nBenelli was much more sophisticated, the  Guzzi had \nreliability on  its side, but the  factory withdrew before \nthe  end of the  year to  develop a  DOHC four-valve \nmotor. Mondial dominated the 125  class with their \nDOHC single, Morini providing some opposition with \ntheir chain-driven SOHC single. \nABOVE Flat, fast and with \nan  audience well in  excess \nof  100,000; it could only \nbe  Assen.

In fact, the  design can  be traced back to \ntwo newly graduated engineering students, Carlo Gianni \nand Piero Remor, who built a number of across-the- \nframe four motors in the  1920s under the  patronage of \nvarious noblemen. As far as  is known, these were the  first \nacross-the-frame fours ever built. According to  Raymond \nAinscoe’s history Gilera Road Racers (Osprey, 1987) they \nwere getting the  bike to  rev  to  7000rpm in  1928 but \nwithout the  reliability to win  races despite having the \ngreat Piero Taruffi riding. (Taruffi was an  engineer, Italian \n500cc champion, international tennis player, summer and \nwinter Olympian, Mille Miglia and  Targa Floria winner, \nfactory Ferrari and  Mercedes driver, and  holder of 50 \nspeed records on  two, three and  four wheels.) \nIn  1934, with Taruffi now a co-designer as  well as \nteam-manager, the  bike was reborn under the  banner of \nthe  CNA aeroplane company as  the  Rondine (‘swallow’ in \nItalian). The  52x58mm water-cooled motor had  a semi- \nautomatic gearbox and  a Taruffi-designed supercharger, \nand  the  cylinders were inclined forward at a very \nmodern-looking 45  degrees. CNA was sold to  another \nplane-maker, Caproni, which quickly sold the  racers on  to \nGilera. Taruffi tested the  first  Gilera at  137mph/220km/h \n—  unfaired —  and  reckoned it made 7Ohp at 8800rpm. \nThis  was  the  bike that Dorino Serafini took to the  1939 \nEuropean Championship. There was  just time for Taruffi to \nset  an  absolute speed record of 170.37mph/274.18km/h \nand  a one-hour record of 127  miles/204km before the \nItalian aerospace industry had  things other than racing on \nits mind. \nAfter the  Second World War, Remor redesigned the  old \nmotor to take account of the  new World Championship \nregulations: no  forced induction was allowed so  the \nengine could be air cooled. However advanced the \nmotor, pre-war orthodoxy on  chassis design still  ruled. \nWeight distribution was  distinctly rearwards biased, and \nsuspension was by girder forks and  friction dampers. \nThere was  no  doubt that the  Italian fours made enormous \namounts of power, but  not  everyone was convinced that \nmultis were the way forward. What was the  use  of all that \npower if it couldn't be used? This  argument would recur at \nregular intervals over the  next 60 years. \nOPPOSITE The first four: the \nGilera was the  original high- \nrevving, multi-cylinder racer, but \ncheck that suspension: girders at \nthe  front, friction dampers at  the \nrear. This is Massimo Masserini \non  the  very first post-war design. \n(Elwyn Roberts Collection) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 17"

His  Italian team-mates Carlo Bandirola \nand Arciso Artesiani fared better in the  points table. \nNorton again fielded Geoff Duke, now recognised \nas  the  best rider in the world despite having not  yet \nwon a title, and they also signed Dickie Dale.

He  rode a Velocette in the  350s. \nMoto Guzzi completely dominated the  250cc \nclass after Benelli pulled out  following the  death of \ntheir champion Dario Ambrosini. Guzzi’s outdated \n500cc V-twin also won in Switzerland, thanks to \nFergus Anderson, but  he  needed the  assistance of \nthe weather; Guzzi’s second rider, Enrico Lorenzetti, \nwas third. The  V-twin would be  retired but  Guzzi’s \nsingles would, like  the Manx Norton, be  refined year \non  year by the  brilliant engineer and designer Giulio \nCarcano. \nOnce again the  other Italian factories couldn’t \ncompete with Mondial in the  125  class, although the \nMorini was a considerably improved machine. \n—— ee \nABOVE Duke and the \nNorton charge past the \nscoreboard at Assen. \n(Keulemans Archive) \nRIGHT AJS  factory rider \nBill  Doran at the bottom \nof Bray Hill  on  the  Isle  of \nMan —  look at that crowd. \n(Doran Family Collection)"

BMW, who had  been pre-war winners with \ntheir supercharged flat twin, did  not  re-enter the \nfray immediately, but  DKW and  NSU took part. Like \nthe  rest, these factories had  been working on  forced \ninduction when hostilities commenced so  had  had  to \ncome up with brand-new designs to suit  GPs  where \nsupercharging was specifically banned. \nIn the  1930s DKW had  raced a strange two-stroke \ntwin with an  extra smaller cylinder acting as  a pump to \npressurise the  intake side, and  they now kept their faith \nwith the  two-stroke, fielding a 250  twin and  then a \n350  triple. They maintained the  tradition of the  pre-war \nbike by producing machines that were incredibly loud, \nvery thirsty, wayward both in corners and  on  straights, \nand  extremely fast. \nNSU used their 1939 supercharged DOHC twin as \nthe  starting point for a generation of racers, producing \na  new motor with unit  gearbox, wet-sump lubrication \nand  giant camboxes. It looked, and  was, the  most \nmodern and  efficient engine in the  world and  for years \nwas the  only naturally aspirated motor with a specific \npower output of over 125hp per  litre. The 125cc \nRennfox single and  Rennmax twin both had  pressed \nsteel forks, and  spine frames like  the  company’s SOHC \nroad bikes that  they were designed to  promote, \nto which end  the  company ran  the  largest racing \ndepartment in the  world. \nThe  NSU factory's efforts were enhanced by the \ndiscovery of a very talented young racer called Werner \nHaas. He  won first  time out  on  the  Rennfox with a \nteam-mate fifth, and  at  Monza chased new 250cc \nWorld Champion Enrico Lorenzetti (Moto Guzzi) home \non  the  Rennmax. There were other German makers \nwho looked as  if they could be competitive, notably \nHorex and  Adler, but  NSU’s attack on  GP  racing was \na thoroughly modern, high-technology effort by a \nlarge company intent on  promoting its products. NSU’s \nbikes and  methods of working were much admired by \none  Soichiro Honda when he saw the  factory team in \noperation on  his first visit  to  Europe. \nOPPOSITE Fergus \nAnderson (Moto Guzzi) \nand Werner Haas (NSU) \ncheck out each other's \nbikes before the 250cc GP \nat  Monza.

Geoff Duke \njoined the  Gilera team and accelerated the  process \nof ‘Nortonising’ the  four to the  formula so  brilliantly \ndeduced by Rex McCandless. The Gilera was lower, \nwith shorter, stronger forks and rear suspension \nunits, and clip-ons replaced the  old  handlebars. Reg \nArmstrong and Dickie Dale also joined the  Italian \nsquad, while reigning champion Umberto Masetti \n(who walked out  after Assen) and fellow-ltalians \nAlfredo Milani and Giuseppe Colnago were retained. \nMV Agusta, and indeed the whole paddock, were \nbadly shaken by the  death of their lead rider Les \nGraham at the  TT.  The 1949 World Champion had \ndeveloped the  MV  to the  point where it could beat \nthe  Gileras, but  in the  aftermath of Graham's death \nCarlo Bandirola could not  continue the  progress. \nNorton only won at the  TT  and in Ulster, with \nRhodesia’s Ray Amm as  their lead rider backed up  by \nBriton Jack Brett and Ken Kavanagh. \nAnother Italian factory also upped their game. \n26 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nMoto Guzzi moved away from their traditional \npower base in the  250  class, with Fergus Anderson \nand Enrico Lorenzetti now also riding in the  350cc \nclass with what was essentially a bored and stroked \nversion of their 250. (MV were also experimenting \nwith a  350, a sleeved version of the  500.) The new \nGuzzi proceeded to  blow the  British singles, which \nhad dominated the  350cc class, out  of the  water. \nAnd Moto Guzzi didn’t stop there. They entered the \n500cc class with an  entirely new design, an  in-line \nfour with shaft drive and mechanical fuel injection. \nBMW had more sophisticated fuel injection on \ntheir new DOHC boxer twin raced by Walter Zeller. \nThe BMW factory also led  the  way in aerodynamics, \nfielding a fully enclosed bike at  Monza. NSU, well \non  their way to  becoming for a short but  glorious \nperiod the  biggest motorcycle manufacturer in the \nworld, arrived in the 125  and 250 classes in full  force. \nThe 125  revved to  at  least 1000rpm more than the \nMVs, the 250 twin to  over 2000rpm more than the \nGuzzi singles which were its main rivals. \nABOVE The Gilera team \nriders —  Duke, Colnago, \nMilani and Masetti — \nwith their mechanics \nand, between Duke and \nColnago, team manager \nPiero Taruffi.

When it was  finally \nadmitted there was no  possibility of the  rumours \nbecoming hardware, Duke decided to concentrate on \nhis burgeoning car  racing career with Aston Martin. \nThat didn’t go  quite to  plan either, so  he accepted \nan  offer from Gilera. This  was a  brave decision by \nboth parties. The British press regarded the  move as \nsomething akin to treason, while the  Italian media \nwasn’t keen on  the  idea of importing foreign riders. \nHow brave, then, was Piero Taruffi to  employ three of \nthem in  1953? He was rewarded with a clean sweep \nof the  top-three places in the  championship, with Duke \nand  Armstrong finishing first  and  second ahead of \nItalian Alfredo Milani. \nDuke was widely regarded as  the  best rider in the \nworld, and  not  just in the  UK.  Not  only was he a superb \nracer, he was also  technically very astute, and  became \nthe  first  example of a  new breed, a  rider on  whom \na factory could focus their efforts to  improve their \nmachine. Duke did  for Gilera what Les  Graham had \nbeen in  the  process of doing with the  four-cylinder MV. \nJohn Surtees would eventually do the  same job, just as \nGiacomo Agostini would with the  MV  Agusta triple and \nmen like Wayne Rainey and  Mick Doohan would do \nfor Yamaha and Honda respectively. Geoff's attention \nto  detail was legendary, and  not  merely on  the  bike. In \n1950 he  realised the  baggy riding kit of the  time was \naerodynamically inefficient and  asked his tailor to  make \nhim a  one-piece sult. \nGeoff Duke was also  the  first nationally famous \nmotorcycle racer in the  UK. He was awarded an  OBE \nin  1953, and  won one  of the  first  ‘Sportsman of \nthe  Year’ polls. Duke was, in short, the  first modern \nmotorcycle racer. \nOPPOSITE BMW came to  GPs a \nyear after NSU and DKW, but, like \nthe other German factories, they \nbrought some advanced thinking. \nThis streamliner, ridden by Walter \nZeller, appeared at the  final GP  of \nthe  year at  Monza and led  to  the \nuniversal adoption of ‘dustbin’ \nfairings on  faster circuits. Note the \nabsence of carburettors as  BMW \nused fuel injection; the  company \nhad also used telescopic forks on \ntheir pre-war racers. The German \nmotorcycle industry was booming \nand, for  a  few short but spectacular \nyears, would be the  biggest and \nmost innovative in the  world. \n(Stuart Dent Archive) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 29"

The 350cc \nversion of Guzzi’s single was ridden by the  two 500 \npilots plus veteran Enrico Lorenzetti, with fellow- \nItalian Duilio Agostini as  reserve. \nNorton also had a  new works Manx for  Ray \nAmm and Jack Brett in both 500  and 350  classes. \nAJS  again fielded Rod Coleman with new team-mate \nBob Mcintyre (GBR).

It is \ndifficult to think of any  manufacturer dominating \nnot  one but two classes so  comprehensively. \nThis was the  year that Mr  Soichiro Honda visited \nEurope for the  first time, and was so  impressed by \nthe  NSU teams. Unhappily, their run  was bought to \nan  end by the  death of Hollaus in practice for \nMonza, after which the  team withdrew from the \nchampionship. Only the  great Carlo Ubbiali (MV \nAgusta) could give the  NSUs a  race in the  125cc class, \nalthough he and Mondial’s Tarquinio Provini were \nonly winners once NSU had gone home. \nAt the  end of the  season both NSU and Norton \nwould withdraw their works teams from GPs, but \nthey did  continue to sell  customer bikes. \nABOVE Geoff Duke \nprepares to  start the Isle \nof  Man TT.

They'd pioneered small nose-cone fairings, \noften integrated with the  long, thin  tanks of the  day,  and \nthen in  1952 they extended the  bodywork down around the \nengine to  produce a look not  unlike today’s ‘dolphin’ fairing. \nGuzzi, though, had  a  beak-like front mudguard projecting \nfrom under the  front number plate as  opposed to  attached to \nthe front forks. \nNSU followed a similar path, using the  wind tunnel at \nStuttgart Technical Institute, only their fairing for the  1954 \n125  bike covered the  handlebars and  the  whole engine. The \n250  sported a giant, flat-sided wedge. It was the  NSU team \nwho first used the  term ‘dolphin’ after someone decided \nthe  Rennfox fairing’s beak resembled the  nose of the  marine \nmammal. \nMoto Guzzi, aware that their highly evolved single-cylinder \ndesigns needed all the  help they could get against the  multis, \npioneered full  streamlining: the  so-called ‘dustbin’ fairing that \nfully enclosed the  front wheel. It was tried on  the  straight-four \nmachine at the  end  of  1953; not  everyone was convinced it \nWas a  good idea. \nMV  Agusta, conscious that their 500  still  had  a reputation \nas  a difficult-to-handle brute, tried a variety of designs. There \nwas a  strange fairing that looked like a  dustbin with the \nbit covering the  front wheel taken off,  something else  that \nlooked very like  a dolphin design, and  they also raced with \nno  fairing at all.  However, like every other manufacturer, MV \nhad  no  hesitation in adopting full  streamlining for the  smaller \ncapacity classes. Norton had  the  strange ‘proboscis’ fairing \nwith an  elongated nose; only AJS, who had  never used any \nstreamlining, did  not  experiment. \nGilera also  tried a dolphin design that  was really their \nintegrated nose-cone/tank design with panels added to cover \neither side  of the  engine, but  at  Monza they had a full  dustbin \nand  Geoff Duke promptly set  new race record and  lap speeds \nwith it. From the  following season onwards full  streamlining \nwas used by nearly every factory on  most courses, and \nespecially at the  fast  tracks like  Monza and  Assen. \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 33"

When Norton \nannounced they would not  be contesting the  GPs, \nRay Amm, who had been Norton’s lead rider since \nDuke left, signed for  MV  Agusta, only to  be  killed in \nhis first race, an  international at  Imola. Thus the  old \nGilera team of Nello Pagani, Umberto Masetti and \nCarlo Bandirola found themselves reunited at  MV. \nThey were up  against what was now the  established \nGilera line-up of Duke and Reg Armstrong backed \nup  by Pierre Monneret, Libero Liberati and Giuseppe \nColnago. Gilera won every race they contested, \nexcept the  one that mattered most —  Monza. \nMoto Guzzi were still there, with Fergus Anderson \nnow team-manager. Ken Kavanagh was joined by \nDickie Dale, Diulio Agostini and, after the  TT,  Briton \nBill  Lomas. The 500  was not  competitive, although \nLomas did  win  on  it in Ulster, but the  350  was \nliterally unbeatable —  it won every GP. \nThe Norton factory, unhappy with the trend \ntowards streamlining and away from pure road \n34 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nGilera and Duke win again, Guzzi \ncontinue to dominate the 350s, but a \ncustomer bike wins the 250 title \ncircuits, only entered the  TT with a factory team: \nJack Brett backed up  by two British youngsters, John \nSurtees and John Hartle. The bikes were no  longer \nfull  works prototypes but  development versions of \ncustomer machines. BMW looked like  they might \nfill the  gap. They entered Walter Zeller (GER) and \nJohn Surtees at the  Nurburgring but  dithered about \nmaking the  commitment to field a  factory team. \nNSU may also have withdrawn their works \nmachines but they sold a tuned version of their \n250cc single-cylinder road bike, called the  Sportmax. \nIt was good enough to win the  championship and \nbe competitive for several years to  come. NSU’s \ncompetition in the  250  class came from the  previous \nyear’s factory Guzzi, in the  hands of Cecil Sandford, \nand from MV  with a  bored-out version of their \nDOHC 125cc single. At the  class minimum of 203cc it \nwas nevertheless fast enough for  Bill  Lomas to win \nthe  TT.  It would also give the  other Italian factories, \nMondial and Morini, a clue as  to  how they too  could \nbe competitive in the  250  class. \nABOVE You could buy \nan  NSU Sportmax over \nthe counter, Hermann- \nPaul Muller did  and \nwon the  250cc World \nChampionship.

Race organisers \nhabitually exploited riders, paying derisory start and \nprize money. As the  Dutch TT,  then as  now, attracted \nenormous crowds the  privateers decided this  was the \ntime for action. After the  demands of the  riders were \nrejected they told the  organisers they would pull out \nof the  350 race. Sure enough, a dozen riders pulled in \nafter doing one lap at  a  processional pace. \nFurther panicky negotiations now took place, with \nGeoff Duke and  the  rest  of the  Gilera team threatening \nto  back up the  privateers, thus putting the  500cc \nrace in jeopardy. That extracted some cash from the \nnotoriously tight-fisted promoters and  the  500 event \nwent ahead. \nSportsmen do  not  usually make good trades \nunionists, but  Duke and  Reg Armstrong acted in \nsolidarity because of events which had  taken place at \nthe  Italian GP  two years earlier, when the  promoters \nhad  arbitrarily decided not  to  pay  start money to  British \nriders racing for  Italian teams. On  that occasion Fergus \nAnderson, a  Scot riding for  Moto Guzzi, delivered \na  letter of protest signed by every competitor and \nthe  organisers relented. For  Duke and  Armstrong, \nsupporting the  privateers’ aims at Assen was repaying \nthat debt, although they did  not  approve the  threat of \nstrike action. \nThere was, of course, retribution. In  November the \nFIM's sporting committee suspended Duke, Armstrong \nand  twelve others from all competition for six  months, \nand  three Italian riders for four months. No  doubt the \nseverer punishment for  Duke and  Armstrong was pour \nencourager les autres. \nThe  FIM  eventually relented after Duke made a \npublic apology —  much against his better judgement — \nbut  only allowed him  to  race in domestic competition. \nThe  Grand Prix  ban  stood and  would ensure that he \nand  the  rest  of the  factory Gilera team missed the  first \ntwo races of the  1956 season, the  Isle  of Man TT \nand  Assen. \nLEFT Geoff Duke’s actions \nat  Assen would have \nsevere repercussions for \nhis  1956 season. Here he \nstands on  the German \nGP  rostrum of  1954 with \nAssen co-conspirator and \nfellow Gilera man Reg \nArmstrong (right) and \nNorton’s Ray Amm.

Umberto \nMasetti was the  other MV  rider. \nBMW finally decided to  contest a whole season \nwith Walter Zeller on  the  fuel-injected short-stroke \nRennsport flat-twin. The combination didn’t win \na  race but  Zeller did  get on  the  rostrum —  and not \njust when the  Gilera team was absent. Moto Guzzi \ncontested all  classes except the 125  with Aussie Ken \nKavanagh, Brits Bill  Lomas and Dickie Dale, and \nItaly’s Duilio Agostini. However, the  500cc single \nwas now uncompetitive and the  factory raced the \nstill  quite astounding water-cooled V8.  The Guzzi \n350  was still  good enough to  see  off the  new four- \ncylinder designs from MV  and Gilera comfortably, \nalthough the  screaming three-cylinder two-stroke \nDKWs of August Hobl (GER) and Cecil Sandford were \nmore of a  problem. \n38 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nJohn Surtees gave MV their first 500cc title as \nthe  Italian factory won three championships; \nonly Moto Guzzi held out  in the  350s \nMV's new 250  —  a full  249cc as  opposed to the \nold  enlarged 125, which would only stretch to  220cc \n—  was too  good for  even Enrico Lorenzetti and the \nMoto Guzzi.

The 250  GP that Ubbiali missed out  on  was \nwon by Luigi Taveri on  another MV, but the  125 \nrace they failed to win was a victory for the  fast but \nfragile newcomer, Gilera’s twin, the  Gilerino.

He \nunderstood that  the  only way for the  single to  compete \nwith multi-cylinder designs was with low  weight, efficient \naerodynamics and  increased revs. Over the  years, the \nhorizontal single was painstakingly refined with both \nSOHC and  DOHC heads. The  final 350  of 1957 weighed \njust 215lb/98kg thanks to  much use  of aluminium and \nmagnesium; it revved to  8400rpm and made 38hp. \nAlthough Carcano had  faith in the  single-cylinder \nlayout as  the  way forward in the  350  class, he was \nwell aware the  500  couldn't compete with the  Gileras \nand MVs. The in-line four of  1953 that was disliked by \neveryone who rode it was not  a Carcano design, and  the \nteam quickly reverted to  the  lightweight single. Carcano \nwas finally allowed to  pursue his vision, and  the  result \nwas the  V8.  The  90-degree across-the-frame motor had \na  one-piece magnesium crankcase, over-square bore and \nstroke, very narrow (5mm) valve stems, and it made 68hp \nat  12,000rpm. The motor weighed just 123lb/56kg, with \nall-up weight 331Ib/150kg. \nThe  original design was first  raced in  1955 but  suffered \nfrom serious handling problems in fast  corners, and  a \nlack of reliability: it always broke down, usually while in \nthe  lead, and  didn’t finish a  race until a  new crankshaft \ndesign was used for the  '57  season, by which time it was \nmaking 73hp. Reliability was much improved and Dickie \nDale scored fourths on  it in the  first  two GPs  of  1957. Spa \nwas the  nearest the  V8  came to winning a  GP.  Australia’s \nKeith Campbell was leading by a  distance, had  smashed \nthe  lap record and  been timed at  178mph/286km/h when \na  battery lead came off.  Giuseppe Colnago did,  however, \nwin  an  Italian Championship race on  it.  It is tempting to \nspeculate on  what could have been achieved had  the \nItalian factories not  withdrawn from Grand Prix  racing \nat the  end  of  1957. Nevertheless, the  V8  Moto Guzzi \nremains one  of the  great racing designs of any  era  and  a \nlasting reminder of Giulio Carcano’s genius. \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 41"

Geoff Duke’s season was ruined by \nshoulder injury sustained in a  pre-season race at \nImola, and Aussie Bob Brown replaced him at the  TT. \nMV  Agusta’s hopes were carried alone by reigning \nchampion John Surtees, but  he only managed \none race win. MV  unveiled a six-cylinder 500 in \npractice for the  Monza GP  but  did  not  race it. Moto \nGuzzi's V8  added reliability to  its undoubted speed, \nalthough its high-speed handling led to  more than \none rider refusing to  race it.  Bill  Lomas, Dickie Dale \nand Keith Campbell started the season for  Guzzi, \nwith another Australian, Keith Bryen, joining them at \nSpa. Giuseppe Colnago was reserve, racing primarily \nin the  Italian Championship. \nThe 350cc Guzzi single was still  able to  dominate \nGilera’s smaller four and the  Norton Manx, while in \nthe  250 and 125  classes Mondial swept the  board \nwith riders Cecil Sandford, Tarquinio Provini and \nlreland’s Sammy Miller.

Things were closer in the 125  class, but the \nuprated, seven-speed Mondial was good enough for \nProvini to  see  off the  MV  armada led  by Luigi Taveri \nand Carlo Ubbiali. \nAt the  end of the year the  Italian factories \nannounced their withdrawal from the  sport, \nalthough MV, who had originally planned to  go \nalong with the  pull-out, later thought better of \nit. Gilera’s decision was affected by the  death of \nFerruccio Gilera, son  of the  company owner and a \ndriving force behind the  team. Their bikes would be \nback on  track with Scuderia Duke in  1963. \nMoto Guzzi, with its three top riders badly \ninjured and its aerodynamic advantage about to \nbe  negated by the  banning of full  streamlining, \ncited the  downturn in street-bike sales, as  did  the \ncomparatively small Mondial concern.

Geoff Duke had  come \nSO  near to the  magic ton  two years previously, in  1955, \nonly to  have what was announced as a lap at exactly \n100mph rounded down to 99.97mph. (The Gilera team \nwas then suspended for the  first  two GPs  of  1956.) In \n1957 Mcintyre started the  longest ever GP,  the  Senior \nTT —  eight laps of the  Island instead of the  usual seven, \nin honour of the jubilee —  with a  lap of 99.99mph from a \nstanding start. That was a  new lap record; then came a \nlap of 101.03mph and  three more at three-figure speeds: \n100.54, 101.12 and 100.35mph. His  race average was \n98.99mph. No  other rider, in a field that included John \nSurtees on  the  MV, Bob Brown on  the  other Gilera and \nthe  Guzzis of Dickie Dale and  Keith Campbell, could \nmanage even one lap at over a  hundred. Surtees, though, \nwould do the  ton  the  following year and  take the  lap \nrecord in  ‘59. \nWhen Gilera pulled out  of racing the  factory embarked \non  a spree of record breaking using both the  350 and \n500-fours at  Monza in November. Alfredo Milani set  a \nnew one-hour record of  134.4 miles/216.3km on  the  500 \nbefore flying to compete in a winter series in Argentina. \nMcintyre then used the  350 to  do  141.37 miles/227.5km. \nThat record wasn’t beaten until 1964, and it took the \ncombination of Mike Hailwood, MV  Agusta and  the \nDaytona banking to  do it. \nBob  Mcintyre died after a wet-weather crash at Oulton \nPark in  1962. At  a tribute meeting later that same year \nGeoff Duke rode one  of the  Gileras and  formed the  idea \nof running his  own team, Scuderia Duke. Thus the  Gilera \nfour, one  of the  seminal racing motorcycle designs of all \ntime, returned to  the  track for a final outing. \nOPPOSITE Bob Mcintyre \non  the  Gilera four during \nABOVE Bob Mcintyre, \nthe  very epitome of the \ngritty Scot.

      "text": "he  look of racing changed over winter as \nthe FIM banned full-enclosure streamlining: \nboth wheels and (most of) the rider’s arms and \nlegs now had to  be visible from the  side. The \nshape of sporting motorcycles as  we  now know \nthem was fixed. \nThe withdrawal of Gilera, Moto Guzzi and \nMondial left  MV  alone in the  bigger classes, \nbut they still  had stiff Italian competition in the \nsmaller ones in the  shape of Ducati in the 125s, \nplus Morini, making a comeback to  GPs, in the \n250s. There was also a  new challenge emerging \nfrom a  most unexpected quarter: the  East German \nMZ  factory and their Walter Kaaden-designed \ntwo-strokes. \nJohn Surtees dominated both the  500  and 350 \nclasses with support from new team-mate and \nfellow-Brit John Hartle. Geoff Duke started the \nyear on  a  BMW but  soon reverted to  Norton, as \ndid  most of the  ex-employees of the  Italian \nfactories.

The team \nwas led  by Luigi Taveri with support from fellow- \nItalians Alberto Gandossi, Romolo Ferri, Bruno \nSpaggiari and Francesco Villa, plus Britain’s Dave \nChadwick. Morini’s new 250 only appeared for the \nfinal race of the  year, Monza, but  Italians Emilio \nMendogni and Gianpiero Zubani finished first and \nsecond there. The other challenge to  MV  in the \nquarter-litre class was from MZ’'s Horst Fugner, \nwith Ernst Degner (both DDR) backing him up  in \nthe  125s. \nA good rider could still  get on  the  rostrum with \nan  NSU Sportmax, however, as  a  British youngster \ncalled Mike Hailwood demonstrated. \nABOVE John Surtees on \nthe  500cc four-cylinder \nMV Agusta. \nUARROTTS.com) \nRIGHT Bob Brown and \nMike Hailwood on  NSU \nSportmaxes during the \nLightweight (250cc) TT. \nThis was Hailwood’s first \nGP  meeting —  he finished \nthird in the  250s and got \nto  the  flag in  all  four \nclasses.

He \nknew that efficiency came from harnessing the  pressure \nwaves that reflect and  resonate in the  exhaust. This gave \nrise  to the  expansion chamber. He  understood the  need \nfor asymmetric port timing, hence discvalve induction. \nFinally, he  rediscovered an  old  Zundapp concept, the  third \ntransfer —  or  boost —  port. \nUnfortunately, in post-war Communist East Germany \nit was difficult to  get  hold of modern metals, let alone \nstate-of-the art  ignitions or  carburettors. Nevertheless, \nthe  small team first scored points under the  IFA  name in \n1955, unnoticed by everyone except British journalist Vic \nWilloughby, who did  more than anyone to throw light \non  the  genius of Kaaden, a  man who was liked as  well as \nrespected by all who worked with or  rode for  him. \nBy 1958 the  bikes, now called MZs, were very fast  but \nfussy and  fragile. The  standard technique for a  rider on \nanother make of bike was to  try and slipstream the  MZs \nwhile keeping a sharp eye  on  the  two-stroke’s exhaust. \nAs  soon as  the  first tell-tale signs of blue smoke appeared \nit was necessary to  dive to one  side to avoid the  rapidly \nslowing MZ. \nHowever, a  rider with \nmechanical sympathy and \nan  acute enough ear  to \njuggle with an  air-lever \ncontrol (a bit  like  a choke) \nwhile racing these machines \ncould make them last. \nHorst Fugner was good \nenough to  do all that. He \nfinished the  season second, \nsplitting the  factory MVs \nand  taking the  MZ’s first \nGP victory. The  following season, foreign riders started \ntaking an  interest in riding MZs. The  factory went on  to \nwin 13  GPs, the  last  in  1971, but  never won the world \ntitle  that Walter Kaaden’s work deserved (see the  chapter \non  1961 for the  reasons why). However, that should not \nobscure the  fact  that one  man, working behind the  Iron \nCurtain without access to  modern techniques or  materials, \ndeduced the  principles of the  modern two-stroke racer. \nOPPOSITE An  original MZ \nfactory publicity postcard \nshowing their first GP \nwinner Horst Fugner.

His  back-up in the \nbig class was Remo Venturi (ITA) and, in the \n350s, John Hartle. In  both classes the  opposition \nagain came from privately entered and tuned \nNortons, with young Rhodesian Gary Hocking on \nthe Dearden Manx being particularly impressive. \nBMW tried for  a  final season, this  time with Dickie \nDale on  board. \nHocking was one of the  riders who had \nshrewdly assessed the  potential of MZ’s two- \nstrokes and, when Horst Fugner suffered career- \nending injuries at Spa, Gary rode the  250 MZ  and \nwon first time out. He  won next time out, too  — \nand MV  immediately signed him up for  1960. MZ’s \nWalter Kaaden later told the  Swedish journalist \nJan  Leek how Hocking never blew up  one of his \nultra-sensitive engines, despite being so  blazingly \nfast. By comparison Luigi Taveri, the  first non-East \nGerman rider to  sign for  MZ, started 16 races for \n50 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nthem but  only finished five, although as  Kaaden \nsaid in the  same interview, it was the  Swiss rider \nwho'd first showed that his bikes could win. The \nMZ  team’s 125  riders, Ernst Degner and Britain’s \nDerek Minter, couldn't get  near the MVs, apart \nfrom a brilliant Degner victory at  Monza. \nMV's Carlo Ubbiali and Tarquinio Provini \nwere by now as  intent on  stabbing each other in \nthe  back as  they were on  retaining their titles. \nUbbiali ended up winning both 125  and 250 \nchampionships, with Provini departing for  Moto \nMorini at the  end of the  year. In the  250  class \nMorini-mounted Emilio Mendogni and Minter, \nplus Mike Hailwood on  an  ex-works Mondial, were \nMV's other opposition. Hailwood again featured \nin the 125s, this time on  a  Ducati Desmo single, \nwith Bruno Spaggiari and Walter Villa receiving \nsimilar machinery. Luigi Taveri started the year on \na  Ducati twin before switching to  MZ, while Ken \nKavanagh bought a  DOHC single and received \nsome additional factory support. \nABOVE John Surtees \nblasts through Parliament \nSquare on  the 350cc MV \nAgusta during the \nJunior TT.

Britain's \nJohn Hartle, riding a  Norton, won the  500cc race in \nUlster, but  only after John Surtees had stopped to \nreplace a  broken gear pedal. Perhaps, therefore, the \nvictory of Ernst Degner on  an  MZ  in the  125cc Belgian \nGP should be counted as  the  only time MV were \nbeaten all year. The two-strokes really were getting \nrather fast, Degner’s race average for eight laps of the \nold  Spa circuit hitting over 100mph/161km/h. \nAt  MV, Surtees again had Remo Venturi as  team- \nmate along with the  experienced Emilio Mendogni, \nwho retired at the  end of the  season. John Hartle rode \nMVs in the  350  and 500  TTs  but thereafter reverted to \nhis  Nortons. There was an  interesting newcomer in the \n350  class, a bevel-drive DOHC twin from Jawa, ridden \nwith panache by Frantisek Stastny (CZE). \nIn the  250  and 125  classes the  MVs of Ubbiali and \nHocking carried all  before them. Tarquinio Provini had \nleft  MV  on  far from amicable terms and now rode for \n54 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nMorini. He  concentrated on  the  Italian Championship \nfor them while developing their bike into the  most \neffective 250  single, with which he would put the  fear \nof God into the  250  field for the  next four years. \nDegner led the  MZ  team and rode in both the  125 \nand 250  classes. Fellow-East German Werner Musiol \nrode a 250, and various non-DDR riders like John \nHempleman, Dickie Dale, Bob Anderson and Italian \nAlberto Gandossi backed him up  in both classes. \nAnother team with foreign riders was Honda, who \nsigned Aussie Tom Phillis to  ride alongside their \nJapanese teamsters. This was a vital cultural exchange, \nallowing the  factory to  receive critical input from \nan  experienced racer, not  automatic deference to \nsuperiors. However, it was a Japanese rider, Teisuke \nTanaka, who scored Honda’s first Grand Prix podium \nin the  250cc race in Germany. \nIn many ways, Phillis's most significant act  of the \nyear was  to  break his collarbone at Assen, because he \nrecommended that his ride be taken by Rhodesian \nracer Jim  Redman. \nABOVE John Hartle \n(MV Agusta) and Bob \nMcIntyre (AJS) hurtle \npast the coach parties at \nGinger Hall during the \nJunior (350cc) Isle  of \nMan TT.

      "text": "At the  end  of the  season, Count Agusta decided to \nwithdraw his machines from racing. The  expanding \nnumber of Grands Prix, including a  planned trip to \nArgentina in  1961, meant the  expense of running four- \nstrokes was prohibitive. Also, both John Surtees and Carlo \nUbbiali, with seven and  nine world titles, respectively, \nto their names, decided to  retire from motorcycle \ncompetition. (The 500 MVs did, however, appear at  most \nGPs In ‘61.  They were lent  to  Gary Hocking and  sported a \n‘Privat’ logo on  their tanks.) \nJohn Surtees, of course, went on  to  achieve the \nunique distinction of becoming World Champion on \nboth two and  four wheels. It is increasingly unlikely that \nthat  feat  will  ever be equalled. His  departure may have \nbeen slightly acrimonious, John feeling that  as  he wasn’t \nallowed to  race MVs in non-championship events, he \nwasn't getting enough racing. However, as  he  pointed \nout  in his autobiography, he was the  only MV  rider to \nhave been given one  of his bikes so  they must have \nforgiven him  for  leaving. It is often said  that Surtees had \nlittle competition in his championship years, and  that may \nbe true, but  it was his skill  which developed the  four from \nan  unruly monster into  something close to  four-stroke \nperfection. \nCarlo Ubbiali retired because he was now aged 30 and \nhad  business interests to  look after.

The \nretirements of two MV  greats, Carlo Ubbiali and \nJohn Surtees, doubtless had their effect as  well. \nThankfully this  draconian decision was diluted by \nApril and 1960-spec MVs were supplied to  several \nracers, notably Gary Hocking, who promptly cleaned \nup  in the  500 and 350 classes. The word ‘Privat’ \nappeared prominently next to the  MV  badge to \nshow these weren't works bikes. \nHocking had also started the  season competing \nin the  250 class, and won the  first race, but  the \nstrength of six  Hondas, three factory and three \nleased, proved overwhelming —  one of them claimed \nHonda’s first world title, thanks to  Mike Hailwood. \nTwo other Brits, John Hartle and Bob Mcintyre, also \ngot bikes through the  UK  importer. The factory \nsquad comprised another Rhodesian rider, Jim \nRedman, along with Aussie Tom Phillis and Japanese \nKunimitsu Takahashi. In the  125  class Phillis and \n58 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nRedman rode alongside Swiss veteran Luigi Taveri. \nYamaha ventured into Europe for the  first time \nwith all-Japanese entries in the 125  and 250cc \nclasses. They didn’t do a full  season but  raced at the \nTT,  Assen and Spa-Francorchamps early in the  year \nbefore reappearing at the  last  round in Argentina. \nMike Hailwood won the  Isle  of Man TT ona \nprivate 500cc Norton tuned by Bill  Lacey, and \nfollowed Hocking home in the  next four races. \nCount Agusta knew talent when he saw it and \nprovided an  MV  for  Hailwood for the  Italian GP, \nwhich Mike won when Hocking fell  chasing him. \nThe Rhodesian got his  revenge next time out. The \nfinal race of the  year took place in Argentina, the \nfirst time Grand Prix  motorcycle racing had ventured \noutside Europe. However, not  many of the top \nrunners, especially in the 500cc class, went to the \ntime, trouble and expense of attending. This is \nwhy many of the  ‘one hit wonders’ of Grand Prix \nhistory appear in the  record books with their names \nattached to  early South American races. \nABOVE Welsh-born but \nbrought up  in  Rhodesia, \nGary Hocking was a \nnatural talent who could \nsurely have won more \nthan two championships. \n(JARROTTS.com) \nRIGHT The Nortons of \nJohn Hartle and Mike \nHailwood lead the field at \nthe start of the Ulster GP. \n(JARROTTS.com)"

Sweden was due  to  be \nthe  penultimate round, with Argentina completing the \nseason, but there were doubts over the  South American \nrace. The East German factory's 125  had  just become the \nfirst motor in history to  generate a specific power output \nof over 200hp/litre, and  lead rider Ernst Degner was \nheading the  championship and  favourite for the  title. \nHow had  a tiny company locked away in East Germany \nwith no  means of buying top  riders, modern alloys or \nstate-of-the-art parts like  carbs and  ignitions been able \nto  do this? The  answer was the  genius of one man, \nWalter Kaaden. Single-handedly he had  deduced the \nmodern two-stroke from first  principles by treating it as \na  resonating device not  as  a  pump —  like  a four-stroke \nmachine —  no  matter that he had  to  use  old  saw blades \nto fabricate disc  valves. And all this  took place with MZ \npitted against Honda’s highly paid works stars and  the \nItalian armada. \nNot  long before the  Swedish GP,  in September 1961, \nthe  situation of the  East German team was made even \nmore precarious because their government built the \nBerlin Wall, plunging the  Cold War well and  truly into  the \ndeep freeze. Some people think that Degner’s plans were \nalready well advanced before the  Wall went up,  and  on \nthe  way to  Kristianstad he learnt that his family had  been \nsuccessfully smuggled to the  West, drugged in the  boot \nof a Car. \nInstead of running a conservative race and  taking the \ntitle, Degner shot into  the  lead but the  engine only lasted \ntwo laps. Most histories state that Degener deliberately \nover-revved his  bike, but  why would a  man as  self-centred \nas  Degner pass up the  chance of calling himself a World \nChampion? Especially as  his status as  an  international \nsportsman enabled him  to travel freely and  he could \nhave escaped relatively easily once he knew his family \nwas  safe? \nWith the  help of Suzuki, he immediately defected and \njoined his family. Suzuki weren’t helping for  humanitarian \nreasons, though: their two-strokes were cringingly slow \nnext to  both Honda’s four-strokes and  the  MZs, and  they \nwanted Kaaden’s secrets. Degner provided a quick route. \nIn  1962 Ernst Degner became the  first rider to win  a \nWorld Championship on  a two-stroke —  a  50cc Suzuki — \nand  the  following year Hugh Anderson won both the  125 \nand  50cc titles for Suzuki. \nWhat did  Degner take with him? He  always maintained \nhe just took what was in his  head. Walter Kaaden \nthought otherwise, feeling sure Degner took a good deal \nof hardware too. Most of all, he resented the  selling of \nyears of his team’s work, and  when Suzuki painted their \nbikes blue and  silver, the  same as  MZ, Kaaden had  his \nmachines painted green and  silver. \nThere are  also fanciful stories about Degner’s death, \nsome claiming that he was murdered by the  East German \nsecret service, the  Stasi. The  truth is more prosaic. He  died \nyoung of a  heart attack, as  did  his father and  grandfather. \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 61"

The only works bikes on  the  grid were the \nJawa twin of Frantisek Stastny and Phil  Read’s single- \ncylinder Manx Norton. The story was very different in \nthe smaller classes. Honda fielded Jim Redman, Tom \nPhillis, Luigi Taveri, Kunimitsu Takahashi, Bob Mcintyre \nand new recruit, Ulsterman Tommy Robb, as  factory \nriders. Mcintyre was supposed to  win the  350s, Redman \nthe  250s and Takahashi the  125s. Britain’s Derek Minter \ndid  his  best to  upset the  applecart by unknowingly \nbeating the  factory bikes at the  250cc Isle  of Man TT  on \na  Honda supplied by the  British importer. He  never rode \na  Honda again. \nIt was a  grisly year. Phillis died in the  350cc TT, \nMcintyre after crashing at  a  British national meeting. \nGary Hocking, appalled by the  death of his great friend \nPhillis, quit motorcycle racing and went back to South \nAfrica and a career on  four wheels. Before the  end of \nthe  year he too  was dead. Like Jarno Saarinen in the \n1970s, Hocking was an  astonishing talent cut  down \n62 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nrMdaliVWvOOQOQ \nwaive \nVINES \n- = pe - \\WiA a   | Fy io \" a , \na = yy    tt   = A nw iA \nin his  prime. He won 19 GPs, two on  MZs, the  rest on \nMVs. He  won the  first time he sat  on  a two-stroke, at \nSweden’s Kristianstad circuit in  1959, and he was good \nenough to  race Hailwood at  lap-record pace on  equal \nmachinery around the  Isle  of Man. No-one who saw \nhim or  raced against him doubts he could have added \nto  his two world titles. \nJim  Redman persevered grimly and won both the  250 \nand 350  championships. This was the  first year Honda \nraced in the  350  class, using their 250-four bored out \nto  285cc. They finished first and second, Tommy Robb \ntaking victory in the  last  race of the  season, in Finland, \nto  claim the  runner-up spot. In the  250s it was another \none-two, this  time with Mcintyre taking second place — \nand only three of the  championship top ten  weren't on \na  Honda. In the  125cc class Taveri won, with the  other \nthree Honda riders second, third and fourth. \nHowever, they didn’t have it their own way in the \nnew 50cc class. Taveri and Robb were faced with a  new \nphenomenon: two-strokes that were both fast and \nreliable, with Ernst Degner taking the  title on  a  Suzuki. \nABOVE Mike Hailwood \non  the 500c MV  Agusta. \n(JARROTTS.com)"

Degner always maintained \nhe only took the  information that was in his  head, \nbut  in his seminal book Team Suzuki Ray Battersby \nquotes Suzuki team-managers and mechanics \naffirming that he brought plenty of hardware \nas  well. \nThe  MZ  factory, affected not  just by the  loss  of \ntheir star  rider but  also by even severer restrictions \non  their already strictly controlled movements, \nsimply didn’t figure. From now on  East German \nriders hardly ever appeared away from their home \nrace or  the  Czechoslovakian GP.  MZ’'s presiding \ngenius Walter Kaaden ran  the  racing effort by \nremote control, with Britain’s Alan Shepherd as \nhis  main 350cc rider and  guest appearances by a \nvariety of others, the  most memorable of which was \nMike Hailwood’s ride  at the  250cc East German GP \nat the  Sachsenring just a few  kilometres from the \nMZ  factory. In front of over a quarter of a  million \nspectators Hailwood duelled for the whole race with \nJim  Redman on  the factory Honda, over a  minute \nand  a  half  ahead of the  rest  of the  field, only losing \nout  on  the win  by a fifth of a second. \nIn the  50cc class, the  new Suzuki and  another \nGerman two-stroke, the  Kreidler, fought it out \nwith the  four-stroke Hondas. Kreidler was a West \nGerman moped factory and  their race team, \nincluding rider Hans-Georg Anscheidt, were all \nfactory employees. However, the  bike was ultra- \nmodern with disc-valve induction and  the first  use \nof silicate coatings on  cylinder bore. In the  125  class \nthe  Hondas were unbeatable, but  in the  50s  the \nnew generation of two-strokes was making itself \nfelt.

      "text": "y far the  most interesting World Championship \nclass in  1963 was the  250. Honda development \nwas stalled and the  team understaffed, Yamaha \nburst on  to  the  scene with a two-stroke twin and \nItalian double World Champion Tarquinio Provini \nhad a  new iteration of the  Morini single which he \nrode as  if his  life  depended on  it.  It was one of those \ntime windows when a lighter, less  powerful bike \nwas able to  compete with the  more powerful but \nclumsier machines, and Provini pushed Honda’s team \nleader Jim  Redman all the  way. The other Honda 250 \nriders were Tommy Robb and Luigi Taveri. Benelli \nhad a  new four-stroke four for  Silvio Grassetti, while \nMZ’s two-stroke twin in the  hands of Britain’s Alan \nShepherd was still  on  the  pace. \nThe real surprise was how competitive the \nYamaha RD56 was. Unfortunately the  team only \nhad finances for three races: the  Isle  of Man TT, \nAssen and Spa. Fumio Ito  finished second to  Redman \nin the first two races, then won the  third with his \nteam-mates getting two fourths and a second. Phil \n66 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nRead got to  ride the  Yamaha at the  last  race of the \nseason and immediately signed up  for  ‘64. Suzuki \ndebuted a square-four machine at the  same race. \nHonda’s trio had similar problems in the 125 \nclass. Their twin was outclassed by the  Suzuki disc- \nvalve two-strokes of Hugh Anderson, Ernst Degner, \nFrank Perris (GBR) and Bert Schneider (AUT). \nHonda didn’t contest the 50cc class, so  Suzuki's only \nopposition came from Kreidler, at  least until Honda \nraced a  new twin at  Suzuka and Taveri won on  it. \nThe 350  class was a straight fight between \nRedman and Mike Hailwood on  the  MV \nAgusta, which the  Honda man won. Mike the \nBike cakewalked the  500s on  the  MV  with the \ndogged and versatile Alan Shepherd second on \na  Matchless single. The Gilera fours were taken \nout  of mothballs for  one last  season and run  by \nGeoff Duke under the  banner of Scuderia Duke: \nBritish riders John Hartle and Derek Minter were \ncontracted, with Phil  Read taking over when Minter \nwas injured. \nABOVE Double World \nChampion for the  second \nyear running —  Jim \nRedman on  the 125 \nHonda at the French GP. \n(Honda) \nTOP RIGHT Luigi Taveri \n(Honda) prepares for \nthe start of the 125cc \nUlster GP.

It \nwas a  measure of how little the  500 class had  progressed \nin the  intervening five  years that the  bigger bikes were \ncompetitive, whereas it was quickly obvious that the  350 \nwas significantly inferior not  just to the  Honda and  the \nMV  but to Jawa as  well. It was quickly parked. \nHailwood’s MV  was generally superior and  only when \nit hit mechanical problems at Assen did  Scuderia Duke \nachieve a win, courtesy of John Hartle. This was not  a \nproper works effort, though, because the  only factory \ncontribution was a couple of mechanics. Promised \nsponsorship never materialised (some things never \nchange) so  Duke's riders were allowed to  ride  other bikes \nat events not  on  the  team’s schedule. Derek Minter, the \nScuderia’s lead rider, was hurt at  Brands Hatch and  missed \nthe  first  three GPs; Phil  Read took over. The  bikes looked \ndifferent, with dolphin fairings, but were essentially the \n‘57  machines. Only at the  Italian GP  did  Minter receive an \nupdated motor. However, the  effort was not  only short of \nfactory support and  finance but  also  riven by personality \nclashes. It was  the  last  time Gilera contested the  GPs  with \na team. \nThe  last  burst of Gilera glory came via  Benedicto \nCaldarella, winner of his  home 500cc GP  in Argentina in \n1962. He  had  an  ex-Scuderia Duke bike for end-of-season \ninternationals in South America and  was quick enough to \nbe allowed to  keep it for  ‘64.  At the  opening GP of the \nyear at  Daytona he gave Mike Hailwood a serious race \nbefore the  bike broke, proving that the  win  at  his sparsely \nattended home race did  mean something. However, \nCaldarella had  the  same problems as  Scuderia Duke, and \nhis only scoring ride  in  1964 was  a close second place \nbehind Hailwood at  Monza. Both Derek Minter and  Remo \nVenturi (ITA) tried to  race Gileras again in  ‘67,  but  to  no \navail. The  racing career of the  bike  that pioneered the \nubiquitous double-overhead-camshaft across-the-frame \nfour-cylinder layout was  over. \nLEFT Derek Minter on \nthe Scuderia Duke Gilera. \n(JARROTTS.com) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 69"

Suddenly, success in \ndomestic competition wasn’t enough and  Yamaha too \nhad  to venture overseas. They had  first  appeared at a \nGrand Prix  in  1961 with air-cooled discvalve two-stroke \nracers, a single-cylinder 125, the  RA41, and  a 250  twin, \nthe  RD48, for the  French, British, Dutch and Belgian races. \nThe bigger bike was good enough to  score points at  all \nbut the  first  race. Yamaha only raced once outside Japan \nin  1962, and that was in a  non-championship event, but \nthe  factory was busy applying the  lessons they had  learnt. \nThe result was the  RD56. The  motor was little changed, \nbut  the  chassis now looked modern: duplex cradle frame, \nGirling rear shocks, forks with internal springs and a flat- \nsided tank. With Fumio Ito  leading the  team, Yamaha \nmade a  massive impression when they raced at the  Isle  of \nMan TT, Assen and Spa  in  1963. \nStill  short of budget, the  Yamaha factory didn't want \nto  do a full  season in ‘64  but  Phil  Read talked them into \nit.  He  started the  250cc GP  season on  the  RD56 he  had \nridden at Suzuka at the  end of the  previous season, and \nreceived the  revised model in time for the  Isle  of Man \nTT,  the  fourth round of the year. It incorporated more \nmodern porting to  give it an  estimated 50bhp, but  it \nlooked even fresher thanks to that iconic red  and  white \ncolour scheme that would feature on  all Yamaha racers \nup to  and including the  YZR500. \nThe Honda, by contrast, was considerably more \npowerful but  also a  lot  heavier. The  Achilles heel of all \nthe  two-strokes was still  reliability, but  the  points-scoring \nsystem meant that in the  250cc class riders counted their \nsix best results from eleven races, so  the  failures that \nRead did  experience were not  as  damaging as  they would \nbe \nnowadays. \nRead \nthus \nbecame \nYamaha’s \nfirst  \nWorld \nChampion, \nbut  \nit \nis \neasy \nto  \noverlook \nthe  \ncontribution \nof \nFumio \nIto.  \nThe  \nJapanese \nrode \nat  \nCatalina \nin \nthe  \nUSA \nin \nFive best results were counted \nNett Gross Pos Rider Nat \n46 (64) 1 Hugh Anderson NZE \nsi) (ey) Ralph Bryans GBR \n34 3 Hans-Georg Anscheidt GER \n22 (24) 4 Isao Morishita JPN \n21 5 Mitsuo Itoh JPN \n12 6 Jean-Pierre Beltoise FRA \n10 7 Luigi Taveri SWI \n6 8 José Busquets SPA \n6 9 Rudi Kunz GER \n6 10 Peter Eser GER \n10 Angel Nieto SPA \n10 Cees van Dongen NED \n1958, the  factory’s first  venture outside Japan; he was the \nteam’s lead rider when they came to  GPs  and he scored \ntheir first  victory, although his first  GP  point actually \ncame when he was riding a  500cc BMW in  1960.

However, Yamaha \ndidn’t rest on  their laurels and came out  with their \nown monster in the 125  class. First a water-cooled \nversion of the  125cc twin appeared at the  TT and \nAssen, winning both races before being shipped home. \nThen, 12  months after Honda had unveiled their 250- \nsix at  Monza, Yamaha took the  sheets off their V4, \neffectively two contra-rotating RA97 125cc engines \nmounted in a  70-degree Vee. It turned out  to  be \nneither as  effective nor  as  pretty as  the  RA65. \nSuzuki's team of Hugh Anderson, Frank Perris \nand Ernst Degner were joined full time by Yoshimi \nKatayama who had scored a  rostrum finish on  the \n125  at Suzuka the  previous year. The square-four 250 \ncontinued to  be problematic and didn’t appear again \nafter Spa, despite Perris having got it on  the  rostrum \nat the TT —  the  RZ’s second and final top-three finish. \nHowever, Suzuki got their revenge in the  125  class as \n74 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nthey added water-cooling to their twin and so  outpaced \nthe  Honda fours of Luigi Taveri and Ralph Bryans that \nthe four-strokes were withdrawn after Assen. \nHonda showed their intention by unveiling their \nfive-cylinder 125  at the  final race of the  year at Suzuka, \nwhere it set  the  fastest lap, and some satisfaction \nwas obtained when Bryans won the  50cc title on  the \n20,000rpm nine-speed RC115 twin. At that Japanese \nGP the  250 race took place last, as  was then usual. \nHaving won the  350  race for  MV, Mike Hailwood \nhopped on a six-cylinder Honda and won the  250 race \nby a  minute and a half. \nHonda left Jim  Redman on  his own not  just in \nthe  250  class, but  in the  350s as  well, where he came \nunder serious pressure from MV  Agusta’s new recruit, \nGiacomo Agostini. MV were still  using their old two- \nvalves-per-cylinder four in the  500cc class —  and it was \ngood enough for  Mike Hailwood and his new team- \nmate to finish first and second in the  championship \n—  but  in the  350s they now had a lightweight four- \nvalve triple. \nABOVE MV Agusta team- \nmates at  Assen: Giacomo \nAgostini leads Mike \nHailwood.

Count Agusta had  been waiting \nfor an  Italian rider capable of winning on  his  machines, \nso  when Ago appeared the  triple was created specifically \nfor  him. It was built to the  Count’s specific orders to  be \nsmaller and  lighter than the  old  bike, and  was based on \nthe  250  twin that had  last  raced in  1961. The  machine \nfirst surfaced in 350cc form in domestic competition, \nnotably without the  ‘Privat’ logo on  the  tank, and  won its \nfirst Grand Prix  at the  Nurburgring in  Germany in  1965. \nMike Hailwood rode the  old  four. \nWhy did  MV  test  their new concept in the  350  class? \nThere was no  real  challenge to their domination of the \n500s with what was, essentially, a 15-year-old design, \nbut  in the  350s Honda had  won the  last  three titles with \nJim  Redman. Count Agusta wanted to fight back. The \nnew MV  was so  fast  that Redman crashed chasing it in \nGermany, but the  champ then hit back with a  run  of four \nstraight wins. Neither Redman nor  Ago scored in Ulster, \nthen Ago won two in a  row, so  the  fight went all the  way \ndown to  the  last  round in Japan. Agostini maintains to \nthis  day that he would have been champion if his ignition \nhadn’t malfunctioned, but  that failure allowed Redman \nto  cruise to second place behind Hailwood’s MV, and  the \nRhodesian rider retained the  title  for the  fourth year in \nsuccession. \nThe  advent of the  MV  triple was  just the  first  of a \nseries of seismic shifts in the  power balance of motorcycle \nracing. The  ‘65  350  crown was  to  be  Redman’s last world \ntitle; the  man who did  more than any  other to  put  Honda \non  the  racing map would soon have to  hand over to \nHailwood for the  company’s assault on  the  500cc class. \nThe combination of Giacomo Agostini and the  MV  triple, \nhowever, would bestride the  next seven years of Grand \nPrix  racing in the  two biggest capacity classes, first in epic \nconfrontations with Mike Hailwood and  the  Honda six, \nand  then fighting a  heroic rearguard action against the \nadvance of the  two-strokes. \ny 1965 \nnen a We  ae \nFive best results were counted \nNett Gross Pos Rider Nat Machine Nett Gross \n56 (62) 1 Ralph Bryans GBR _ Honda 36  = (38) \n44 (48) 2 Luigi Taveri SWI Honda 32, (39) \n28 (30) Hugh Anderson NZE = Suzuki S24 (37) \n23 4 Ernst Degner GER = Suzuki 26 \n14 5 Mitsuo Itoh JPN = Suzuki 16 \n12 6 Michio Ichino JPN = Suzuki 6 \n11 7 Hans-Georg Anscheidt GER Kreidler 6 \n11 8 José Busquets SPA Derbi 4 \n10 9 Jacques Roca FRA Derbi 4 \n8 10 Harou Koshino JPN = Suzuki 3 \n10 Charlie Mates GBR _ Honda 5 \nABOVE Giacomo Agostini - \ndevastatingly fast, impeccably \norganised, and handsome \nwith it.

Jim  Redman and \nMike Hailwood rode the  RC181, like the  other Hondas \nan  air-cooled DOHC but, perhaps surprisingly, with \nonly four cylinders. Hailwood and Redman also rode \nsix-cylinder Hondas in the  250  and 350  classes while \nLuigi Taveri and Ralph Bryans contested the  50 and \n125cc classes. When Jim  Redman was injured at the \nBelgian GP,  Stuart Graham (GBR) was employed to \nback up  Hailwood. \nThe opposition to  Honda’s onslaught came, as  was \nnow the  pattern, from MV  Agusta in the  two biggest \nclasses, from Yamaha in the  125  and 250s, and from \nSuzuki in the  50s. The Italian factory concentrated all \nits efforts behind Giacomo Agostini and brought out \na 420cc version of their triple to counter the threat of \nthe  new 500cc Honda. Yamaha persisted with their \nunwieldy V4  in the  250  class but countered Honda’s \nfive-cylinder 125  with their own water-cooled V4  late \nin the  season. The (in)famous team of Phil  Read and \nBill  lvy (GBR) rode both classes, Little Bill  getting the \n78 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \njob after he replaced the  injured Mike Duff at the  last \nrace of ’65. \nSuzuki kept Frank Perris, Yoshimi Katayama and \nHugh Anderson on  their 125s and  the  latter two were \njoined by Hans-Georg Anscheidt on  the  50s.  The \nGerman was recruited after his previous employers, \nKreidler, quit GPs. Suzuki had  a  new water-cooled twin, \nthe  RK66, on  which Anscheidt would prove almost \nunbeatable over the next three years. However, he \nneeded a  Honda boycott of the  last race of the year, as \nusual the  Japanese GP, to win his first title. Ostensibly, \nHonda refused to race at the  Fisco Circuit (also known \nas  Fuji) because of safety concerns. The alternative \ntheory was  that the company was irked at the  event \nbeing moved from Suzuka, Honda’s own circuit. \nHonda may not  have won the  500  or  50cc \nRiders’ Championships but they did  something \njust as  remarkable. They won the  Constructors’ \nChampionship in all five  solo classes in what was \narguably the  season which saw  the technology of \nracing advance further than in any  other year. \nABOVE Mike Hailwood on \nthe bike with which he  is \nidentified more than any \nother —  the  six-cylinder, \n18,000rpm, 250cc Honda \nRC166.

He  first \nrode for  Honda in  1960 when he  replaced his  injured \nfriend, Aussie Tom Phillis, joining the  factory full  time the \nfollowing year. He  went on  to win  six titles, including two \n250/350 doubles, in four years. In  1964 he won the  125, \n250 and 350cc races at the  Dutch TT on  the  same day, a \nfeat equalled only by Hailwood. He  also acted as  Honda's \nteam captain, advising the  factory on  rider recruitment, \nand he  had  enough power to decide that the  team \nshould boycott the  US  GP  in  1964 and ‘65.  Jim  enjoyed \nthe  confidence and  respect of Mr  Honda himself and \nthe second President of the  Honda Motor Company, Mr \nKawashima. Company legend has  it that when the  bikes \nstarted becoming competitive and  there was a queue of \nbetter known riders asking to  ride  them, Mr  Kawashima \nsaid: ‘Jim-san and  Tom-san rode them when they were \nslow, they will  ride  them now they are  fast.’ That loyalty \nworked both ways. No-one ever heard Redman say \nanything bad  about his  bikes, no  matter how wayward \ntheir handling. Even though he was never a fan  of the  TT, \nJim  won the  same two races three years running on  the \nIsland, a fact of which he  remains extremely proud. \nNo-one has won more world titles on  a  Honda, \nand 1966 was supposed to  be the  year when Redman \nadded the  500c crown to  his two 250  and  four 350 \nchampionships. Hailwood was originally supposed to \nconcentrate on  the  250  and  350  classes. Jim  won the  first \ntwo rounds, then crashed at  Spa, badly breaking his wrist. \nHe  tried to come back four races later but  he  had  not  fully \nrecovered. He  retired at the  end  of the  season, as  he’d \nalways planned, without completing the  year and  without \na  500cc title  to  his  name. \nEnglish by birth, Redman emigrated to  Rhodesia to \navoid \nhis \nyoung \ntwin \nbrother \nand \nsister \nbeing \ntaken \ninto \ncare when he was called up for  National Service.

This was the  year of the  epic duel \nbetween Giacomo Agostini on  the  three-cylinder \nMV  Agusta and Mike Hailwood on  the  much- \nimproved but  still  wayward-handling Honda four. \nTheir confrontation at the  Isle  of Man saw Hailwood \nset  a  lap record that would stand for  nine years \nand, by common consent, the  1967 Senior TT was \nthe  greatest race ever on  the  Mountain circuit. The \nHonda RC181 500  wasn’t good enough for  Hailwood \nto  get on  terms with Ago, but  the  six-cylinder 350, \nthe RC174, which was actually a  250 over-bored to \n297cc, was perfection. Mike won every GP  he  rode \nit in. \nThe resources taken up  by Honda’s attack on \nFormula 1 —-  or  it may have been the  inexorable \nmarch of the  two-strokes —  led  to  a  reduction in \nthe  factory's effort on  two wheels. Mike Hailwood \ncontested the  three big classes —  250, 350, 500cc — \nwith Ralph Bryans supporting him in the  two smaller \nclasses; Mike was on  his  own in the  500s. Honda did \n82 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nnot  contest the  50 and 125cc championships. \nGauge the  status of the  250s by the  fact that \nevery GP  promoter ran  the  class —  13  rounds — \nwhereas 10  ran  the  500s and just 8 the  350s. \nYamaha again had the  pairing of Phil Read and Bill \nIvy on  V4s  in both the 125  and 250cc classes. Nothing \ncould touch their 125, and although Hailwood won \nmore 250 races than Read, only seven races were \ncounted for the  scoring system, which put the  pair \nlevel on  points. Hailwood won on  countback. Suzuki \nwere as  dominant in the  50cc class as  the  Yamahas \nwere in the  125s. Hans-Georg Anscheidt just rode \nthe  50  (and won the title again), Stuart Graham and \nYoshimi Katayama doubled up  with the 125  as  well, \nand Graham got to  ride the  new V4  125cc Suzuki at \nthe  Japanese GP. \nAs  usual, the  end-of-season Japanese Grand Prix \nwas awash with rumours of exotic new machinery \nfor the  following year —  a  50cc Suzuki triple, a  six- \ncylinder Honda 500, even a V8  250. None of it was \nto  happen. \nABOVE Hailwood pushes \noff  on  the 500 Honda at \nthe start of the greatest- \never TT:  he  set  a  lap \nrecord that would stand \nfor  nine years. \n(JARROTTS.com) \nRIGHT Hans-Georg \nAnscheidt (GER) retained \nthe 50cc title for  Suzuki. \n(JARROTTS.com)"

Suzuki followed suit  shortly \nafterwards, but  agreed to  supply Stuart Graham with \na  125  twin for  non-GP events. Hans-Georg Anscheidt \ndid  a  similar deal with Suzuki but  he was given a  50cc \nbike as  well, which he was allowed to  race in the \nWorld Championship —  and that turned out  to  be a \ngood decision, because the  German rider made it a \nhat-trick of titles and then retired from racing. \nNeither Suzuki nor  any  other manufacturer could \nhave lived with Yamaha in the  intensely competitive \n250  class, now most definitely the  race with the  most \ninterest. The V4  Yamahas of Ivy and Read were the \nmost advanced motorcycles in the  paddock and they \ndominated both the 125  and 250 classes, winning \nevery race bar  one. A third Yamaha finished fourth in \nthe 250 class, ridden by Rod Gould (GBR). This was an \nover-the-counter racer, a TD1C -  Yamaha had actually \nbeen producing them since 1962 —  but  it was the \nfirst time one was sent to the  GPs. Gould housed the \n86 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nWith Honda gone Giacomo Agostini \ncruised to two more titles, attention \nfocused on  the civil war at Yamaha \nmotor in a  Bultaco chassis. A factory MZ  prevented a \nYamaha one-two-three in the  250s. \nThe Spanish industry was now taking a serious \ninterest in the smaller classes. Ginger Molloy (NZE) and \nSalvador Canellas (SPA) put  Bultacos on  the  rostrum in \nthe  125  class, while Barry Smith (AUS) and Angel Nieto \ndid  the  same for  Derbi in the  50s. There was also a win \nfor the  Dutch Jamathi bike in the  50s. \nIn the  bigger classes Giacomo Agostini embarked \non  arun of sustained domination by winning every \nrace on  the  350  and 500cc calendar. In the  350s he was \npursued by a  new Italian hero, the  bespectacled Renzo \nPasolini on  a four-cylinder Benelli, who would take the \nfight to Ago both in the  Italian Championship and in \nGPs. In the  big class, a  herd of antiquated British singles \nhad  their own race, minutes adrift of the  MV  four. That \nat  least let the  epitome of the  privateer, Aussie Jack \nFindlay, focus of the  cult 1972 film Continental Circus \nwhich documented the  precarious lives of the  privateer \nracers to  a  prog rock soundtrack by Gong, achieve his \ncareer-best championship position with second place. \nABOVE Bill  Ivy leads Phil \nRead in the  250cc Dutch \nTT;  Ivy won by a  tenth of \na  second with Pasolini’s \nBenelli one and three \nquarter minutes behind in \nthird.

Yamaha were so  far ahead of the  competition \nin ‘68  that they could effectively decide who should be \nthe  125  and 250 World Champions. Their decision was \nthat Bill  lvy should win  the  250s and Phil  Read the  125s. \nlvy, very much an  innocent abroad compared to the \ncalculating Read, duly rode shotgun for his team-mate \nuntil the  125  championship was decided. At the  Czech GP, \nhowever, Read announced that he was riding to win  the \n250cc class as  well. This  was more than simple double- \ndealing. Read had  his reasons, prime among them a desire \nto get Yamaha to commit to the  ‘69  season, or  at  least to \ntell  him  whether they would be racing or  not  because it \nwas  strongly rumoured that they would be pulling out  at \nthe end  of the year.

The  250  class, don’t forget, was the  one  that \nmattered most. According to  his friend and  biographer Alan \nPeck, Bill  lvy saw  the  world in a  much simpler light. He  simply \ncouldn't imagine reneging on  a deal. \nIt came down to  the  last  race of the  year, at  Monza, \nwhere Read won the  race and  the  title. Both riders were \nprepared to  protest against the  other —  and Ivy did  so  on,  it \nmust be said, trivial grounds which deflected some of the \ncriticism from Read. Peck's book, No  Time to  Lose, records \nthat lvy became much more difficult to  deal with after this \nepisode and  that he really wanted to  quit bike racing. He \ndabbled in cars, where his talent was as  obvious as  it was \non  two wheels. Ivy announced his  retirement from bike \nracing but would, tragically, be tempted back. Phil  Read had \nbeen right about Yamaha, though: they pulled their works \nteam out  of GPs  at the  end  of the  season. \nLEFT Yamaha team-mates \nRead and lvy, not seeing \neye-to-eye as  usual. \n(Elwyn Roberts Collection) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 89"

In the  350 and 500  classes Agostini and \nMV  Agusta again won every race they contested. In \nthe  500s the  Linto, basically two Aermacchi 250cc \ncylinders on  a  common crankcase, was now reliable \nenough to  put the  Hungarian-born Swiss Gyula \nMarkovszky regularly on  the  rostrum, and he took \nsecond place in the  championship. The completely \nhome-made Paton, brainchild of ex-Mondial engineer \nGiuseppe Patoni, was almost as  successful for  Billie \nNelson (GBR), but this was a  one-off motorcycle; it \nwas possible to  buy a  Linto. Ago’s hegemony of the \n350s was threatened by Bill  lvy and the  powerful \nbut fickle V4  Jawa two-stroke, but  that threat was \nsnuffed out  when Little Bill  died at the  Sachsenring. \nIn the  smaller classes, the  titles were really open \nto  anyone who could put together a good season. \nThat turned out  to  be  Kel  Carruthers (AUS) in the \n90 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nLal | ¢ J Au |   VY ( L  D | | } =i (  ‘nd i} ge \n5  SO  AgOStINI \n2 \n\\/ - are laft ta    ctaamroller a \nita IVEiW AUDI LG VI IVE Se a AM JHICT ei: \n. § \ner \ncS \n1    \n@ \n| \nTIC \niS \neS  \ngl \n= \nae \n| \nLah \nae \nteapots \n‘no \nc \nfh \n= ee en eT \n250  class: the  Benelli factory continued to  race their \nfour for one last  season and were rewarded with the \nlast  quarter-litre title to  be won by a four-stroke.

However, he had  tried car \nracing and  was good at it —  more than good, in fact, \nas  Jackie Stewart, Graham Hill  and  others noted. \nTypically, lvy wanted to  go straight into  Formula 2 and \nneeded to finance his  new career. The  Czech Jawa factory \nhad  a  radical 350cc V4 two-stroke bike  designed by \nZdenek Tichy, no  doubt after careful observation of \nMZ  and  Yamaha's progress. The  two underdogs liked \neach other. \nThe  Jawa was undoubtedly fast  and  powerful but  it \nwas underdeveloped, like  all the  other machines that \nemerged from behind the  Iron  Curtain. The  factory's lack \nof access to  modern ignition, suspension and  carburettors \nwas also  a  major handicap. Nevertheless, Ivy gave Ago \na \nserious \nscare \nat \nHockenheim, \nthen \ntwice \novertook \nhim \nat Assen before the  machine faltered. At the  next event, \nSix  best results were counted \nNett Gross Pos Rider Nat Machine Nett Gross \n90 (144) 1 Angel Nieto SPA Derbi 76 \n59 2 Aalt Toersen NED Kreidler 75 (93) \n51 3 Barry Smith AUS Derbi 69 (73) \n36 4 Jan de Vries NED Kreidler 643) \n338) 5 Paul Lodewijkx NED Jamathi 63 \n29 6 Gilberto Parlotti ITA  Tomos 31 \n27 7 Santiago Herrero SPA Derbi 28 \n26 8 Rudi Kunz GER __ Kreidler 26 \n24 9 Ludwig Fassbender GER Kreidler 25 \n20 10 Martin Mijwaart NED Jamathi 18 \nthe  East German GP,  the Jawa seized in practice and  lvy \nsustained fatal injuries. It was thought he might have \nbeen adjusting his  helmet when the  incident happened so \ndid  not  have time to grab the  clutch lever. \nThere is little doubt that lvy would have been \nsuccessful at car  racing. His few competitive events saw \nhim  racing with big names like  Stewart, Hill,  Jean-Pierre \nBeltoise and  Jochen Rindt —  he was  a  natural on  four \nwheels, just as  he was on  two. Bill  was the  first man to \nlap the  Isle  of Man at over 100mph/161km/h on  a  125 \nand  his  1968 250cc lap record of 105.5mph/169.8km/h \nstood until 1979. \nThe  V4  continued to  race but  never again showed the \nform it had  in Bill  lvy’s hands, and  those of veteran factory \nrider Frantisek Stastny who had won four GPs for Jawa, \nthree in the  350  class and  one in the  500s, earlier in his \nlong career. Versatile Italian Silvio Grassetti did  win  the \nfinal race of ‘69  on  it, in Yugoslavia, but  the  MV  team did \nnot  enter that event. \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK \n93"

      "text": "here was still  no  coherent challenge to  Giacomo \nAgostini and the  MV  Agusta in the  500cc class \nin  1970. Nevertheless, Count Agusta saw fit to field \na second bike for Angelo Bergamonti from Monza \nonwards. There wasn’t enough time for the  Italian \nto  secure second in the  championship, but when Ago \ndid  not  attend the  final race of the year, at  Montjuich, \n‘Berga’ won both 350  and 500 races in record time and \nwith two new lap records to  his  name. Ago himself \nwon every race he contested, in both classes. It is \nworth noting, however, that despite the  lack of serious \nopposition the  MV  was continually refined —  perfected \nmight be a  better adjective —  and race and lap records \nwere often broken. Giacomo Agostini never did \ncomplacency, as  anyone who worked with or  for  him \nwill  readily testify. \nKawasaki sold a  run  of 40  H1R racers based on \ntheir three-cylinder road-bike engine. Experienced \nprivateer Ginger Molloy traded in his  Bultaco for one \nand made it on  to the  rostrum four times. This was in \nno  small part due to the  Kiwi rider’s abilities as  a tuner \n94 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nand mechanic, talents a  privateer needed if he were to \nmake a living, and he duly finished second in the  500cc \nchampionship table. \nIn the  350  class Ago had to cope with real pressure \nfrom Benelli riders Kel  Carruthers and Renzo Pasolini, \nand also Rod Gould on  a Yamaha. Gould and Kent \nAndersson were officially employed by Yamaha (unlike \nthe  previous season, when there was no  ‘works’ team). In \nwhat was now a familiar pattern, they rode development \nbikes that would form the  basis of the  B-model TR2 \nand TD2 that would be sold for the  ‘71  season. The TD2 \ninstantly turned the  250  class into a Yamaha benefit. \nOnly the  mercurial Spaniard Santiago Herrero and the \nremarkable Ossa single looked like  stemming the  tide, \nbut  a crash at the  Isle  of Man TT,  probably on  melting \ntar,  ended his  life. \nIn the 125s the  big German Dieter Braun and an \naging Suzuki somehow saw off  Nieto and the  Derbi, but \nthe  Spaniard made no  mistake in the  50s, retaining his \ntitle, again with Aalt Toersen in second, although the \nDutchman had abandoned Kreidler in favour of Jamathi. \nABOVE ABOVE Angel \nNieto, the  greatest ever \n50/125cc racer, retained his \n50cc title with the factory \nDerbi. (Elwyn Roberts \nCollection) \nRIGHT Kawasaki's \nproduction-based H1R was \nthe  privateer’s preferred \nmount. This is Christian \nRavel (FRA) on  his  way to \nthird place at  Spa.

Giacomo Agostini \nand  the  MV  still  ruled the  500cc class, but the  old \nthree-cylinder design was at the end  of its life and  a \nfour was debuted at Monza by Alberto Pagani (son \nof Nello). Ago rode triples in the  350  and 500  classes \nand both had breakdowns -a   totally unprecedented \noccurrence. Pagani was drafted into the  MV team \nafter Angelo Bergamonti was killed in an  Italian \nChampionship race. Agostini won the first eight races \nof the  season on  the  bounce, and out  of the  remaining \nthree rounds only raced at Monza. That let in Jack \nFindlay (Suzuki) and Dave Simmonds (Kawasaki) to \ntake the first two-stroke wins in the  500cc class. MV's \nhonour was almost salvaged by Pagani’s win  at Monza. \nFindlay rode a TR500 supplied by the  Italian \nimporter, while Rob Bron (NED) and Keith Turner (NZE) \ngot semi-works Suzukis through similar arrangements. \nSimmonds took over Ginger Molloy’s Kawasaki H1R \nbut  housed it in a frame built by Reynolds’ legend of \nthe  welding torch, Ken Sprayson. \n98 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nAgostini’s majestic progress to  another 350  title \nwas interrupted only by mechanical failures, although \nthere was a warning of what was to come. Jarno \nSaarinen received 250  and 350  Yamahas through the \nFinnish importer and won races on  both. He  also set \na  new lap record at his home 250cc race. It is worth \nremembering, though, that despite being second in \nthe  350 race, Jarno was almost lapped by Ago! Apart \nfrom the  MV, the  250  and 350  classes were now \ntotally dominated by Yamahas, although MZ’s Silvio \nGrassetti managed two wins in the  250  class and \nPeter Williams (GBR) won a wet 350cc Ulster race. \nAnother youngster burst on  the  scene in the  125 \nclass. Barry Sheene and his father Frank had bought a \nfour-year-old ex-works Suzuki off Stuart Graham, and \nBarry promptly scored more points on  it than Angel \nNieto on  the  factory Derbi, although the  Spaniard \nwon the title because only a  rider’s six best results \nwere counted.

The story of the  class might have \nbeen very different but  for the  death of Gilberto \nParlotti on  the  Isle  of Man. \nThe real drama came in the 50s, where Nieto \nand his  great rival Jan  de Vries finished equal \non  points and couldn't be split on  countback. \nThe rules stated that the  title be decided on  the \naggregate time of the  races in which they both \nfinished, so  Nieto won the  title by 21.32 seconds. \nThe Derbi factory then quit racing, only returning \nin  1984 when they had another Spanish hero as \ntheir rider, Jorge ‘Aspar’ Martinez. \nABOVE Jarno Saarinen \nwon his  only world title \non  the Finnish importer’s \nYamaha 250.

The  Spaniard came back \nwith wins in Austria and Italy, but  Parlotti was on  the \nrostrum both times. This was shaping up to  be a tight \nchampionship; but  the  next round was at the  Isle  of \nMan TT. \nIn the  wake of the  death of Santiago Herrero, riding \nan  Ossa on  the  Mountain circuit two years earlier, the \nSpanish Federation had  banned its riders from competing \nin the TT and  saw no  reason to  alter their ruling. Parlotti \nfelt this was a way of taking an  advantage and  entered \nagainst the  advice of the  Morbidelli factory, seeking \nguidance from his good friend, Giacomo Agostini. Ago \neven took him  for a  lap in his car  the  night before the \nrace. The  weather was filthy and  Parlotti crashed at \nthe  Veranda, a succession of high-speed lefts high on \nSnaefell, \nwhile \nleading \non \nthe \nsecond \nlap. \nThere \nwas, \nof \ncourse, \nno \nrun-off. \nAgo \nwas \npreparing \nfor \nthe \nSenior \nTT \n(the  500  race) when news of the  fatal accident came \nthrough. He  raced, and  won, that afternoon but  had \nalready decided not  to  return to the  TT. \nBarry Sheene had  made his feelings known in  1971, \nthe  only year he raced on  the  Island, and  now Agostini \nwas backed up  by Count Agusta, Phil  Read, Rod  Gould \nand  most of the  top  GP  men —  although Read was \ntempted back for the TT  F1  series that was initially \ncreated as  a one-race World Championship in  1978 and \nthen extended to —  mainly —  roads circuits. (Technical \nregulations were not  unlike those for the  new MotoGP2 \nclass.) F1  survived for a couple of years after the  advent of \nthe World Superbike Championship in  1988. \nThe  Isle of Man TT continued as  the  UK's Grand Prix \nuntil 1976, but  the  factories never went back. Many of \nthe  one-hit wonders in the  record books won their sole \nGP  on  the  Isle of Man circuit against less  than stellar \nopposition, although that is not  a charge that can  only \nbe  levelled at the  TT:  there was still  no  compulsion to \ncompete in every round of the World Championship, so \nend-of-season races at tracks like  Imatra and  Montjuich \nwere often undersubscribed. \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 105"

The British rider was never a \nman to take too much notice of team orders, so  it \nis safe to  assume that MV, having had a  look at  him \non  their 350 the  previous season, put  him on  the  500 \nto  keep their multiple World Champion honest, just \nas  they’d done when employing Angelo Bergamonti \ntwo years earlier. However, for the  first time since \n1965, Giacomo Agostini did  not become 500cc World \nChampion. He failed to finish the  first four races of the \nyear, won three of the  final six,  but  Read took four \nvictories to  become the  oldest rider to  win the  500cc \nworld title since Les  Graham in  1949. \nAll  of these MV  victories might have been irrelevant \nbut  for the  events of 20  May at  Monza and the \naccident that killed Jarno Saarinen and Renzo Pasolini. \nThe Finn had been 250cc World Champion in  1972, and \nwas now racing in 500s too, on  the  new four-cylinder \nacross-the-frame Yamaha. He won the  first two races \non  it, and was leading the third, at  Hockenheim, \n106 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nwhen his chain broke. Then came Monza. \nThe next two rounds were the  Isle  of Man TT  and \nthe  Yugoslavian GP  at the  equally fearsome Opatija \ncircuit, neither contested by the  factory teams, so \nit wasn’t until Assen that the  championship really \ngot going again after a three-race hiatus. Ago was \nstronger on  the  run-in, but  Read was able to  protect \nhis  lead. The biggest surprise of the  season was \nthe  race win in Yugoslavia, and second place in the \nchampionship, for  New Zealander Kim Newcombe on \nthe  Konig, a  bike he’d help develop while working \nas  an  engineer for the  eponymous West German \noutboard motor company, using one of their flat-four \ntwo-strokes mated to  Manx Norton transmission parts. \nNewcombe died at a  non-championship race at \nSilverstone, and racing lost a man who could have \ntaken the  two-stroke challenge to  MV. In 2006 a film \nentitled Love, Speed & Loss was released. Narrated by \nKim's widow, Jeneen. It is worth seeing not  just for \nthe \ninsight \nit \ngives \ninto \nracing \n35 \nyears \nago \nbut \nas \na \nrecord of a  remarkable privateer achievement. \nABOVE Phil Read, MV's \nlast  500cc champion. \nUARROTTS.com) \nRIGHT It looked \nagricultural but it was \neffective.

What caused it? Was it Walter Villa’s \nBenelli leaking oil during the  closing laps of the  350  race, \nas  the  Italian toured round to try and  pick up a point? \nAustralian John Dodds thought so  and  tried to tell  the \norganisers. He was threatened with expulsion from the \nrace and  the  police were called to eject him  from Race \nControl. The  French journalist Christian Lacombe suffered \nsimilar treatment when he tried to  get  marshals to  show \nan  oil flag. \nPasolini arrived at the  corner first  and  fell.  His  bike \nthen bounced back off the  Armco that closely bordered \nthe  track, right into Saarinen’s path. Both men died on \nthe  spot. The  German journalist Volker Rauch collected \nstatements from Hideo Kanaya, Dieter Braun, Borje \nJansson, Kent Andersson and  others who all stated \ncategorically that  there was  oil on  the  track. \nThe  Italian inquiry decided that  the  accident was \ncaused by Pasolini’s bike seizing.

      "text": "V Agusta again swept the  board, but this \ntime without Giacomo Agostini. Because he \nboth disliked Phil  Read intensely and realised the \npower of the  approaching two-stroke tsunami, Ago \ndecamped to  Yamaha and promptly won both the \nDaytona and Imola 200-milers. Neither was a  Grand \nPrix race, but  at that time they carried enormous \nprestige and earned him massive kudos with the \nfactory. However, a  crash in Sweden due to water \nleaking from Barry Sheene’s Suzuki effectively \ntorpedoed the  Italian’s chances of the  500  title, \nalthough Ago still  believes that but  for this  crash and \nhis  ensuing broken shoulder he would have won the \n500  championship in his first season on  a two-stroke. \n(He didn’t have to wait too  long: the  following year \nsaw him claim victory.) Compensation in  1974 came \nin the  form of the  350  title, Yamaha’s first in the \nclass, on  the  magnesium-engined TZ  ridden by Tepi \nLansivuori the  previous year. The Finn stayed on  as \nAgo’s team-mate in both the  350 and 500 classes. \nRead did  race the  350  MV  in the  first few GPs  but \n110 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nsuffered mechanical problems and it was parked for \nthe  rest  of the  year. \nYamaha did  not  defend the  250  title with a factory \neffort and their customer racers were beaten by \nWalter Villa on  the  factory Harley Davidson. Phil Read \nbecame MV's lead rider and marched to the  500  title \nwith the help of Gianfranco Bonera (ITA) and the \nfour-cylinder MV. \nThe most significant event of the year was the \nappearance of a  brand-new 500cc Suzuki in the  hands \nof Barry Sheene and Australian Jack Findlay. The RG500 \nwas a square-four disc-valve two-stroke in which the \nDNA of Walter Kaaden’s work at MZ  could clearly be \ndetected. The bike was fast but fragile; nevertheless, \nSheene put  it on  the  rostrum first time out. \nPerhaps there was another candidate for event of \nthe  year: in the  250  class at Assen a young American \nYamaha rider called Kenny Roberts made his Grand \nPrix debut. He  set  pole position and fastest lap before \nfinishing third behind Villa and Bruno Kneubuhler \n(SWI, Yamaha). \nABOVE Jack Findlay (AUS) \non  the Suzuki RG500 at \nthe French GP,  the first \nrace outing for the new \nwater-cooled square-four \n500 two-stroke.

The four-stroke rearguard \nwas led  by defending champion Phil  Read, riding as \nwell as  ever on  the  MV. Crucially, Ago had strong \nback-up in the  form of Hideo Kanaya, whereas the \nsecond MV  was first in the  hands of Armando Toracca \n(ITA) and then ridden by old  hand Gianfranco Bonera. \nNeither managed a rostrum finish. \nThe surprise package was the  square-four Suzuki \nRG500 (XR14), ridden by Barry Sheene (from round \nthree onwards, after he’d recovered from his  Daytona \nspill) and Tepi Lansivuori, plus John Newbold (GBR) for \nAssen and Spa, and Stan Woods in Germany and Italy. \nInitially the  RGs  were fast but fragile; the five-week \ngap between Imola and Assen gave the  factory time \nto  make significant improvements. \nThere was a  Grand Prix  in that time but  it was the \nBritish round, at the Isle  of Man TT,  and the Suzuki, \nYamaha and MV  factory teams didn’t race there. \n114 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nGiacomo Agostini won the  last of his  15 \ncrowns; it was also the first 500cc crown \nfor Yamaha and the first for a two-stroke \nTheir absence gifted Mick Grant (GBR) the  win on  a \nKawasaki H1R, against limited competition —  his fastest \nlap was 102.9mph (in less than ideal conditions); \nhe clocked up  109.8mph in the  non-championship \nClassic race, breaking Mike Hailwood’s long-standing \nabsolute lap record set  in  1967. \nAgostini won four races, Read just two, but \nalthough the  Englishman notched up  more points he \nlost the title as  only the  best six results counted.

However, they needed the  help of the  points- \nscoring system to  overcome the  reliability of the  MV. Read \nonly failed to score once, in Finland, thanks to an  engine \nfailure, while Ago was stopped by seizures in Austria \nand Belgium (he also had  a  DNF in Sweden thanks to  a \npuncture). The  Suzuki, in its second year, was still  prone to \nmisfires and  niggling vibration-induced failures, yet such \nwas the  pace of development that the  factory supplied \nmost of the  grid with RGs  the following season. Yamaha's \nTZ250/350C did  the  same for their classes. \nHere was the  triumph of mass production over \nthe  hand-built MVs that had  relied on  knowledge \naccumulated by a  handful of dedicated technicians over \nmany years to extract the  best from their aging design. \nThis mirrored the  road-bike sector. It is no  surprise that \nHonda \ncould \nbuild \na \nmulti-cylinder \nDOHC \n750cc \nengine \ngiven \ntheir \nracing \nhistory; \nthe \nreally \nclever \nthing \nwas \nthat \nFive best results were counted \nthey could mass produce it on  an  industrial scale far \ngreater than MV, Benelli or  Gilera could dream of. \nThe first company to score points and get on  the \nrostrum with a stroker was DKW in the  mid-1950s. In the \nlater part of the  decade MZ  appeared from the  other side \nof the  Berlin Wall, getting their first rostrum and  victory in \n1958 (in the 125  and 250 classes, respectively). After lead \nrider Ernst Degner defected and  went to  Suzuki he won \nthe  first two-stroke title, the  50cc World Championship, in \n1962. New Zealand racer Hugh Anderson won Suzuki the \n125  title  in  1963, and  a year later Phil  Read and  Yamaha \ntook the  first  quarter-litre crown with a two-stroke. \nHonda and MV  then fought a four-stroke rearguard in the \n350 and 500cc classes for the  best part of a  decade, until \nGiacomo Agostini left  MV  for Yamaha and  promptly won \nthe  1974 350cc championship. One more season and  the \ntwo-strokes had  triumphed. They would be unbeatable. \nIt took the  biggest change ever in Grand Prix  regulations, \nthe  advent of MotoGP in 2002, to enable a four-stroke to \nwin  again. \nNett Gross \n75 (114) \n61 (79) \n43 \nBi (39) \n31 \nSh \n28 \n21 \n20 \n16 \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 117"

At the final \nround of the  500cc championship, held on  the  old \nNtirburgring, he  used both bikes in practice but  the  MV \nfor the  race. Ago admitted to  some ‘sleight of hand’ in \nthis  matter, but  he made the  choice because the four- \nstroke suited the  track and  conditions better —  not, as \nthe  romantics would have us  believe, because of the \nfans’ reaction to the  MV. Ago led  from the  start but \nreally pulled away when the  rain  came. He  had  over a \nminute over the  rest  going into  the  last  lap and  won by \n52  seconds. The MV, a  bike developed for and around \nAgo, made its power more predictably and was easier to \nuse  around the  ‘Ring in good conditions than the  disc \nvalve Suzukis, never mind in the  wet. The victory was a \ntriumph of experience and  Ago’s legendary attention to \ndetail, and  it is remembered not  just because it was  the \nfinal four-stroke win  in the  top class until the  advent of \nMotoGP, but  also  because it was  the  last  of Agostini’s 122 \nGrand Prix  wins. However, it should be noted that it was \nachieved in the  absence of Barry Sheene, who had  already \nwrapped up the  title. \nFor  \na  \nreal  \nswansong \ngo  \nback \nto \nthe  \n350 \nrace \nat \nAssen. \nAgo \ncampaigned \nthe \nsmaller \nMV \nthroughout \nthe \nseason, \nafter \ntwo \nyears \non \nTZ350s, \nagainst \na field \nof \nstrokers \nincluding \nthe \nYamahas \nof \nCecotto, \nTakazumi \nKatayama \n<a \nwo Soni Pi INO) Oy \nNett Gross Pos Rider Nat Machine Nett Gross \n/OmmEO 1 Walter Villa ITA Harley Davidson 90 117 \n65 2 ~=Takazumi Katayama JPN Yamaha isiger \n54 3 Gianfranco Bonera ITA Harley Davidson 61 77 \n41 45 4 Tom Herron GBR Yamaha 47 52 \n34 5 Pentti Korhonen FIN Yamaha 47 55 \n29 eS 2 6 Dieter Braun GER Yamaha 42 50 \n28 29 7 Chas Mortimer GBR Yamaha 31 \n2350 8 Bruno Kneubuhler SWI Yamaha 29 \nAy} 9 Olivier Chevallier FRA Yamaha 25 \nD7, 10 Victor Palomo SPA Yamaha 25 28 \nNett Gross Pos Rider Nat Machine Nett Gross \nS005 1 Angel Nieto SPA _Bultaco SSmeo \n67 2 Herbert Rittberger GER Kreidler 16 oa? \n64/4 3 Ulrich Graf SWI Kreidler 69 ~=80 \n46 4 Eugenio Lazzarini ITA = Morbidelli 530761 \n32 5 Rudolf Kunz GER __ Kreidler 34 86039 \n27 31 6 Julien van Zeebroeck BEL Kreidler 26 \n26 7  ~~ Stefan Dorflinger SWI Kreidler 25 \n25 8 Rolf Blatter SWI Kreidler 25 26 \n23 9 Hans Hummel AUT Kreidler 20 Zs \n18 10 Pierre Audry FRA  ABF 15 \nand  Chas Mortimer, the  Morbidelli of Dieter Braun and \nthe  Harley Davidsons of eventual (double) champion \nWalter Villa and Gianfranco Bonera. The MV  broke in \nevery race except one. That was  the  Dutch TT where, on  a \nsweltering afternoon, Ago led  every lap,  and  won by over \n24 seconds. It was the  last  350  class win  for a four-stroke, \nfor  MV, and  for the  man himself. Many would argue \nthat this  was a greater achievement than his win  at the \nNurburgring later in the year. \nGIACOMO AGOSTINI STATISTICS \n®  His total of 15 world titles is better than any  other rider, Angel Nieto (13)  being the \nnext most successful \n122  GP victories —  the  most successful racer of all time \n8 premier-class titles; Valentino Rossi, with 6, is the  next most successful \n7 350cc titles, beating Jim  Redman (4) \n68  race wins in the  premier class —  only Rossi has won more \n54  race wins in the  350cc class —  more than any  other rider \nOnly rider to win  500cc GP  races and  the  500  title  on  both two-stroke and \nfour-stroke machines \nOnly rider to win  the  350cc title  on  two-stroke and  four-stroke bikes \nLast rider to win  both a  500cc GP  and  a 350cc GP  on  a four-stroke \nLast rider to win  a  350cc world title on  a four-stroke \nFirst rider to win both the  350cc and 500cc titles on  a two-stroke \nAchieved a  perfect season of  10  500cc GP wins from 10  races in  1968 \nIn  1970 he won 19  GP  races (10 x 500cc, 9 x 350cc) to share the  record \nfor  most GP wins in a single season with Mike Hailwood \n20 successive 500cc GP  race  victories during the  1968 and  ‘69  seasons —  an  all-time record \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 1214"

Indeed, the  World Champion was very \nrarely beaten at all.  Sheene and his Suzuki won \nsix out  of the  nine races in which they competed, \nboycotting the  Austrian event along with the \nother big names. He was beaten by Wil  Hartog \n(NED, Suzuki) in Holland, and finished down the \nfield in Finland when his  motor overheated, but \nthat was enough to  win the title so  Barry didn’t \ngo to  Czechoslovakia. Then overheating stopped \nhim again at Silverstone, now the  venue for the \nBritish round. \nYamaha fielded Johnny Cecotto, Steve Baker \n(USA) and Giacomo Agostini on  their new bikes. \nThe American newcomer was the  most impressive \nof the  trio, and although he didn’t win a  race he \nfinished second overall.

There has  never \nbeen a faster World Championship race. It was held on \nthe  8.75-mile (14.12-km) version of the  circuit that was \nshrunk to a 4.32-mile (6.95-km) track two  years later. | \nFor  comparison, in 2008 the  fastest MotoGP race of \\! \nthe  year was at  Phillip Island, with Casey Stoner (AUS, \nDucati) winning at  109.36mph (176.00km/h). \nSpa was the  last  of the  old-style road circuits, laid  out \nin the  days when engine technology was giving riders \nplenty of horsepower but  chassis, brakes and  tyres had \nhardly moved on  from the  pioneer days. Look at  maps \nof tracks like  the  Sachsenring, parts of the  old  Brno \nroad circuit, Dundrod (home of the  Ulster GP), Monza \nbefore the  chicanes, and  even the  Isle  of Man Mountain \ncircuit. What they have in common is fast, long straights \nand  sweeping or  interlinked corners that don’t require \nmuch in the way of braking. In the  late  1970s Spa- \nFrancorchamps still  had  the  Masta straight at the  highest \npart of the  course, with its  130mph (209km/h) kink. The \nonly place riders dropped below 100mph was for the \nLa Source hairpin that ended the  lap.  Eugenio Lazzarini \n(ITA, Kreidler) won the  50cc race earlier in the  day at \nover 102mph (164km/h), which gives a  pretty good \nindication of what was required to win  at the  old  Spa. \nThis  was not  a trouble-free race for Sheene. His  rev- \ncounter bracket was repaired with duct tape after the \nwarm-up lap, and in the  early laps he was involved in a \nsix-man group and  after that in a  lap-record-shattering \ndice with Michel Rougerie (FRA, Suzuki). On  the  very last \nlap fuel  starvation nearly stopped Barry —  he was down \nto  60mph (97km/h) at one  point —  but  he still  won by \nten  seconds from Steve Baker. \nLd tae ;  x Ys ; \nSe ae $n ee \nmT   a hat 4 ign  iG \nRIGHT The start of the \nfastest race in  Grand \nPrix history, the 1977 \nBelgian 500cc race at \nSpa-Francorchamps. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 125"

He  has  been \na champion as  both rider and  team owner, a  unique \nachievement in itself, but  he has  also been a  constructor. \nAlong the  way he has  been credited with everything from \nbeing the  first racer to  get  his knee down, the  first  to \nadopt the  hang-off riding style, and  the  first  deliberately \nto  use  rear-wheel steering. He  didn’t actually do  any  of \nthese first, but  he did  completely revolutionise the  way in \nwhich motorcycle racers were treated and  GPs  were run. \nIt was also very obvious that he didn’t care whom \nhe  upset. He was a  central player in the  World Series \nscheme that threatened to  break motorcycle racing away \nfrom FIM  control. The  plans never came to fruition, but \nthe  shock waves the  idea generated hastened the  end \nof races on  deadly circuits and  the  exploitation of riders \nby greedy organisers. Roberts clearly saw the  Catch 22 \nsituation: every racer wants to  be the  best and  that means \nbeing World Champion. However, to  be a champion riders \nhad  to subject themselves to  humiliation at the  hands of \norganisers, and  at tracks where capital punishment was \nthe  reward for a  mistake on  a  motorcycle. Kenny did  not \nlike  this, so  he did  something about it. \nFor  the  record, Kenny says it was by watching Jarno \nSaarinen (at Ontario in  1973) that he figured out  that \nshifting his weight around would help him  in corners. As \nfor  rear-wheel steering, Roberts says he learned from a \nGoodyear contact that American ace  Cal  Rayborn set  his \nbikes up to  push the  front in slow corners and  slide the \nrear  in fast  ones. That’s what Kenny did  in the  States, and \nthat’s what he  brought to  Europe. \nRIGHT Under the \nbubble with both \nwheels well off  the \nground: Roberts \nat  the Finnish GP. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 129"

The  NR500 was, without a doubt, the  most \nradical motorcycle ever built, the  result of giving young \nengineers a blank sheet of paper. Why? Mr  Honda really \ndidn’t like two-strokes. \nBut  how could they achieve enough power to  be \ncompetitive with the  strokers? The  answer was frankly \noutrageous: regulations demanded no  more than four \ncylinders so  Honda effectively built a V8,  then siamesed \nthe  bores. Each oval piston had  two connecting rods, \neach cylinder eight valves and  two spark plugs. The \ncycle parts were just as  advanced. Yamaha were still \nrunning their straight four, Suzuki a square four. The \nframe was an  aluminium monocoque at a time when \nsteel tubes were still  the  norm. The  forks were outer \nupper tube (upside down), with 16-inch wheels and \nrear  suspension rising-rate linkage years before they \nbecame the  norm; Sheene’s Suzuki still  used twin rear \nshock absorbers and 18-inch wheels. The  NR  even had \nside-mounted radiators to avoid feeding warm air to the \ncarbs ten  years before it became common practice. Next \nto the  opposition, the  NR500 looked tiny. \nSome Honda managers had  counselled caution and \nasked for a parallel two-stroke programme, or  at least \nsome shakedown races at national level. The  top  men \nfelt they wouldn't learn quickly enough that way. Of \ncourse, such a  radical machine was a  racing nightmare. \nIt needed to  run  at 7000rpm to start —  unfortunately \npush starts were still  in force. The  motor sounded like \nit stopped dead when the throttle was  closed, so  it \nis fair to assume that  there was  next to  no  flywheel. \nRiders Mick Grant and  Takazumi Katayama had  dreadful \nproblems even qualifying. \nTotal Pos Rider Nat \n120 1 Eugenio Lazzarini ITA \nDS 2 Rolf Blatter SWI \n50 3 Patrick Plisson FRA \n48 4  ~~ Gerhard Waibel GER \n47 5 Peter Looijensteijn NED \n40 6 Hagen Klein GER \n39 7 Henk van  Kessel NED \n36 8 Jacques Hutteau FRA \n36 9 Ingo Emmerich GER \n35 10 Stefan Dorflinger SWI \nSeeing the world’s largest motorcycle company \nsuffering such public humiliation engendered much \namusement, and  the  NR  never scored a World \nChampionship point. The  first  NR  may have been a racing \nfailure, but  it is also probably the  most misunderstood \nracer ever. Many top  Honda men, including the current \npresident, Takeo Fukui, started their careers on  the \nproject. Remember that  the  NR was  Honda's first V4. \nWithout the  several hundred patents and  the  knowledge \ngained in four years of racing, would the  RVF, RC30 and, \nindeed, the  NSR have been such elegant designs? \nMachine Total \nKreidler 75 \nKreidler 62 \nABF 32 \nKreidler 31 \nKreidler 30 \nKreidler 26 \nKreidler 23 \nABF 22 \nKreidler 19 \nKreidler 18 \nABOVE This is what the \nfuss was all  about: oval \npistons, each with two \ncon rods, two spark plugs \nand eight valves.

The American \nnow had a choice of aluminium or  steel frames but \notherwise the  bike was little changed. When the \nSuzukis got up to speed mid-season Yamaha reversed \nthe  outer cylinders of the  engine to  give all the \nexhaust pipes straight runs. \nThe factory also sold a  Roberts Replica, the TZ500G. \nIt differed from the factory bike in that the  power \nvalves were mechanically, not  electrically, operated. \nOne of these bikes did  win  —  courtesy of Jack \nMiddelburg, at home in Holland —  but  his machine was \nreally a  Nico Bakker chassis with RG  Suzuki forks, and \nno-one else got one on  the  rostrum. The Cagiva that \nappeared at the  last  round, ridden by Virginio Ferrari, \nwas built around a TZ500 bottom end. \nHeron Suzuki had  two new riders after Barry \nSheene left to  run  a private Yamaha with Akai \nsponsorship —  20-year-old Randy Mamola and New \n134 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nprivateer’s triumph in the  350  class \nRoberts and Yamaha made it a hat-trick \nof titles but the story of the year was a \nABOVE The final \nshowdown: Jon Ekerold \nand Anton Mang duel \non  the Nurburgring with \nno-one else in sight.

Despite the  problems of the \nprevious season, when the  Suzuki challenge had no \nclear leader, the  factory again supplied full  works \nbikes to their Dutch and Italian teams. Wil  Hartog \nreturned, while the  Olio Nava Fiat team had  two new \nriders: Graziano Rossi and Marco Lucchinelli. All the \nSuzuki riders had  problems with their new rising- \nrate suspension systems at the  start of the  year, and \nRoberts took full  advantage. \nHonda also returned late  in the  season with a \nmuch simplified version of their oval-piston NR500 \nin a conventional steel tube frame engineered by \nUK  specialist Maxton. The NR wasn’t the  only \nunconventional bike on  the  grid. Kawasaki fielded \nKork Ballington on  a  rotary-valve square four housed \nin an  aluminium monococque chassis, the  KR500. It \nwas very long, very heavy, but  it was reliable. \nRIGHT Jack Middelburg \n(NED) looking slightly \nshell-shocked after \nwinnng the  500cc GP  at \nAssen. It was the  first \nof his two wins.

It had been winning races since \n1973 but  disc-valve induction was now being used by \nevery other factory in GPs, so  Yamaha gave Kenny \nRoberts a  new square four with disc-valves and an \naluminium frame, the  OW54. It was powerful but \nunderdeveloped and caused Roberts problems both \nwith abrupt power delivery and handling. This was \nalso the  last year that Kenny, or  anyone else, used \nGoodyear tyres in GPs. A revised chassis appeared for \nthe  French GP,  along with a second square four for \nBarry Sheene from the  French round onwards. Barry \nimmediately went well on  it and won the  last  race \nof the  year. There were TZ500s as  well, the  model \nJ, for  privateers, and seven replicas of the 1980 bike \ncomplete with aluminium frames for senior men \nlike  Sheene, Boet van  Dulmen and Christian Sarron, \nthe  most successful of whom was Dutch rider van \nDulmen, with two third places. \nDespite all this  effort by Yamaha, it was Suzuki \n138 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nwho won the title with their factory bike and Suzuki \nwho supplied the  best privateers. Randy Mamola \nand Graeme Crosby stayed with the  Heron team, \nnow with Ingersoll sponsorship, with Japanese test \nrider Hiroyuki Kawasaki appearing for the  first few \nraces. The Italian Nava team had just one rider, \nMarco Lucchinelli, as  did the  Dutch squad, who kept \nWil  Hartog. All  were on  XR35 square fours with \nconventional steel chassis. The  exception was Mamola \nwho got a square-section aluminium chassis which he \nraced from the  Belgian GP  onwards. \nDutch privateer Jack Middelburg gave the  RG500 \nSuzuki what many consider its finest moment when \nhe beat Roberts in a straight fight on  the  fearsomely \nfast  old  Silverstone circuit. Kork Ballington continued \nwith the  Kawasaki, which had lost  some weight but \nwas still  too  long and too  heavy. He  did  get it on  the \nrostrum twice, the  only top-three finishes the  KR500 \never managed. Kawasaki had no  such problems in \nthe  350  and 250cc classes where Anton Mang put \ntogether a season of utter domination. \nABOVE ‘Lucky’ Lucchinelli \non  his way to  winning the \nFinnish GP  on  the closed \nroads of  Imatra.

All \nthe top  men were there —  Mamola, Roberts, Sheene, \nCecotto —  but  the  Dutch rider beat them using a \ncustomer RG500 on  a drying track with a  narrow \ndry line. Despite his tough-guy demeanour, van \nDulmen was reckoned to  be one  of the  safest and \nmost consistent riders of the  era,  a fact  that may \nhave had  something to  do with the  number of \nclosed-roads circuits on  which Dutch riders then \nbegan their racing. \nJack Middelburg won two races, yet never \nreceived the  support his talent deserved.

The Roberto Gallina-managed Italian \nSuzuki team put out  one rider on  a very well-sorted \nmotorcycle, which ran  even more perfectly than the \nprevious year, although there was a different colour \nscheme for their new sponsor and a change of rider. \nMarco Lucchinelli took his number-one plate and \njoined Honda's new two-stroke team, leaving Franco \nUncini to take advantage of the  opposition’s disarray. \nUncini’s team-mate was Loris Reggiani. \nThe UK-based Suzuki team kept Randy Mamola, \nbut  Graeme Crosby was pushed out  and joined \nGiacomo Agostini’s new Marlboro Yamaha team \nalongside Graziano Rossi. Another experienced \nItalian, Virgino Ferrari, became Mamola’s team-mate. \nYamaha’s much-improved OW60 square four also \nwent to  Kenny Roberts (the factory's entry), Barry \nSheene and Marc Fontan (FRA). Kawasaki persevered \nfor one final year with their now plate-frame square \n142 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nfour, ridden as  ever by Kork Ballington. \nHonda gave up  on  their quixotic NR  four-stroke \nand, swallowing corporate pride, came in with a full- \non  two-stroke effort with three riders: Lucchinelli, \nTakazumi Katayama and wonder kid  Freddie Spencer. \nThe bike was almost as  out  of step with current \npractice as  the  NR —a  small, lightweight, reed-valve \ntriple —  but  it was good enough to  be third first time \nout  and first in only its seventh GP. \nRoberts, now on  Dunlops, switched to  Yamaha's \nV4, the  OW61, early in the  season. It was far from \nready and, by common consent, the  worst bike the \nfactory ever built. Yamaha's hopes looked to  rest  with \nSheene, riding as  well as  he’d ever done. Yamaha were \nimpressed enough to  hand him a V4 for the  British GP, \nbut the  crash that produced the  most famous X-ray in \nthe  sport ended Sheene’s season. Ironically, Roberts's \nseason also ended the  same weekend, when he \ncrashed in the  first corner of the  race.

MBA \nGOODBYE TO  THE 350S \nThe  final GP  of the year, at  Hockenheim, also saw the \nend  of the  350cc class, but  it was a good day for German \nfans: Anton Mang had  lost  his 250  title  earlier in the  day \nbut  retained his 350 crown with a second place. He was \nbeaten by another German, local hero Manfred Herweh, \nwho hadn't scored a  Grand Prix  point before finishing \nseventh in the  250cc race earlier that day. There was \nactually precious little in the  way of mourning for the \n350cc class —  although, of course, there were privateers \nwho lost some earnings potential —  because the  250  and \n350cc races were now almost indistinguishable from each \nother. Machinery was identical save for different coloured \nbackgrounds for the  racing numbers and a set  of slightly \nbigger-bore cylinders. At Silverstone the  race speeds of \nthe two classes differed by less  than 0.2mph. \nThe  history of the  class shows how GPs  changed \nover time and riders started to  specialise as  opposed \nto  riding a different bike in every class —  the  first  500cc \nWorld Champion, Les  Graham, for  instance, rode 125s \nat the same meetings as  he competed with his  500. A \nrider's choice of class was obviously influenced by the \nmachinery available. Manx Nortons were made as  350s \nas  well as  500s, and  if you  rode an  MV  Agusta in the  500 \nclass you  also  got a 350. This changed considerably from \n1976 onwards when privateer riders concentrated on  the \n500cc class with an  RG  Suzuki, and  the  350cc class was \ndominated by Yamaha and  Kawasaki riders doubling up \nwith the  250cc class. It is interesting to  note that from \n1976 onwards no  rider who finished in the  top four of the \n500cc championship also  finished in the  350cc top four. \nIn every year from 1956 to  1975 at least one  of the  top \nfour riders in the  500cc class also  finished in the  top four \nin the  350cc class, while from 1956 to  1973 the winner \nof the  500cc title  always finished in the  top four of the \n350cc class. \nlf there was ever an  iconic machine in the  350  class \nit was  surely the  three-cylinder MV Agusta that  was \ndeveloped \nfor \nand \nby \nGiacomo \nAgostini, \nas \nis \nshown \nin \nthe \ntables. \nAfter \nthe \nfour-stroke \nera, \na \n350 \nbecame \nmerely \nan  over-bored 250. \n=O ON OU RWN = \nStefan Dorflinger \nEugenio Lazzarini \nClaudio Lusuardi \nRicardo Tormo \nGiuseppe Ascareggi \nHans Hummel \nTheo Timmer \nMassimo de  Lorenzi \nHans Spaan \nQO   Hagen Klein \n350CC STATISTICS: \nMANUFACTURERS \nAND GP  WINS \nWins \n76 \n67 \n—---WHHH BS \nManufacturer \nMV Agusta \nYamaha \nHonda \nKawasaki \nMoto Guzzi \nNorton \nVelocette \nAJS \nGilera \nHarley Davidson \nJawa \nChevallier \nMZ \nYamsel \nNat Machine Total \nSWI Kreidler 81 \nITA Garelli 69 \nITA “Villa 43 \nSPA  Bultaco 40 \nITA = Minarelli 38 \nAUT Sachs 19 \nNED Bultaco 15 \nITA ~~ Minarelli 14 \nNED Kreidler (2 \nGER  Massa-Real 10 \nRIDERS WITH MOST \nWINS IN  THE 350CC \nCLASS \nRiders Wins \n1.

      "text": "~*~ \n—— \n: \n/ \nA \n\\ \nhis  pivotal year saw the  balance of power shifting \ndecisively away from Suzuki and the  American \ninvasion gathering momentum. Suzuki's RG500 was \nreaching the  end of its development, with only Randy \nMamola getting on  the  rostrum. Mamola and reigning \nWorld Champion Franco Uncini were the  factory riders, \nalthough they were run  by different teams; customers, \nincluding Barry Sheene, back after three years on  a \nYamaha, had a  miserable time. \nThe privateers who could afford it were turning to \nHonda RS500s, over-the-counter versions of the  factory's \nNS500 triple —-  now sporting ATAC, Honda’s variable- \ngeometry exhaust-port system. There were four factory \nbikes: Freddie Spencer, Takazumi Katayama and Marco \nLucchinelli all  returned, and were joined by British racer \nRon Haslam. \nYamaha's new OW70 was the  first generation of the \nline  of V4s  that would go on  to dominate the  500cc \nclass right up  until the  advent of MotoGP. The disc-valve \nmotor was housed in an  aluminium chassis that was \nobviously not  the  conventional double cradle that a \n146 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nManx Norton rider would have recognised. Fabricated \nspars ran  either side of the  top  of the  motor ina \nstraight line  from steering head to swingarm pivot with \nvestigial frame members running to  engine mountings. \nOhlins suspension was used for the first time. Kenny \nRoberts was joined by Eddie Lawson (USA). Marlboro \nsponsorship moved from Agostini’s team, which folded \nand Ago became the team’s figurehead. \nAluminium frames were now ubiquitous. Honda and \nSuzuki ran  Michelin tyres; the  factory Yamahas stuck \nwith Dunlop. \nIt was a year of epic confrontation between Roberts \nand Spencer, the  battle effectively decided at the \npenultimate round in Sweden when the  Honda rider \nwent inside Roberts at the  end of the  back straight. \nBoth men ran  off track but  Spencer regained it much \nmore quickly and won. All  Freddie had to do  at the  last \nround was follow Kenny home to  be champion. Roberts \nwon the  race —  his  last —  but  Spencer won the  crown. \nThat passing manoeuvre in Sweden is still a matter of \ndispute. \nABOVE Freddie Spencer \nand Kenny Roberts \nmoments before the  start \nof their final showdown \nin Sweden. (Henk \nKeulemans) \nRIGHT Kenny and Freddie \nstayed civil. Roberts \nlater admitted he'd \nunderestimated his  rival. \n(Henk Keulemans)"

There was, however, a  narrow time window \nin which the  more usable bike could triumph. \nThis was true for the  NS500 in  1983, but  it needed \nthe  genius of Freddie Spencer to take that advantage. The \nother Honda riders ended the  season fifth, seventh and \neighth respectively. The  NS  and RS triples would continue \nto win GPs, but  not  another title. Chassis and suspension \nadvances and  the  development of the  radial tyre  helped \ntame the  V4s  but, as  the  boxing saying goes, a  good big \n‘un  will  always beat a  good little ‘un. \nHowever, when Kenny Roberts became a constructor \nthe  bike he built was a triple, designed to take advantage \nof the  lower minimum weight limit compared to that \nfor four-cylinder machines. Kenny’s triples could do \ncomparable lap times to the  V4s  on  a clear racetrack, \nalthough they had  to carry a  lot more pace in the  corners \nto  make up for their significantly inferior acceleration \nand  top speeds.

The French Yamaha importer \npulled its team from 500s to  concentrate on  Christian \nSarron’s successful attack on  the  250  title. \nHonda gave champion Freddie Spencer their take \non  the  V4,  the  first NSR500, the  bike that became \nknown as  the  ‘upside down’ V4.  They too  went the \nreed-valve V4  route with an  aluminium frame, but \nlocated the  petrol tank under the  engine and ran \nthe  pipes over the  top. This fitted cleverly with the \ncontemporary wisdom that a  low  centre of gravity was \nthe  route to  quick handling. It wasn’t. By the  end of \nthe  season it was realised that its mass centralisation \nlow polar moments of inertia were the  critical \nproperties. The NSR was so  unwieldy that Spencer got \nhis triple out  of mothballs for two races. It wasn’t the \n150 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nEddie Lawson took his first world title \nfor Yamaha as  Honda got their first V4 \ndesign badly wrong \nbike that lost  him  the  title, though, but  missing five \nraces through injury. Only Spencer got the  NSR. The \nother Honda riders were on  triples, Ron Haslam the \nfactory rider on  an  NS,  while Takazumi Katayama \nmissed most of the  season through injury. The stand- \nout customer bike rider was Raymond Roche (FRA), \nwho got some factory support later in the  year in an \nattempt to  stop Lawson’s march to the  title. \nSuzuki riders were headed by Barry Sheene, but \nthe  factory had ceased development of the  RG500 \nso  Sheene had an  old  Mamola motor put  in a chassis \nbuilt by Harris Performance. Barry was the  only \nSuzuki rider to  get on  the  rostrum all  season —  in \nSouth Africa, in the  wet. Having proved the  people \nwho said he was past it conclusively wrong, Barry \nretired from bike racing at the  end of the  year. \nRandy Mamola failed to  agree terms with Suzuki \nand sat  out  the  first two races of the  year until he got \na  deal from Honda. He  then won three races, one of \nthem on  the absent Spencer’s NSR, to  finish second in \nthe  championship for the  third time in five years. \nABOVE Eddie Lawson's \nYamaha leads Randy \nMamola’s Honda; they \nfinished first and second \nin the championship. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nRIGHT Lawson dominated \nthe season with his \ntrademark ruthless \nefficiency.

There was only one of them, for  Freddie \nSpencer, with again a squadron of triples for  Randy \nMamola, Ron Haslam and Aussie Wayne Gardner. \nWayne had ridden a few GPs in  1984, in between \nhis  British Championship commitments, but  he  now \nbecame a full-time Grand Prix rider. Like Haslam, he \nused Dunlops while Mamola and Spencer were on \nMichelin radials. This was the first year that Rothmans \nsponsored factory Hondas in both the  500  and 250 \nclasses. Belgian rider Didier de  Radigues also got a \nworks NS triple run  under the  banner of the Elf team. \nYamaha retained Eddie Lawson and brought in \nRaymond Roche as  his team-mate in the  factory \nset-up.

The company’s UK  importer, Heron, tried \na different approach with the  now outgunned \nRG500. They housed their square-four motor in \na composite chassis for  Rob McElnea (GBR). \nHowever, it wasn’t the  most radical bike on  the \ngrid —  that accolade belonged to the  Elf2, which \nused a  Honda triple motor with a swingarm bolted \non  either end.

Spencer \nsuffered badly enough from carpal tunnel syndrome to \npull out  of the  first race of the  year while leading. He \nmissed the  next two races, came to Austria but failed \nto score, and then did  not  reappear all year. Japanese \ntest rider Shunji Yatsushiro rode the V4 for three races \nbefore Raymond Roche parked his  Honda NS500 triple \nand took over. But the  ‘86  NSR was Spencer's bike and \nno-one else could get the  best out  of it. Ron Haslam \ntook over the  Elf, now in its third incarnation. \nBy contrast Yamaha fielded five  V4s, their \napproach being made clear by the  dropping of the \n‘OW’ designation used for full  factory bikes and the \nadoption of the  YZR500 nomenclature that had  a \nclose relationship to the  company’s street-bike range. \nEddie Lawson led the  Marlboro-sponsored factory \nteam, still  managed by Giacomo Agostini, with Rob \nMcElnea as  his  new team-mate. Christian Sarron \nstayed on  the  Sonauto machine and a  new Yamaha \n158 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nteam appeared managed by Kenny Roberts with \nLucky Strike sponsorship. Naturally the  riders were \nalso American: Randy Mamola and Mike Baldwin. The \nbike had only detail changes from the  previous year \nbut was now versatile enough to  suit  all  its riders, \nand it was completely reliable: none of the  five riders \nfailed to finish a  race because of mechanical problems. \nIt took Lawson just one race to  start winning, after \nwhich he won another three on  the  bounce and \nended the  season with seven wins out  of eleven races. \nThe only time Eddie wasn’t on  the  rostrum was when \nhe fell  on  the  first lap at Assen. \nSuzuki's teams were still  waiting for their own V4 \nbut  both Gallina and Heron squads raced reed-valve \nversions of the  old  square four. Pier-Francesco Chili \n(ITA) of the Gallina team was the top Suzuki scorer, \nwhile the  British operation gave 500cc GP debuts to \nScot Niall Mackenzie and Kevin Schwantz (USA). \nJuan Garriga (SPA) gave the  Italian Cagiva company \ntheir most promising season since they’d come to the \n500cc class in  1982 with their own Yamaha-like V4. \nABOVE Eddie Lawson \nand the  Yamaha YZR500 \n—  a  clinically efficient \ncombination.

The \nriders and teams remained the  same: Lawson \nand McElnea for  Marlboro and Agostini; Mamola \nand Baldwin for  Lucky Strike and Roberts; and Sarron \nfor Sonauto and Gauloises. The only significant \nchange was that Kenny Roberts’s team switched to \nDunlops. Honda, in contrast, did  not  rest on  their \nlaurels. The NSR got a complete revamp, with the \ndirection of crank rotation reversed and the  angle of \nthe V between the  banks of cylinders opened out  so \nthat the  carburettors could be housed there. Apart \nfrom the  single crankshaft there was now little to \ndistinguish the  Honda from the  Yamaha. \nThe difference turned out  to  be Wayne Gardner. \nThe Aussie arm-wrestled the  still  far from perfect \nHonda into submission to  become his country’s first \n500cc World Champion. As  in the  previous year, \nFreddie Spencer was supposed to  head the  Honda \nchallenge but  a  pre-season injury followed by knee \ndamage put him out  until the  ninth round.

Along with another stellar new boy, \nWayne Rainey (USA), Magee rode for  Roberts’s Lucky \nStrike Yamaha team. Agostini’s Marlboro Yamaha \noperation retained Eddie Lawson and partnered him \nwith Didier de Radigues. Rob McElnea left to join \nSchwantz at Suzuki (now with Pepsi sponsorship) on \nthe  now competitive V4.  For  the  first time the  French \nYamaha team had a  second rider, Patrick Igoa (FRA), \nalongside Christian Sarron. \nHonda expected Freddie Spencer to  return, and \nso  did  he.  However, an  old  wrist injury prevented \nhim riding and he decided to  retire. Instead, Shunji \nYatsushiro was drafted in to  ride alongside Gardner \nin the  factory team. Niall Mackenzie and Pier- \nFrancesco Chili were on  satellite bikes for different \nteams and HRC continued to  provide engines for  Elf’s \nexperimental machine, again piloted by Ron Haslam. \nOnly the  Roberts team was not  on  Michelins, \nstaying loyal to  Dunlop. Cagiva retained Raymond \n166 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nHonda got their sums wrong \nagain; Lawson and Yamaha took \nadvantage again \n——— \nRoche, signed Randy Mamola, and made it three \ntyre manufacturers in the top class by starting \na  partnership with Pirelli. lt was a good enough \ncombination for  Mamola to  get third place in the  rain \nat Spa, the  Cagiva factory’s first rostrum. \nThe Honda was a  brute, massively powerful \nbut fatally compromised by the  Honda engineers \nrediscovering their obsession with a  low  centre of \ngravity, which only produced massive wheelspin. \nModifications masterminded by Jerry Burgess in \nmid-season got Gardner competitive, but  a  piston \nfailure while leading on  the  last  lap of an  epic French \nGP ended his chances. Lawson and the  YZR500’'s \nconsistency won them their third title. \nAnother great champion retired before the  end \nof the  season. Anton Mang had already made the \ndecision to call  it quits at the  end of the  year, but  a \ncrash at the  first corner of the  Yugoslav GP  hastened \nhis decision.

He  had Erv  Kanemoto as  his engineer \nand, vitally, they had the  freedom to  do what they \nwanted to the  bike. Lawson rode in Rothmans \ncolours but was not  part of the  factory team, which \nconsisted of Wayne Gardner and new tough Aussie \nMick Doohan. Pier-Francesco Chili (on Pirellis) and \nDominique Sarron were on  satellite bikes, while \nAmerican dirt-track legend Bubba Shobert received \nan  ‘88-spec Honda. \nLawson’s defection threw the  official Yamaha team \ninto chaos. Manager Giacomo Agostini summoned \nFreddie Spencer out  of retirement and signed Niall \nMackenzie as  his team-mate, but  still  prefers not \nto talk about Spencer. Kenny Roberts again fielded \nWayne Rainey and Kevin Magee, Christian Sarron was \nstill backed by Sonauto, and Alessandro Valesi (ITA) \ngot the  previous year’s bike. At Suzuki Kevin Schwantz \n170 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nwas joined by Ron Haslam, with Randy Mamola kept \non  by Cagiva. \nSito Pons retained his World Championship in the \n250s, with Spaniards winning both titles in the smaller \nclasses as  well. Unusually, neither was won by ‘Aspar’ \nMartinez, who was beaten by Alex Criville (JJ Cobas) \nin the 125s and by his  Derbi team-mate Manuel \nHerreros in the  last  ever 80cc championship. \nInjury and worse played a  big part in the  year, \nespecially in the  USA.

Wayne Rainey was the \nother factory Yamaha rider. Christian Sarron was \njoined in the  French Yamaha team by Jean-Philippe \nRuggia, and Juan Garriga came up from 250s in a \none-man team. \nHonda also recruited a  Spaniard from the  250s \nto  ride a satellite bike -  double champion Sito \nPons —  and Pier-Francesco Chili kept his satellite V4. \nThe factory team was cut  back to the two Aussies, \nWayne Gardner and Mick Doohan. At Suzuki, Kevin \nSchwantz was joined by Kevin Magee, but  a serious \nhead injury sustained at  Laguna Seca put the \nAustralian out  for the  season and Niall Mackenzie \nwas recalled from the  wilderness of a  privateer 250 \nride.

Things got \nso  bad there were only 16 starters and nine finishers \nat the  mid-season Yugoslav GP —  and the  last four of \nthem were off-the-pace privateers. \nFortunately the 125  and 250  championships threw \nup  new stars.

      "text": "Loris Capirossi emerged from a  pack of Honda RS125 \nriders to  beat ‘89  runner-up, Dutchman Hans Spaan, at \nthe  last  round of the year and  become the youngest ever \nWorld Champion. He  had  already become the  youngest \nwinner at the  British GP.  Winning a world title  in  a debut \nseason would be reason enough to earn a place in the \nhistory books, but  Loris was still  gracing the  paddock 20 \nyears later. Along the  way he  retained his  125  title, added \na 250 World Championship and then won 500cc/MotoGP \nraces on  three different makes of motorcycle. At the  time \nof writing it is possible he could make that four. \nThe  win  at  Brno in 2006 on  the  Ducati made Loris’s \nwinning career the  longest in Grand Prix  history. His  first \nwin, the  British 125 race in  1990, had come 16 years and \n15  days earlier, breaking the  record of Angel Nieto whose \nwinning career in the  smaller classes started with the  50cc \nGP  of East Germany in  1969 and  ended with the  80cc \nrace at the  1985 French GP.  The  gap between those two \nraces is exactly a week shorter than between Loris’s first \nand  his win  in Brno. \nIf Loris wins again in MotoGP he will  also have the \nlongest winning career in the  top  class. His  first  500cc win \nwas  the  Australian race in  1996, 10 years and  338  days \nbefore his  last  win, in Japan in 2007. Giacomo Agostini, \nPhil  Read and  Alex Barros all have longer gaps between \ntheir first and last  500cc/MotoGP wins, with the  Brazilian \nholding the  record with 11  years and  204  days between \nJarama 1993 and Estoril 2005. \nBy the  end  of 2008 he had  made 282 Grand Prix  starts \n—  more than any  other rider in GP  history \nHe  has taken part in 37.9 per  cent of the  743  Grand \nPrix  events staged since the  start of the  World \nChampionship series back in  1949 \nHe  has  finished in a  points-scoring position a  record \n231 times \n2009 is his  20th year as  a full-time GP  rider —  equalling \nthe  record of Angel Nieto \nHe  has won GP  races on  seven different motorcycles: \n125cc Honda, 250cc Honda, 250cc Aprilia, 500cc \nYamaha, 500cc Honda, 990cc Ducati and 800cc \nDucati \nHe  is one of only two iiders who have won on  500cc \ntwo-stroke, 990cc four-stroke and  800cc four-stroke; \nthe  other is Valentino Rossi \nDuring his career he  has  competed at 41  different \nGrand Prix  circuits \nHe  still  holds the  record set  in  1990 of being the \nyoungest ever rider to  win a World Championship, at \nthe  age  of  17  years 165  days \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nBELOW Loris \nleads the \n125s.

      "text": "ddie Lawson swapped bikes for the third year in \na  row, leaving Yamaha to  replace Randy Mamola \nat  perennial under-achievers Cagiva. Alex Barros \nkept his  ride with the  Italian team, which had been \nexpected to  stop racing until Eddie signed. Honda \nreduced their commitment to three bikes: the  factory \nRothmans team of Aussies Wayne Gardner and Mick \nDoohan plus Sito Pons, who got a second year on  a \nsatellite bike. \nWayne Rainey was back on  a  Roberts Yamaha to \ndefend his title, with 250  champion John Kocinski as \nhis new team-mate. The Roberts team also put Doug \nChandler (USA) on  a third Yamaha, run  in factory \nrather than sponsor’s colours. The French Yamaha team \npromoted Christian Sarron to  a management role, so \nJean-Philippe Ruggia became their leading rider with \nback-up from veteran all-rounder Adrien Morillas (FRA). \nNiall Mackenzie would ride a third Sonauto Yamaha \nlater in the  season. Juan Garriga also got a second \nyear on a satellite bike. Suzuki had, rather surprisingly, \ndecided not  to  re-employ Mackenzie, who had  finished \n178 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nfourth overall in 1990, choosing instead to field Belgian \nDidier de Radigues alongside Kevin Schwantz. Kevin \nMagee recovered from his terrible Laguna Seca crash \nthe  previous year to  ride the  first two races for Suzuki, \nthen discovered he hadn't got a contract. He  rode \nin the  last  race of the year, in Malaysia, for Roberts \nYamaha as  team-mate to Chandler. \nThere was another Yamaha on  the  grid, though, \nand a very significant one. Team Millar’s rider Eddie \nLaycock (IRL) had  a V4  leased from the  factory, not \noperated under the  aegis of a  national importer, a \nfirst for a  private team. This was by way of a test to \nsee  if a complicated beast like a YZR500 could be \nentrusted to  a  private team. The experiment was a \nsuccess. Laycock racked up enough points to finish \ntwelfth overall and it might have been even better if \nhe had not  damaged his shoulder when he crashed at \nAssen while lying seventh. \nThis season was the  last time a  points-scoring \nsystem which did  not  count all  rounds was used: riders \ndropped their worst two scores of the  year. \na ABOVE The ‘Evil Empire’: \nKenny Roberts’ Marlboro \nYamaha team of Wayne \nRainey and John Kocinski. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nRIGHT New star Noboru \nUeda leads double \n125  champion Fausto \nGresini. ‘Nobby’ was the \nspearhead of a  Japanese \ninvasion of the  class. \n(Henk Keulemans)"

John Kocinksi \nwas again Rainey’s team-mate, while Randy Mamola \nhad  the third Roberts bike. Juan Garriga was back for \na third year on a satellite Yamaha, while the  French \nsquad kept Niall Mackenzie, who had guested for \nthem in ‘91,  and brought in Miguel DuHamel (CAN). \nMick Doohan and Wayne Gardner stayed as  Honda’s \nworks riders while Sito Pons handed the  leased NSR \nto  1989 125  champ Alex Criville and went into team- \nmanagement. Kevin Schwantz was again Suzuki's \nlead rider, although fellow-American Doug Chandler \nwould prove to  be the first team-mate capable of \noutperforming the Texan. Cagiva kept both their riders, \nEddie Lawson and  Alex Barros, but  brought in a new \nteam-manager —  none other than Giacomo Agostini. \nThe experiment of the  previous season with \nTeam Millar had demonstrated that it was possible \nfor  private teams to  run  V4s, so  Yamaha now made \n182 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nWayne Rainey made it three in a row, \nbut only after Mick Doohan broke his \nleg and saw a 53-point lead disappear \nengines available to  privateers by way of French and \nEnglish chassis builders ROC and Harris Performance. \nThis enabled over a dozen privateers to  get on  the \ngrid, the best of whom was Peter Goddard (AUS), the \nreigning All-Japan Champion, on  a  bike run  by Bob \nMcLean’s WCM team. \nRainey started the year hurt, then missed two races \nin the  middle of the season after a crash in Germany. \nGardner broke his leg at the  first round in Japan, \nSchwantz his hand at the third race, in Malaysia, and \nthen everyone fell  off at Assen. Mick Doohan’s crash, \nactually his second of the weekend, didn’t look too  bad \nbut  his right leg went under the  bike when it hit the \nkerbing and he fractured the tibia and  fibula. It looked a \nrelatively simple case, but then infection set  in and Mick \ncame terribly close to  losing the  leg. He was 53  points \nin front of the field —  65 in front of Rainey —  before the \nDutch race, with six of 13 races remaining, having won \nfive  races and  finished second twice. Doohan returned \nfor the  last two races, a ghostly presence, but couldn't \nprevent Rainey winning the championship again. \nABOVE Mick Doohan \nis carried into Assen‘s \nmedical centre with what \nstarted as  a  relatively \nstraightforward fracture \nbut  soon became a \nnightmare.

      "text": "The  Honda V4s  sounded different, growling rather \nthan shrieking. In the  search for  usability as  opposed \nto  outright power, HRC came up  with a  new engine in \nwhich all four cylinders fired within around 65-70 degrees \nof crank rotation —  the  ‘big-bang’ motor. For  reasons \nno-one was able to  explain satisfactorily for the  next \n15 years, this  new firing order transformed the  500cc \nV4 two-stroke from a  man-eater into  a  relative pussy \ncat.  The  out-of-balance forces generated necessitated \nstrengthened transmission components and a  power- \nsapping balance shaft, but  lap times came down. The \nbalance shaft also cured many of the  problems Honda \nhad  suffered from due  to the  gyroscopic effect of their \nsingle-crankshaft design —  all the  other manufacturers \nused contra-rotating twin-crank engines which, as  well \nas  being simpler to  produce and cheaper to  maintain, \ncancelled out  any  gyro effects. \nPower could be fed  in  earlier, tyres lasted longer and \nclass rookies could get on  the  rostrum —  as  Alex Criville \ndemonstrated in the  third race of the  year. That would \nhave been almost unthinkable with a  regular firing-order \n‘screamer’ motor, or  even the  slightly softer version that \nfired two cylinders together at  180-degree intervals. \nHonda’s innovation was so  spectacularly successful that \nthe  other manufacturers were forced to follow suit  as \nquickly as  they could. There is  no  doubt that Doohan and \nthe  big-bang Honda NSR would have won their first  title \nin  1992 but  for the  complications that followed Mick's \nAssen accident. \nEven in  the  MotoGP era  manufacturers continued to \nsearch for the  optimal crankshaft phasing. A variety of \nbig-bang and long-bang layouts were tried, without any \ntheoretical justification; the  stopwatch made its  empirical \njudgement. Improbable theories about the  rear  tyre \nslipping and gripping were eventually overtaken by Maseo \nFurusawa of Yamaha’s demonstration that torque flutter \ndue  to  acceleration and deceleration of the  crank, rods \nand pistons at  small throttle openings can  be significant \non  regular firing order motors. \nThe 1992 NSR50O0 looked very like  the  ‘91  model from \nthe  outside, but  the  rearrangement of its  engine internals \nhad  a  profound effect on  racing. It just  took a few years \nto  work out  why \nABOVE &  BELOW At  last, \nthe V4  was tamed thanks \nto  ‘big-bang’ firing orders. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 185"

He would have further operations \nto try and restore movement in his ankle, but  in the \nmeantime he pioneered a thumb-operated rear-brake \nsystem. Mick was joined by two new team-mates \n—  Daryl Beattie, another product of the  production \nline that took young Aussie hot-shots to  GPs  via the \nAll-Japan Championship, and a second ex-A-J champ, \nShinichi Itoh. The  Japanese rider was charged with \ndevelopment of the  fuel-injected NSR motor. Alex \nCriville continued on  the  lone satellite Honda. \nTriple champion Wayne Rainey was joined by 125 \nand twice 250  champion Luca Cadalora, but the  new \nYamaha chassis proved too  stiff and led to  Rainey \ntrying a  ROC customer frame. The French Yamaha \nteam bought Freddie Spencer out  of retirement for a \nsecond and disastrous comeback, alongside Bernard \nGarcia.

When the team brought John \nKocinski in after his sacking by the  250  Suzuki team, \nthe  original riders were seriously undermined. \nSuzuki found another partner for  Kevin Schwantz \nin the  shape of Alex Barros, the  Brazilian rider who \nhad impressed in his three years on  the  Cagiva. \nSchwantz took full  advantage of the  opposition’s \ndisarray, ripping into a 23-point lead after nine \nrounds —  four of which he won —  but  next time out \nat  Donington he was skittled by an  errant Doohan. \nRainey hit back at  Brno, and  then came Misano and \nthe  crash that ended Wayne Rainey’s career.

He  crashed alone, tumbled through the  gravel \ntrap and came to  rest  with a  broken back. \nWayne Rainey comes from Los  Angeles and \nworked his way up from local dirt-track races to the \nnational championship, then to  road racing —  first  with \nthe  underdog Kawasaki team, then Honda in AMA \nSuperbike racing, and  finally to  GPs  with Yamaha. Kevin \nSchwantz is Texan, the  son of a  motorcycle dealer, \nwho was talent-spotted by Suzuki very early on  and \nfast-tracked to  GPs. The  pair were implacable enemies \nwho brought their rivalry over to  GPs  from the  AMA \nSuperbike Championship, and they continued to  find \nreasons to  dislike each other. Rainey was a grafter, hard \nworking and  analytical; Schwantz seemed to  get  by on \nunadulterated natural talent. Their mutual dislike fuelled \nsome great racing in the  500cc GP  class in the  early \n1990s. Schwantz’s own decision to  retire came after \na  long ‘plane conversation with Rainey at the  start \nof 1995. \nDespite his grievous injuries Rainey was back in the \npaddock at the  start of the  ‘94  season, taking over from \nKenny Roberts as  team-manager for the  250  Yamaha \nsquad. No  matter that it was too  much too  soon after \nhis accident, Wayne persevered through his  rehabilitation \nand  then took over the  500 team when Kenny embarked \non  his  project as  a constructor. Eventually, though, \nRainey had  to  admit he found the  role unsatisfying and \nretired to what seems to  be a  happy family life.  He  has  a \npowerful speedboat and has  been known to  race a very \ntrick kart built for  him  by Eddie Lawson. Nowadays he \nis only seen once a year at a  bike race, at  Laguna Seca, \nwhich is close to  his  home —  and  where there.is a section \nof the  track named after him. \nFor  \nthe  \nfull,  \nat \ntimes \nharrowing \nstory \nof \nthe  \ntwo \nlives \nof \na \ndriven \nman \nget  \nhold \nof \na  \ncopy \nof \nWayne \nRainey \nby \nMichael \nScott \n(Haynes, \n1997). \nIt \nis \nout \nof \nprint \nbut \nwell \nworth \nthe \neffort \nof \ntracking \ndown. \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 189"

      "text": "SS TT \nhe  paddock looked very different in  1994: \nWayne Rainey was back but  in a wheelchair \nand as  a team-manager; Honda had lost  their works \nteam’s sponsor; and Kevin Schwantz was racing with \nnumber one on  his  Suzuki, not  his customary 34. \nWithout Rothmans, Honda ran  their three \nmen —  Doohan, Itoh and Criville —  in strangely old- \nfashioned-looking corporate colours. The lone lease \nNSR went to  Spaniard Alberto Puig in a satellite \nteam run  by Sito Pons. Mick duly marched almost \nunopposed to  his first title, on  the  rostrum for  every \none of the 14  rounds and taking nine wins. Honda \ndid  have another highlight, though, in the  stunning \nwild-card debut of Norifumi ‘Norick’ Abe at  Suzuka. \nThe reigning All-Japan 500cc champion was still  only \n18 and had  the  temerity to  race with —  and scare — \nDoohan and Schwantz before crashing out  at  high \nspeed with only three laps to  go.  A star was born. \nYamaha, struggling to  come to terms with what \nhad happened to Wayne Raine, had yet to  get their \nbike anywhere near right. Luca Cadalora was joined \n190 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nSE \nin the  Roberts team by Dary! Beattie: neither had an \nenjoyable season, although Cadalora won two races \nand finished second overall. There was a  veritable \nflood of ROC and Harris Yamahas, the  quickest of \nwhich was again Mackenzie on  the  WCM team’s ROC. \nCagiva stuck with Doug Chandler and retained \nJohn Kocinski full  time, while Schwantz and Alex \nBarros stayed at  Suzuki. However, Kevin injured \nhimself in a  pre-season mountain-bike crash, and then \nagain when he damaged his wrist —  always the  wrist — \nat Assen and aggravated the injury when he crashed \nin  France. More crashes followed at  Donington and \nBrno, until a  big highside coming out  of Laguna Seca’s \nCorkscrew ended his season. The opposition might \nhave had  their problems, but  it’s  actually doubtfui if \nanyone could have challenged Doohan and the  now \ndominant Honda NSR. \nThankfully, spectators saw enthralling 250  season, \nwith Max Biaggi on  an  Aprilia fighting a  bevy of \ntalented Honda riders. Aprilia also tried a  ‘super 250’ \ntwin, actually 380cc, in the  500 class. \nNn Re ee ay \nABOVE Mick Doohan \nwon his  first title by the \nastonishing margin of  143 \npoints.

      "text": "This was the first time Aprilia won both the  125  and \n250  titles in the  same season, a  remarkable enough \nachievement for a company of any  size  but  a  minor \nmiracle for a tiny factory that relied for  its existence \non  selling scooters to fashion-conscious Italian youth. \nThe  Aprilia story started with Loris Reggiani and  what \nwas basically a  Rotax motor in their own chassis. The \ncombination was good enough for a  rostrum in its first \nseason, 1985, despite Reggiani suffering a couple of nasty \ninjuries. Progress stalled the following season when Loris \nwent to  Honda, but  in 1987 he was  back and  gave the \nfactory its first  Grand Prix  victory in front of a  raucous \nhome crowd at  Misano. This was in a field stuffed with \nfactory Hondas ridden by aces like Anton Mang, Reinhold \nRoth and  Sito  Pons, and  Yamahas with Luca Cadalora and \nCarlos Lavado on  them. In  1988 Aprilia entered Corrado \nCatalano on  a  125; he gave the  factory their first podium \nin the  class at the  French GP. \nCustomer 250s were available in  1989 but only \nGermany's Martin Wimmer got one on  the  rostrum, in \nAustria. Next season Wimmer was on  the  rostrum twice, \nDidier de  Radigues and  Reggiani once. In ‘91  Reggiani \nand  Chili rode the  factory 250s, and 125s appeared \nfor the first  time in the  hands of Gabriele Debbia and \nAlessandro Gramigni. The last  named duly gave Aprilia \ntheir first world title  in  1992 after stalling on  the  line  at \nthe  last  round and  riding through the  field to third place. \nThe  250 crown eluded Reggiani, though, frustrated by \nthe  brilliance of Honda’s Cadalora and Kanemoto. The \nnext year it was Tetsuya Harada JPN, Yamaha) and Loris \nCapirossi (ITA, Honda) who thwarted Loris. Then Max \nBiaggi joined the team, and 1994 saw the  beginning of \nhis run  of three Aprilia-mounted championships (and one \non  a  Honda, just to  make a  point); 1994 was also  the year \nthe  125  crown went to  Kazuto Sakata, the  first Japanese \nrider to win  a world title  on  a  European machine. \nFrom the  early 1990s onwards Aprilia were at  least \nthe  equal of the Japanese companies in the  smaller \nclasses, and as  Japan Inc’s interest in two-strokes waned \nthe  Italian factory continued to develop their bikes and \nlease LE  models (replicas of the  previous season’s works \nmachines) to  customer teams. After Aprilia was absorbed \nby the  giant Piaggio group, other brand names such as \nGilera and  Derbi have been affixed to what are,  in fact, \nAprilias. Taking that into  account, the  only years since \n‘93  when Aprilia has  not  provided a World Champion \nwere 2004 and 2005, thanks to  Spanish youngster Dani \nPedrosa taking the  250  title  in both years, and  Andrea \nDovizioso (ITA) and  Thomas Luthi (SWI), the  respective \n125  champions. \nABOVE Max Biaggi won \nfive GPs in  1994. (Henk \nKeulemans) \nBELOW Biaggi’s 250 \nnose-to-nose with Kazuto \nSakata’s 125, the bikes \nthat achieved Aprilia’s first \ndouble. (Henk Keulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 193"

      "text": "ick  Doohan backed-up his first title by again \ndominating the  season, despite throwing \naway the  lead on  the  last  lap of the  third round, then \ncrashing while leading the  next two races. His crash at \nJerez handed the  championship lead to  Daryl Beattie, \nnow Suzuki's lead rider after the  retirement of Kevin \nSchwantz, but  a  run  of four consecutive wins in the \nmiddle of the  season put  Doohan 15 points in front \nof Beattie, and he was never headed again. Britain’s \nSean Emmett had a couple of points-scoring outings \non  the  Suzuki before the  1993 World Superbike \nChampion Scott Russell (USA) got the job full  time. \nYamaha’s challenge was led  by Luca Cadalora, the \nItalian starting the  season on  Dunlops, with which he \nfailed to  come to terms, so  Team Roberts got  him  onto \nMichelins, or  sometimes even a cocktail of Michelin \nfront and Dunlop rear. He won back-to-back races \nafter Doohan’s run  of four. Cadalora’s team-mate, and \nthe  only other full  factory Yamaha rider, was Norick \nAbe. The squadron of other Yamahas in the  results \nwere ROC and Harris-framed privateer machines. \n194 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nA second title for Mick Doohan \nin the  500s and  for Max Biaggi \nin the 250s \nThis was the  first year of Repsol’s sponsorship \nof the factory Honda team, as  well as  Doohan, \nwith Alex Criville and Shinichi Itoh also running in \nthe  Spanish oil  company’s colours. Barros and Puig \nrode leased Hondas, as  did  class newcomer \nLoris Capirossi. \nIt was a  promising year for Spanish riders. \nAlberto Puig had seemed to  be an  ordinary 250 \nrider, but in his second full  season in 500s he  looked \nfar from ordinary. He won at home and looked a \nlikely contender until he crashed in practice at  Le \nMans’s ultra-fast first turn and broke his left  leg very \nbadly, putting himself out  for the  rest  of the  season. \nHis  replacement in the  satellite Pons team, Carlos \nCheca, had also looked average in 250s but  also \ntook to  500s remarkably rapidly. In the  final race of \nthe year, the European GP  at  his home track, the \nCircuit de Catalunya, Checa came within five laps of \nwinning the  race, then crashed out  after a  heroic \nride, gifting the  victory to  another Spaniard —  and \nfuture 500cc World Champion —  Alex Criville. \n} \n| \nwe... \noo — \n% ;    = Nae \nms Us aft J \n~   Ub Fn \n4: \nBe \nFem |  | \ng ; i  ewe . \nABOVE Which way did  he \ngo?

      "text": "t was a year in which the  NSR Honda was little \nchanged but the  opposition got no  closer to  Mick \nDoohan who did  have to work to  beat a strong Alex \nCriville, again his  Repsol Honda team-mate. There \nwere two more Repsol Hondas, this  time a  new \nV-twin, the  NSRS5OOV, in the  hands of Japanese duo \nTadayuki Okada and Shinichi Itoh. It might have \nseemed like the  same idea as  Aprilia’s twin but  it \nwasn't that simple. Where Aprilia pumped up their \n250, Honda built a  brand-new bike to the full  500cc \nlimit to take as  much benefit as  possible from the \n30kg minimum weight advantage for twins. Okada \npromptly put  it on  pole first time out. Satellite team \nNSRs went to  Alex Barros, Luca Cadalora and the \nSpanish Pons team, with Alberto Puig back from \ninjury alongside the  man who had replaced him after \nthe  accident, Carlos Checa. \nKenny Roberts and Wayne Rainey both managed \nfactory Yamaha teams. The former ran  Kenny \nRoberts Jnr, Jean-Michel Bayle (FRA) and Norick \nAbe; the  latter two former World Champions, Loris \n198 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nCapirossi on  a  500 and Tetsuya Harada on  a 250. \nAprilia’s 500  —  or  rather 410cc —  V-twin project \ncontinued with Doriano Romboni replacing Loris \nReggiani. Max Biaggi was the  factory’s only fully \nsupported works 250cc rider. He fought off  a \nsquadron of factory Hondas for  his third consecutive \ntitle. Suzuki stuck with very much the  same \nmachinery, and retained riders Aussie Daryl Beattie \nand American Scott Russell. \nAll  but two 500cc races were won by Hondas, and \none of them was the  result of Criville’s last-corner \nlunge in Australia, which took down both himself and \nDoohan to  let  in Capirossi. It could thus be argued \nthat the  only non-Repsol Honda winner in a straight \nfight was Norick Abe, who became the  first Japanese \nwinner of a Japanese GP.  It was a  reminder of that \nwild-card ride two years earlier when Abe burst on \nto the scene for the  first time. However, that was but \na  sideshow to  Doohan’s majestic progress —  and the \nimmense irritation the  persistent Criville’s back-to- \nback wins provoked in the World Champion. \nABOVE Two triple \nchampions together — \nDoohan and Biaggi. (Henk \nKeulemans) \nRIGHT When Norick Abe \nwon his  home Grand Prix, \nit seemed that he  would \nbe  the next big star. (Henk \nKeulemans)"

His fellow-Honda \nV4  riders all  pressurised him at  one time or  another, \nbut  none of them could put together a consistent \nchallenge. Of the  Repsol men, Alex Criville and \nTadayuki Okada were on  V4s  while the  middle of \nthe three Aoki brothers, Takuma, took over on  the \nfactory V-twin, with older brother Nobuatsu riding \na  '96-spec NSR in FCC-Technical Sports colours. The \nMovistar team of Sito Pons retained both Carlos \nCheca and Alberto Puig. \nSuzuki's lead rider was Daryl Beattie but, still \ntroubled by injury, he had a  mediocre season and \nretired at the  end of the year. Scott Russell was \nreplaced by Anthony Gobert, a  naturally talented \nrider, but  when he failed a drug test Suzuki \nfound themselves needing the  services of another \nAustralian, tester Peter Goddard. \nYamaha's effort was somewhat shaken by Kenny \nRoberts departing to  build his own bikes and taking \nsponsor Marlboro with him, as  well as  riders Roberts \n202 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nThe Honda steamroller, driven again by \nMick Doohan, rolls to the top five places \nin the  500s; Max Biaggi joins Honda and \nwins the 250s for a fourth time \nJnr  and Frenchman Jean-Michel Bayle. When Loris \nCapirossi decided to  go  back to the  250  class Wayne \nRainey had to cast around for another rider, and \nhe signed Sete Gibernau (SPA) to  partner Norick \nAbe. Yamaha’‘s other team was essentially the  squad \nthat had taken Troy Corser to the  World Superbike \nChampionship in  1996. They partnered the  Aussie with \nLuca Cadalora early in the  season. After sponsorship \ndried up,  the WCM team took over the team’s bikes. \nKenny Roberts’s bikes were triples, allowed to  be  15kg \nlighter than a four, badged as  Modenas machines \nthanks to sponsorship from the  giant Malaysian \nProton automotive company. Aprilia’s V-twin got a  last \nrun-out, with Doriano Romboni staying as  the  rider. \nIn the  250s, Max Biaggi left Aprilia in a  huff with \nthe  intention of proving that it was the  man not  the \nbike who had  taken the  last three titles. All three \nclasses now had 26  permanent entries who were \ncontracted to  ride at all GPs.

(Henk Keulemans) \nThis  was the year that the  factory Honda team totally \ndominated the  500  class, with Mick Doohan winning 12 \nraces to  make it four crowns in a  row. He failed to win \njust three times: in Spain an  engine fault slowed him  and \nCriville won; Okada beat him in the  penultimate race \nin Indonesia; and  in Australia Mick fell  while leading his \nhome race to  hand Alex Criville his second win  of the \nyear. The  Spanish rider had  had a horrible accident in \npractice at Assen that  threatened to end  his career, so  it \nwas an  impressive win under any  circumstances. \nThe  team also hogged pole position: Okada was \nfastest at the  first  three GPs, Doohan at all the  rest. \nTakuma Aoki got  in on  the  action too, putting the  twin \non  the  rostrum three times. The Repsol Honda team also \nmonopolised the  rostrum on  four occasions. It wasn’t just \nthe  Repsol team that dominated, though, it was Honda \nas  a Whole. NSR500 riders finished in the  top  four places \nin the  championship, with Nobuatsu Aoki, a class rookie, \nthird overall and  his  little brother Takuma fifth on  the \ntwin. It was the  sort of domination that MV  Agusta had \nenjoyed in the  late  1950s, but then they didn’t have any \nfour-cylinder opposition. Biaggi’s win  in  the  250  class \ngave Honda their first  250/500 double in eight years and \nmeant the  only championship the  factory didn’t get  its \nhands on  was the  125  —  Valentino Rossi (Aprilia) won his \nfirst  title. \nWith hindsight this  was probably Mick Doohan at  his \nfinest.

Mick Doohan, Alex Criville and Tadayuki \nOkada all stayed as  the  Repsol Honda V4  riders, \nwhile Sete Gibernau took over the  factory V-twin \nfrom Takuma Aoki, who had been paralysed from \nthe  waist down in a testing crash. The other satellite \nHonda teams were Movistar Pons, which retained \nCarlos Checa —  and they were also given American \nJohn Kocinski, back in GPs  as  a  reward for  his World \nSuperbike Championship win —  and Team Gresini with \nrider Alex Barros, but  on  a V4  rather than a V-twin. \nYamaha again had  two teams. Wayne Rainey \nkept Norick Abe and brought in Jean-Michel Bayle, \nonly for the  Frenchman to  become another victim \nof a pre-season crash. He was replaced first by Kyoji \nNanba (UPN) and then by Luca Cadalora. WCM, \nrunning as  Red Bull Yamaha, went with Simon Crafar \n(NZE) and Regis Laconi (FRA). The Red Bull Yamahas \nwere the  only V4s  on  Dunlops rather than Michelins. \n206 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nSuzuki brought in Nobuatsu Aoki after his \nimpressive debut, and his  intended team-mate \nwas another Japanese, Katsuaki Fujiwara, but  he \ntoo  was hurt in pre-season tests. The second bike \nwas therefore ridden by Keiichi Kitagawa at the \nfirst round, and then by Yukio Kagayama, among \nothers. Kenny Roberts’s Team KR  lost  most of their \nsponsorship to  Biaggi, and their rider Bayle to  Rainey’s \nYamaha team. Kenny Jnr was retained and German \nRalf Waldmann brought in; they were the  other \nDunlop team. \nThe wild-card regulation for the  500  class was \nopened up to allow for a second entry nominated by \nthe  GP  Manufacturers’ Association. The other major \nchange was the  introduction of lead-free petrol — \n‘green gas’. \nValentino Rossi moved up to the  250  class on  a \nfactory Aprilia. Along with the  official factory team of \nTetsuya Harada and Loris Capirossi they dominated a \nposse of Hondas on  new twin-crank NSRs. Only Daijiro \nKato, a wild card at Suzuka, could win  on  it. \nABOVE Mick Doohan led \nanother Honda sweep of \nthe  top five places, but \nMax Biaggi did  get to \nhim just a  little bit.

      "text": "The  arrival of Max Biaggi was  just what the  500 \nclass needed. His win  first time out  was helped by \ncircumstances, but  it served to  reignite Mick Doohan’s \nenthusiasm for  racing —  or,  rather, for  beating Max. \nThe  coming of ‘green gas’ had  several effects. First, \nit necessitated lower compression ratios and  therefore \nsoftened the  power of both fours and twins. However, it \nonly slowed down the twins and  effectively removed any \nhope they had  of being competitive, whereas flattening \nthe  peak power of the V4s  meant more people could ride \nthem nearer the  limit. Max Biaggi broke Mick Doohan’s \nSuzuka lap record by over a second at the  first  race  of the \nyear. Second, there were also  worries about how the  loss \nof the  petrol-borne lead’s lubricating properties would \naffect reliability. \nThe  more user-friendly nature of the  NSR500 certainly \nhelped Biaggi to  be instantly competitive. He  started the \nrace from pole and, as  just mentioned, set  the fastest lap \nof the  race. Doohan ran  off track early on,  at the first \ncorner, something that could only be interpreted as  rider \nerror, and  then he had  the  crankshaft break on  him  while \nhe was  climbing back through the field. This  was  the first \ntime Mick had  been let down by his bike since he came \nto  GPs. It is possible that the  motor ingested some debris \nduring its trip into  the  gravel trap, but with bulk seizures \nof 250  Aprilias in mind most mechanics worried about the \nnew fuel. \nAssisted by circumstance or  not, it’s  a measure of \nBiaggi’s feat in winning first  time out  on  a  500  that it had \nlast  been achieved by Jarno Saarinen, 25 years earlier. \nMax only won one  other race all season, at  Brno, a track \nthat suited his wheels-in-line style perfectly, but  he was \nimpeccably consistent and  ended the year second overall. \nIt also  helped that  the  Italian brought his usual abrasive \nattitude up from the  250 class, and that turned out  to  be \na major contributing reason for Mick Doohan to decide to \nkeep racing for one more year. \nki PANS \\ \n\\\\   be \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 209 \n\\F \nBELOW Max Biaggi \nexultant after winning \nat  Suzuka on  his  500cc \ndebut.

Gibernau inherited his V4 \ntwo races later and the  Repsol V-twin was quietly \nshelved. There were two Honda satellite teams: the \nPons squad with Alex Barros and Juan Borja (SPA), \nand the  impecunious Kanemoto operation with John \nKocinski as  rider. \nYamaha lined up with two new men in the \nfactory team, both recruited from satellite Honda \nsquads: Max Biaggi and Carlos Checa. WCM (Red \nBull  Yamaha) opted to  keep Regis Laconi and Simon \nCrafar, but the  latter spectacularly failed to  come \nto terms with a switch to  Michelin tyres and was \nreplaced by ex-125 winner Garry McCoy from Assen \nonwards. A new satellite team, run  by Spanish ex-250 \n210 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nracer Luis d’Antin, got  a year-old YZR500 to  run \nNorick Abe. \nNobuatsu Aoki was retained by Suzuki, who also \nprised Kenny Roberts Jnr —  assisted by technical guru \nWarren Willing —  away from his dad’s team. They \nwere rewarded with their first wins since Beattie’s \nsuccesses in  1995. Both, note, involved beating \nDoohan fair  and square. \nTeam KR  re-employed Jean-Michel Bayle only \nto  lose him to  injury early in the  year, a fate which \nseemed to  befall everyone else they hired during \nthe  season. Aprilia brought back their V-twin after \nspending a year enlarging the  engine to  somewhere \nnear 500cc and put Tetsuya Harada on  it. It was the \nonly factory bike on  Dunlops. \nAfter Roberts and Suzuki blitzed the  first two \nraces, Alex Criville stepped into the  shoes of the \nabsent Mick Doohan and showed his six years as \nthe  great man’s understudy had not  been wasted \nto win six  races and become the  first Spanish 500cc \nWorld Champion. \nABOVE Alex Criville, \nSpain’s first 500cc \nWorld Champion.

      "text": "Ask Mick Doohan to  name his finest race and  the \nchances are  he will  pick one  where he won by more \nthan ten  seconds from pole position and hardly saw an \nopponent. Champions are  always fixated on  winning, \nbut  Mick piled up wins and took five  consecutive titles \nwith a  single-minded ferocity that intimidated not  just \nthe  opposition but  the  rest  of the  paddock as  well. He \nutterly dominated the  500cc class between 1994 and \n1998 with a  mixture of ruthless dedication and  physical \ncourage that few have equalled. \nIt is often claimed that he didn't have to  beat men \nof the  calibre of Rainey and  Schwantz, but  people who \nadvance this  argument should be forcibly reminded that \nMick was 53  points in front of a field containing those \ntwo as  well as  Gardner, Lawson, Kocinski and Mamola \nwhen he broke his  leg at Assen in  1992. That break \nnearly became amputation when infection set  in.  His \nrecovery and  premature comeback left  him  with severely \nrestricted movement in his  left  ankle, so  he adopted the \nthumb-operated rear brake. There were other injuries \nand  some terrifying crashes, especially at the  start of \nhis career, but  by what looked like  sheer force of will \nhe  mastered the  500 Honda and, with the  help of race \nengineer Jerry Burgess and his  mainly Aussie crew, \nshaped the  development of the  ultimate two-stroke V4. \nWhat engineers want from their rider is direction, \nand Mick always knew what he wanted and  refused \nto waste time on  distractions. Jerry Burgess took that \napproach on  to  his work with Rossi. It is also often said \nthat Mick had  the  best bike. Well, if that is true, it Is \nbecause he made it the  best bike. \nHow good was he?  Well only John Surtees, Giacomo \nAgostini and  Valentino Rossi have dominated the  top \nclass for extended periods of time in the  way Mick did. \nNot  bad  company. \n'~  \nMick \nDoohan \nwon \nfive \nsuccessive \ntitles \n—  \nthe \nonly \nother \nriders \nto \nhave \nachieved \nthis \nfeat \nare \necebkue \nand \nRossi \n-  \nDoohan \nwon \nmore \n500cc \nraces \non  \na \ntwo- \ndioke \nthan \nae \nother \nrider \n~  \nHis  \n12 \nrace \nvictories \nin \n1997 \nis \nan  \nall-time \nrecord \nfor wins in a season \n'  \nMick \nDoohan \nmade \n95 \npodium \nappearances \n— \nmore \nthan \nany \nother \nrider \nin \nthe \n500cc \nclass \n-  \nHe \nachieved \nmore \nrace \nvictories \non  \nHonda \nmachinery \nthan \nany \nother \nrider \n~  Doohan started from pole on  12 occasions in \n1997 — a record for most poles in a single season \nin the pelos class \n_  Of the 71  races Doohan started in  his five \nchampionship-winning years he finished on  the \npodium 61  times (86 per cent) and won 44 (62 \nper cent) of them \nABOVE Halfway through \nthe season Mick Doohan \nstill needed crutches to \nget  about; this picture \nwas taken at  Assen.

      "text": "or  the  first time since 1988 the  season started \nwithout Mick Doohan. Alex Criville, Sete \nGibernau and Tadayuki Okada all  rode Hondas \nunder the  Repsol banner in the  factory squad. Class \nnewcomer Valentino Rossi was in  a one-man team \nsponsored by Nastro Azzurro with machinery one \nnotch down from the  works boys, while Sito Pons’s \ncustomer team ran  Alex Barros and 500-class returnee \nLoris Capirossi. \nPons’s old  sponsor Telefonica moved to the \nSuzuki team, which retained Kenny Roberts Jnr  and \nNobuatsu Aoki. Yamaha again led  with Max Biaggi \nand Carlos Checa in the  factory squad and the \nsatellite WCM team also went for continuity with \nGarry McCoy and Regis Laconi. Aprilia kept Tetsuya \nHarada on  their twin and promoted British veteran \nJeremy McWilliams from 250s. Team Roberts recruited \nyoung Spaniard David de Gea to  ride their Modenas. \nAll the  V4s  were on  Michelins. The Aprilias and \nthe  Modenas started the  season on  Dunlops but  had \nmoved over to  Michelin by the  middle of the  year, \n214 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nleaving only under-resourced privateers and V-twin \nHondas on  the  British rubber. \nIn the  250s Marco Melandri took over Rossi’s factory \nride at Aprilia and Daijiro Kato, a double GP winner \nas  a wild card, came aboard for  Honda. As  in the  500 \nclass, Yamaha kept their line-up from the  previous \nseason with Olivier Jacque and Shinya Nakano on  the \nworks bikes run  by the  French Tech 3 team. \nKenny Roberts Jnr  won the title with a brilliant mix \nof brave riding, clever tactics and bloody mindedness \n—  a  Roberts family characteristic if ever there was \none. There was no  doubt that the  Suzuki wasn’t the \nbest bike out  there, but team and rider extracted \nthe  maximum from it, and occasionally from the  rule \nbook too. Their crafty approach to  rain-interrupted \nraces caused an  unofficial revision of the  system. The \nyear was summed up  by the  way Kenny Jnr  won the \nchampionship, scoring an  underwhelming sixth in \nBrazil and  then coming out  the  following week at \nMotegi to  win by a distance on  a track that wasn’t \nsupposed to  suit  the  Suzuki. \nABOVE Kenny Jnr  on  his \nway to  becoming the  only \nson of  a World Champion \nto  himself become a \nWorld Champion. (Henk \nKeulemans) \nRIGHT The 250 \nchampionship went \ndown to  the last  yard of \nthe last  race between \nYamaha team-mates \nNakano and Jacque. \nTech 3 team manager \nHervé Poncheral (latterly \nPresident of IRTA) mugs \nfor  the  camera before the \ndecider in Australia.

Kenny Snr \nhad  been the  500cc champion three times, from 1978-80 \ninclusive, so  they became the  only father and  son  both \nto  have won world titles. Senior won two 250cc races \nas  well as  22  in 500s (all on  Yamahas), Junior won eight \n500cc races, all with Suzuki. However, they are  not  the \nonly Senior and  Junior to  have won Grands Prix. \nThe  very first 125cc World Champion, Italian Nello \nPagani, won in  1949 for  Mondial and  also rode a  Gilera \nto  second in the  500cc class. He won two 125  races (SWI, \nNED) and  two 500 GPs  (NED, ITA-NAZ) that year and \nwent on  to  manage the  MV  Agusta team. His  son  Alberto \nwon three 500cc GPs, one for  Linto (ITA-NAZ/1969) and \ntwo  on  MVs (ITA-NAZ/1971, YUG/1972). \nLes  Graham was the very first 500cc World Champion, \nriding an  AJS  Porcupine. The British rider won once on \na  125  MV  (GBR/1953), once on  a  350  AJS  (SWI/1950), \nonce on  a  350  Velocette (SWI/1951), twice in his  500cc \nchampionship year (SWI, ULS) and once in  1950 on \nthe  AJS (SWI), then twice in  1952 on  a  500 MV  (ITA- \nNAZ, SPA). In  1967 his son  Stuart won two GPs  for \nSuzuki (50cc GBR, 125  cc  FIN)  and  finished third in both \nchampionships. Stuart Graham also holds the  unique \ndistinction of have won the  Isle  of Man TT on  both two \nand  four wheels. \nThirteen-times World Champion Angel Nieto’s son \nPablo had  a  long 125cc career but won only one race \n(POR/2003). \nGraziano Rossi won three 250cc GPs in  1979 (YUG, \nNED, SWE) on  his way to third in the  championship on \na  Morbidelli. He  moved up  to  500s and  scored two \nrostrums in  1980 (ITA-NAZ, NED) on  a  Suzuki before \ninjury forced his  retirement. His  son  Valentino Is also quite \nwell known. \nThe  most recent offspring of  a GP winner is Germany’s \nStefan Bradl, winner of the  2008 125cc Czech GP.  Dad \nHelmut competed exclusively in  the  250cc class riding a \nHonda, making a  total of 84  Grand Prix  starts between \n1986 and 1993.

He duly won the \nfirst three races of the year and was never headed in \nthe  points standings. The Italian again ran  on  his own \nin Nastro Azzurro’s yellow colours while the  notional \nworks team shrunk to two with only Alex Criville being \nretained but joined by 250  ace  Tohru Ukawa. The Pons \nsatellite team retained Loris Capirossi and Alex Barros \nand gained West sponsorship. The last  NSR went to \nChris Walker (GBR) but  he was gone by mid-season \nand  the team did  not  see  out  the year. \nSuzuki's defending champion Kenny Roberts Jnr \nwas joined by Sete Gibernau, but even before the \nfirst race the American was warning that the  bike was \nnowhere near being competitive: the  previous year’s \nvictory had led to assumptions that it was actually \nbetter than it was. However, the  Suzuki team-mates \nwere responsible for the  abiding images of the year. \nSete won at Valencia, in the  immediate aftermath of \nthe attack on  the Twin Towers, with ‘| Love New York’ \nwritten in tape on  his  leathers and carrying \n218 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nOne season to  learn, then win the title \nat the second attempt; Rossi won the \nlast ever 500cc championship in the same \ntimescale he’d won in 125  and 250 \nboth the American and Spanish flags to the rostrum, \nwhere third-placed Roberts wore a  New York Fire \nDepartment baseball hat. \nYamaha retained Max Biaggi and Carlos Checa \nfor the factory team for a third season, Garry McCoy \nstayed with WCM and was  joined by World Superbike \nace  Noriyuki Haga, and  the  d’Antin team went back up \nto two riders with Spaniard José Luis Cardoso joining \nNorick Abe. Team Roberts changed the  name of their \nbike to  Proton and brought in Dutch rider Jurgen van \nder Goorbergh. Two private teams, Sabre and Pulse, \nfielded V4s; the first was really a slightly updated old \nROC Yamaha, the second the  last  incarnation of the \nElf, MuZ and  Swissauto projects. The  Aprilia V-twin \ndid  not  return. \nThere was also a shrinking of factory involvement in \nthe  250  class. Yamaha handed their all-conquering 2000 \nbikes to the  Petronas team, Honda gave works bike only \nto the Gresini team of Daijiro Kato and Emilio Alzamora, \nand Aprilia’s favoured duo were old  champion Tetsuya \nHarada and young gun Marco Melandri. \nABOVE Rossi harassed by \nBiaggi —  the  story of the \nseason.

      "text": "The 500cc limit that had  been in place since the  start \nof the  World Championships in  1949 stayed for two- \nstrokes, but  now four-strokes of up to  990cc were \npermitted. Triples could weigh up to  135kg, four or  five \ncylinders up to  145kg, and  if six or  more cylinders were \ndesired then the weight limit was 155kg. Oval pistons \nwould attract an  extra 10kg in engines with fewer than \nsix cylinders. Two-stroke bikes of two, three and  four \ncylinders had  limits of 100, 115  and  130kg, respectively. \nThe bikes also had  to  be  prototypes, a word the  FIM \nhad  insisted on  including in the  regulations in order to \nensure clear blue water between the  new class and  the \nbikes running in the  World Superbike Championship. \nFuel-tank capacity was limited to  24  litres and \nnoise output to  130dB —  although limit isn’t quite the \nright word since the  new bikes were very, very loud. \nSome riders, notably Rossi, preferred to  use  silencers. \nTwo-strokes could only make 113dB and  could carry \n32  litres of fuel. The 25  per  cent reduction in fuel use \nfor the  new bikes, coupled to  massive performance \nincrease, showed why the  factories were willing to  put \ndevelopment budget into  the  new class but  not  into  the \nold  500cc two-strokes. \nThe  move to four-strokes meant electronic fuel \ninjection came to  motorcycle racing decades after cars \nand  engineers wrestled with the  problems of applying \nmodern digital electronics to two-wheelers. Making \npower was not  a  problem; controlling it was. Crude \ntraction control appeared, either using throttle kickers to \neffectively increase tickover in corners or  ‘dropping’ sparks \nif rear- and  front-wheel speeds differed significantly. Early \nefforts also  centred on  coping with engine braking —  or \nback torque. A variety of slipper clutches, some electrically \noperated, appeared as  ways were sought to  make 200 \nplus horsepower usable. \nOvernight, the  expertise needed to set  up  carburettors, \ncrucial to any  mechanic all through the  history of BELOW Just  how good \nmotorcycle racing, became redundant. Making the  fuel was  the  RCV? When Alex \nlast was an  issue, though, so  now the  vital men carried a Barros got  one  for the \nlaptop not  a  box  of needles and  jets. The  most astonishing last  four races of the  year \nchange was undoubtedly how two-stroke V4s, previously he  won two of them. \nregarded as  man-eaters, instantly became obsolete.

Kawasaki picked up Garry McCoy \nafter WCM were unable to  guarantee him a  ride and \nteamed him  with fellow-Aussie Andrew Pitt, who \nhad ridden the  bike as  a wild card at the  end  of the \n‘02  season. Aprilia also upped their game, recruiting \ndouble Superbike Champion Colin Edwards (USA) and \nbringing Noriyuki Haga back to  GPs. \nAt  Honda reigning champ Rossi got a  new team- \nmate in Nicky Hayden —  the  youngest ever AMA \nchampion. Gresini snaffled Sete Gibernau and his \nsponsor from Suzuki to  run  alongside Daijiro Kato. \nMax Biaggi left Yamaha for a  Pons Honda, with \nTohru Ukawa moving from the  factory team to the \nsatellite squad. A seventh RCV was produced for \nMakoto Tamada who, uniquely among the  Honda \nriders, used Bridgestone tyres. Yamaha retained \nCarlos Checa and recruited Marco Melandri, Tech 3 \nkept Olivier Jacque and found a  home for Alex \n226 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nBarros while the  d’Antin team ran  Shinya Nakano. \nHaving lost  both their sponsor and Gibernau, the \nSuzuki team raced in factory colours, retaining Kenny \nRoberts Jnr for a fifth season and recruiting American \nteenager John Hopkins. The WCM team also lost their \nsponsor, and their Yamahas, so  they built their own \nbikes. As they initially used engine castings from a \nproduction bike, they fell  foul of the  scrutineers and \nran  their old two-strokes until they could produce \ntheir own crankcases, cylinders and heads. \nRossi and Honda were even more dominant than \nthey'd been in the first year of the MotoGP formula, \nwinning nine races, starting from pole nine times \nand finishing on  the  rostrum in every race. Valentino \nset  the  fastest lap of the  race 12 times, with a  new \nlap record each time. Yamaha, their riders hit  by \nearly-season injuries, managed only one rostrum all \nyear. The only non-Honda victory came when Loris \nCapirossi took advantage of a  rare Rossi error at \nBarcelona to give Ducati a victory in only their sixth \nrace in the top class. \nABOVE Daijiro Kato, \nHonda’s great hope for  a \nJapanese champion, who \ndied at  Suzuka.

      "text": "It's  almost impossible to overstate what bad  shape the \nYamaha team was in at the  end  of 2003. The  factory \nwas on  the  longest run  in its history without a top-class \npodium, and  they hadn’t won a  MotoGP race since Max \nBiaggi’s victory in Malaysia towards the  end  of the  2002 \nseason. (It was also  Yamaha's longest ever time without a \nwin  across all the  GP  classes.) \nThe invaluable contribution of race engineer Jerry \nBurgess and his mainly Australian pit crew to Valentino \nRossi's GP campaign in 2004 cannot be overstated either. \nValentino had  expended considerable effort in persuading \nthem to  move to  Yamaha with him, where Burgess’s \nability to distil complex situations down to the  one  or \ntwo vital factors that he could do something about was \nsecond to  none. The  team gave Rossi a  bike that worked \nin the  places where it would enable him  to win, while the \nrider himself could ride  around problems on  other parts \nof the track. Yamaha moved Masao Furusawa to  head \nthe  project: he had  already hit on  his  irregular-firing-order \ncrankshaft design and  four-valves per  cylinder as  the way \nto  go.  Rossi concurred the  first  time he tested the  motor. \nIn the  tradition of Yamaha's 500c, the  M1  was never the \nfastest bike on  track but  it worked well everywhere. \nNevertheless, no-one seriously thought Rossi could \ntake the title. In fact, most paddock debate centred \non  whether he could even win  one  race in his first \nseason with Yamaha, so  by winning the very first race \nof the year, in South Africa, he effectively removed any \nlingering doubts about his  right to  be considered one \nof the  all-time greats. He also made it four crowns in a \nrow, something only Agostini, Hailwood and Doohan \nhad  achieved. Geoff Duke, Giacomo Agostini and  Eddie \nLawson had  previously won titles on  different makes of \nbike, but  only Lawson achieved that feat in consecutive \nyears. Valentino's win  at Welkom also beat Ago’s record \nfor consecutive podiums. \nRossi’s only serious challenger in  both 2003 and  ‘04 \nwas Sete Gibernau, the  second most successful rider \nof the  990cc years with eight wins. When Valentino \nwas relegated to  the  back of the  grid for the  Qatar GP \nbecause his  pit crew illegally cleaned his starting spot, he \nblamed Gibernau and his crew. Rossi crashed in the  race \nwhile chasing the  Spaniard, but  said afterwards that Sete \nwould never win  another race ...  what became known as \nthe  ‘Curse of Qatar’ appeared to  work. A week later Rossi \nwon in Malaysia and, on  the  slow-down lap,  he stopped \nto take a broom from a  marshal and  proceeded to  sweep \nthe  track for the  benefit of the  assembled photographers. \nABOVE Taking the  flag at \nWelkom for  that debut \nwin on  the Yamaha.

Satellite outfit Tech \n3 was Fortuna branded and used as  a junior team for \ntwo promising young Spaniards, rookie Toni Elias and \nRuben Xaus. \nRepsol Honda brought in Max Biaggi as  team-mate \nto  Nicky Hayden while the  Gresini team retained \nSete Gibernau and signed Marco Melandri, whose \nrelationship with Yamaha had broken down half-way \nthrough the  previous season. Alex Barros was demoted \nfrom the  factory team to the  satellite Pons outfit and \npartnered with Troy Bayliss, out  of the  Ducati family \nfor the  first time in his World Championship career. \nWhen Bayliss was injured, late in the year, the team \nused a variety of replacements: Shane Byrne, Tohru \nUkawa, Aussie Chris Vermeulen and Ryuichi Kiyonari. \nA new team, JiR  Japan Italy Racing), was formed to \nrun  Makoto Tamada on  a seventh Honda with Konica \nMinolta sponsorship. \n234 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nLoris Capirossi was retained by Ducati, with Carlos \nCheca replacing Bayliss, and Roberto Rolfo moving \nup from 250s to  be d’Antin’s lone entry on  a year-old \nDucati. Kawasaki and Suzuki retained their riders: \nKenny Roberts Jnr  and  John Hopkins in blue, Shinya \nNakano and Alex Hofmann in green. WCM fielded \nJames Ellison (GBR) and Franco Battaini (ITA). Team \nKR started the  year with KTM engines, but that \nrelationship had  soured terminally by the  Czech GP. \nJeremy McWilliams rode the  bike at  Brno using the \nteam’s own V5,  as  did  Kurtis Roberts at Valencia. \nThe major surprise of the  year was Ducati switching \ntheir works team from Michelin to  Bridgestone \ntyres. Clearly this  was a  gamble, but  a clever one. \nThe  thinking went something like this: we  cannot \nbeat Rossi with the  same equipment so  we  will  use \nsomething different; that way although we  may be \nat a disadvantage at some tracks there will be others \nwhere we  have a vital advantage. Kawasaki and Suzuki \ncontinued to  run  Bridgestones, WCM and d’Antin were \non  Dunlops, and everyone else used Michelins. \nABOVE The pivotal \nmoment of the  year came \non  the last  corner of \nthe  first race when Rossi \nbarged past Sete Gibernau \nfor  the win.

No  computer would ever \nhave laid  out  the  high-speed snake of tarmac behind the \npits —  the Veenslang —  let alone retained the  crown in  the \nroad that complicated things so  much for  riders. Despite \nhaving nothing that could honestly be called a straight, \nAssen remained the  fastest track on  the  calendar.

This time, instead of going for experience, \ndouble 250  World Champion Dani Pedrosa moved \nup to the top  class, leaving Max Biaggi without a \nride.

      "text": "i A surprisingly small number of racers won in the  990cc \nera  (2002-6). Valentino Rossi won on  a  Honda and  a \nYamaha, as  did  Max Biaggi. With hindsight, Biaggi’s \ntwo wins in the  first year of MotoGP look better and \nbetter —  the  Yamaha didn’t win  again until Rossi got \non  it —  but  Max never put a sustained championship \nchallenge together. Biaggi and Rossi were the  only men \nto win on  the  990cc M1. However, the  Honda RC211V \nalso carried Tohru Ukawa, Alex Barros, Sete Gibernau, \nMakoto Tamada, Nicky Hayden, Marco Melandri, Dani \nPedrosa and  Toni Elias to victory. The  factory 990cc \nDucati Desmosedici was only ridden by four men and \ntwo of them won on  it —  Loris Capirossi and  Troy Bayliss \n—  although the  Aussie three-times World Superbike \nChampion won as  a  replacement rider in the  very last  race \nof 2006, not  when he was  a  regular. \nThat means only a dozen men stood on  top  of the \nrostrum in that  time, and  three of them did  so  only \nonce, two of them twice, which makes Rossi's tally of 45 \nwins from the  82  races quite astounding. The next most \nsuccessful was Sete Gibernau, with eight wins, one  of the \nvery few riders to  beat Rossi when there were no  weather \nor  machinery factors distorting the  picture. His  2003 wins \nin South Africa and Germany were the  highlights. \nIn their five  years the  990cc four-strokes obliterated \nevery record set  by the  old  two-strokes. On  tracks that \nremained unaltered and  in races unaffected by weather, \nrace times fell  by an  average of 1m  28s  (3.24 per  cent) \nand lap records by 3.4s (3.19 per  cent). Qualifying tyres \nreduced the  average pole time by even more: 3.7s. This \nmeans a  MotoGP machine would on  average take 31  laps \nto  gain a full  lap on  the  best 500. The  biggest reduction \nin the  record lap time was at  Donington Park, (3.9s), the \nsmallest Phillip Island (2.4s), a  reflection of the  nature of \nthe  two tracks. Donington’s stop/start final section was \ntricky for  500s, Phillip Island’s sweepers enabled them to \nmaintain corner speed. \nAll  this  was done on a third less  petro! than the \nstrokers, but  the  rate  of progress is  best shown by the  fact \nthat in the  five  years of the  990 era  there were only four \ndry races where the  lap record was not  broken. \nABOVE The first and \nlast V5  motors. (Henk \nKeulemans) \nBELOW HRC lined up \nevery version of the \nRC211V at  Motegi. \n(Henk Keulemans) \nMotoGP SOURCE BOOK 244"

Hayden, Pedrosa, Rossi, \nEdwards, Capirossi, Hopkins, Vermeulen, Elias and \nMelandri all stayed where they had been in 2006. \nTeam KR  also kept their rider, Kenny Roberts Jnr, and \ntheir link  with Honda, but  all did  not  go well and the \nyounger Roberts brother, Kurtis, joined in at  Mugello \nand then saw out  the  season as  the  team’s lone rider \nafter Junior's retirement. \nDucati had to find a  new rider to  replace the \nretired Sete Gibernau and ended up with a  man \nrumoured to  be their third choice: Casey Stoner. The \nAussie was in turn replaced at  LCR Honda by Carlos \nCheca in what would be the  Spanish veteran’s last \nseason in MotoGP. Randy de  Puniet stayed with the \nfactory Kawasaki team and was, originally, joined by \nhis fellow-countryman Olivier Jacque, lured back to \n242 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nThe  800cc formula arrived, and Casey Stoner \nand the  Ducati Desmosedici wiped the floor \nwith the Japanese factories \nracing from his  preferred role as  a test rider. OJ  didn’t \nlast past the Catalan GP,  however, a  succession of \ncrashes reminding him of why he’d retired the \nfirst time round. Anthony West (AUS) eventually \nreplaced him. \nThe satellite teams, Gresini excepted, shuffled \nriders. Nakano replaced Tamada at JiR for  his first ride \non  a  Honda, while Tamada went to Tech 3 for  his first \ngo on  a Yamaha. He  was joined by top  250 privateer \nSylvain Guintoli (FRA). The d‘Antin Ducati team kept \nAlex Hofmann, although his season would be  blighted \nby serious injury, and brought veteran Alex Barros \nback from World Superbike for a  last  Grand Prix \nseason. He  and the  two Gresini men were the  only \nsatellite team riders to  stand on  the rostrum all  season. \nAfter their hopeful try-outs in the  final two races \nof 2006 the  Ilmor team returned with veterans Jeremy \nMcWilliams and Andrew Pitt  as  riders. Unhappily, the \nbike was nowhere near competitive and that, along \nwith the team’s failure to  raise sponsorship, meant \ntheir season lasted just one race. \nABOVE A ski  resort in \nthe middle of winter \nis a  strange place to \nlaunch a  team.

      "text": "There were three significant changes in the  regulations: \nfirst, the  reduction in engine capacity from 990 to  800cc: \nsecond, the  reduction in fuel-tank capacity to  21  litres \nfrom 22;  and  third, MotoGP got  its first  ever restriction \non  tyres. Only Honda had a totally new motorcycle, a V4 \ninstead of a V5.  All the  other factories re-engineered their \nbikes but  stuck to their existing designs. \nThe  first change meant bikes no  longer had  an  excess \nof power and now relied on  high corner speed, much \nlike  a pumped-up 250. The  fuel restriction had  a  greater \neffect than most people predicted, making ignition \nmapping and  engine management the  crucial part of race \nset-up. As for the  tyres, riders were now restricted to  31 \ntyres per  weekend, split 14/17 front/rear, to  be selected \non  a Thursday evening and barcoded by the  MotoGP \nscrutineer, Mike Webb. This rule  only applied to tyre \ncompanies that had  won races in the  past two years, so \nthe  Tech 3 Yamaha riders, the  only Dunlop users, had  no \nsuch restrictions. There was no  limit on  the  number of \nwet-weather tyres. \nThis rule  obviously favoured the  manufacturer that \ncould produce tyres which worked over a  broad spectrum \nof conditions —  and  that happened to  be Bridgestone. The \nJapanese company had  always worked that way, whereas \nMichelin, thanks to the  proximity of their Clermont- \nFerrand factory to  most European tracks, were known to \nmanufacture new tyres overnight and  thus could afford \nto  make their rubber work superbly in a very narrow \ntemperature or  humidity range. \nOne, and only one, combination of rider, tyre and \nmotorcycle got everything right. At the  first race of the \nyear Casey Stoner motored past Rossi's Yamaha on  the \nfront straight as  if the  Italian were on  a  250; Ducati \nhad  got their fuel  usage optimised, but  only the  Aussie \ncould use  the  peaky motor that was the  trade-off for \n_.

His  Bridgestone tyres, while not  perfect \neverywhere, did  a good job. Rossi and Michelin were \nfalling out  with each other, as  the  shadow of a financial \nscandal fell  across the  Italian. Valentino may have had  his \nproblems and distractions, but  there was no  doubt Stoner \nand  Ducati were the  perfect combination in 2007. \n__  Stoner’s MotoGP victory in Qatar made him the \nyoungest Australian rider to win-in the top class, \ntaking the  record from Daryl Beattie, and  the first \nAustralian to win in all three current GP classes \n|  His points total for 2007 — 367 - ccudiea the \nhighest ever single-season total, achieved by \nValentino Rossi in 2005 \n|  Stoner set a new record in  2007 of 18 points- \nscoring finishes in a single season \nABOVE Stoner drove \naway from the opposition \nat  Qatar like they were \nstanding still.

There was a  new man at the  factory \nYamaha team, too, double 250  World Champion Jorge \nLorenzo. His  arrival meant Colin Edwards moved to \nTech 3 to team with another new boy, British double \nWorld Superbike Champion James Toseland. Honda \nstuck with Dani Pedrosa and Nicky Hayden in the \nfactory team, but  changed both Gresini riders: Shinya \nNakano, whom the  factory thought deserved another \nyear, came in alongside another rookie, Alex de \nAngelis (RSM). JiR formed an  alliance with the Scott \nteam to  bring another 250  ace  to  MotoGP, Italian \nAndrea Dovizioso. Team KR,  after a disastrous 2007, \ncould not  raise the  budget to  race in ‘08. \nThe big-money signing was John Hopkins’s move \nfrom Suzuki to  Kawasaki; Anthony West, who'd \nstepped in mid-way through '07,  kept his job on  the \ngreen bike. Hopper’s seat at Suzuki was taken by Loris \nCapirossi, with Chris Vermeulen staying for  his third \n246 MotoGP SOURCE BOOK \nyear with the team.

Michelin had \na trio  of disasters in the  middle of the  season, and \nwith Rossi having engineered a switch to  Bridgestone \nover winter (for him, not for  his team-mate) \nmomentum was building for the  move to  a single \ntyre supplier.

      "text": "According to Valentino Rossi this, his eighth world \ntitle, was the  toughest of the  lot.  Just  how tough can \nbe gauged from the  fact  that only one  other rider, \nGiacomo Agostini, regained the  top-class title after \ntwo fallow years. On  the  way to  equalling one  of Ago’s \nachievements, Valentino broke another even more \nsignificant record. His win  at  Indianapolis was Rossi’s \n69th in the  top class, a  new record. Another of Ago’s \nrecord totals, 159 podiums in all classes, was in danger \nas  well, because this  was Rossi's 147th top-three finish \nacross all classes. \nAgostini won 68  500cc GPs  from 119  starts, a strike \nrate  of 57.1 per  cent, while Valentino’s 69  win  from 146 \nstarts equates to  47.2 per  cent, but  do the  calculation \nfor  rostrum finishes and Vale comes out  on  top, with \n76 versus 74  per  cent. However, Rossi himself has  said \nthat Agostini’s total of 122  wins and 15 world titles are \nprobably out  of reach. \nThe  win  at  Motegi gave Rossi his sixth title  in the \npremier class, one clear of Mick Doohan’s total, leaving \nonly Agostini with eight ahead of him. Add in Rossi's 125 \nand  250 titles to  get the  total of eight championships \nand  he has  only been beaten by Mike Hailwood and \nCarlo Ubbiali (9 titles apiece), Angel Nieto (13)  and, of \ncourse, Agostini (15). Rossi’s first title came in  1997, and \nonly Angel Nieto’s championship career was longer: the \nSpanish star  won the  50cc title in  1969 and  his final title \nwas the  125cc crown in  1984. \nThis was Rossi’s first  title under the  800cc MotoGP \nformula, so  he  became the  first man to take the  title  on \nfour different types of motorcycle, the  others being 990cc \nYamaha M1, Honda RC211V V5  and the  Honda NSR50O \ntwo-stroke. The  thing that pleased Valentino as  much as \nanything was that this  was his  37th win  and  third title  for \nYamaha, more than he achieved with any  other factory. \nHe  is Yamaha's most successful rider of all time (Eddie \nLawson won 26  GPs and three titles) and the  man himself \nis more than content that this  means he will  now be \nremembered as  a Yamaha rider. \nLEFT The best crash \nhelmet design ever? \nRossi's special self-portrait \nfor  the Mugello GP.
