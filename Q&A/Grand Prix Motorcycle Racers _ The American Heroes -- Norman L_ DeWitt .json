The  movie Grand \nPrix was  released, and in November I attended my first race, the USAC \nIndycar finale at Riverside, featuring Gurney, Clark, The  Unsers, Surtees, \nAndretti, and Foyt. It was a race  for the ages, in which Dan Gurney took his \nfirst win  in the Indy Eagle, at his home circuit before a wildly celebrating \ncrowd. As  Dan once said  to  me,  “So,  it’s all my  fault.” Yes  .  .  .  and  racing \nbecame my all-consuming passion. \nBy 1969, San  Diegans had  won the  Daytona 200  for  eight of the  previous 15 \nyears. The local “Martys”—Smith, Tripes, and Moates—became the first Americans \nto win the MX United States Grand Prix (125, 250, and 500). Meanwhile in Europe, \nMario Andretti and  Kenny Roberts were 1978 World Champions.

Strangely, it was  a bunch of British \nmarketing men who made this  happen, when the  venerable, soon-to-be-history \nBSA/Triumph concern’s publicity crew decided to  try to  grab a slice of stateside \naction by signing up half a dozen U.S. riders to race  their triples in the U.K. against \na team of British riders in the first Transatlantic Match Races over  Easter weekend \nin  1971. Until then, it had  been rare to  see  any  American rider competing in \nEurope, as  there had been no  good reason for U.S.  riders to cross the Atlantic and \nrace  against the locals before this time—and indeed pavement racing was  strictly \nsecond division in the United States compared to traditional dirt-oval action. \nBut  those match races opened the  floodgates, and  when the  series returned \nthe  following year with the  British triples no  longer the  default mount, it was \nan  American rider on  an  American bike who stole the  show. ‘The  late,  great Cal \nRayborn on  the  iron-barrelled XR750 Harley-Davidson V-twin stunned us  Brits \nby winning three of the six races against our  best  riders. In doing so, he kicked the \ndoor open for successive generations of American racers to come and do the same \nto \nother \nEuropeans \non \ntheir \nhome \ntracks, \noften \nsucceeding \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nat \nthe \nTransatlantic \nMatch \nRaces \nbefore \ngoing \non \nto \nbeat \nthe \nworld, \nnot \njust \nthe \nBrits. \nFrom \nthat \npoint \nup \nuntil \nNicky \nHayden’s \n2006 \nMotoGP \nworld \ntitle, \nthe \nworld \nhas \ngotten \nused \nto \nhearing \n“The \nStar-Spangled \nBanner” \nplayed \nin \nvictory \nlane, \nas \na \nseemingly \nendless \nsuccession \nof \ngreats \nwho \ncut  \ntheir \nracing \nteeth \nanywhere \nfrom \nNew \nJersey \nto  \nTexas \nto  \nCalifornia \nto  \nGeorgia \nhave \npicked \nup \nthe  \nRayborn \nbaton \nand  \nrun  \nwith \nit.  \nNow \nBen  \nSpies \nis \ngetting \nthe  \nneedle \nstuck \nin  \nthe  \ngroove \nagain \n\nGRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nwith \nhis \nconquering \nof \nWorld \nSuperbike \nin \n2009 \nand \nhis \nadvancement \nto \nMotoGP \nin \n2010, \nreminding \nus \nthat \nAmerican \nriders \nknow \nhow \nto \ndeliver \nresults \nto \ntheir \nteams \nand \nsponsors. \nNorm \nDeWitt \nis  \nthe  \nmaster \nstoryteller \nof \nmotorcycling \nmoments, \nand \nthe \nperceptive \nprofiles \nhe’s \npublished \nin \nmagazines \nall \nover \nthe \nworld \nof \nkey \nfigures \nin \ntwo-wheeled \nhistory \nwould \nhave \nmarked \nhim \nout \nas \nthe \nright \nguy \nto \ntell \nthis \ntale \nin \nits \nenormity, \neven \nif \nhe \ndidn't \nhave \nthe \nadvantage \nof \nalso \nbeing \nAmerican. \nWhen \nI \nheard \nhe \nwas \nwriting \nthis \nbook, \nI \nreally \nlooked \nforward \nto \nreading \nit, \nhaving \nexperienced \nthe \nso-called \nAmerican \ninvasion \nfirsthand \nin \nthe \n1970s \nwhen \nI followed \nKing \nKenny \naround \nthe \ntrack \nfor \nat least \na few \ncorners \nin Brands \nHatch \npractice. \nI later \nraced \nall \nover \nthe \nUnited \nStates \nand \nsaw \nfresh-eyed \nkids \nlike \n14-year-old \nJohn \nKocinski \nbeating \nup \nriders \nfour \ntimes \nhis \nage \nwith \n10 \ntimes \nmore \nexperience \nat Oakville \nRaceway, \nor \nFreddie \nSpencer \ndoing \nthe \nsame \nin \nthe \nrain \nat age \n17 \naboard \na TZ750 \non \nthe \nsteeply \nbanked \nTexas \nSpeedway. \nTo \nfollow \ntheir \nsubsequent \ncareers \nup \nclose \nand \npersonal \nand \nto \nride \nthe \nbikes \nthat \ntook \nthem \nto \nworld \ntitles—big, \nmeaty, \nfour-stroke \nSuperbikes \nand \nfire-breathing, \nring-dinger, \ntwo-strokes \nalike—for \nmagazine \narticles \nwas \nan \nhonor \nand \na privilege. \nThis \nbook \nrecords \nthat \nera \nand \nthe \nothers \nthat \nfollowed \nit in fascinating \ndetail \nand \nmakes \nthe \nmemory \nbanks \nchurn \nwith \nthe \nremembrance \nof things \npast. \nMention of the  bikes underlines one  important aspect of the  way in  which \nAmerican riders ended up  dominating the  victory rostrum for  the  best part of \ntwo  decades. In many cases, they dominated on  bikes that  were very alien to  the \nmachines they grew up racing. American riders have had in many cases to re-learn \nhow to  race aboard a very different motorcycle than they one  that brought them \nthat  far, especially now that  there is no  longer a 250cc Grand Prix starter class at \nthe  American Motorcycle Association (AMA) level. In  many cases, these riders \nhad  to  adapt their dirt-tracking techniques to  create a whole new style of riding \non  European tarmac circuits. Added kudos to them all, from America’s first road \nrace  champion Steve Baker onward, for doing so. \nNorm DeWitt's comprehensive roundup of  a key chapter in road racing history \nis long overdue, and I’m glad he resisted the temptation to  restrict it solely to the \nseven \nAmerican \n500cc/MotoGP \nworld \nchampions. \nQuite \napart \nfrom \nthe \nfact \nthat \nthe \nsix \nWorld \nSuperbike \nchampions \nto \nhail \nfrom \nthe \nUnited \nStates—from \nFred \nMerkel \nonward—all \nhave \na \nfascinating \ntale \nto \ntell, \nto \nleave \nout \nmen \nlike \nGary \nNixon \n(by \nany \nrights, \nthe \nguy \nwho \nshould \nhave \nbeen \nthe \nfirst \nYank \nworld \nchampion) \nand \nPat \nHennen \n(the \nfirst \nto \nwave \nthe \nStars \nand \nStripes \non \nthe \nworld \nstage) \nwould \nhave \ntold \nonly \nhalf \nthe \nstory. \nInstead, \nwhat \nwe \nhave \nhere \nis \nthe \nfull \nstory, \nfrom \nchampions \nto \ncontenders, \ntitle-winners \nto \nnearly \nmen \nand  \ncompliments \nto \nNorm \non producing \nit. \nAlan Cathcart \nWarwick, Great Britain \n\nGHA PTLERIL \nThe Pioneers \nThe  \nTransAtlantic \nMatch \nRaces \nwere \nthe \nspringboard \nfor \nAmerican \nGP \nsuccess. \nHere \nDon \nEmde’ \nSeeley-Norton \nleads \nDick \nMann's \nBSA  \nRocket \n3 \nin  \n1974. \nDon \nEmde \nCollection \n\n10 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nMERICAN \nPARTICIPATION \nIN  \nEUROPEAN \nmotorcycle \nroad \nracing \nstarted \nearly \nin  \nthe  \nprevious \ncentury. \nThe  \nstory \nbegins \nwith \nJake \nDeRosier, \na \nQuebec-born \nCanadian \nraised \nin \nMassachusetts, \nwho \ngot \nhis \nstart \nin \nbicycle \ncompetitions \nbefore \nmoving \non \nto \nmotorcycles. \nDeRosier \nwould \nnot  \nonly \nmake \nhis  \nname \nracing \nIndians: \nIn  \nmany \nways, \nhe \nmade \nIndian's \nname \nby \ndominating \nAmericar. \nboard \ntrack \nracing \nin \nprobably \nthe \nmost \ndangerous \nera \nof \nwhat \nhas \nalways \nbeen \na \nhighly \nhazardous \nsport. \nThe colorful DeRosier was  among the riders on  the starting grid at the \nvery first race  held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1909. Struggling \nagainst both terrible track conditions and Los Angeles’ Ed Lingenfelder on \nhis  mighty White Pet NSU, DeRosier crashed during the  battle. Bicycling \nWorld and Motorcycle Review’s coverage of the race  noted, “Had DeRosier \nworn proper attire in his race against Lingenfelder, he would not  now be \nsuffering from painful injury. Instead of wearing trousers of stout material, \nsuch as  khaki or  duck, DeRosier rode in a suit  of flimsy tights, which gave \nas  little resistance as  no  clothes at all when brought into  the  rough stone \nsurface of The Motor Speedway.’ \nIn  1911, DeRosier led  the  Indian factory team’s assault on  the  soon- \nto-be-legendary Isle of Man TT  race. He again brought out  the tights and \ncreated a stir by setting the  fastest speed of 75  miles per  hour in a flying \nkilometer event on  the Douglas Promenade. In the Senior TT, held for the \nfirst time in 1911 on  the mountain course, DeRosier led the first lap on  his \nIndian twin. He  was  second behind Charlie Collier's Matchless after lap \ntwo, but then crashed; DeRosier was  eventually disqualified for receiving \noutside \nassistance. \nSurprisingly, \nDeRosier’s \n1911 \nperformance \nremains \nthe \nmost \nimpressive \nTT \nrun \nby \nan \nAmerican, \nwith \nthe \npossible \nexception \nof \nPat \nHennen \nin \n1978, \nbut \nthe \nAmerican's \nTT \nexperience \nwas \nnot \nthe \nteam’s \nhighlight: \nBritish \nriders \nrode \nIndians \nto \nan \nimpressive \n1-2-3 \nfinish. \nSadly, \nDeRosier’s \nimpressive \ncareer \nwould \ncome \nto  \na  \ntragic \nend  \nless \nthan \na \nyear \nlater; \nhe \nwas \ngrievously \ninjured \nin \nan \naccident \nwith \nExcelsior \nteammate \nand \nrival \nCharles \n“Fearless” \nBalke \nat \na \nboard \ntrack \nmatch \nrace \nat \nthe \nnewly \nopened \nLos \nAngeles \nStadium \nin \nMarch \n1912. \nDeRosier \neventu- \nally \nsuccumbed \nto \nhis \ninjuries \nin \nFebruary \n1913. \nAs \nhis \nfuneral \nprocession \n\nTHE PIONEERS \npassed \nthe \nIndian \nfactory, \nflags \nflew \nat \nhalf-staff \nand \nall \nproduction \nceased \nin \ntribute \nto  \nthe  \nman \nwho \nhad \ndone \nmore \nthan \nany \nother \nto  \nmake \nIndian \nmotorcycles synonymous with speed. \nTHE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP \nIn  the  ensuing decades, the  sport of motorcycle racing evolved in  very \ndifferent directions in Europeand the United States. The European tradition \ngrew on  asphalt circuits—Grand Prix races that were held on public roads. \nIn  the  United States, motorcycle competition had  its  roots on  dirt, oval, \nand  horse racing tracks, so  it was  small wonder that the  inception of a \nWorld Championship series of Grand Prix races in  1949 was  not  on  the \nradar of America’s top motorcycle racers of the time. In the United States, \nsuccess at  the  highest levels of dirt  track racing led  to  dirt  track sprint \ncars, which eventually led to  Indianapolis car  racing. Asphalt road racing \nwas  limited to just a  few  events, such as  Laconia. As a result, the greatest \nAmerican road racers on  two (or four) wheels—men such as  Daytona 200 \nwinners Joe Leonard, Brad Andres, and Paul Goldsmith—never seriously \nexplored competing in Europe. \nBy the  late 1950s, however, motorsports enthusiasts in  the  United \nStates were taking more of an  interest in the  European racing scene due \nto  the  success of Americans in  Grand Prix automobile road racing. Phil \nHill, Dan  Gurney, Richie Ginther, Harry Schell, and Masten Gregory were \nregularly competing in Formula One by this time, overcoming challenges \nsuch as  different shift patterns on  different cars. (The author once asked \nPhil Hill  how drivers were supposed to  keep track of such variations: “If \nyou wanted to stay alive, you'd remember it. Once, in 1959, youd go all the \nway  across the  gates and  straight back in the  same direction to  go from \nfirst  to second.”) \nThe \nfirst \nFl  \nUnited \nStates \nGrand \nPrix \n(USGP) \nwas \nheld \nat  \nSebring \nin \n1959, \nand \nthe  \nUnited \nStates \nhas  \nhosted \nnumerous \nF1  \nGPs \nsince. \nIn  \n1961, \nHill \nbecame \nthe \nfirst \nAmerican \nracer \nto \nearn \nthe \ntitle \nof \nworld \nchampion \nwhen \nhe \nwon \nthe \nF1 \nWorld \nDrivers’ \nChampionship, \npiloting \nhis \nFerrari \nDino \n156 \nto \ntwo \nvictories \nand \nfive \npole \npositions. \nThe \nend \nresult \nof \nthis \nlate  \n1950s \nroad \nracing \nautomotive \nrenaissance \nwas  \nthe  \nconstruction \nof \nia \n\n12 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nseveral \npermanent \nracing \nfacilities, \nwith \nnames \nthat  \necho \nacross \nthe \nages, \nincluding \nRiverside, \nRoad \nAmerica, \nand  \nLaguna \nSeca. \nWith \nthe  \nracing \nfacilities \nnow \nin \nplace, \nwhat \nwas  \nneeded \nwas \na \ncatalyst. \nThe  \nfirst  \nWorld \nChampionship \nGrand \nPrix \nfor  \nmotorcycles \nwas  \nheld \nat \nDaytona \nInternational \nSpeedway, \nthe \nsite \nof \nthe \nDaytona \n200, \nthe \nmost \nprestigious \ntwo-wheel \nrace \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates \nat \nthat \ntime. \nThe \n1964 \nUSGP \ntook \nplace \nunder \nadversarial \ncircumstances \nbetween \nthe \nAmerican \nMotorcycle \nAssociation \n(AMA) \nand \nDaytona \nSpeedway \nowner \nBill \nFrance's \nMotorcycle \nInternational \nCommittee \nof the \nUnited \nStates \n(MICUS), \nwhich \nhad \nbecome \nthe \nFédération \nInternationale \nde \nMotocyclisme's \n(FIM) \naffiliate \nfor \nracing \nin \nAmerica. \nThe \nAMA \nforbade \nits \nriders \nfrom \ncompeting \nand \nmost \nof the \nAmerican \nracers \nchose \nto \nsit \nout \nthe \nevent \nrather \nthan \nrisk \ntheir \nAMA \nGrand \nNational \nChampionship \nambitions. \nSome \nAmericans \ndid \nrace, \nhowever, \nwith \nBuddy \nParriott \nplacing \nsixth \nin \nthe \npremier \nclass \n(500cc) \nevent \nto \nearn \na \nsolitary \npoint. \nMike \nHailwood \nwon \nthe \nrace \non \nan \nMV \nAgusta. \nIn \nthe \n250cc \nclass, \nBritish \nemigrant \nRon \nGrant \nfinished \nsecond, \nfollowed \nby American \nBo \nGehring; \nthese \ntwo \nshare \nthe \nhonor \nof \nbeing \nthe \nfirst \nAmericans \nto \ngrace \na \nGP \npodium. \nThe \nWorld \nChampionship \nGrand \nPrix \nfor \nmotorcycles \nwas \nheld \nfor \na \nsecond \nand \nfinal \ntime \nin \n1965. \nThis \nevent \nsaw \nParriott \nbecome \nthe \nfirst \nAmerican \nto \nstand \non \na \npremier \nclass \nGP \npodium \nafter \nhe \nrode \nhis \nNorton \nManx \nto \nsecond \n(again \nbehind \nHailwood) \nin the 500cc \nrace. \nParriott’s \nsingular \nfinish \nearned \nhim \nan \neighth-place \nfinish \nin \nthe \n1965 \nWorld \nChampionship. \nTHE DAYTONA 200 \nParriott \nwould \nnever \nhave \nthe  \nchance \nto  \nfollow \nup  \nhis  \n1965 \nsuccess: \nHe \nretired \nfrom \nthe \nsport \nin \n1966, \nand \nthe \nUnited \nStates \nwould \nnot \nhost \nanother \nWorld \nChampionship \nmotorcycle \nGrand \nPrix \nuntil \n1988. \nBut \nthe \n1964 \nand \n1965 \nraces \ndid \nbring \nmore \ninternational \ninterest \nto \nthe \nDaytona \n200. \nThe \nUnited \nStates \nwas \na \nmajor \nmarket \nfor \nthe \nBritish \nmotorcycle \nmanufacturers, \nso \nthe \npublic \nrelations \nvalue \nof \na \nwin \nin \nthe \n200 \nwas \nhuge \nin \nthis \nera \nbefore \nthe \narrival \nof \nthe \nJapanese \nfactories. \nThese \nwere \nthe \ndays \nwhen \nNorton, \nTriumph, \nBSA, \nand \nHarley-Davidson \ncompeted \nfor \ntop \nhonors, \nwith \nDaytona \nserving \nas \nthe \nproving \nground \nfor \nthe \ntop \nAmerican \n\nTHE PIONEERS \nriders, \nincluding \nthe \nlegendary \nGary \nNixon, \nwho \nwon \nthe \nrace  \nin  \n1967 \nen \nroute \nto the first of \ntwo \nconsecutive \nAMA \nGrand \nNational \ntitles. \nThat \nyear, \nTriumph’s \nTiger \nT100/R \nwas  \nthe  \ndominant \nforce \nand  \nNixon \nhad his greatest \nseason, \nwinning \nfive \nGrand \nNational \nraces, \nincluding \nthe \nDaytona \n200. \nHe \nalso won \nthe 250 \nGP \nrace, \ntaking \nwins \nin \nboth \nof \nthe \nevent's \nmajor \nraces \nand securing \nhis \nposition \nas \nan \nAmerican \nroad \nracing \nlegend. \nThe 1968 Daytona 200  brought the  European invasion of Phil Read, \nPeter Williams, and  Rod Gould. Japanese rider Mitsuo Ito also  competed \non  a Suzuki. The  foreign riders’ impact was  dulled by the phenomenal Cal \nRayborn, who won  the first  of his two Daytona 200s on a Harley-Davidson. \nGary Nixon had  essentially brought a  knife to  a  gunfight, and  said, “We \nwere running one  hundred thirty-five miles per  hour; the  Harleys were \nrunning one  hundred fifty. I told them they needed to put a mirror on  the \nf**ker, so  I could see  which side  they were going by me  on.”  Yet  despite \nthe  superiority of the  road racing Harley-Davidson, Nixon still  repeated \nas  Grand National Champion, further cementing his  relationship with \nTriumph and  giving him the  opportunity to  become the  first  American \nto  race Overseas. \nNixon recalls his  1970 experience in Europe: \nYvon [Duhamel] and I went over for  the  Race of the  Year at  Brands \nHatch. You  had to push-start [the bikes], and Mike Hailwood was  the \nflagman. I had  an  eighteen-inch stainless-steel rod  in my leg, and  I'd \nnever done a  push-start before. Mike and  I were buddies, so  when \nI started pushing he  threw the  flag, so  I got  to  the  first turn with \nthe pack. \nFor  \n1971, \nthe  \nrest  \nof \nthe  \nAmerican \nBSA/Triumph \nteam \njoined \nNixon \nfor \nan \nevent \nthat \nwould \nserve \nas \na \nlaunching \npoint \nfor \nmost \nof \nthe \nfuture \nAmerican \nWorld \nChampionships: \nthe \nTransatlantic \nMatch \nRaces. \nTHE TRANSATLANTIC MATCH RACES \nIt \nall  \nstarted \nduring \nDaytona \nBike \nWeek \nin  \n1971. \nA  \ngroup \nof \nrace \nand \nteam \norganizers \ngot \ninto \na \ndebate \nat \na \nbar \nover \nwho \nhad \nthe \nfastest \nriders, \n13 \n\n14.

While \nAmerican Grand National riders had to be competitive on  various types of \nroad and  dirt racing machinery, the  British riders (who in  1971 included \nRay Pickrell, Paul Smart, Tony Jeffries, Percy Tait, and  John Cooper) were \nnot  only road racing specialists but had years of experience on  the circuits \nwhere the races would take place. \nDavid Aldana was one of  the  Americans who participated in  the \nTransatlantic event. He describes the challenges the Americans faced: \nRacing with the likes of Barry Sheene, John Cooper, and Mick Grant, \nwe  were racing against the best in the world. In the  U.S., we'd maybe \ndo a  road race every couple of months. The  racetracks were up  and \ndown hills with off-camber corners. You'd come up  to  a  ninety- \ndegree turn, and right in  front of you  was  a  stack of railroad ties \nabout twelve-feet high. If you  didn’t make the corner, you  were dead. \nAnother corner had a brick house for electrical equipment; it was  like \nthe Isle of Man—pretty scary. \nAnother American competitor, Don Emde, recalls that  the  riders had  no \nidea  what they were getting into  in  1971: \nWe \nthought \nit \nwas \njust \nan \nexhibition \nor \na \nphoto \nop, \na \nseeing-the-factory \nsort  \nof \nthing. \nOn  \nthe  \nplane \nride \nover, \nI \nfound \nout  \nthat \nthis  \nwas  \ngoing \nto \nbe \na \nfull-on \nrace \nagainst \nthese \nguys. \nWhen \nwe \ngot \nthere, \nthe \nBritish \npapers \nwere \nall \nfull \nof \nthe \n“Who \nwill \nwin?” \nkind \nof \nstuff. \n. \n. \nit \nwas \nreally \nmore \nlike  \nCuster’s \nlast  \nstand. \nSmart, \nPickrell, \nCooper \n.  \n.  \n.  \nthey \nwere \njust gone.” \n\nTHE PIONEERS \nThe  \nAmerican \nteam \nsuffered \nits  \nfirst  \nblow \nin  \nits  \nfirst \npractice \nat  \nBrands \nHatch, \nwhen \nGary \nNixon \nwas  \nknocked \nout  \nof \nthe  \ncompetition. \n“Coming \nout  \nof \nClearways, \nthe \nthing \nlost  \ntraction \nand  \nhigh-sided \nme.  \nThe  \ndoctors \ndiagnosed \nme \nas having \na broken \nwrist,” \nNixon \nrecalls. \nAldana, Emde, Dick Mann, Don Castro, and Jim Rice were left to pick \nup  the  slack. (Grand National Champion Gene Romero did  not  partici- \npate.) In the  end, the  Brits won the  event. The  final score was  183  points \nfor  Britain against 137  points for  the  United States. The  top  individual \nscore came up a tie between Smart and  Pickrell. \nWhile the races may have been forgettable, the riders did create some \nlasting memories. U.S.  Suzuki team manager Merv Wright recalls one  of \nthem: “My most distinct memory of the  match races was  driving down \nthe freeway with David Aldana mooning everyone out the rear  window of \nBarry Sheene’s Rolls-Royce.” \nBarry Sheene served as  England’s one-man welcoming committee. \n“I had  met him the  year before,” says Nixon. “He  was  the  only English \nguy  that came to  our  hotel and  ended up  being friends of ours. He  was \njust a  cool dude, the  only one  of their match race guys to  hang out  with \nus.”  Barry Sheene would go  on  to  play a  recurring role  in  the  story of \nAmericans in GP  racing, helping some along the  way, while challenging \nothers for World Championships. \nAt the end of 1971, BSA/Triumph slashed its racing budget, with the end \nresult being that the Transatlantic Match Races were opened to other manu- \nfacturers. A reluctant Harley-Davidson allowed Cal Rayborn, the two-time \nDaytona 200 winner and America’s top road racer, to compete. Cal Rayborn \nwould take his obsolete Harley and  make the  most significant impression \nfor an  American in European racing since Jake DeRosier in  1911. \nDon \nEmde \nremembers \nhelping \nhis  \nfellow \nSan  \nDiegan \nduring \nthe  \ntrip \nover \nto  \nEngland: \n“On \nthe  \nflight \nhe \nstarts \nasking \nme  \nstuff \nlike, \n“So  \nwhat's \nBrands \nHatch \nlike?’ \nI'd \nget \na \ncocktail \nnapkin \nand \ndraw \nit \nout \nfor \nhim \nand \nexplain \nthe \nups \nand \ndowns \nof \nthe \ncourse. \nThen \nwe \nwent \nover \nthe \nsame \nfor \nMallory \nPark \nand \nOulton \nPark.” \nOne \nmight \nexpect \nthat \nRayborn’s \nDaytona \nwins \nwould \nhave \ncarried \nsome \nrespect \nwith \nthe \nBrits; \nthis \nwas \nnot \nthe \ncase, \nand \nthe \nBrits \nlaughingly \n15 \n\n16 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nThree American motorcycle road racing pioneers (left to right): Gary Nixon, Cal \nRayborn, and Don Emde in 1970. Don Emde Collection \ndismissed the  Harley-Davidson as  agricultural equipment. They would \nnot  be laughing for long. \nRayborn quickly recognized the  limitations of  the  British riders, \namazed at their reactions when they put a wheel off the  track. As  Dennis \nNoyes recalls: \nI overheard Rayborn say  to  Mann after they saw  Dave Croxford on \nthe  John Player Norton go  in  the  dirt  on  the  exit  of Paddock Bend, \n“That guy, when he  got  in  the  dirt  ..  .  he just  quit racing.

In  December 1973, the  era's greatest American road \nracer suffered a fatal crash at Pukekohe Raceway in New Zealand. \nMISSED OPPORTUNITIES \nWere it  not  for  bad luck, Gary Nixon might well have been the  first \nAmerican to enjoy GP success in Europe. In 1974, he was  given the oppor- \ntunity to  partner with Sheene at  the  Dutch TT  at  Assen. It would have \nbeen Nixon's 500cc GP debut, but he never got the chance due to a vicious \naccident testing the Suzuki RG500 in Japan. \nFactory test  rider Ken Aroka had  just set  the  lap record at  Suzuki's \nHamamatsu test track the week before. Nixon describes the scene: \nWell, I go out, [Aroka] comes past me  and motions for me  to  follow \nhim. It’s his track and he wants to show me  the good way around. Well, \nstupid-ass me,  I passed him  back.

My left arm  came apart driving, and my right arm  came apart \nin practice. I had a joint between my elbow and  my wrist, so  I didnt start \nthe race.” \nWhile Nixon was  recuperating in  1975, David Aldana enjoyed his best \nyear overseas, taking individual honors as  well as  leading the  American \nteam to its first overall victory in the Transatlantic Match Series. (Thankfully, \nAldana did  not  take his lap of honor at  Oulton Park in the  back of Barry \nSheene’s Rolls-Royce.) But  despite this  success on  the  world stage, Aldana \nnever moved into  GP racing, instead plying his all-around talent on  racing \nflat track, Superbike, AMA Formula One, and motocross in America before \nmoving on  to international endurance road racing later in his career. Nixon \ndidn't return to  the  international scene until 1976, when he came back to \nrace  for Kawasaki in his last season of international competition. \nGary \nNixon \nwheelies \nhis \nKawasaki \n750  \nover \nthe \nhump \nat \nOulton \nPark \nin \nEngland \nduring \nthe \n1976 \nTransatlantic \nMatch \nRaces. \nMortons \nMedia \n\nTHE PIONEERS \nFor  \n1976, \nErv  \nKanemoto \nand  \na \nhealed \nGary \nNixon \ncontested \nthe \ntitle \nwith \na \nnew \nbike, \nthe \nlarge-diameter \ntube \nframe \nKawasaki \n750-3. \nA \nbig \nstep \nup \nfrom \nthe \nprevious \nmachine, \nthe \npowerful \nwater-cooled \ntriple \nnow \nhad \nhandling \nto \nmatch \nits \ngrunt. \nNixon \nbrought \nthe \nbike \nto \nDaytona, \nand \nfinished \nsecond \nbehind \nCecotto’s \nOW-31. \nThe \nnext \nround \nwas \nheld \nin Cecottos \nhome \ncountry \nof \nVenezuela, \nand \nwhat \nhappened \nthere \nwill \nbecome \nsynonymous \nwith \nresult \ntampering \nand \npolitical \ninfluence. \nOn the track, Gary Nixon won the race, but the race  officials later gave \nthe  win  to  Yamaha's Steve Baker. “The big fiasco,” Baker recalls. “What \nhappened was  the  race started and  on  the  first  lap I had  one  carburetor \noverflowing and  Bob Work got in there and tapped on  the carb, and I was \noff again. Nobody could agree on  anything as far as the results and payofts \nfor finishing. The Venezuelan organizer said, ‘Fine, do whatever you want \nto  do, but  see  if you  can  get out  of the country, That was  the first  time I'd \nbeen in  South America and  I didn't want to  end  up  in  some damn jail \ndown there or  something.” \nWith the  possible exception of the  Russian team mauling of CZs \nJaroslav Falta in  the 1974 Swiss 250 motocross GP,  the  two Americans \nhad found themselves in the middle of the darkest and most controversial \nchapter in  motorcycle racing history. “I was  right there, Steve came in, \nparked the bike against the pit wall,” Merv Wright recalls: \nA little while later he comes back out  again, but the idiot scorers had \nhim on  the  same lap, which is absolute friggin’ nonsense. He  lost  at \nleast one  lap. I had my scoring sheets that verified that.

Like so  many American motorcycle racers, the  Bellingham, \nWashington, native got his start on  the dirt tracks: \nIn  1970, my  novice year, I had  the  highest number of points of any \nnovice in  the  nation. Halfway through my  novice dirt  track year, I \nmentioned to a guy that worked for Fred Deeley [based in Vancouver, \nBritish Columbia, Canada] that  Id like  to  try a  road racer sometime. \nBob  Work got a friend of a friend to loan him a bike for me  to  ride  at \nWestwood [in British Columbia]. \nThe  \ntiming \nwas  \nright \nfor  \nBaker. \nLongtime \nYamaha \nrider \nYvon \nDuhamel \nhad \njust \nsigned \nwith \nKawasaki, \nleaving \na \nseat  \nfor \nBaker \nto \nstep \ninto: \nDuring \nmy  \nnovice \nyear \nof  \n1970, \nId  \nalso \nridden \nsome \n650  \nand \n750 \nstuff, \nand \nI \nfound \nthat \nto \nbe \npretty \nhard \nfor \nme \nto \nride \n. \n. \n. \nwith \nthe \nYamaha's \npower \ndelivery. \nWhen \nI \ngot \nthat \nopportunity \nfrom \nDeeley \nto \nride \nthe \nroad \nracer, \nit \njust \nkind \nof \nclicked \nfor \nme. \nThat \nwas  \nwhy \nI \nmade \nmy  \ndecision \nto  \nbranch \noff \ninto \nthe  \nroad \nracing \nside \nof things. \n\nTHE PIONEERS \nBaker's Canadian Yamaha sponsorship would cause many to  mistakenly \nthink that he was  a Canadian, but his experience racing on  the road courses \nnorth of the  border would prove to  be  a  crucial factor for  his  future in \ninternational racing. “The tracks in Canada were very rough,” says Baker. \n“Oulton Park was  somewhat like Westwood, off-camber exits and  all.” \nBaker's first year as  an  expert came in  1973, riding against the  top \nriders in  the  nation on  the  Deeley Yamaha. Thrown into a  deep talent \npool, he found the  season to be a sobering experience: \nI remember guys like Cal  Rayborn, Dick Mann—all those people \nthat  I was  suddenly racing against. I tried to learn as  much from those \nguys as  I could. Kel Carruthers helped me  out  some; he used to let me \nfollow him around. The  first  time I did  really good as  an  expert was \nsecond place at  Talladega in  1973 behind Kel.  By Charlotte, I think I \nhad  gotten a little cocky, thinking that I could race with these guys, \nand  fell off. \nSteve \nBaker \ntearing \nup \nthe \ncompetition \nat \nOulton \nPark \nin \nthe  \n1976 \nTransatlantic \nMatch \nRaces. \nMortons \nMedia \nDi \n\n22 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nBaker’s \nexperience \nthe \nfollowing \nyear \nwas  \nequally \nmemorable, \nbut \nfor \nthe \nwrong \nreasons, \nas \nhe \nwould \nspend \nthe \nseason \ntrying \nto \ntackle \nthe \nfearsome \n700cc \nTZ750A \nYamaha: \nScary \nyear. \nThat \nbike \nscared \nthe  \nhell  \nout  \nof \nme,  \nmore \nso  \nin  \nCanada \nbecause \nthe \nracetracks \nwere \nrougher. \nIt \nwould \ndo \ntank \nslappers \nlike \nyou \nwouldnt \nbelieve; \nyou \ncouldn’t \neven \nhang \non \nto \nthe \nbars—if \nyou \ntried \nto \nhang \non to \nit, \nit \nwould \njust \nget \nworse. \nAnother \nthing, \ntoo: \nWe \nwere \nalways \ntrying \ndifferent \ntires \nback \nthen, \nthey \nnever \nhad \ntires \nthat \nworked \non \nthat \nbike. \nIt \nwas \na \nbig mess. \nI \nwas \nso \nfocused \non \nwanting \nto ride \none \nof \nthese things and do well; I just kind of went along with the whole deal. \nHis  stormy relationship with the  TZ750A finally ended in  tears with \na  crash at  Talladega; Baker suffered a  broken leg that ended his  season. \nBut all of these challenges were to provide Baker with the perfect training \nground for racing on  the dangerous road circuits of Europe. \nBaker returned for  Daytona in  1975, taking second in  his  comeback \nrace: “Daytona probably isn't the  place to  regain your confidence, but \nfortunately I had a good handling new  motorcycle [the improved TZ750D] \nwith a good team behind me.” He would also score his first win  that season \nat Loudon, New Hampshire. \nBaker's career trajectory continued upward the  following season, \nhelped greatly by the  introduction of the  OW-31 Yamaha. “The OW-31 \nwas a trick bike,” he  explains. “It  had different suspension, a  different \nframe than a standard TZ—with the monoshock of course. The motor was \nmodified, hand-built from the factory with all sorts of polished bits in it. It \nwas  like magic. At Daytona, I just couldn't believe how fast  it was.” \nAlthough \nthe \nbike \nblew \nthe \nbase \ngasket \nin \nthe \nrace, \nthe \nnew  \nOW-31 \nwas \nclearly \na \nforce \nto \nbe \nreckoned \nwith. \nBaker’s \nsuccess \nled \nto  \nan  \ninvitation \nto \ncompete \nin \nthe \nTransatlantic \nMatch \nRaces. \nIn \nGreat \nBritain, \nBaker \ninstantly \ntook \nto \nthe \ntwisty \noff-camber \nracetracks \nsimilar \nto \nhis \nbeloved \nWestwood \nand \nswept \nthe \nraces \nat \nBrands \nHatch \nand \nOulton \nPark. \nFor \nBaker, \n1976 \nwas \nstarting \nto \nlook \nlike \na \ndream \nseason. \nHis \nAmerican \nteammate, \nKenny \nRoberts, \nobserved, \n“Stevie \nwas \nHOT \nin \n1976.” \n\nTHE PIONEERS \nBaker \nagrees. \n“That \nwhole \nyear \nwas  \nreally \ngood. \nThe \nbike \nworked \nreally \nwell, \nbut \nI didn’t \ndo \nall \nthe \nraces \nin \nF750 \nthat \nyear.” \nIn  1977, the  F750 series became a  World Championship, and  Steve \nBaker, on  top of his game and riding the OW-31, would be the series’ first \nworld champion. \nThe season began with a  dominant win  at  the  1977 Daytona 200. \nHaving the  support that comes with being a full-factory rider proved a \nbig advantage for Baker: \nId been in Japan testing in January and February, so I was  familiar with \nthe  motorcycles, and  this  was  my  first  year with the  actual Yamaha \nfactory. Before that year, I wouldn't receive the bikes until Daytona. I \nwas  more prepared, we  had  some magnesium power jet carburetors, \nand  the bikes were another step  above OW-31 spec, with handmade \nparts that made them more reliable. I think everybody who gets into \nroad racing from the U.S.  wants to win  Daytona; that’s the big one.” \nFollowing Daytona, Baker went on  to win the F750 World Championship, \nwhile at the same time fighting for the 500cc Grand Prix title.

He was  the  only non-Suzuki \nrider to  finish in the  top  10.  “We had  horsepower, and  down those long \nstraights the  thing would really go,  but  the  whole package didn't work \nas  well as  the  Suzuki.” Baker started from pole at  Imola and finished \nsecond between the  factory Suzukis at  Spa. But  it  was too  little too \nlate. When Cecotto returned from his  injuries, the  Venezuelan was \nimmediately on  the pace, scoring a second place followed by two victories. \nDespite taking second place behind Hennen at  the  British GP  finale—a \nfinish that  secured second place in the  title  chase for  Baker, behind only \nSheene— \nYamaha \ninformed \nBaker \nthat \nhe \nwould \nno \nlonger \nbe \nracing \nfor \nthe \nteam \nin \nEurope; \nthey \nwanted \nhim \nto \nrace \nfor \nthem \nin \nAmerica. \n“I \ndon't \nknow \nwhat \nthe \nwhole \ndeal \nwas,’ \nBaker \nrecalls \nyears \nlater. \n“But \nI \nwanted \nto \nstay and  race  in Europe.” \nWith \nthe  \nhelp \nof \nBarry \nSheene, \nBaker \nlanded \na  \nride \non  \nthe  \nRG500 \nSuzuki \nwith \nSuzuki \nItaly \nfor \nthe \n1978 \nseason. \nA \nthird \nat \nthe \nseason \nopener \nin \nVenezuela—once \nagain \nbehind \nthe \nfactory \nSuzukis \nof \nSheene \nand \nHennen— \nshowed \nsome \npromise, \nbut \nother \nthan \nfourths \nat \nImola \nand \nSweden, \nthe \nseason \nbrought \nlittle \nin \nterms \nof \nresults. \nBaker \nfinished \nseventh \nin \nthe \nWorld \n\nTHE PIONEERS \nChampionship \non  \nthe  \nprivateer \nSuzuki. \nAt  \nthe  \nend  \nof \nthe  \nseason, \nBaker \nbroke \nhis  \narm \nand \nleft  \nleg \nin  \na  \ncrash \nat  \nMosport, \nending \nthe  \ncareer \nof \nthe \nfirst  American world champion in motorcycle road racing. \nPAT HENNEN \nDespite \nhis  \nmany \naccomplishments, \nSteve \nBaker \nnever \nwon \na  \n500cc \nWorld \nChampionship \nGrand \nPrix. \nInstead, \nthe \nhonor \nof \nbeing \nthe first \nAmerican \nto \nstand \non \nthe top \nstep \nof a \npremier \nclass \nGrand \nPrix \npodium \nwould \nbe \nearned \nby \nPat Hennen \na \nyear \nbefore \nBaker \nwon \nhis F750 \nWorld \nChampionship. \nSteve \nBaker \nand \nPat \nHennen \nboth \nhad \nspectacular \ncareers, \nand \nboth \ndemonstrated \nthat \nAmerican \nriders \ncould \ntake \non \nthe \nEuropeans \non \nEuropean \nsoil \nand \nchallenge \nfor \nvictories \nin \ntheir \nrookie \nseasons. \nBoth \nmen \nalso \nsaw \ntheir \ncareers \nend \nabruptly \nand \nall \ntoo \nearly \ndue \nto injury. \nBorn in  Phoenix, Arizona, and  raised in  the  Bay Area of Northern \nCalifornia, Pat  Hennen first  became involved with racing while working \nfor  U.S. Suzuki factory racer Ron Grant, preparing road racing bikes in \nRon's garage. “It was  literally his garage at his home,’ Merv Wright recalls. \n“I worked there also, prior to  Pat.” \nHennen did the porting as  well  as  the full-race setups (phases 1 thru 3) \non  the 500  and 750  Suzukis. Looking back, he remembers his first introduc- \ntion to  a  racing machine. “I took this  bike [a phase 3] to  Sears Point and \n[after riding it, I] realized that I didn’t want to ride a street bike anymore.” \nPat  Hennen’s meteoric rise to  GP  racing was a  combination of \nworld-class talent mixed with a little luck. In  1974, Hennen was  given an \nopportunity to  partner with Ron Grant to  ride Suzukis in  a  new racing \nseries in New Zealand. The  Suzuki distributor for New Zealand was  Rod \nColeman, 1954 Junior TT winner and an  AJS factory GP  rider during the \nPorcupine \nera. \nColeman \nwas \ninstrumental \nin \nbringing \nforeign \ntalent \nto \nshowcase his new racing series. \n“Ron \nGrant \nhad \na \nlot \nto  \norganize,’ \nrecalls \nHennen, \n“going \nto  \nraces \nin \nNew \nZealand, \nand \nhe \nintroduced \n“Team \nCardboard \nBox, \nas \nwe \nworked \nto \nput \ntogether \nsomething \nthat \nwould \nrun.’ \nIn \naddition \nto \nthe \nNew \nZealand \nexperience, \nHennen \ncontinued \nto \nhone \nhis \nroad \nracing \nskills \nwhile \nriding \nfor \nRon \nGrant \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates. \nBut \nthe \n22-year-old’s \npromising \ncareer \nJS) \n\n26 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nappeared \nto \nbe \nin \njeopardy \nwhen \nthe \nU.S.  \nSuzuki \nfactory \nroad \nracing \nteam \nclosed \nits \ndoors \nat \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \n1975 \nseason. \nLuckily, \nHennen \nhad  \nRod  \nColeman \non  \nhis  \nside. \n“We \nsent  \nhim \na \ntwo- \nyear-old \nfactory \ntriple,” \nsays  \nColeman, \n“One \nof \nthe \nbikes \nleft  \nover \n[when \n> \nU.S. Suzuki closed its team]... ”: \nI was  at U.S.  Suzuki and saw  them loading the little factory 125  twins \ninto  a truck. I asked, “Where are  you going to take that?” He said, “To \nthe rubbish dump.” I told him  to hold on  a minute and  rushed inside \nto the main office. I asked, “Why are  you going to destroy those?” \n“Oh, well, that’s the factory policy.” \n“Can I buy one?” \n“Well, okay.” \nSo  I bought one, and  then when I went into the  race shop, they \nhad  the  750s spread out  all  over the  floor, about to  be  going to  the \ndump as  well. I asked if I could buy some of these bits  as  well, and  he \nsaid, “Yeah, but you'll have to get them out  of the place.” \nSo  I phoned up  Pat  Hennen in  San Francisco and told him, \n“Go buy  a  big van  and I'll  pay  for  it.  Get  down here fast  and get \nall  these bits  in  the  van  and  take them back and put  ‘em  together. \nGet one bike and a  spare engine out  of  it.  After I  telephoned \nhim, he  drove overnight and was at  U.S. Suzuki next morning. \nI shipped the  van out  with all  that stuff inside it,  and when the \nvan arrived in  New Zealand it  contained an  immaculate TR750 \nand  a  spare engine. Pat  built it.  He  was  not  just a good mechanic, \nhe  was  a  most meticulous mechanic, and had  absorbed all  of Ron \nGrant’s expertise. \nPat  \nHennen \nwas \nto  \ndominate \nthe  \n1976 \nNew \nZealand \nracing \nseason \non \nthe  \nColeman \nSuzuki \n750-3, \nand  \nhis \ngoal \nwas  \nto  \ncontinue \nthat \nsuccess \nin \nAmerica. \nBut  \nwith \nno  \nfunding \nor  \nequipment, \nit \ndid  \nnot  \nlook \nfavorable. \nOnce \nagain, \nRod \nColeman \nstepped \nin: \n“Pat \nsaid, \n‘Oh, \nI'd \nlove \nto \nride \nat \nDaytona. \nAfter \nthe \nNew \nZealand \nseason, \nthe \nbike \nwas  \nshipped \nback \nto \nthe \nUS. \nfor \nhis \nuse \nat \nDaytona.” \n\nTHE PIONEERS \nThis \nparts-bin \nspecial, \nbuilt \nby \nPat  \nfrom \nthe  \ndiscarded \nU.S. \nSuzuki \neffort, \nwas \nto \nachieve \nSuzuki’s \nfirst \npodium \nin \nthe \nDaytona \n200, \nfinishing \nthird. \nColeman continues the story: \nWhen Pat did so  well [at Daytona], he said hed love to go to Europe. So, \nwe  bought a new  RG four-cylinder, one  from the factory. I shipped it to \nEngland, and he went there to meet the bike, the RG500. He said, “What \ncan  I do to  repay you  for  it?”  I said, “When you  win  your first  World \nChampionship round, send us  an  air ticket and we'll come over.” \nPat Hennen, recent graduate of Team Cardboard Box, and Team Rubbish \nBin, was  going Grand Prix racing. His  brother Chip joined the  “team” \nTo  say the  team was  racing on  a shoestring doesn't begin to  describe the \nsituation, as  Pat  recalls: “I had  $1,500 for myself and  my brother Chip to \nget to  Europe. We  arrived at  Croyden near the  Suzuki headquarters and \nstayed in B&Bs.” \nThe  Hennens were fortunate to  have the  help of another alumnus of \nRon Grant’s garage, Merv Wright, who happened to be manager of Barry \nSheene’s Texaco Heron Suzuki Grand Prix team. \nChip Hennen describes the arrangement: \nI served as  Pat’s business manager and  only mechanic for the first half \nof the  1976 season—just the  two  of us,  a production RG500 (S00GP), \nan  obsolete ex-factory TR750 [F750], and our  little diesel Bedford van. \nMerv’s back-door support of our  effort played a key role  in  Pat's early \nsuccesses on  the  GP  trail. Merv was also a terrific friend to both of us. \nNot  \neveryone \nwas  \npleased \nwith \nthe \narrangement, \nhowever. \n“Barry \nSheene \nwas  \nmore \nthan \na \nlittle \ndispleased \nwith \nMerv’s \nsupport \nof \nPat's \neffort,” \nrecalls \nChip. \n“Barry \nwas \nno \nidiot \nand \nvery \nquickly \nrealized \nPat \nwas \na \npotential \nthreat \nto \nhis \ndominance \nof \nSuzuki’s \nGP \ninitiatives.” \nSheene \nhad  \nmade \nsure \nthat \nno  \nother \nriders \nhad  \naccess \nto  \nthe  \nlatest \n54x54 \nsquare \nengines \nthat  \nwere \nclearly \nsuperior \nto  \nthe  \nrest  \nof \nthe  \nfield. \nZi, \n\n28 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \ny-  MICHELIN = \nSPEED? ‘ \nPat  Hennen on  the Rod Coleman Suzuki RG500 bike at Assen in  1976.

Frans \nVandenbroek Collection \nMaking use  of his advantage, Sheene dominated the  1976 season, winning \nhis and  Suzuki's first  500cc World Championship. Meanwhile, on  the  far- \nmore-modestly funded side of the paddock, the tiny team of two  brothers \npunched well above their weight and  achieved results that  seemed beyond \nthe  realm of fantasy, all while racing on  a borrowed bike prepared by the \ntwo  brothers competing on  circuits they had  never seen before. \nMidway through the  season, the  brothers were able to  add a  third \nmember to the team. Chip explains: \nFor most of  the GPs we  competed at in  1976, the only other Americans \nwe  ran  into  at the  races were usually American servicemen stationed \nin Europe. Midway through the season, a young American showed up \nat \nour \npit \narea \nat \nthe \nSpa \nGP, \nFrans \nVandenbroek. \nI \noffered \nto \nlet \nhim \nhelp \nmy \nbrother \nand \nI \nat \nthe \nrace. \n. \n. \nthat \nevening \nI \noffered \nhim \na \njob \nas  our  first  paid mechanic and  he accepted. \n\nTHE PIONEERS \nA historic moment in American motorcycle road racing: One of the Hennen team’s \ncrew took this snapshot of Pat  on  the podium after his surprise victory in the  1976 \nSwedish Grand Prix. Frans Vandenbroek Collection \nTwo races after the  Belgian GP  at  Spa, the  Hennen team arrived at  the \nGrand Prix of Finland. Teuvo Lansivuori of Finland was  the  favorite on \nhis  Suzuki RG500, but  in  the  race Pat  Hennen was  to  take an  early lead \nand hold it to  the  end. The victory did  not  come without some suspense, \nhowever, as  Vandenbroek explains: \nThe  bike fluffed a  plug on  the  warmup lap, and  Chip and | frantically \nchanged the  plugs on  the  starting grid. We  weren't sure  the bike  would \nstart, but it did and much to our  surprise Pat came by on  the first lap in the \nlead. To our  utter astonishment, he led the last lap as well, thus becoming \nthe first American ever  to win  a World Championship GP.  He did it with \na  borrowed production racer, with his  brother and  a  tourist as  crew. \nEveryone was  caught off guard, including the organizers. They brought \nPat  to  the  winner's platform, handed him a trophy and a garland, then \nsheepishly told  him  they couldn't play the  national anthem. They didnt \nhave a tape of it. After Pat received his trophy, we  all retreated to the pits, \nXY) \n\n30 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nwhich \nwas  \nin \na \nblocked-off \ncity \npark. \nAs \nwe  \npushed \nthe \nbike \nup \ntoward \nour \nspot, \nTakazumi \nKatayama \ngreeted \nus \nwaving \na \nsmall \nAmerican \nflag. \nHe \nthen \nattempted \na \nsincere \nbut \nfractured \ndelivery \nof \n“The \nStar-Spangled \nBanner” \nas \nTakazumi \nwas \nan \namateur \nrock \nsinger. \nIt \nwas \nactually \nquite \ntouching and I remember the incident with great fondness. \nOf  course, Pat  Hennen also remembers the  moment with his  usual \nhumility: “Tepi Lansivuori .  .  .  I almost felt  guilty, he  was  a  Finn and  I \nthink he was  second at that race, the Finnish GP” \nIn  a testament to  the  decency of Pat  Hennen, one  of the  first things \nhe  did  after winning the  race was  to  follow up  on  his  commitment to \nRod Coleman: \nWhen [Pat] won the  Finnish GP  that  year, straight away he sent us  a \ncable and said, “Where do you want the ticket sent?” He remembered. \nYeah, I'll never forget that. A very nice fellow. I was  sure he was  going \nto  be world champion. Of all the  riders ’ve  sponsored, Pat  was the \nmost sincere one. He always appreciated everything I did for him. \n“Rod Coleman is the guy who made my career possible, says  Pat Hennen. \n“He was  the big key, along with Ron Grant.” \nThe 1976 season concluded with the  German GP  at  the  infamous \nNurburgring Nordschleife, a  14-mile course that favored track knowledge \nabove all  else. Vandenbroek’s street bike was pressed into service. \nHennen \nmade \na.tour \nand \ncame \nback \nwith \nsome \nuseful \ninformation, \nas \nVandenbroek recalls: \nWe  \nmounted \na \nset  \nof \nused \nSuzuki \nfront \ntires \non  \nmy  \nHonda \n250, \nand \nPat  \ndid  \na  \nlap.  \nHe  \npronounced \nthe  \ntrack \nchallenging \nand \nalso \nwas \nuncertain \nif \nthe \nSuzuki \ncarried \nenough \ngas \nto \nfinish \nthe \nrace. \nSo \nwe \ntook \na \nhigh-pressure \nair \nhose, \nput \nit \nin \nthe \naluminum \ngas \ntank \nfiller \nneck, \nsealed \nit \nwith \na \nrag, \nand \npressurized \nthe \ntank \nuntil \nthe \nside \npanels, \nwhere \nPat's \nknees \nfit,  \npopped \noutward. \nBingo, \nan  \nextra \nhalf \na \ngallon. \n\nTHE PIONEERS \nPat \nwent \non \nto \nfinish \nthird \nbehind \nGiacomo \nAgostiniand \nMarco \nLucchinelli \nand \nat \nthe \nend \nof \nhis \nfirst \nGP \nprivateer \nseason, \nhe \nhad \nfinished \na \nshocking \nthird \nin the \nWorld \nChampionship. \nHeading \ninto  \nthe \nTransatlantic \nMatch \nRaces \nof \n1977, \nPat  \nHennen \nwas \nto \nbecome \nthe \ndominant \nforce, \ntaking \nthe \nindividual \nhigh-point \nhonors, \nall \nthe \nwhile \ngoing \nabout \nhis \nbusiness \nwith \nquiet \ndignity \nand \nblinding \nspeed. \n“He \nwas \na \nteam \nguy, \neasy \nto \ndeal \nwith, \neasy \nto \nmanage, \nand everybody \nrespected \nwhat \nhe \ncould \ndo,’ says Gavin \nTrippe, \nwho \nserved \nas \nmanager \nof \nthe American \nteam. \nTransatlantic teammate Gene Romero has similar memories of \nHennen: “He was a quiet individual, a very nice  guy, and a real formidable \nracer, a  real  clean racer as  well. One of those kinds of guys you  could \nrace with and  not  have to worry about it. He wasn’t like  us  renegade dirt \ntrackers gone road racing” \nHennen was  called on  to  race at the  Isle  of Man TT  in  1977. As with \nthe  Nurburgring the  previous year, the  rider needed a  prerace tour to \nlearn the circuit. \nVandenbroek describes what happened next: \nPat really needed to have a closer look, so we broke out our secret weapon. \nIn  the  back of the  Suzuki team truck, under a cover, was  my blue 250 \nHonda. Pat  hopped on,  me  on  the  back, and  off we  went to  do a lap. \nOrdinarily, I'm  not  a good passenger on  a motorcycle, but how  fast can \na 250  Honda with two  adults on  it go? Well, it turns out  that, right after \nstart-finish at  the  Isle  of Man is a  long downhill, Bray hill,  and  at  the \nbottom of that  hill,  that  Honda is going at a pretty good clip and  we're \nimmediately busted for speeding! And as  the cop looks at Pat's license, I \nsee  his eyes go wide, and he says, “Pat  Hennen, the American motorbike \nracer?” Pat grumbled a response, but I’m laughing on  the back of the bike \ngoing, “Yeah, it’s him. Okay, bust him, Copper!” In the race, Pat finished \nfifth, \nwhich \nI \ndon't \nbelieve \nhas \never  \nbeen \nreplicated \nby \nan  \nAmerican. \nHennen \nwas  \nthe \nobvious \nchoice \nto \njoin \nthe  \nfactory \nHeron \nSuzuki \nteam \nfor \n1977, \nbut \nhe \nsoon \nfound \nthat \nbeing \nBarry \nSheene’s \nteammate \nwould \nnot  \nbe \nou \n\n32 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nan  \neasy \nride. \nIt \nbecame \nclear \nearly \non  \nthat  \nTeam \nSheene \nwas  \ndifferent \nfrom \nTeam \nSuzuki, \nand \nHennen \nwas \nnever \nallowed \nto \ncompete \non \nan \nequal \nfooting \nwith \nhis \nreigning \nworld \nchampion \nteammate. \nThe \nsituation \nwas \nmade \nmore \ndifficult \nby \nthe \ndeparture \nof \nHennen’s \nfriend \nand \nally, \nMerv \nWright. \nWright, \nwho \nmoved \nback \nto  \nthe  \nUnited \nStates, \nexplains \nthe  \nsituation \nImpl97 \n7: \nPat  was  a  neat guy, but  he  was  totally dominated by Barry . .   .  like \neverybody else. Barry liked to  win  the  races off the  racetrack as  well \nas  on  the racetrack. He  did it by commandeering the best machinery, \nwhich somehow he got away with. Unfortunately for  Pat,  Barry well \nknew that Pat  was one  of the  ones that could beat him on  equal \nmachinery, and like  John Williams [the year before], Barry did every- \nthing he could to make sure that  he got the best machines. If they had \nbeen on  equal machines, not to say Barry wouldn't have won anymore, \nbut some of the results would have been very different. \nIn the end, the  1977 results saw  Sheene repeat as  500cc world champion, \nfollowed by Steve Baker and  Hennen. Pat's disappointment of losing the \ntitle was  softened somewhat by beating Sheene on  his home turf. Pat’s win \nat the season-ending British GP  gave him  two  victories in the  motorcycle \nracing premier class. \nChip Hennen describes the difficulties the team faced that year: \nThe  personnel looking after Barry’s effort operated completely inde- \npendent of the  personnel looking after Pat’s effort. When we  arrived \nat  the  track for  a  race, his  team set  up  in  one  area of the  paddock \nand \nours \nin \na \ncompletely \ndifferent \narea—no \nkidding! \nWe \nshared \na \nSuzuki \nGB \nmechanic \nnamed \nMartin \nOgborne \nand \nthe \nJapanese \nengineers \nthe \nfactory \nsent \nout \nto \nthe \nGP \ncircuit. \nDenis \nRohan, \nwho \nlater \nbecame \nGM \nof \nSuzuki \nGB, \ntold \nPat \nand \nI \nthat \nhad \nPat \ngone \non \nto \nwin \nthe \n1978 \nGP \nWorld \nChampionship, \nPat \nstill \nwould \nhave \nbeen \nthe \nnumber \ntwo  \nrider \nbehind \nBarry, \nbecause \nBarry \nwas  \nso  \nimportant \nto \nU.K. \nsales. \n\nTHE PIONEERS \nU.K. \npolitics \naside, \nthe  \nAmerican \ntakeover \nof \nmotorcycle \nroad \nracing \nwas \nnearly \ncomplete \nby \n1978, \nas \nevidenced \nby \nthe \nfact \nthat \nthe \nTransatlantic \nMatch \nRaces \nwere \na \nstraight \nfight \nbetween \ntwo  \nAmericans: \nKenny \nRoberts \nand  \nPat \nHennen. \nTheir \ntitanic \nbattle \nserved \nas  \na  \npreview \nfor \nthe  \nupcoming \nseason, \nwith Hennen taking the individual title, edging Roberts, three wins to two. \nChip Hennen recalls the epic battles: \nDuring the 1978 match races, Pat and Kenny were ina  class by themselves, \nand what happened in those races really set the tone for the now-storied \nGP  season that  followed, both of them trying to stake an  early claim to \nbeing the  top road racer for the upcoming GP  season. Of all the riders \nPat  ever competed against—both road racing and  dirt  track racing—I \nthink he enjoyed most competing against Kenny. No matter how fiercely \nthe  two  were competing against each other, he  says he  could always \ncount on  Kenny’s allowing for a margin of error. He was  truly a class act, \nboth on  and off the track. When Kenny joined the GP circuit in 1978, the \nmatch races were really his first opportunity in quite a while to compete \nagainst Pat, and the two  of them had some great head-to-head races. \nTrue to his humble nature, Pat credits the bike for his success: “With Barry \nSheene and  the  RG500, Suzuki won a  couple of World Championships. \nBut  the  RG700 was a rocket ship. It was  ahead of its  time. They almost \nneeded a  whole class just for  them. I was  just beginning to  understand \nhow to race  that  thing.” \nRod Coleman concurs. “They only made a  handtul of the  RG700 \nSuzukis. The  first time it came out, it was  so  much more powerful than \nanything else.” \nWith \nRoberts \njoining \nHennen \non  \nthe  \nGrand \nPrix \ncircuit \nfor  \n1978, \nit  \nlooked \nto  \nbe  \njust \na  \nmatter \nof  \ntime \nbefore \nan  \nAmerican \ntook \nthe \n500cc \nWorld \nChampionship. \nThat \nreality \nappeared \nto \nbe \nimminent \nafter \nthree \nWorld \nChampionship \nraces, \nas \nSheene’s \nwin \nat \nthe \nopening \nround \nin \nVenezuela \nwas \nfollowed \nby \na \nHennen \nvictory \nin \nSpain, \nwith \nRoberts \ntrailing \nclose \nbehind. \nThe \nthird \nround, \nin \nAustria, \nbelonged \nto \nYamaha \nand  \nRoberts, \nwho \nfollowed \nup  \nhis  \nfirst  \nGP  \nvictory \nwith \ntwo  \nmore \nwins. \n\n34 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nHennen \nfinished \nsecond \nin \nboth \nraces \nto  \nstay \non  \nRoberts’ \ntail  \nin \nthe  \ntitle \nchase. \nAnd \nthen \nPat \nHennen’s \nbrilliant \ncareer \nended \nat \nthe \nIsle \nof \nMan. \nChip \nHennen \ndescribes \nthe \nhistoric \ntitle \nfight \nthat \nended \ntoo \nsoon: \nWhen \nPat \nhad \nhis \naccident, \nhe \nwas  \nonly \ntwo \npoints \nbehind \nKenny \nin \nthe \nstandings, \nand \nBarry \nwas \nwell \nbehind \nthem. \n[Sheene \nhad \nbeen \nsuffering \nfrom \na \nviral \ninfection \nduring \nthe \nearly \nseason.] \nPat \nand \nKenny \nwould \nliterally \nlap \nnearly \nthe \nentire \nfield, \nwith \nBarry \nusually \nabout \na \nthird \nof \na \nlap \nbehind \nthem. \nThe \n1978 \nSpanish \nGP, \nwhere \nPat \nbeat \nKenny, \nand \nthe \n1978 \nItalian \nGP, \nwhere \nKenny \nnarrowly \nbested \nPat, \nwere \nprobably \ntwo \nof \nthe \nfastest \nand \nmost \nferociously \nfought \nGP \nroad \nraces \never. \nWhat \nI \nsaw \nat those two  GP races was  absolutely incredible. \nBy 1978, most of the top GP riders were no longer competing at the epic Isle \nof Man TT. Barry Sheene had refused to ride the event that year. However, \nSuzuki GB wanted one  of its top riders taking part in the prestigious event, \nso  Pat Hennen was  called upon to compete. \nAmerican circuit racer Jimmy Moore sums up the experience of racing \non  the island: \nThis place humbles you. I don't care  how good you  are,  how good you \nthink you  are,  what your accomplishments have been in  the  past. It \nhumbles you  back to  your roots when you  were a  beginning racer. \nWhat's scary is Kirk Michael, there are  three right-hand turns leading \ninto  the village, and  in between each bend you  bang another gear. By \nthe time you are  pointed into the village, you are  in sixth gear; it’s really \ntight and  it’s bumpy to where you  get up out  of the  seat. That kind of \nstuff freaks me  out.  It’s sixth gear, you can't get it wrong, you  are  going \ncurb \nto \ncurb \nto \ncurb \nand \nget \nshot \nout \nthe \nback \nside \nof \nthe \nvillage. \nThe \nhardest \nthing \nabout \nthe \nIsle \nof \nMan \nis \ntempering \nyour \nenthusiasm, \nbecause \ncircuit \nracers \nwant \nto \nlearn \nas \nfast \nas \nthey \ncan. \nIt \ndoesn’t \nfeel \nnatural, \nit \ndoesn't \nfeel \nright, \nit \ndoesn’t \nfeel \nlegal. \nIt’s \nagainst \neverything \na \nperson \nhas \never \nlearned \nabout \nriding \nmotorcycles, \nand \nthat \nmakes \nit \nbeautiful, \nbut \nat \nthe \nsame \ntime \nit’s \nreally \nreally \nscary, \nand  \nI \nmean \nreally, \n\nTHE PIONEERS \nreally \nscary. \nIt \nis  \na \nhuge \nchallenge, \nand \nit \nis \nwithout \na \ndoubt \nthe \nMount \nEverest of motorcycle racing. \nOnly \na  \nhandful \nof  \nsuch \nstreet \ncourses \nremained \non  \nthe \nWorld \nChampionship \ncalendar \nby \nthe \nlate \n1970s. \nIt \ncould \nbe said \nthat, \nfor \nHennen, \nracing \nGrands \nPrix \nat \nthe highest \nlevel \nmay have \nbeen \nthe \nworst \npossible \ntraining \nfor \nracing \non public \nroads. \nPerhaps \nunable \nto \nwithhold \nthe \nblinding \nspeed \nwhich \ncame \nso \nnaturally \nfor \nhim, \nPat \nset \nthe \nfirst \nsub-20-minute \nlap \nin \nthe \nhistory \nof \nthe \nTT. \nThere have been many versions of the  events that occurred next— \nstories of a bird strike or  other contributing factors—but no  one  knows \nfor sure exactly what happened. Soon after his historic sub-20-minute lap, \nHennen crashed at high speed. He  suffered serious head injuries that left \nhim  in a coma for three months. \nFrans Vandenbroek, speaking at  Pat  Hennen’s induction into the \nMotorcycle Hall of  Fame in  2007, summed up  his  longtime friend’s \namazing but all-too-brief career: \nSome people say  that Pat  Hennen was  lucky. He  was  in  a  coma for \nthree months, but  he  survived. That year, at  the  Isle  of Man, five \ncompetitors and  a half-dozen race fans  did not.  But  there's one  thing \nno  one  can  take from Pat  Hennen, and  it’s  this: Before there was \nNicky, before there was  Kenny Ir., Kevin, Wayne, Eddie, Freddie, and \nKenny Sr., there was  Pat  Hennen, the  first  American to win  a World \nChampionship 500cc Grand Prix. \nThe  \nAmericans \nwho \nhave \nfollowed \nin  \nHennen’s \nfootsteps \nhave \nimmense \nrespect \nfor \nthe  \nman \nwho \nled \nthe \nway. \nFreddie \nSpencer \noffered \nthis  \nappre- \nciation \nof \nthe  \ngreat \nPat  \nHennen: \n“I’ve \ntold  \npeople \nmany \ntimes \nthat  \nif \nPat \nhadn't \nbeen \nhurt, \nhe \ncould \nhave \nbeen \nthe \nfirst \nAmerican \nworld \nchampion. \nI \nrespect \ntradition; \nthe \nguy \nbefore \nyou \nmakes \nit \npossible \nfor \nyou \nto \ndo \nwhat \nyou \ndo.” \nThe \ngroundwork \nthat \nthis \nhandful \nof \nAmerican \npioneers \nlaid \nin \nGrand \nPrix \nracing \nwas \nto \nbear \nfruit \nfor \ndecades. \nAmerican \nriders \nwould \nbecome \n500cc \nworld \nchampions \nfor  \n13 \nof \nthe \nnext \n16 \nyears. \nShe) \n\nCEUA Dee ha \nThe Natural: Kenny Roberts \nTSS \nOS Ss  twa: \nKenny \nRoberts, \nthe \nfirst \nAmerican \n500cc \nWorld \nChampion. \nMortons \nMedia \n36 \n\nTHE NATURAL: KENNY ROBERTS \nKe \nROBERTS \nMADE \nHIS  \nGrand \nPrix  \ndebut \nat \nthe  \n1974 \nDutch \n250 \nGP at \nAssen. \nThe \nEuropean \nmotorcycling \nworld, \nwhich \nhad \nfor  \nyears \nthrived \non  \na  \nculture \nof \ndeference, \nprotocol, \nand  \nacceptance \nfor \nwhatever \npittance \nthe \norganizers \nwould \npay \nthe \nriders, \nwas  \nwholly \nunpre- \npared \nfor \nthe \narrival \nof \nthe \noutspoken \nand \nstraightforward \nrider \nfrom \nModesto, \nCalifornia: \nThat was my  first Grand Prix. I went to  the  prize-giving and  bad- \nmouthed everybody in  the  organization. When I sat  down at  the \ntable, Kel  told me,  “You'll never race another World Championship \nrace.” I said, “Good, you know what? I don't want to  race another \nWorld Championship race. They just take advantage of you.” Kel \nsaid that I didn't understand nothin, but  I didn't give a  s**t. The \nriders were all  dying, starving to  death, and these guys were all \ngetting rich. Theyd give you  something like  two  hundred fifty bucks \nto  start the  race, another two hundred if you  did  good; it was  like \nnothing. They just raped us!  A  World Championship race at  that \ntime was big money for  them. In  America, they actually pay  you \nto  race. \nKenny Roberts had  arrived, and  the  sport of Grand Prix racing would \nnever be the same. \nHOME ON THE RANGE \nKenneth Leroy Roberts was  born on  December 31,  1951, in  Modesto, \nCalifornia. He grew up in the vast agricultural heartland of the West Coast, \nthe \nSan \nJoaquin \nValley. \nRaised \nin \nan \narea \nbetter \nknown \nfor \nlivestock \nthan \nmotorcycles, \nKenny \nhad \nhis \nearliest \nexperiences \nriding \nhorses: \n“I \nonly \ndid \none \nhorse \nracing \ncompetition. \nMy \nlittle \nhorse \ngot \nstuck \nin \nan \narena \nwith \na \nbunch \nof \nbigger \nhorses. \nBut \nhe \nwanted \nto \nrace. \nI \nlapped \neverybody, \ndamn \nnear \npushed \nthe \nfront \nand \nfell \ndown. \nThat \nwas \nalmost \ncurtains \nright \nthere. \nEverybody \ngot \na \nbig \nkick \nout \nof \nit \nexcept \nme.” \nKenny \nRoberts \nsoon \nfound \nhis \nway \nonto \ntwo  \nwheels: \n“It \nwas  \njust \na \nseries \nof \ncircumstances. \nA \nTaco \nminibike \nhad \njust \nscared \nthe \nheck \nout  \nof \nme,  \nand \nI \na7 \n\n38 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nthought, \n“Man, \nI’ve \ngot \nto \nconquer \nthat.” \nSo \nI \nbuilt \none \nout \nof \nan \nold \nlawnmower \nmotor \nand \na \nbicycle \nframe. \nNeedless \nto \nsay, \nI \nwas \nadventurous.’ \nLike \nPat  \nHennen \nand  \nso  \nmany \nof \nthe  \nWest \nCoast \nriders, \nRoberts \nhad \nhands-on \npractical \nexperience \nand \nan  \nintuitive \nunderstanding \nof \nhow \nthings \nwork, \nwhich \ngave \nhim \na \ngreat \nadvantage \nover \nmost \nof \nhis \nEuropean \nrivals. \nKenny describes how he got into  racing: \nMy brother got a Honda 50, the one  that  made Honda. He  needed it \nto  ride  to summer school. When he got one, then I had  to  have one. \nSo we  found one  that  had  ended up  in  a  canal somewhere, and  that \nwas  it. It wasn't long before the  Honda 50  was  traded for  a  Daihatsu \n50 that blew up. \nMy dad said he knew a guy named Merle Mills. His kid raced one \nof these things, and he fixed it for me.  There was a dirt racetrack called \nPlayland in  South Modesto, and  I rode my  horse to  it and  watched \nthe  races over the  fence. Merle said  there was  another race the  next \nweekend, and I went to the race  with him. I saw  that  I could beat these \nguys, so  that  was  it.  I only rode [the bike] twice and  it blew up both \ntimes, but it looked like  I could kind of do it. \nIt wasn't long before Kenny’s dad  bought him  a  Hodaka 90.  Roberts was \non  his way: “I trophied on  it the first or  second time I rode it in the 90 class \nat the Lodi Cycle Bowl, where I got my first win.” \nRoberts was  fast, but wild: \nOne heat race  at Lodi, I crashed three times and still got fourth. I went \nthrough a  series of crashes; at  the  time we  didn't have the  right tires \non \nit, \nthings \nof \nthat \nnature. \nThe \nnumber \none \nrider \nin \nModesto \nwas \na \nguy \nnamed \nRay \nHuff \nwho \nsaid, \n“He's \ncrashin’ \nbut \nif \nhe \never \nlearns \nto \nstay \non \nit, \nhe'll \nbe \nfast.” \nI \nended \nup \nracing \nfor \nhim \nquite \na \nbit; \nhe \nwas \na hell of a guy. \nRoberts \ndid \nlearn \nto  \nstay \nupright, \nand \nHuff’s \nprediction \nproved \naccurate. \nIn  \nfact, \nRoberts \nwas \nso  \nfast  \nthat \nit  \nwasn’t \nlong \nbefore \nrace \n\nTHE NATURAL: KENNY ROBERTS \norganizers \nbegan \nto  \nhandicap \nhim \nin  \norder \nto  \ngive \nthe  \nother \nkids \na \nchance: \nOne race they made me  start on  the jump, facing backward, so  I had \nto  turn around and then take off. That pissed me  off.  So for the main \nevent, they decided to let me  just start thirty yards behind everybody, \npointed in  the  right direction. They were trying to  think of ways to \nhandicap me,  so  I wouldn't just win. I moved up to the 250 and spent a \nyear racing them. I was  seventeen at the time in 1968. In 1969, I turned \neighteen and  they signed me  up for the Cow Palace in San  Francisco, \nthe  indoor short track where the  experts rode. Novice, junior, and \nexpert all rode together; I made the  trophy dash and got third in the \nmain event. \nRoberts’ feats were covered in  the  San Francisco Chronicle, and the \npublicity helped to  launch Kenny's career to  the  next level. Jim  Doyle \nprovided his Suzuki 250  twin and Suzuki 250  road racer as well as  money \nfor  expenses, allowing Roberts to  compete at  Ascot and  Daytona. The \nDaytona International Speedway left  an  impression: “That was my  first \nroad race experience. | said  at that time that  Id never ride  another one. It \njust scared the s**t  out  of me.” \nAscot Park, on  the other hand, was  the Promised Land for West Coast \nracers, and  Kenny Roberts soon made his name there: \nDoyle bought a 250  Montesa Cappra in  Redwood City. We  put a set \nof Girling shocks and  Pirelli tires on  it.  Gary Scott was  dominating \nat  Ascot, the  guy  who was  going to  win  all the  races. And then this \nlittle kid from Northern California showed up and won the Ascot TT. \nMontesa’s \nrider \nwasn’t \ndoing \nanything, \nso \nwe \nmet \nthe \nimporter \nin \nan \nitty-bitty \nbuilding \ndown \nin \nLos \nAngeles, \nand \nthey \ngave \nus \nsome \nparts \nand a bike... they wanted to help. \nAnd \nthe \nname \nof \nthat \nMontesa \nimporter? \nHe, \ntoo,  \nwas  \na \npioneer \nwho \nhad \nhelped \npaved \nthe  \nway \nfor  \nAmericans \nto  \ncompete \nin  \nFormula \nOne \nand \neh) \n\n40 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nthe  \nfirst  \nAmerican \nto  \nwin  \na  \nGrand \nPrix \nin  \na  \ncar  \nbearing \nhis  \nown \nname. \n“Dan \nGurney \nwas \nthe \nimporter,’ \nsays \nKenny. \n“He \nwas \na \nbig \nmotorcycle \nnut \ntoo.” \nGurney \nremembers \nthe \nyoung \nKenny \nRoberts \nwell: \n“Kenny \nwas  \njust \nas \nfast \nthen; \nhe \nstayed \nthat \nway \nfor \nthe \nrest \nof \nhis \ncareer. \nAnd \nif \nyou \nwanted \nto \nhave \ntrouble, \nthen \nthat \nwas \na \ngood \nguy \nto \nbe \nwith \n[iaughs].” \nTrouble \nor  \nnot,  \nRoberts \nhad  \nmade \na \nhuge \nimpression \non  \nthe \nmen \nwho \nlooked \nto \nAscot \nfor the \nnext \ngeneration \nof \nracing \ntalent. \nRoberts \nturned \nto \nTriumph \nin \nhopes \nof \nmaking \nthe \nnext \nstep \nin \nhis \ncareer. \nHe \ndid \nnot \nget \nthe \nreception he had hoped for: \nWe went in to negotiate my moving up to be a junior, racing the 650s. \nThe  guy  looked at  me  and  said, “I’ve enjoyed watching you race at \nAscot, and you are  a really talented little kid, but I’m afraid you are just \ntoo  little to  ride  a big bike.” Man, when he said  that, the veins started \npopping out  of my neck. \nThat short-sighted response would have a  profound effect on  Kenny \nRoberts’ career. Spurned by Triumph, he  turned to  Yamaha: “The only \nproblem I had  with the  Yamaha deal was  that they wanted me  to  road \nrace. Me  and  road racing just didn’t get  along, but  I had  to  do  it.  I was \npretty good at  it  right away, but  then I started crashin, just like my \nsportsman career.’ \nWhen he stayed on  the  machine, Kenny was a factor. Roberts picked \nup  his  first major road racing win  as  a  novice at  Road Atlanta in  1971. \n(There \nwas \nanother \nYamaha \nrider \nat \nthat \nevent, \na \nman \nwho \nwould \ngo \non \nto \nhave \na \nprofound \ninfluence \non \nRoberts’ \ncareer. \nThat \nman \nwas \nthe \n1969 \n250cc world champion, Kel Carruthers.) \nKenny \nRoberts \nexploded \nonto \nthe \nGrand \nNational \nscene \nin  \n1972: \nThat \nfirst \nyear, \nI \nled  \nthe  \nchampionship \nhalfway \nthrough \nthe  \nyear, \nbut \nthe \ndirt \ntrackers \nkept \nbreaking \ndown. \nYamaha \ndidn't \nhelp \nme \nmuch. \nIt \nwas \nracing \nthe \nold-fashioned \nway: \n“Here \nare \nsome \nparts, \ntry \nthis, \ntry \nthat” \nI \nalmost \nleft  \nthem \nfor \nHarley, \nas  \nthe  \nYamahas \nkept \n\nTHE NATURAL: KENNY ROBERTS \nblowing \nup. \nI \ncould \nhave \nwon \nthe \nchampionship, \nif \nthey \nhad \ndone \ns**t \nfor me. \nRoberts \nwon \nat \nhis \nsecond \nexpert \nrace, \non  \nthe \nshort \ntrack \nat \nHouston. \nThe \nlandmark \nevent \nwas  \nwitnessed \nby \na \nrider \nwho \nplays \na \nmajor \nrole \nin \na \nlater \nchapter of this story, Earl Hayden: \nHe's my  hero. One time at  the  Houston Astrodome short track, on  a \nYamaha 360, I saw him go into turns three and four. When he went into \nthree, he grabbed the throttle and  picked the front wheel up.  He went \nall the way through three and four ona   short track with the front wheel \noff the ground. That was  one, but I’ve seen so  many of ’em.  He ran  the \nYamahas against the Harleys. If he’d been on  a Harley, he might never \nhave lost  a race. At Terre Haute, Indiana, he was  broad-sliding in the \ngroove on  that Yamaha, trying to keep up with the Harley. \nRoberts finished his rookie year fourth in points behind Champion Mark \nBrelsford, Gary Scott, and the previous champion, Gene Romero. \nIn  contract negotiations with Yamaha, Kenny worked out  a  deal \nwhere Kel Carruthers prepared the road racers while tuning-legend Shell \nThuet built the flat track machines. It was  around this  time that  Roberts \nbegan to  adopt his  knee-dragging riding style, much to  the  chagrin \nof Carruthers: \nI started leaning off  the  bike—I got  that from [Jarno] Saarinen— \nand I started doing that at Ontario in 1972. The next year the race  after \nDaytona was  at Dallas, and I started leaning off and  dragging my knee. \nI came into  the pits asking for duct tape and  started taping my knees. \nKel freaked! He said, “What are  you doing?” I told him, “I’m  dragging \nmy \nknee.” \nKel \nsaid, \n“No, \nyou're \nnot. \nGet \noff \nthat \nbike. \nWhat \ndo \nyou \nthink \nyou \nare  \ndoing? \nYou  \ndon’t \ndrag \nyour \nknee \non  \na \nmotorcycle.” \nCarruthers \nhad \nbeen \nschooled \non  \nthe  \nstreet \ncircuits \nof \nEurope, \nwhere \nriders \nthreaded \ntheir \nway  \nbetween \nthe  \nphone \nbooths \nand  \nhedges. \nSuch \n4] \n\n42 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nan  \nextreme \nriding \nstyle \nwould \nhave \nresulted \nin  \na  \nvery \nshort \ncareer \nin Europe. \nCarruthers continues: \nYou've got  to  remember that  by that  time the  tires had  gotten good \nenough that you  could lean the  bikes over. But  at the  time, it seemed \nlike  a pretty weird idea, dragging your knee on  the  ground! But  hey, \nthings change. In GP  racing, we  would hang off the  side  of the  bike, \nwith your bum off the  side, but  in the  high speed corners you  didn't \ngo sticking your leg out. \nBacked by  the  wizardry of  Carruthers and Thuet, the  bikes were \ncompetitive in  every discipline. Roberts won the  Houston short track \nrace, the  Colorado Springs Mile, and finished out  the  season with \na  win  at  the  half-mile at  Ascot Park. Roberts also won five  of the  nine \n250cc road races held that year on  his  way to  taking the  1973 Grand \nNational Championship. He  spent the  season mastering his  innovative \nknee-dragging style: \nAt Ontario at the  end  of the  year, I was  sliding the  250  around like  a \ndirt  tracker, as  Ontario had  corner after corner. Art  Baumann, who \nwould win  or  crash and  was  the  craziest guy  there, said that I was \ngoing to kill myself. He told  me  that  I was  the craziest guy he had ever \nseen on  a  road racer. And I said, “You know, coming from you, Art, \nthat kind of scares me.” \nKENNY VERSUS THE WORLD \nIn \n1974, \nRoberts \nsuccessfully \ndefended \nhis \nGrand \nNational \nChampionship \nwhile \nalso \nmaking \nhis  \ninternational \ndebut \nin  \nboth \nthe  \nGrand \nPrix \nand \nTransatlantic \nMatch \nRaces. \nThe \nmatch \nraces \nin \nBritain \nwould \nbe \nKenny's \nfirst \nexperience \nwith \nthe \nEuropean \nracing \nscene. \nIt \nwas \nnot \na \nhappy \nbeginning, \nas \nKel \nCarruthers \nexplains: \n“The \nfirst \nyear \nwe \nwent \nover, \nwe \nshowed \nup \nwith \nslick \ntires \nand \nthe \nmarshals \nat \nBrands \nHatch \nwere \nhorrified: \nwe \nhad \na \nfront \ntire \nwithout \ntread \non \nit.” \n\nTHE NATURAL: KENNY ROBERTS 43 \nKenny \ncontinues \nthe \nstory \nin \nhis \nusual \ndirect \nmanner: \nSome a**hole—I guess they called him the  clerk of the  course—said \nwe  couldnt race with slicks. [But] that’s all  I had. Goodyear was  my \nsponsor. [The weather] was beautiful, not  a  cloud in  the  sky, and he \ntold me  you  never knew when it was  going to  rain here. I told  him, \n“Yeah, I can  see  that.” Kel ended up dragging me  away; I was  going to \nkill him. I said for him to just give me  my goddamned money, and I'll \njust go home, no  f**king problem. \nThe  second round of the  series, held at Mallory Park, didn’t do much to \nimprove Kenny's attitude toward the Brits: \nWe  got  to  Mallory Park, and  in  the  first  race we  took off.  We  were \non  slicks. About the  second or  third lap,  I was  leading and  it just \nhailed like  you  couldn't believe. The  next lap around, I couldn't see \nthe  racetrack. I thought, “What do I do?” I was  thinking they would \nstop the  race. Well, they didn't stop the  race. We're on  slick tires in \nhail—you just putted around. After, I went to  the  clerk of the  course \nand  asked him, “Why didn’t you  stop that  race?” He  says, “We don't \nstop races in England for a little hail.” I said, “You call  that  a f**king \nrace?” It was  just a joke. From the moment J arrived in Britain until I \nquit, they had  these silly little rules that  didn’t apply, and I was  one  of \nthe guys that  didn't like it. \nThe  rain didn't stop for  the  second race. But  Roberts was  prepared this \ntime: “For the  second race  at Mallory Park, we  bolted the  funny-looking \nGoodyear \nrain \ntires \non. \nThey \nwere \nbasically \nFormula \nOne \ntire \npatterns \nfor \na \nmotorcycle, \nwith \nindividual \nknobs \nin \nrain \ncompounds. \nWhen \nthe \nflag \ndropped, we  just disappeared.” \nGoodyear’s \nhead \nof \nracing \noperations, \nLeo  \nMehl, \ndescribes \nthe \nevent: \nKenny \nsaid \nit  \nwas \nraining \non  \nrace \nmorning, \nand  \nas  \nyou  \nknow \nwe \ndidn’t \nrace \nin  \nthe \nrain \nin  \nthe \nUSA. \nAll  \nthe \nBrits \nwere \ngiving \nhim \n\n44 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nthe  \n“mickey,” \nsaying \nstuff \nlike, \n“Hohoho, \nYank, \nyou've \nnever \nraced \nin \nthe \nrain \nhave \nyou?” \nTim \nMiller, \nwho \ninvented \nthe \nGatorback, \nhad \ndone \na \ndirt \ntire \ndesign \nwith \na \ngreat \nrain \ncompound, \nbut \nit \nhad \nnever \nbeen \ntested \nin \nthe \nrain. \nI \ncan’t \nremember \nwho \nall \nwas \nin \nthe \nrace, \nbut \nat \nhalfway \nKenny \nhad \nlapped \nall \nbut \none \nguy. \nHe \nwas \nso \nanxious \nto \nlap \nthe \nwhole \nfield \nthat \nhe \nhit \na \nbig \npuddle, \nlaid \nit \ndown, \nand \nslid \nmany \nyards \non \nthe \nwet \ngrass, \nstopping \njust \nin \nfront \nof \nthe \nbiggest \ngrandstand. \nHe \nsaid \nhe \ngot \nup, \ntook \noff \nhis \nhelmet, \nand \nwas \nlaughing \nlike \nmad. \nThe \ngrandstand \nstared \nat \nhim \nlike \nhe \nwas \na \ncrazy man. \nThe first  two  events had  clearly shown Roberts to be the fastest rider. But \nthe American finally met his match at the final pair of races at Oulton Park. \nIt wasn't a competitor who proved to be too  much for Roberts, however— \nit was  the track itself. “I fall off at Oulton Park,” says  Kenny: \nI fall  off EVERY time at  Oulton Park! it was  one  of those racetracks \nthat was  real tricky, for all the wrong reasons. One time I cut the corner \nreal sharp, squared it off on  the last lap, and it was  gravel. That spit me \noff.  The  corner marshal said, “Well, you  don't ride down here, you \nride  up there, everybody knows the line is up there.” It had  trees over- \nhanging the  racetrack; you've got  to  be  careful there because there's \na kind of moss from the  trees that  grows on  the  track. They told me \nabout this  after my second or  third trip to  the  hospital. Oulton Park \nalways got me: \nLater \nthat \nyear, \nRoberts \nmade \nhis \nGP \ndebut \nin \nthe \n250cc \nrace \nat \nAssen. \nHe \nwas  \nimmediately \non  \nthe \npace, \nsetting \nfastest \ntime \nen  \nroute \nto \nan  \nimpressive \nthird \nplace: \nI \npassed \nthe \nfirst-place \nguy,  \nthe \nHarley-Davidson \nof \nWorld \nChampion \nWalter \nVilla, \nbut \nI \nslipped \nthe \nclutch \nand \nspun \nit \nout. \nI \npicked \nit \nup \nand \nwas \nriding \naround \nin \nthird, \nwaiting \nfor \nthe \nlast \nlap \nflag, \nthe \nwhite \nflag. \nKel \nwas  \nall \nexcited \nthat \nI'd \ngotten \nthird, \nand \nI \nwas  \nyelling \nthat \nthey \n\nTHE NATURAL: KENNY ROBERTS \ndidn’t \nput \nout  \nthe  \nf***ing \nflag. \nThen \nKel  \ntold  \nme,  \n“They \ndon't \nput \nout \nwhite flags in World Championship races.” \nAs \nmentioned \nearlier, \n1974 \nwas  \nalso \nthe \nyear \nof \nthe \nfearsome \n700cc \nTZ750A. \nUnlike \nSteve \nBaker, \nRoberts \nwas able \nto \ntame \nthe \nbeast. \n“I \nwas \nalways \nin \nthe \ntop \nthree \nin \nthe \nroad \nraces, \nbut \nthen \nthe \n700 \ncame \nout, \nand \nit \nwas \n‘Lights \nout’ \n[for \nthe competition].” \nRoberts \nalso \nwon the 1975 \nIndy \nMile \nwith \na \ndirt track \nversion \nof \nthe \nbike, \nwhich \nwas \nbasically \na \nstate-of-the-art \nroad \nengine \nbolted \ninto \na \ndirt bike \nchassis. \nThe \nmachine \ncould \ndo \n140 \nmiles \nper \nhour \nbut \nhad \nno \nfront \nbrakes. \nRoberts \nrecalls \nhis \nfirst time \non the bike, \nwhich \nhappened \nto \nbe \nthat \n1975 \nIndy \nMile. \n“We're \nall \nin \nthe \npractice \nline \nand I'm \nsaying, \n‘Its going \nto be funny \nwhen \nwe \nall \nget \ndown \nto turn \none, these \nthings \ndon’t \nturn, \nand \nwe \nall end up ass-packing \nourselves \ninto \nthat wall’ \nThe \nfirst \ntime I \nflicked \nit \ninto \na corner \nwas \na \nmile \ncorner \nwith \na cement \nwall behind \nit. \nNow \nyou \nprobably \nwouldn't \ndo \nsomething \nthat \nstupid \ntoday, \nbut \nat \nthat \ntime \nyou \ndid” \nThe  author recently asked MotoGP veteran Colin Edwards how today's \nriders would react to  being asked to  race a  GP-engined dirt  track chassis \nwithout front brakes at  140 miles per hour on a dirt oval: “Sounds like a great \nidea. I don't want any  part of it, but  it sounds like  a  great idea. Obviously \nKenny had the balls to do it.  | mean we are talking about when men  were men \nand  sheep were scared. The  s**t  that  [those guys] went through back in the \nday, it boggles my mind. It shows how really hard core  they were.” \nRoberts spent the  next three seasons dominating the  U.S. Grand \nNational road races. But  he  rarely had the  equipment to  compete on \nthe  dirt  tracks and  failed to  win  the  title  in  1975, 1976, or  1977. After \nYamaha pulled the plug on  its flat  track program, Roberts found himself \nheaded \nback \nto \nEurope \nalmost \nby \ndefault. \nCompeting \nsolely \nin \nroad \nraces \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates \nwas \nnot \nan \noption, \nas \nthese \nevents \nwere \nso \nfew \nand \nfar \nbetween: \n“I \nhad \nno \ndesire \nto \ndo \nthis, \nbut \nYamaha \ndidn't \nwant \nto \ndirt \nrace \nanymore; \nthey \nweren't \ncompetitive. \nIn \nthem \ndays, \nyou \ndidn't \neven \nthink \nabout \nEurope. \nI \ndamn \nnear \nhad \na \nbreakdown \nwhen \nI \nfound \nout \nthat \nI \nhad \nto \ngo \nover \nthere. \nYamaha \nsaid, \n“We'll \ngive \nyou \nparts \nand \nsome \nmoney, \n. \n. \n. \nwhich \nwas \nabout \nhalf \nof \nwhat \nwe \nneeded \nat \nthe \ntime. \nThey \ngave \nus \none \nhundred fifty thousand dollars.” \n45 \n\n46 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nRoberts \nlooked \nto \nLeo \nMehl \nat \nGoodyear \nfor \nhelp: \n“I \nflew \nto \nGoodyear, \nand \nLeo \nMehl \nsaid, \n‘Kenny, \nwe're \ngonna \ngo \nwith \nyou \nto \nEurope. \nCan \nyou \nstay \nhere \nuntil \ntomorrow? \nWe \nhavea \nlunch \nthen \nwith \nthe \nboard \nof \ndirectors. \nThere’s \nlike \nfourteen \nor \nfifteen \nof \nthese \nguys. \nLeo \nwas \nsaying \nhow \n‘Kenny \nhas \nto \ngo \nto \nEurope \nnow \nto \ntry \nto \nbecome \nworld \nchampion.” \n“I \nremember \nthat  \nlunch \nwell,” \nrecalls \nMehl. \n“I \nasked \nKenny \nto  \ntell \nthe \nstory \nabout \nthe  \nraces \nthey \nhad—USA \nversus \nGreat \nBritain.” \nGoodyear \nwrote \nthe \ncheck, \nand \nKenny \nRoberts \nwent \noff \nto \nchallenge \nthe \nworld. \nBefore making the trip, however, Roberts took care  of some unfinished \nbusiness at home by dominating the Daytona 200, lapping the entire field \nin the process. \nThe 1978 GP  season opened in  Venezuela with Roberts competing \nin both the  250cc and  500cc classes. He won the  250  race on  a  privateer \nYamaha, but the factory 500cc bike broke: \nMy 500  blew up  in  the  first race, and  that’s when I found out  that \nI wasn't the  works rider. Johnny Cecotto had  a  different motorcycle \nthan I did.  I was  saying, “Wait a  minute, I’m  the  factory rider.” “Yes, \nbut you  aren't the Japanese factory rider” That pissed me  off... .  At \nJarama, we  pretty much had the same equipment as  Cecotto. I had the \nthing won, but then one  of the throttle slides started hanging up. \nRoberts would soon hit  his  stride; however, first  he had  to  convince the \nFIM to allow him  to  race. “In  them days, riders were more or  less  treated \nlike monkeys,” Roberts recalls: \nThe \npromoters \nat \nthe \nWorld \nChampionship \nraces \nwere \njust \na**holes— \nthere \nwas \nno \nother \nway \nto \nexplain \nit. \nIn \nSpain \nthey \nreally \nlit \nme \nup; \nthey \nsaid, \n“You \nget \ntwo \nmechanics \npasses,” \nand \nI \ntold \nthem \nthat \nI \nhad \nthree \nguys. \nThey \nsaid, \n“You \nget \ntwo \nmechanic \npasses, \nwhat \ndon't \nyou \nunderstand \nabout \nthis?” \nThen \nthey \nsaid, \n“You \nare \nnot \nentered \nbecause \nyou \naren't \non \nthe \ngrading \nlist \nfor \nthe \n500s.” \nIt \nwas \nbecause \nI \ndidmt \nget \nany \npoints \nin \nVenezuela \nwhen \nthe \nbike \nbroke \non \nthe \nfirst \nlap. \nSo \nI \nmissed \nthe  \nfirst  \npractice \nbecause \nthey \nweren't \ngoing \nto  \nallow \nme  \nto \n\nTHE NATURAL: KENNY ROBERTS \nstart. \nIt \nwas  \na \ndifferent \nworld, \nand \nyou \nweren't \ninvited. \nI \nended \nup \nwith \nthe \nfast \ntime \nand \nwas  \nleading \nthe \nrace  \nby \nabout \neight \nseconds \nuntil \none \nof the throttles stuck open. \nAfter \nlosing \na \ntense \nbattle \nwith \nHennen \nat \nthe \nSpanish \nGP, \nRoberts \ntook \nthe \nnext \nthree \nraces \nat \nSalzburgring, \nNogaro, \nand \nMugello. \nA \nsecond \nplace \nin \nthe \nnext \nGP \nat \nAssen, \ncombined \nwith \nPat Hennen’s \ncareer-ending \ninjury, \nmeant \nRoberts \nwas \nnow \nleading \nthe \nWorld \nChampionship \nin his \ndebut \nseason. \n“It's \nnot \nlike \nI \nwasn't \nused \nto \nwinning \nroad \nraces,” \nsays \nKenny, \n“but \nI couldn't \nbelieve \nI \nhad won \nso \neasily.” \nMany American riders struggle to  cope with the  European culture, \nincluding the drastically different retail landscape, accommodations, meal \ntimes—even the smallest details, such as trying to get ice in your soft drink. \nBut  Roberts never missed a beat and immediately replaced Barry Sheene \nas  the sport's dominant force. \nThe 1978 season marked the  farewell of  the  legendary nine-mile \nSpa-Francorchamps circuit with the  Masta kink on  the  road to  Stavelot \nand  roads either lined with barbed-wire fences, buildings, cows, or  trees. \n(The 1967 Formula One World Champion Denny Hulme once famously \nsaid, “Spa in the rain? Park it.”) The  site  of the Belgian Grand Prix is chal- \nlenging enough in dry conditions with predictable and reliable equipment, \nbut Kenny had neither: \nThe  500, every time Id take it out,  it would seize. Of course, the  250 \nkept blowing up,  too, so  I never really had  any  laps. The [Yamaha] \nracing manager ripped the number plate off of Johnny Cecotto’s spare \nbike and put my number on  it. That night, my truck pulled out  of the \npits, and Johnny’s truck pulled out  of the pits. They went out  to a field \nor  parking lot somewhere. Johnny had decided which bike he wanted \nto  use,  and  they took Johnny’s engine out  of the  unused bike and  put \nit into mine, and then drove back to the  track. \nAs  \nif \nlack \nof \npractice \ntime \nand  \nintra-team \nshenanigans \nweren't \nenough, \nRoberts \nwould \nmake \nhis  \nSpa  \ndebut \nin  \nintermediate \nweather: \n“It  \nwas \n47 \n\n48 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nprobably \nthe  \nmost \nscared \nthat \nI’ve  \never \nbeen \non \na \nstarting \nline. \nI \ndidn't \nknow \nwhere \nI \nwas \ngoing. \nI \ncouldn't \nbelieve \nwe \nwere \nthere \nracing. \nJohnny \nCecotto’s \nbike \nblew \nup \n[laughs].” \nDespite \nthe  \nconditions, \nRoberts \ntook \nsecond, \nfurther \ncementing \nhis \npoints \nlead \nover \nSheene. \nIf \nRoberts \nhad \nconcerns \nover \nSpa, \nhe \nwas \nshocked \nat \nImatra, \nFinland. \n“Finland \nwas \na \nrude \nawakening; \nthat \nplace \nwas \na \nfull-on \nstreet, \nbig \nlong \nstraights \nwith \ntrees \non \neither \nside \nof \nit. \nThe \nonly \ngood \npart \nabout \nthat \nwhole \nthing \nwas \nthat \nSheene \nwas \nmore \nscared \nabout \nthat \ns**t \nthan \nI \nwas.” \nThe money involved was  abysmal, hardly in line with the risks involved. \n“They told me  that they were going to  give me  30  percent more start \nmoney, Roberts recalls. “My start money was  like  $200. I just  laughed \nand  told them, ‘Wow, now I can  take my kids out  to McDonalds after the \nrace. They would get pissed saying, “You don't appreciate it?” Oh God, that \npissed them off” \nAs in 1976, the season concluded at the fearsome 14-mile Nurburgring \nNordschleife. Roberts describes his  first experience at  the  mountainous \ntrack that three-time Formula One champion Jackie Stewart called the \nGreen Hell: “To  me,  I didn’t think it was  that bad. The  only problem in \nmy  estimation was  that  you  could have rain in four corners and  nobody \nwould even know it.  It happened to  me  in  practice. I came up  on  this \ncorner over this hill and boom! It was  a rainstorm.” \nSheene was  the  only rider who could still  challenge for  the  title, and \nwith the  British star in  fourth place, Roberts stayed in  control of the \nsituation, \ncovering \nhis \nrival \nby \nfinishing \nthird \nbehind \nFerrari \nand \nCecotto, \na \nresult \nthat \nput \nhim \ndown \nin \nhistory \nas \nthe \nfirst \nAmerican \n500cc \nWorld \nChampion. \nThe \nauthor \nrecently \nasked \nRoberts \nto  \nrecall \nthe  \nmoment: \nThe  \nfirst  \nAmerican \nto  \never \ndo  \nit \n.  \n.  \n.  \nUnfortunately \nthere \nweren't \ntoo \nmany \nAmericans \naround, \nand \nyou \ncouldn't \npick \nup \na \ncell \nphone \nlike \nyou \ncan \nnow \nand \ncall \nhome. \nI \nthink \nYamaha \nU.S. \ndidn’t \neven \nknow \nabout \nit \nuntil \nMonday. \nThere \nwas \na \nbar \ninside \nthe \nracetrack, \nand \nme \nand \nSparky \n[Edmonston \nof \nLectron \ncarbs, \nwho \nlater \nintroduced \nRoberts \nto \nWayne \nRainey], \nwe  \nkind \nof \ntook \nit \nover \nand  \ngot \ndrunk. \nWe \n\nTHE NATURAL: KENNY ROBERTS 49 \nhad \na \nlot \nof \nchampagne \nand  \nhad  \na  \nbig \nparty \nthere \nwith \nthe \npeople \nwe \nworked \nwith. \nBut \nyou \nknow \nwhat, \nwhen \nyou've \ngot \ntwo \nsmall \nchildren \nliving \nwith \nyou \nin \na motorhome, \nreality \nsets \nin \nreal \nquick. \nThree \ndays \nlater it was  back to changing diapers. \nOh the glamor of big-time motorcycle racing... \nKING KENNY \nA  testing injury would hamper the  start of  Roberts’ title defense in \n1979, forcing him to  miss the  first  round in Venezuela. “I just was  really \nconservative,’ he recalls. “I didn’t want to crash” \nHe  returned for round two  at Austria, taking the win  despite wearing \na  back brace and struggling with his  injuries. After taking second at \nHockenheim, Roberts notched three straight victories at  Imola, Jarama, \nand  in Yugoslavia. \nAt Spa in July 1979 there was a rider’s boycott when Roberts and the \ntop  GP  riders in the  paddock drew the  line  on  track safety. “I got in an \nargument with one  FIM guy  in Belgium and  I went over the  fence after \nhim,” he recalls. “I was  going to kill him. It was just awful, it was  a different \nera.  Ed Youngblood, president of the  AMA, told  me  they were going to \npull my license, and  told me  I had  to  write a letter and  apologize. I said \n“Ed, if they pull my license because of safety, I'll make far more money \nsuing them than I'll  make racing.” A win  at  the  penultimate race of the \nseason, the  British GP,  followed by a third place in the  finale in France, \nclinched the title. \nThe 1980 season would prove to  be  much more of a struggle, as \nthe \nSuzuki \nhad \nthe \nadvantage \nin \npace \nover \nRoberts’ \nYamaha. \nDespite \nthe \ndisadvantage, \nRoberts \nstill \ndefeated \nFranco \nUncini \nand \nGraziano \nRossi \n(father \nof \nValentino) \non \ntheir \nSuzukis \nin \nthe \nseason \nopener \nat \nMisano. \nAs \nthe \nseason \nunfolded, \nit \nbecame \na \nbattle \nbetween \nRoberts \nand \na \nfleet \nof \nSuzuki-mounted \nchallengers \nthat \nincluded \nfuture \nchampions \nUncini \nand \nMarco \nLucchinellias \nwell \nas \nRandy \nMamola \nand \nTakazumi \nKatayama. \nWins \nin \nSpain \nand \nFrance \ngave \nRoberts \na \ncommanding \nlead \nin \na \nchampionship \nthat \nwould \nrun  \nonly \neight \nrounds \nthat \nyear. \n\n50 \nGRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nRoberts’ \nsupreme \nriding \nin \n1980 \ncannot \nbe \noverestimated. \nThe \nYamaha \nwas \nclearly \ninferior \nto \nthe \nSuzuki. \nThe other \nYamaha \nriders, \nincluding \ntop- \ndrawer \ntalents \nBarry \nSheene \nand \nJohnny \nCecotto, \nwere \nnever \nin the \nfight. \nIt \nwas \nclear \nthat \nKenny \nRoberts \nwas \nthe \ndifference. \nIn a \npreview \nof \nthe \n1981 \nseason, \nSuzukis \nwould \nsweep \nthe \nfinal \nfour \nGrands \nPrix \nof \nthe \nyear, \nbut \nby then \nit \nwas \ntoo \nlate. \nRoberts’ \nlate-season \nconsistency—a \nthird \nat \nZolder \nand second places in Finland and Great Britain—were enough to seal his \nthird consecutive World Championship. \nBut Suzuki’s dominance would put an  end to Roberts’ epic run  in 1981. \nThe American won Rounds 2 and 3 at  Hockenheim and Monza, but his \nRoberts \nleads \nRandy \nMamola \nat \nthe \nBritish \nGP \nat \nSilverstone \nin \n1981. \nMortons \nMedia \n\nTHE NATURAL: KENNY ROBERTS \ntitle \nchallenge \nwas \neffectively \nscuttled \nwhen \nLucchinelli \nswept \nthe \nfollowing \nfive  \nraces. \nAt  \nseason’s \nend, \nMarco \nLucchinelli \nwas \nthe  \nworld \nchampion, \nwith \nRandy \nMamola \n(Suzuki) \nsecond, \nfollowed \nby \nthe \nYamahas \nof \nRoberts \nand \nSheene. \nThe 1982 Grand Prix season proved to  be  more of the  same for \nRoberts and  Yamaha. It began on  a  promising note with wins at  round \none (Argentina) and round four (Spain). But  despite pole positions at \nAssen and  Silverstone, the  rest  of the  season would mean frustration as \nFranco Uncini and  Suzuki took five  wins and  the  title. As  Roberts and \nYamaha struggled to  find the  pace to  match the  Suzukis, another threat \nwas  emerging in  the  form of a  very fast  20-year-old from Shreveport, \nLouisiana: Freddie Spencer would win two GPs in  his  rookie season, \nestablishing himself and Honda as  forces to  be  reckoned with in \nthe future. \nRoberts had  struggled for two  seasons, but hopes were high for  1983. \n“They started experimenting around building in-lines, squares, Vs,  and \nthings got turned around for a few years,” says  Roberts. “The 1983 was  a \ngood bike again.” \nAnother positive was the  addition of  Eddie Lawson as  Roberts’ \nteammate. “I made Yamaha hire  him [Lawson] ...  .  I needed some help \nwith the  bike. It's kind of hard racing against five  works Hondas on  one \nworks Yamaha.” \nRoberts had  already decided that 1983 would be his  final season in \nGrand Prix. He was  going to enjoy it, and, if at all possible, celebrate it with \na fourth championship. \nKel Carruthers describes the situation: \nEddie got thrown in  the  deep end  that first  season. To  me,  he really \nhad concentrated just on  the racing; he wasn’t into  the socializing that \nmuch. \nKenny \nwas \nabout \nhaving \na \ngood \ntime—not \ngetting \ndrunk \nor \nall \nthat \nstuff, \nbut \neverything \nwas \na \ngood \ntime \nfor \nKenny. \nKenny \nwas \nserious \nabout \nit \nin \na \ndifferent \nway. \nYou \ncan \nbe \nserious \nand \nstill \nhave \na \nlot \nof \nfun \ndoing \nit. \nPeople \nask, \n“How \ndo \nyou \ncompare \nEddie \nLawson \nto \nKenny \nRoberts?” \nWell, \nthey \nare  \nboth \ngood, \nbut \nthe \ndifference \nwith \nopi \n\n52 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nKenny \nwas  \nthat \nyou \ncould \nput \nhim  \non  \na \nbad \nbike \nand \nhe \ncould \nride  \nit. \nWith \nKenny, \nyou \ncould \nsay, \n“This \nis \nas \ngood \nas \nit \nis \ngoing \nto \nget, \nso \njust \nget \nout \nand \nride \nthe \ndamn \nthing.” \nThat \nwas \none \nof \nthe \nbest \nthings \nthat \nKenny \nhad \ngoing \nfor \nhim, \nthat \nhe \ncould \ndo \nthat. \nLawsons \nera  \nwas  \nto \ncome \nsoon \nenough, \nbut \nthe \nYamana \nchallenge \nin \n1983 \nwould \ncome \nfrom \nKenny \nRoberts. \nKenny \nrecalls \nhis \nfinal \nWorld \nChampionship \ncampaign: \nWe  didn’t hit  the  ground running. We  had  some problems. But  by \nMonza, it  was going the  way I wanted it  to  go.  But  the  Japanese \nengineer figured the mileage wrong, thinking we  wouldn't go that fast \nin  the  race, and  I ran  out  of gas  on  the  last  lap.  That didn't heip. I \ncould have won France, but  then the bike broke. Just  everything that \ncould have gone wrong happened, and  Freddie . .  .  it was  just one  of \nthose years where he wasn't going to lose. \nYet  despite the  uphill battle Roberts faced, the  championship would be \none  of the  all-time classics, a  see-saw battle that  went to  the  final lap of \nthe  season. But  the  defining moment came a race earlier, on  the  last  lap \nof the penultimate round in Sweden. \nIt's not  a moment Roberts is likely to  forget: “Yeah, he ran  me  off the \ntrack on  the last lap. He ran  beneath me  and  didn't make the corner. Who \nwas  on  the outside of  him? I was.

For  1984, his  focus turned to  team ownership, starting \nout  with a  250cce Grand Prix team and  running Wayne Rainey and  Alan \nCarter. Two years later, he moved up to  the premier class, signing Randy \nMamola and Mike Baldwin to ride  for his team. \nMike Baldwin recalls the earliest days of the  500cc Team Roberts: \nThe good thing about [1986] is that they got the bikes early, before the \nseason started. We went to Malaysia and ran  four races down there, in \nthe heat .  .  .  in the sweltering heat. By the time we  got to Spain for the \nfirst race at Jarama, we  were ready to  go.” \nAfter finishing third and fourth in  the  points, the  team improved to \nsecond in 1987—it would be Randy Mamola’s fourth season as champion- \nship runner-up. In  1988, Wayne Rainey returned to Team Roberts, paired \nwith emerging talent Kevin Magee. Roberts explains the keys to the team’s \nsuccess at the time: “We started doing our  own development work on  the \nbikes, and  that  was  what separated us  from the  other Yamahas. I started \nputting together people, and we  started doing it the way I wanted to do it. \nThen we  took over the Marlboro deal.” \nWayne Rainey describes the  advantages of riding for  a  legend and  a \nthree-time world champion: \nI respected what he said. I was  able to  run  stuff by him  and he would \ngive \nme \nwhat \nhe \nthought. \nHaving \nan \nally \nof \nthat \ncaliber \nis \nan \nadvantage; \nin \nthis \ncase \nKenny \nand \nI \nworked \nreally \nwell. \nI \ncould \nask \nKenny \nto \ngo \nout \nthere \nand \nwatch \nKevin \n[Schwantz] \ncoming \nout \nof \nturn \nthree: \n“Does \nhe \nsound \nlike \nhe’s \nusing \nmore \nrpm, \nis \nhe \nshifting \nsooner?” \nThese \nare \nnot \nquestions \nyou \ncan  \nask \njust \nanybody \nand \nexpect \nto \nget \na \ngood \nanswer. \note) \n\n54 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nRainey, \nTeam \nRoberts, \nand \nYamaha \nwould \nwin \nthree \nconsecutive \nWorld \nChampionships \nfrom \n1990 \nthrough \n1992. \nDespite \nthe \nsuccess, \nthe \nsituation \nwas  not  always rosy, as  Roberts explains: \nYamaha started saving money and  spending it in other places; there \nwas  no  happy ending. The  problem was  that I had  Marlboro on  one \nside  yelling and  screaming that it wasn’t good enough, and  on  the \nother side I had Yamaha saving money. I was  like caught in the middle \nand  I couldn't get out.  We  were making the  ignition products at that \ntime. All  the  cylinders Wayne won with were ours, not  Yamaha’. \nCylinder heads, exhaust pipes, pistons, fairings, chassis, linkages—all \nour  spec, all on  my  nickel. It got to  the  point where I said, “Look, I \ncan't keep this up.” \nRoberts explains his decision to break away from Yamaha and start his own \nteam with backing from Malaysian motorcycle manufacturer Modenas: \n[I had] two  choices: quit  or  build my own motorcycle. I had a lot  of \npeople depending upon me,  and I leaned toward building my  own \nmotorcycle. The biggest mistake I made was saying that we  were \nduilding a  three[-cylinder engine]. If we  had  used a  four, we  would \nhave had  a  Yamaha from the  start. All  we  had  to  make would have \nbeen a crankshaft and  a crankcase, because I was  already making all \nthe cylinders. \nPart \nof \nthe \ndecision \nto \ngo \nwith \nthree \ncylinders \nwas  \na \nconcern \nabout \nutilizing \nany of his  past work with Yamaha: \nI \nwas  \nworried \na \nlittle \nbit  \nabout \nthe  \nlegality \nof \nYamaha \nsaying \nthat  \nwed \ncopied \ntheir \nmotor \nor \nsomething. \nThe \nengineers \nwere \npushing \nreally \nhard \non \nthe \nthree-cylinder \nbecause \nthey \nthought \nit \nwas \nan \nadvantage \nat \nthat \ntime. \nThe \ndevelopment \nof \nthe \nfour-cylinder \nengines \nhad \nkind \nof \nstopped \nbecause \nof \nthe \ntires. \nThe \ntires \nweren't \nvery \ngood. \nThe \nfour-cylinders \nwere \nstruggling \nfor \nabout \ntwo  \nor  \nthree \nyears; \nthe \nlap \ntimes \nweren't \ngetting \nany \n\nTHE NATURAL: KENNY ROBERTS 55 \nbetter. \nThe  \n250s \nwere \ngaining \non  \nus,  \nso  \nwe  \nthought, \n“Okay, \nwe'll  \nbuild \na \nthree-cylinder” \nWell, \nguess \nwhat? \nBefore \nthe \nthree-cylinder \nactually \nhit, \nthey \nmade \na \nnew \ngas \nrule \nthat \ntook \nthe \nlead \nout \nof \ngas, \nand \nthat \nhurt \nus \non \nthe three-cylinder. \nThen \nthe \ntires \ngot \nbetter, \nputting \nthe \nthree-cylinder \nat \na \ndisadvantage. \nThe \nfirst \nengine \nwas \nbuilt \nby Tom \nWalkinshaw \nat \nTWR, \nbut \nthen \nwe \nstarted \ndoing \nit after \nthat. \nAt that \ntime, \ndoing \ntwo-stroke \ndevelop- \nment, \nit \nwas \nkind \nof \nblack \nmagic. \nThe \nfirst \nengine \nwas \nkind \nof \na \nshot \nin \nthe \ndark; \nto \nmake \nit \nsmall \nand \nlight \nwe \ncompromised \nsome \nthings \nthat \nwe \nprobably \nshouldn't \nhave. \nThe \nsecond \ndesign \nwas \nbalanced, \nbased \noff \nthe \nHonda \nthree-cylinder \nwith \na couple \nof \nchanges \nto \nit.

The  repercussions \nwould be profound: \nWhat happened was  that  we  had  plenty of budget to  do  this, but  in \nthe first year it didn't win. Then we  lost the budget. Marlboro said if it \nwasnt going to win they weren't going to dump a bunch of money into \nthis thing, so  we  lost all our  money. \nTeam Roberts would continue, working with Proton and then KTM. Both \nexperiences were frustrating and ultimately fruitless: \nWe  basically never had  an  engine that was  competitive. The  KTM \nthing was  on  a  shoestring, anyway. If the  sponsorship didn't come, \nthen they were supposed to pick up the expenses. When it came time \nto \npick \nup \nthe \nexpenses, \nnobody \nwas \ndoing \nit, \nso \nI \nwas. \nThe \ncontract \nkept \ngetting \ndelayed, \nand \nthen \nthey \njust \nwalked \naway. \nIn \nracing, \nmost \nof \nthe \ntime \nyou \nare \ndealing \nwith \npeople \nwho \nwant \nto \ndo \nsomething, \nthat \nhave \nthe \npassion. \nIf \nI \nwere \njust \na \nbusinessman, \nI \nwouldn't \nhave \ndone it, as  the contract wasn't done. \n\n56 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nThe  \n2006 \nseason \nwould \nprove \nto  \nbe  \nthe  \nbrightest \nspot \nin  \nthe  \nhistory \nof \nTeam \nKR. \nThere were no  years, except for  the  first year with Honda and the \nfive-cylinder, where we  had  a competitive motor. We  had  a very good \nengine, probably the best  four-stroke in that  era.  We  started with the \nright motor and  we  had  Kenny [Jr.]  riding it. Two thousand six was  a \ngreat year for everybody; it showed that we  could actually build a good \nmotorcycle, and  Honda did  help us  a  lot.  We  had  about twenty-five \npeople working on  the project. \nRoberts Jr. led two Grands Prix in 2006, including the first lap of the United \nStates MotoGP at Laguna Seca and part of the last lap at Estoril. By the end \nof the season, there was  optimism that Team KR would be a  factor in 2007, \nThis would not  be the case, as  Roberts explains: \nUnfortunately, somebody dumber than me  made the  rule  that  wed go \nto 800s [800cc engines from 2006-spec 990cc engines]. The  800  motor \nKenny \nRoberts \nin \n2006. \nJoe \nBonnello \n\nTHE NATURAL: KENNY ROBERTS \ndidn't \nlive \nup \nto  \nits \nbilling, \nand  \nthe  \nmoney \njust \nkept \ngetting \ntighter \nand \ntighter, \nand \nthe \ncosts \njust \nkept \ngoing \nup \nand \nup. \nTo \nbe \nable \nto \nafford \nthe \nHonda \nmotors, \nand \nbeing \nan \nAmerican \nteam... \n. \nit \njust \ndidn’t \nwork. \nThe \nItalians \ncan \ndo \nit, \nthe \nSpanish \ncan \ndo \nit, \nbut \nin America \nit’s \nunheard \nof \nto \nsponsor a Grand Prix bike. At that  time, there was  nothing. \nIn Spain, virtually every billboard has a motorcycle on it, and the top Spanish \nriders are  media and marketing superstars. Yet, despite all of the American \nsuccess on the world stage of Grand Prix motorcycle racing, an all-American \nteam simply does not  have those kinds of marketing opportunities. Sadly, \nTeam KR closed its doors before the beginning of the 2008 season. \nThe  demise of Team KR has  left  Roberts with some free  time for other \npursuits. His new  sport of choice might surprise some, considering Roberts’ \nhigh-speed exploits of years past. Wayne Rainey notes that  his former boss \nhad recently spent almost a month at his house, practicing his golf game every \nday in preparation for his next big challenge: the Pebble Beach Pro-Am. \nRoberts describes his latest ambitions: \nWhen I quit racing in  1983, I was  a  twenty-nine handicap; now my \nhandicap is four. We made the cut  [at Pebble Beach] but then it rained \nout.  This year the schedule was  so  tight there was  no  date available to \ndo  it.  My luck. We'll get another shot at  it, because making the  cut, \nyou  are  automatically in... but  making the cut  is hard. Really good \ngolfers didn't make it. \nIt’s probably safe to say that  any pursuit that  Kenny Roberts attempts will \nsee  success. \nThroughout \nhis  \ncareer, \nRoberts \nhas  \nhad \na  \nmajor \ninfluence \non  \nthe \nmotorcycle \nracing \ncommunity, \noffering \nadvice \nand \nmentoring \nto \nnumerous \nyoung \ntalents \nover \nthe \nyears. \nEarl \nHayden, \nfather \nof \n2006 \nWorld \nChampion \nNicky \nHayden, \nexplains \nhow \nRoberts \nhelped \nhim \nout: \nHe \nalways \ntold \nme,  \n“Go \nget \none  \nof \nyour \nkids \nready, \nand \nthen \ncome \nsee \nme.” \nHe \ntold \nme  \nto \nget \nem \nroad \nracing, \nget \noff \nthe  \ndirt \ntrack \nbikes \nand \n57 \n\nmaybe go see  the  world. Staying in  dirt  track, you  would only get so \nfar.  King Kenny, he’s the one  who told me  to  get them out  there road \nracing, and I’m glad he did.  I'd be on  food stamps if they were still out \nthere dirt trackin. \nRoberts blazed a  path that many Americans would follow. As  Doug \nChandler explains, “Kenny is  one of  the role model leaders as \nfar  as  Americans go.  Going over to  Europe and winning World \nChampionships—everyone wanted to follow suit.” \nOf all  the  Americans in  Grand Prix racing, none would be  able to \nmatch Kenny Roberts’ impact on  the sport. From his earliest years racing \non  the public road circuits of Europe and through the MotoGP era,  Kenny \nRoberts has been the most influential American in GP racing history. \n\nCHAPTERS \nThe Prodigy: Freddie Spencer \nSpencer \non  \nboard \nthe \nNR500 \nHonda \nduring \nthe  \n1981 \nBritish \nGP.  \nDespite \nwringing \neverything \nhe \npossibly \ncould \nfrom \nit, \nthe \nrevolutionary \nbike \nwas  \nnot  \na \nsuccess. \nMortons \nMedia \npo \n\n60 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nY  \n1980, \nONE \nWOULD \nthink \nthat \nEuropeans \nwould \nhave \nfinally \nB \ncome \nto \nrecognize \nthe \nremarkable \nroad \nracing \nskill \nand \ndepth \ncoming \nout \nof \nthe \nUnited \nStates. \nBut \nthey \nwould \nbe \nshocked \nonce \nagain \nby \nthe \narrival \nof \na \nbright-eyed \nteenager \nfrom \nLouisiana. \nAs  \nin \nprevious \nyears, \nthe  \nwake-up \ncall  \nwould \nbe \ndelivered \nduring \nthe \nTransatlantic \nMatch \nRaces. \nU.S. \nteam \nmanager \nGavin \nTrippe \ndescribes \nthe \nevent: \n“The \nthing \nwith \nFreddie \nthat \nyear \nwas \nthat \nnobody \npaid \nhim \nany \nattention. \nAll \nthe \narticles \nwere \nabout \nother \npeople. \nBut \nthose \nof \nus \nin \nthe \nknow \nwere \nthinking, \n‘You \njust \nwait. \nJust \nwait. \nYou \nhave \nno idea’ \nIt \nwas \nthe \narrogance \nof the \nEuropeans. \nIt \nwas \nthe \nsame \nwith \nRayborn, \nRoberts, \nand \nSpencer. \nThe \nEuropeans \nwere \nblindsided.” \nFreddie Spencer recalls that first race  at Brands Hatch: “I started on  the \nfront row—one of the least-experienced guys in the  field—and ended up \nwinning it. Barry [Sheene] and Kenny [Roberts] were fighting for second. \nYou  can  imagine when I got up on  the podium afterward, the  surprise of \nthe  crowd and  everyone. I ended up winning race two, and  Kenny and  I \nended up battling for race  wins.” \nWith his sweep of both races at Brands Hatch, “Fast” Freddie Spencer \nhad arrived on  the world stage. \nBOY AMONG MEN \nFrederick Burdette Spencer was  born on  December 20, 1961, in Shreveport, \nLouisiana. ‘The  Spencers were a  racing family, and  young Freddie got his \nstart early. He began his motorcycle racing career at  age  four, competing \nat \nthe \nlocal \ndirt \ntracks. \nBefore \nFreddie \ncame \nalong, \nthe \nfamily \nhad \nbeen \ninclined \ntoward \nfour-wheel \ncompetition: \n“My \nbrother, \nmy \ndad, \nand \nmy \nsister \nall \nraced \ngo-karts. \nMy \nbrother \nis \neleven \nyears \nolder \nthan \nme, \nand \nmy \nsister \nis \nfourteen \nyears \nolder. \nI \ncame \nalong \nvery \nlate: \nMy \nmom \nthought \nshe \nhad \nthe \nflu. \nMy \nbrother \nhad \nalways \nliked \nmotorcycles, \nso \nthe \nfamily started doing motorcycle stuff together.” \nEven \nat \nsuch \na \nyoung \nage,  \nit \nwas  \nclear \nthat  \nSpencer \nwas  \nblessed \nwith \nan \nuncommon \ngift. \nRiding \never \nlarger \nand \nmore \ndemanding \nmachinery, \nhe \nproved \na \nmatch \nfor \nanything \nhe \ntried: \n“I \nhad \nalways \nridden \nbikes \nmuch \nbigger \nthan \nme,  \nand \nmuch \nmore \npowerful. \nBy \nthe \ntime \nI \nwas  \nfive, \nI \nhad \nalready \nbeen \n\nTHE PRODIGY: FREDDIE SPENCER 61 \nracing \nfor \na \nyear. \nEven \nwhen \nI \nwas  \neight \nor  \nnine \nyears \nold, \nwhen \nI \nwas  \nriding \nmy \nbrother's \n250 \ndirt \ntracker, \nI \ncouldn't \neven \ntouch \nthe \nground” \nRiding \noversized \nmachinery \nno  \ndoubt \nforced \nyoung \nFreddie \nto  \nrely \nentirely \non \nhis \nkeen \nsense \nof \nbalance. \nHe \nwasn't \ntall \nenough \nto \njust \nput \na \nfoot \nout \nto \nstay \nupright \non \nthe \nbike. \nSpencer spent years honing his technique, hour after hour ona  practice \ntrack in  his  yard, often keeping one  part of the  track wet  to  increase \nthe challenge: \nI pulled [the site  where Spencer grew up]  up  on  Google Earth: You \ncan  still see  the path I rode, the oval. I could judge what this lean angle \nwould do, what speed. It helped me  to become a quick study. I'd lean, \nrotate, and  see  how soon I could pick it up and how much I picked it \nup, what I had to change to pick the throttle up sooner. That drill that \nI ran,  with my track being dry on  one  end, wet  on  the other .  .  .  it had \nmore impact than anything else  upon my  ability, depth perception, \nthrottle versus lean angle, and changes as  the tires went away. \nIt wasn't long before Freddie had  his  introduction to  the  world of road \nracing. He was  all of 11 years old: \nOne Friday night, I was  racing at  a  flat  track event in  Irving, Texas, \nand  we  heard over the loudspeakers about a road race  that was  going \nto be at Green Valley Raceway. Well, they didn’t have anything for kids \nmy age.  The  smallest class was  the 0-to-250 production class, and the \nonly bike I could kind of fit on  was  this  RD100. Of course I didn’t do \nvery well  running a 100 against 250s, but within a couple of races I got \nan  RD250. They came out  with the TA125 production road race  bike \nlater, so  by the time I was  twelve, I had a proper road racing bike. \nMeanwhile, \nFreddie \nSpencer \nwas  \nalready \nimmersed \nin \nthe \nsport \nof \nmotor- \ncycle \nroad \nracing, \nporing \nover \nthe \nmagazines \nthat \ntold \nof \nthe \nexploits \nof \nhis \nEuropean \nheroes \nand \nthe \nspecifications \nof \ntheir \nfactory \nroad \nracing \nmachines: \n“I \nalready \nfollowed \neverything. \nKent \nAndersson \nwas \nthe \nworld \n\n62 \nGRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nchampion \non  \nthe \nYamaha \nTA125, \nexcept \nhis \nwas  \nwater-cooled. \nYears \nlater \nwhen \nI \nmet \nKent \nat \nthe \nSwedish \nGP, \nI \ntold \nhim \nabout \nthat, \nand \nhe \nsaid, \n‘At \neleven \nyears \nold \nyou \nknew \nabout \nthis?” \nSpencer’s \nsecond \nfull  \nyear \nof \nroad \nracing \nsaw  \nhim \nreach \nthe  \nsport's \nmecca \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates: \nDaytona \nInternational \nSpeedway: \nI raced in the  amateur race at  Daytona with the  [Yamaha TA125] at \nage  twelve.

When it seized up on  me,  I couldn't get my hand to \nthe clutch in time. All I had to do was  go through the last turn and the \ncheckered flag was  there... \nFreddie Spencer had arrived, but his size  needed to catch up with his \nenormous natural speed and talent. \nOver the  next few  seasons, Freddie rode and raced everything he \ncould get his hands on,  often running in every class at any given event: \nBy 1977, I was  riding an  RD400, a 125 single, and a TZ250. I'd race all \nthose bikes on  the same day. A lot of times [ would go to  a race, and \nit was  just Dad and  I. At  the  WERA national finals at  Mid-Ohio in \nOctober of 1977, I won the  250  race. I was  fifteen and  because I won \nthat race, my dad got me  a TZ750—can you believe that? That would \nbe like a fifteen-year-old riding a Grand Prix bike today! \nGiving \na \nTZ750 \nto  \na  \n15-year-old \nmight \nbe  \nroughly \nequivalent \nto  \ngiving \na \nchild \na \nloaded \nrevolver \nto \nplay \nwith. \nThe \nYamaha \nroad \nracer \nwas \na \nfearsome \nmachine \nthat \nhad \nprompted \nthe \nnear-retirement \nof \nsome \ngreat \nriders. \nGene \nRomero, \nthe \n1970 \nGrand \nNational \nChampion, \ndescribes \nthe \nbike: \n“Those \nTZ750s \nwere \nreally \na \ntwo-wheeled \nhot \nrod. \nThey \nwere \nalmost \nviolent \ncompared \nto \nwhat \nwe \nhad \nbeen \nrunning. \nWhen \ntesting \nat \nDaytona \non \nthe \nmain \nstraight \nat \nabout \n160 \nmiles \nper \nhour, \nthe \nthing \nwould \ndo \nthis \nwobble \nand \nbegin \nto \nshake. \nWe \ntried \neverything, \nbut \nit \nstill \nhad \nthat \nproblem. \nIt \njust \nscared \nthe \nliving \ns**t \nout \nof \nyou.” \n\nTHE PRODIGY: FREDDIE SPENCER 63 \nFreddie \nSpencer, \nhowever, \nwas  \nnot  \nintimidated \nby \nit: \n“I \nwas  \ntelling \nmy \ndad, \n‘I \nwant \none  \nof \nthose \n[TZ750s]. \nI \nknow \nI \ncan  \nride \nit? \nKenny \nClark, \nwho \nwas  \nthe  \n[Yamaha] \nrace \nmanager \nat \nthat  \ntime, \nsold \nit \nto  \nus.  \nBoy, \nI \nsure \ndid \nenjoy \nriding \nthat \nthing. \nOf course, \nI \nwasn't \nold \nenough \nto \nrace \nit \nprofes- \nsionally \nuntil \n1980. \nYou \nhad \nto \nbe \neighteen.” \nThere was a  Superbike-sized loophole in  the  rules, however, and \nSpencer would race  right through it: “When you turned sixteen, you were \na  novice dirt tracker and raced against other novices. When you road \nraced, you rode a maximum size of a 250 against other novices. But I could \nalso  run  Superbike, for whatever reason.” \nRegardless of the  logic (or lack thereof) behind setting 16-year-old \nriders loose on  1,000cc road racing machinery, the Superbike series offered \nSpencer the opportunity to continue his upward career trajectory: \nWhen I raced at  Daytona in  1978, I rode a  1,000cc Suzuki that \nmy  brother and Doug Polen built. Doug Polen was the  mechanic \nat my brother’s Suzuki dealership in Texas. Doug took up racing late; \nI'm  pretty sure [Daytona 1978] was  the  first  time he had  gone to  a \nprofessional race. I can’t remember where I finished, but it wasn’t that \ngood. The  thing wobbled so  bad; it was  unstable. \nThe  following season of 1979 would be a breakout year for Spencer. After \nMike Baldwin smashed his  femur in  a  crash at  Loudon in  June, putting \nhim out  of racing for  a  year, Kawasaki brought Spencer in  as  a  replace- \nment. This was  the  era  of Suzuki domination, with Wes Cooley earning \nSuperbike Championships in  1978 and 1979 on  the  Yoshimura GS1000. \nBut \nthe \n17-year-old \nSpencer \nwould \nmake \nthe \nbest \npossible \nimpression \nin \nhis debut as  a factory rider: \nThe  \ntwo  \nraces \nin  \nJuly \nwere \nSears \nPoint \nand  \nLaguna, \nand  \nthey \nran  \na \nSuperbike \nclass. \nI \nhad \nnever \ntested \non \nthis \nthing; \nI \njust \nshowed \nup \non \nFriday. \nGary \nMathers, \ntheir \nteam \nmanager, \nasked \nme \nto \nfill \nin; \nI \nwas \nonly \nseventeen. \nLuckily, \nI \nwent \nout \nand \nwon \nat \nSears \nPoint, \nand  \nthat \nhad \na \nbig \neffect. \nI \nhad  \nwon \n250  \nraces \nand  \nraced \nthe \n\n64 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nSuperbikes \nthree \ntimes \nbefore, \nbut  \nthis  \nwas  \nmy \nfirst  \nreal  \nchance \non  \na \ngood bike. \nThree \nweeks \nlater, \nSpencer \nrepeated \nwith \nvictory \nat  \nLaguna \nSeca. \nFujio \nYoshimura \n(son \nof \nlegendary \ntuner \nPops \nYoshimura) \nwitnessed \nthose \nraces \nand \nunderstood \nthe \nsignificance \nof \nthose \nwins \nperhaps \nmore \nthan \nanyone \nelse, \nbecause \nhe \nwas \nmore \nthan \nfamiliar \nwith \nthe \nspecifications \nof \nSpencer’s \nmachine. \n“We \nsold \nWes \nCooley’s \nold \nKawasaki \nto \nthe \nKawasaki \nfactory \nso \nthey \ncould \ndo their \nracing \nbased \non \nthe \nbike \nwe \nran. \nFreddie \nSpencer \nrode \nthe \nbike \nat \nSears \nPoint \nand \nLaguna \nSeca, \nand \nhe \nbeat \nus \nwith \nthe \nold \nbike \nwe had \nbuilt!” \nThe two  races put Freddie Spencer on  the map in American Superbike \nracing, while providing a glimpse of the greatness that was  to come. With \nthe  AMA Superbike season only spanning four events in  1979, Spencer \nhad  finished third in points, while adding the  title  of American 250  GP \nchampion to his résumé with more than twice as many points as runner-up \nEddie Lawson. \nYoung Freddie Spencer was  a hot  commodity, drawing interest from \nboth Kawasaki and  Honda, and  Spencer chose the  latter partly for senti- \nmental reasons. “They had equipment for me  to race at the Astrodome; I'd \nbeen going there since I was  eight or nine years old and had always wanted \nto race  there.” \nSpencer also understood the long-term potential Honda could provide. \n“Although it didn’t say  anything about a  GP  program specifically in  my \ncontract, I knew I was  going to get the opportunity,’ he says. \nIn \nthe \nmeantime, \nFreddie \nhad \nturned \n18 \nin \nDecember \nand \nwas  \neligible \nto  \nride \nin  \nAmerica’s \npremier \nevent, \nthe  \nDaytona \n200. \nLegendary \ntuning \nwizard \nErv  \nKanemoto \nprepared \nthe  \nYamaha \nTZ750 \nfor  \nthis  \nmemorable \ndebut \nin \nthe \npremier \nclass, \nFormula \nOne. \nHondas \ndirector \nof \nracing, \nGerald \nDavison, \nrecalls: \nWhen \nI \nfirst  \nsaw  \nhim  \nride  \nat \nDaytona, \nhe \nwas  \njust \nsixteen, \nand  \nI \ndidn't \nknow \nanything \nabout \nhim. \nHaving \nwatched \nhim \non \nthe \ntrack, \nI \nthen \nwent \nto \nsee  \nhim, \nand  \nI \nwas  \nreally \nshocked \nto \nsee  \nhow \nyoung \nhe \nwas. \nIt \n\nTHE PRODIGY: FREDDIE SPENCER 65 \nwas  \nhard \nto  \nrelate \nto  \nthe  \nmature \nrider \nI \nhad  \nbeen \nwatching \non  \ntrack. \nThis \nwas \nthe \nfirst \nconversation \nI \nhad \nwith \nhim \nand \nErv \nabout \ncoming \nto \nHonda \nto ride \nin our \nnew \nGP \nteam. \nAt \nthat \ntime, \nwe \nwere \nnot \nready \nand \nit was  important for him  to continue to ride  the Yamaha until we  were. \nAt  Daytona, 18-year-old Spencer was  on  the pace immediately: “My first \nyear that I could race there professionally was  1980. At Daytona, I missed \nout on  the pole by a couple of tenths to Kenny. Kenny fell out with a throttle \ncable problem about ten  or  fifteen laps into  the race, and then I had over a \nminute lead when the bike suffered a crankshaft failure.” \nWhen asked if he  was shocked by Freddie's speed at  Daytona, Erv \nKanemoto recalls, “No, because prior to  that all  indications were that if \neverything ran  to its potential—if the machine was  close—Freddie would \nbe able to  make up the difference.” \nMeanwhile, Gavin Trippe always kept an  open slot  or  two on  the \nTransatlantic Match Races team in case someone had a remarkable perfor- \nmance at the  Daytona 200. Freddie Spencer had passed this audition and \nwas  added to the team. At just 18 years old, the precocious young kid was \ngoing racing against the likes of Barry Sheene and the  rest  of the world’s \ngreatest riders on  road racing courses he had  never seen. \nThe  rest, as  they say,  is history. Freddie recalls that first  experience: \n“When I showed up,  nobody knew who I was. I was  the young American. \nFriday as  we  were coming out  of the  tunnel to  the  racetrack for the  first \nrace [at Brands Hatch], I knew this was  where I wanted to be. It wasn't the \nWorld Championship yet,  but  I really felt  that I had  prepared my  entire \nlife for this  opportunity.” \nErv Kanemoto reveals the  confidence that he  had in  his  rider: \n“Freddie could go  to  almost any  racetrack, and  within a  few  laps, he \ncould \nbe \ncompetitive. \nDeep \ndown, \nyou \nkind \nof \nfelt \nthat \nit \ncould \nhave \nbeen \npossible. \nLater, \nin \nthe \nGPs \nit \nwas \nthe \nsame \nway. \nWithin \na \ndozen \nor \ntwenty \nlaps, \nhe \ncould \nbe \ncompetitive. \nProvided \nthe \nmachine \nwas \nrunning \ncorrectly, \nhe could run  at the lap record.” \nSpencer's \nsweep \nof \nthe \nseries-opening \nraces \nat \nBrands \nHatch \nwas  \nall \nthe \nmore \nremarkable \nwhen \nyou \nconsider \nthat \nthe \n18-year-old \nwas  \nbattling \nwith \n\n66 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nthe \nworld’s \nbest \nroad \nracers, \nincluding \nworld \nchampions \nBarry \nSheene \nand \nKenny \nRoberts, \nand \nhe \nwas \ndoing \nit \non \na \ncustomer \nbike. \nClearly, \nFreddie \nSpencer \nwas  \ngoing \nto \nbe \na \nforce \nto \nbe \nreckoned \nwith \nin \nthe \nfuture. \nVALUABLE LESSONS \nTwo \nseasons \nof \nracing \nSuperbikes \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates \nfollowed, \nas \nSpencer \n(and \nHonda) \ncontinued \nto \ndevelop \ntoward \na \ncareer \nin \nGP \nracing. \nIn \n1980, \nhe finished \nthird \nin points \nand \nscored \nHonda's \nfirst \nAMA \nSuperbike \nwin \nat \nElkhart \nLake. \nThe \nfollowing \nyear, \nresults \nimproved \nto \nsecond \nin \nthe \nchampionship \non \nthe \nstrength \nof \nthree \nwins \nfrom \nSpencer. \nPerhaps \nmore \nimportantly, \nthe \n1981 \nseason \nincluded \nSpencer’s \nGP \ndebut, \nastride \nthe \noval-piston \nNR500 \nHonda. \nFreddie recalls the  radical four-stroke bike: \nThe  first  time I rode it was  at  Laguna in  1981. I only rode it twice, \nand  the  only race  it ever won was  that  heat race at  Laguna Seca. The \ninteresting thing about it  was that the  powerband was supposedly \nbetween 13,600 and 21,500, but the reality was  that it didn’t have much \ntorque. The oval pistons with the eight valves made it similar to a V-8. \nAnother thing was  that the  valve springs were pretty weak because \nof the massive amount of heat the  engine was  generating at  the time. \nTo  get  the  power required, there was  a lot  of friction. 21,500 is not \na  small amount of rpm, and  they didn’t have hydropneumatic valve \noperation then. When I rode the  bike at  Laguna, I geared the  thing \nso  I was  shifting a  lot.  I was  running it between about 18,000 and \n22,000, because that’s really where the  usable power was. Because of \nthe \nslipper \nclutch, \nI \nwas  \nable  \nto  \nrun  \nlike  \na \n250  \nand \njust \nshift \nit \na \nlot. \nWatching \nfrom \nthe  \nLaguna \nSeca \nsidelines \nwas  \nlocal \nlegend \nPat  \nHennen: \n“Freddie \nis \none \nof \nmy \nsecret \nheroes. \nI \nwatched \nhim \non \nthe \n500 \nHonda \nat \nLaguna \nSeca. \nI \nwas \ntold \nthe \nredline \nwas \n21,000 \nrpm, \nan \nelectric \ndrill. \nTalk \nabout \nsounding \npretty, \nthat \nkind \nof \nmechanical \ngenius.” \nThe \nheat \nrace \nwould \nbe  \nthe \nonly \nvictory \nfor  \nthe \nNR500, \nas \nSpencer \nexplains: \n\nTHE PRODIGY: FREDDIE SPENCER 67 \nIn \nthe  \nmain \nevent, \nit \nbroke \nvalve \nsprings \nand  \nit \nwasn't \nable \nto  \nfinish. \nThey \ndecided \nto \ntake \nit \nto \nSilverstone \nfor \nthe \nBritish \nGrand \nPrix, \nwhich \nwas \nin \ntwo \nweeks. \nI \nrode \nit \nthere \nin \nthe \ntop \nten, \ngot \nas \nhigh \nas \nfourth, \nand \nthen \nthe \nvalve \nsprings \nbroke. \nI \nwas \ndoing \nwell, \nthe \nbest \nit had \never \nrun, \nbut \n[Silverstone] \nis \nso \nfast; \nit's \nan \nold \nairport, \nand \nas \nsoon \nas \nI would \nget \nthe \nthing \nup \nand \ngoing, \nI'd hit \na \ngust \nof \nwind \nand \nthe \nrpm \nwould \ndrop \nbecause \nthere \nwas \nno \nflywheel \nweight \non \nthe \nthing. \nSo, \nwith \nthe \ntall \ngearing \nand \nthe \ncorner \nspeed \nI \nwould \ntry \nto \nhave \nto \nrun \nand \nhow \nhard \nI \nwas \ntrying \n. \n. \n. \nIt \nwasn't \nas conducive \nto \na \ngood \nresult \nas \non \na \ntrack \nlike \nLaguna, \nwhere \nI \ncould \ngear \nit \nto \nrun \nin \nthe \npowerband. \nPlus, \nit \nwasn't \nreliable. \nBut \n[Honda] \nlearned \na great \ndeal \nthat \nbenefited \nthe \nV-4 \ntechnology. \nDespite the  disappointing results, Spencer still  impressed with his  speed \nand  dedication, as  Gerald Davison recalls: \nWhat was  refreshing was  that he had this clean-cut tennis player aura \nabout him. What made him so  likeable was  that  he was  just a really \nnice person that did  his best in all circumstances. This was pre- HRC \n{Honda Racing Corporation] and the NR500 was  anything but a good \nracing tool, but  he  even got some better performance from that. Of \ncourse, it was the  NSR that made all the difference. \nIt  was not  only Spencer who was doing his  best to  make the  NR500 \ncompetitive. The  Honda factory was  spending an  enormous amount of \ntime and money trying to  prove that four-stroke technology was still \ncompetitive in a two-stroke world. Spencer explains: \nThey tried to  make the  engine smaller again. One of the  issues I had \nat Silverstone especially was  trying to  get enough weight on  the front \nto  help the  thing have some really good feel. And the  overheating \nproblems: \nIt \ngenerated \nso \nmuch \nexcess \nheat \nthat \nit \nreally \ncaused \na \nlot \nof \nthe \nreliability \nissues. \nThe \nHonda \nengineers \njust \ndidn't \nhave \nthe \nexperi- \nence \nand  \nknowledge \nof \nmaterials \navailable \nthat  \nwe  \nhave \ntoday. \nThat's \n\n68 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nwhat \nI \ntell  \npeople \nabout \nthe  \nbike. \nWas \nit \nsuccessful \non  \nthe  \ntrack? \nNo. \nBut \nthe \nexperience \nit \ngave \nus  \nwas  \neven \nmore \nvaluable. \nThe \n1982 \nseason \nwould \nbe  \nthe  \nfirst \nfull  \nGP  \ncampaign \nfor  \n20-year-old \nFreddie \nSpencer. \nHe \nwould \ncompete \non  \nHonda's \nnew \ntwo-stroke \nGP  \nbike: \nHonda had been in  the  World Championship races with the  NR \nsince 1979 without much success, but  the  first  year of the two-stroke \nwas  where things got  competitive. [Before then,] we  had heard the \nrumors that  Honda was  going two-stroke. They brought the  engine \nto American Honda in July of 1981. It only had  three cylinders. Erv’s \nfirst reaction was, “Well, it’s missing a cylinder.” Plus, it was  reed valve \nwhen Yamaha and  Suzuki had  gone to  rotary valves. The  whole idea \nwas  to  make a  bike that  was  lighter and  narrower, but  in  fact  it was \nheavier than the Yamaha or  the Suzuki. That first  race  out,  we  battled \nfor the win  in Buenos Aires but still had some of the overheating issues \nthat we  had experienced in winter testing. \nNevertheless, Spencer managed to  take the three-cylinder NS500 \ntwo-stroke to  third place. Next stop was England for  the  Transatlantic \nMatch Races, but  the  new bikes continued to  struggle with teething \nproblems, and Spencer was forced to  withdraw midway through \nthe series: \nThe  reason we had  to withdraw was  that we  were having some throttle \nsticking problems. Barry and  I were battling coming through turn one, \nand \ngoing \nup \nto \nthe \nhairpin, \nmy \nthrottle \nstuck \nopen. \nI \nlaid \nthe \nbike \ndown \nand \nwent \ninto \nthe \nhaybales. \nObviously, \nwe \nwere \nracing \nfor \nthe \nWorld \nChampionship, \nso \nwe \nweren't \nable \nto \ncontinue \nracing \nthe \nbike \nin \nthe \nmatch \nraces. \nThis \nwas \nwhat \neventually \nkilled \nthe \nmatch \nraces: \nThe \nWorld \nChampionship \nwas \na \npriority; \nthe \nriders \nweren't \nencour- \naged \nto \nride \nin \nnonpoints \ninternational \nevents. \nWe \nran \nDaytona, \nand \nso  \nwould \nKenny. \nBut \nthat  \nwas  \nimportant \nbecause \nthere \nwas  \nno  \nUSGP \nat \nthe \ntime. \n\nTHE PRODIGY: FREDDIE SPENCER \nPart \nof \nthe \nproblem \nwas  \nthat \nFreddie \nwas  \npushing \nthe \nbikes \nfar \nharder \nthan \nthe \ndevelopment \nriders \nhad \ndone \nin \npreseason \ntesting. \nSpencer's \nfirst \ntest \nof \nthe \nnew \nbike \nnearly \nled \nto \na \nmassive \naccident \ndue \nto \nhis \ntrail \nbraking \nand \nearly \nturn-in \ntechnique. \nThe \nfront \nwheel \nimpacted \nthe \nradiator \nmid- \ncorner. \nThe \nteam \nhad \nunderestimated \nthe \nloading \nthat \nonly \nFreddie \ncould \ngenerate. \n“You \ncan \ntest \nand \ndo \nR \nand \nD \nwork,’ \nsays \nSpencer. \n“But \nuntil \nthe \nguys \nare \nriding \nthe \nbike \nat \nthe \ntop \nlevel \n... \nThings \nhappen, \nthings \ncome \nup \nbecause \nof \nthe \nstresses.” \nStuart Shenton (who would later serve as  technical director of the \nSuzuki MotoGP team) had  been brought on  board at  Honda for  1982. \nHe  explains the  situation when he  joined the  team: “The early [bikes] \nwere [unreliable]; they had problems. But  Freddie was  quite tough on  the \nmachinery. In some ways, it was  good for Honda because when they had \nthe  problems, they got on  top of them, and  we  knew if it could last  with \nFreddie, it could last with anybody.” \nErv Kanemoto applauds Hondas commitment to  success in  the \n1982 season: \nIt was  their first  venture with a two-stroke Grand Prix machine, and \nhaving been working in  1981 with Barry Sheene and  Yamaha, I felt \nit would be really difficult for the bike to  be up and  running in  such \na short time. [Honda was] definitely committed to  doing whatever it \ntook. They were willing to do most anything to catch up. \nIn  terms of sheer speed, Spencer was a  factor from the  moment the \nHonda GP  team arrived in  1982. But  reliability problems kept him from \ncontending \nfor \nthe \nchampionship. \nAfter \nstarting \nfrom \npole \nfor \nRound \n4 \nin \nthe \nSpanish \nGP \nat \nJarama, \nSpencer's \nHonda \nretired \ntrom \nthe \nlead \nafter \na \ncoil \nwire \nbroke. \n“The \nvibration \nfrom \nthe \nfact \nthat \nit \nwas \na \nthree-cylinder \ndid \ncause \nsome \nproblems \ninitially,’ \nhe \nrecalls, \n“frames \ncracking, \ntransmissions, \nthings \nlike \nthat.” \nAt \nthe \nfollowing \nGP \nat \nMisano, \nFreddie \ntook \nfastest \nlap \non \nhis \nway \nto \na \nsecond-place \nfinish. \nAnother \nfastest \nlap \nat \nAssen \nconfirmed \nthat \nthe \nspeed \nwas \nthere. \nA \nmaiden \nvictory \nfor \nSpencer \nand \nHRC \nseemed \njust a matter of time. \n69 \n\n70 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nThat \nbreakthrough \nwin \nwould \ncome \nsoon \nenough—on \nthe  \nFourth \nof \nJuly, \nno \nless—at \nthe \nBelgian \nGP \nat \nSpa-Francorchamps, \na \ntrack \nwell- \nsuited \nto \nFreddie’ \nstyle \nand \nthe \nHonda’s \nstrengths. \n“I \nlove \nthat \ntrack,” \nsays \nSpencer. \n“Just \nhigh-speed \nsweepers, \nand \nI \ncould \nmake \nup \nfor \nthe \nlack \nof \nacceleration \nwith \ncorner \nspeed.” \nFreddie \nSpencer, \nage \n20, \nbecame \nthe \nyoungest \nrider \never \nto \nwin \na \n500cc \nGrand \nPrix—and \nhe \nhad \naccomplished \nthe \nfeat \non \nAmerica’s \nbirthday. \nThe Spa  victory was followed up  with another at  the  penultimate \nround at  Mugello in the  San  Marino GP,  and  Spencer ended the  season \nthird in points behind Uncini and  Graeme Crosby. The young American \nalso  started from pole position in  the  final three races of 1982 to  carry \nmomentum into  1983 as  the fastest man in GP  racing. \nTHE EPIC 1983 SEASON \nOver the  winter, Honda continued to  develop the  three-cylinder bike, \nfine-tuning the response of the chassis to fit Spencer’s demands. A critical \npoint for  Spencer was  the  turn-in response of the  motorcycle, the  vital \ningredient to his approach: \nOne  of the things we  really worked on  in the off-season was  the direc- \ntional change. We needed the new  bike to steer a little better. 1 wanted \nto  get  more of a  directional change at  the  first application of lean \nangle. The  reason that is so  important is because the  speed you  carry \nis SO \nfrom the moment you  turn—that first  rotation toward the apex \ncritical. The longer it takes you  to change direction, the more it’s going \nto begin pushing the front. \nHonda \nalso \nworked \non  \nthe  \nengine, \nas  \nSpencer \nexplains: \n“In  \n1983, \nthey \nmade \nit \na \nlittle \nbit \nlighter \nand \ngot \na \nlittle \nmore \nhorsepower \nout  \nof \nit. \nThere \nwere \ntwo \ntimes \nat \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \nraces \nafter \nwe \nstopped \nit \nwouldn't \nstart \nup \nagain \nbecause \nthe \nmain \nbearings \nwere \nlying \nin \nthe \nbottom \nof \nthe \ncases.” \nAll \nthe \noff-season \nwork \nwould \npay \noff \nwhen \nSpencer \nwon \nthe \nfirst \nthree \nGrands \nPrix \nof \nthe \n1983 \nseason. \nThe \nimprovements \nwere \nparticu- \nlarly \nstriking \nat  \nSpa, \nwhere \nFreddie \nwas  \nsix  \nseconds \nper  \nlap \nfaster \nthan \n\nTHE PRODIGY: FREDDIE SPENCER 71 \nthe  \nprevious \nyear. \nOne \nwould \nthink \nsuch \nadvances \nwould \nhave \nensured \nHonda's \ndomination, \nbut \nthat \nwas \nnot \nthe \ncase. \nInstead, \nthe  \n1983 \nseason \nwould \nprove \nto \nbe \none  \nof \nthe \ngreatest \ncham- \npionships \nin \nthe \nsport's \nhistory—the \nyear \nwhen \nthe \nera’s \ntwo \ngreatest \nroad \nracers \ncollided \nhead-on. \nIn \nterms \nof \nsheer \nspeed, \nthe \nmatchup \nwas \na \ndraw. \nAfter \nthe \nfirst \nsix \nGrands \nPrix, \neach \nrider \nhad \nthree \npoles. \nAfter \nthe \nfirst \neight \nGrands \nPrix, \neach \nhad \nfour. \nAfter \n10, \neach \nhad \nfive, \nand \nafter \n12 \nraces, \neach \nhad \nsix. \nRace results told a  similar tale: Every Grand Prix in  the  1983 500cc \nWorld Championship was won by either Spencer or  Roberts. Spencer \ndescribes the intensity of that  epic season: \nId go out  and turn a quick lap, come in, and that would be it. I'd say,  “I \ncan't go any faster.’ Then Kenny would go quicker. So, I'd go out  and do \nitagain...and again... Then Id go nine-tenths quicker after saying that \nthere was  no  way I could go faster. Every race, every session in 1983 was \nlike that. It's like the Japanese would say, “Are you ready to jump back in \nthe fire?” Chuck Yeager put it perfectly—a great test  pilot survives only \nbecause he could push it past the envelope and reel it back in. \nAs described in the previous chapter, the titanic battle of wills would reach \nits  climax at  the  second-to-last race in  Sweden. Coming in  to  the  race, \nSpencer had a  two-point lead over Roberts. But  Roberts was  on a roll, \nhaving won the  previous three rounds. A fourth-straight victory would \ngive the Yamaha rider the points lead going into the finale at Imola, putting \nhis  destiny in his  own hands at  a track where he was  all but  unbeatable. \nRoberts was  one  lap away from taking the win  until that epic and contro- \nversial \nmoment \nwhen \nSpencer \nmade \nhis \nattempt \nfor \nthe \nlead, \ndiving \nup \nthe \ninside of Roberts under braking at the end of the straight. \nNot  \nsurprisingly, \nSpencer \nsees  \nthe  \nincident \ndifferently \nthan \nRoberts: \n“We \ngot \nnext \nto \neach \nother, \nand \nI \nwasn't \ngoing \nto \nshut \noff \nuntil \nhe \ndid. \nSo \nwe \nboth \nran \ndeep. \nI \ngot \nit \nslowed \ndown, \nand \nhe \nwas \na \nlittle \nbit \nwide. \nAnd \nwhen \nhe \ngot \nback \non \nthe \nthrottle, \nthe \nrear \nend \ncame \naround \nand \nhe \ngot \noff \non  the edge of the track.’ \n\n72 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nIt \nwas  \na  \nsplit-second \nthat  \nmade \nhistory, \na  \nmoment \nthat \nis \nstill  \nbeing \ntalked \nabout \nnearly \n30 \nyears \nlater. \nSpencer's \nmove \nwas \nthe \npivotal \ninstant \nwhen \nthe \ntwo \ngreatest \nriders \nin \nthe \nworld, \neach \nwith \nfive \nGrand \nPrix \nvictories, \ncame \ntogether \nin \na \nmoment \nthat \ndecided \nthe \nWorld \nChampionship. \nSpencer’s \ncontroversial \nvictory \nkept \nhim \nin \nthe \npoints \nlead \ngoing \ninto \nthe \nfinal \nrace. \nAs \nwith \nRossi’s \nlunge \nup \nthe \ninside \nof \nSete \nGibernau \nat \nthe \nSpanish \nMotoGP \n(Jerez) \nof \n2005, \nSpencer’s \nmove \nwill \nalways \nbe \nthe \nsubject \nof \nmuch \ndiscussion \nand \nopinion. \nThe 1983 season was also the  greatest battle between teams since \nthe  1967 clash of Hailwood/Honda versus Agostini/MV Agusta, when \neach rider finished the  season tied  with five  Grand Prix wins each, and \nAgostini carried home the prize on  the  strength of his  superior number \nof second-place finishes. Such a clash of titans usually only occurs once \nin a generation. \nLost on  few  in  this, the  greatest rivalry of the  era,  was  the  fact  that \nboth riders were Americans. Roberts’ teammate was  another American, \nup-and-coming rider Eddie Lawson. At the finale at Imola, it was  essential \nthat  Lawson play a role. If Roberts won with Spencer’s Honda in second, \nthe  World Championship belonged to  Spencer. If Roberts and Lawson \ncould manage a  Yamaha 1-2  finish, then the  World Championship \nbelonged to  Kenny Roberts. Imola would favor the  powerful Yamaha \nbecause of  the  track layout, so  the  championship was very much \nstill in  question. However, given the  results at  Sweden, Spencer had \nmore control over his  destiny, as  he  only needed that top-two finish if \nRoberts won. \nSpencer describes the  situation heading into the  season finale: “We \nknew \nImola \nwas \ngoing \nto \nbe \nthe \ntoughest \ntrack \nfor \nus \nbecause \nof \nthe \ntight \nchicanes. \nAs \nsoon \nas \nyou \nwould \nstart \nshifting, \nthe \nYamaha \nwould \njump \nahead. \nBut \nI \nfigured \nout \nin \npractice \nthat \nthere \nwas \none \ncorner \nthat \nI \ncould \ngo \nthrough \nwide \nopen, \nand \nif \nI \nneeded \nto \nmake \na \npass \nI \ncould.” \nThe \nimportance \nof \na  \nWorld \nChampionship \nfor  \nHonda \nwas \nbeyond \ncalculation. \nDespite \nthe  \ncompany’s \nmany \ngreat \nyears \nin  \nthe  \n1960s \nwith \nthe \nincredible \nmulticylinder \nmachines \nof \nthe \nday, \nand \ndespite \nthe \nriding \ntalent \nof  \nMike \nHailwood, \nMV  \nAgusta \nhad \nalways \ncome \nout  \non \ntop. \nHonda \n\nTHE PRODIGY: FREDDIE SPENCER 73 \nhad \nnever \nwon \na \n500cce \nWorld \nChampionship. \nThe \npressure \non \nthe \n21-year- \nold American was  intense, as  Spencer explains: \nThat championship was  very important. HRC had  been in existence \nfor  five  years, and  we  talked about that the  night before the  race. I \nunderstood that it was  very important to  [Honda], and  it was  very \nimportant to  me  because it would allow me  to be the  youngest 500 \nworld champion. Mike Hailwood—whom I respect very much—he \nhad  the record [1962 at age 22] and it would give Mr.  Honda his first \n500  championship. \nRoberts’ best hope was to  slow the  pace down to  allow Lawson to  be \na  factor in  the  hunt for  second place. Spencer comments on  Roberts’ \nstrategy: \nWhen he  would get  to  the  chicanes, he  would almost park it.  I \nalmost hit  him a  few  times. He  was trying to  slow the  pace down \nto  let Eddie Lawson and  the  others catch up.  But  I could get by him \nin  the  turn after the  start-finish line, and  I probably did  it seven or \neight laps in  a  row  there, so  we  were able to  pull out  a  pretty good \nlead [on the third-place bike]. My bike was  working really well, and \nI was  actually thinking that maybe I could have beaten him there, \nbut  I wasn’t pushing that hard because I knew that second was \ngood enough. \nIn the  end, second was  good enough. Honda had  won its  first  premier- \nclass World Championship on the strength of 21-year-old Freddie Spencer. \nPerhaps \nof \nequal \nsignificance \nwas \nthe \nfact \nthat \nthe \ntop \nfour \nriders \nin \nthe \n500cc \nWorld \nChampionship \nwere \nall \nAmericans—Spencer, \nRoberts, \nMamola, \nand \nLawson. \nWhen \none \nconsiders \nthat \nthe \n1982 \n500cc \nand \n250cc \nworld \nchampions \nof \nmotocross \nwere \nalso \nAmericans— \nCalifornians \nBrad \nLackey \nand \nDanny \nLaPorte—one \nmust \nconclude \nthat \nthere \nhas \nnever \nbeen \na \ntime \nwhen \nAmericans \nso \nthoroughly \ndominated \nall \nforms \nof \nmotorcycle racing. \n\n74 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nTHE DOUBLE \nKenny \nRoberts \nretired \nfrom \nGrand \nPrix \nracing \nafter \nImola, \nreturning \nto  \nAmerica \na  \nthree-time \nworld \nchampion. \nThe  \nFreddie \nSpencer \nera  \nhad \nbegun. \nHowever, \nfor \n1984 \nHonda \ntook \na \nradical \nturn \ntoward \nrevolution \ninstead \nof \nevolution, \nand \nthe \nWorld \nChampionship—winning \nthree- \ncylinder \nbikes \nwere \nrevamped \nand \nassigned \nto \nthe \nother \nriders, \nwhile \nSpencer \ngot \nthe \nradical \nnew \nfour-cylinder. \nEverything \nabout \nthe \n1984 \nbike \nwas \ndifferent, \nfrom \nthe \nfour-cylinder \npowerplant \nto \nthe \narchitecture \nof \nthe \noverall \ndesign. \nSpencer describes the problems he faced with the new bike: \nThe  gas  tank was  on  the bottom. We  thought wed get the  CG  [center \nof gravity] as  low as  possible, and we  had  problems stabilizing the fuel. \nThe  bike was  pretty good through the  sweepers, especially with a full \nfuel load. But  it broke down in the beginning of the season twice, once \nwhen the carbon-fiber wheel exploded. That was  the first  race  bike that \nit had  been on.  There was  really no  experience with carbon fiber at \nthe time, and how it was  strong but brittle. It was  a hard lesson. Another \ntime, when leading at  the  match races, it pushed the  front and  high- \nsided me because of the shifting fuel load. We realized that the CG being \nthat low wasn't the direction we wanted to go. But it taught us  something \nabout the bikes being flat with a lot of steering head angle. \nThe first-generation V-4 was  also a tremendously difficult bike to work on, \nas  Kanemoto explains: \nIt \nwas  \na \ndifficult \nyear. \nMaybe \nin \nanother \nyear \nthe \nmachine \nwould \nhave \nbeen \nmore \nstable \nfrom \nrace  \nto \nrace. \nPutting \nthe \ngas \ntank \ndown \nthat \nlow \ncreated \na \nfew \ndifficulties; \nas \nthe \nfuel \nwas \nbeing \nused \nup \nand \nthe \nfuel \nlevel \nreduced, \nit \nhad \na \ngreater \neffect \non \nthe \nhandling, \nmuch \nmore \nthan \na \nconventional \ngas \ntank \non \ntop \nof \nthe \nmachine. \nThere \nwas \na \nlot \nof \nwork \nin \nsome \nof \nthe \nproblem \nareas. \nIt \nwasn’t \nsuch \na \nnew \nidea; \nit \nwasn't \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nanyone \ndid \nthat. \nBut \ntrying \nto \nmake \nit \nsmall \nand \ncompact, \nwith \nthe  \npipes \nabove \nand  \nthe  \ngas  \ntank \nwhere \nit \nwas—there \nwas \na \nlot \n\nTHE PRODIGY: FREDDIE SPENCER \nmore work involved in  the maintenance of this machine, due to  so \nmany more parts to  make the  lower gas  tank design work. \nSpencer notes that  it didn't help that the carburetors were in the immediate \narea of the  exhaust pipes: “It  wasn't allowing enough cool air  into the \nengine. There was  just  no  way, as  everything was  packed in so  tight, there \nwas  nothing they could do.  I came in  at  Assen while leading the  race by \neleven seconds when the  plug cap came off. You  couldn't get your hand in \nthere to  put the  cap  back on  without taking off the  carbs.” \nDespite the  problematic machinery, Spencer was  still  a  factor for  race \nwins. Eddie Lawson stepped into  the  role  of team leader at Yamaha with a \nvictory in the season opener, and Spencer responded by winning race  two  at \nMisano. After Lawson won the following two rounds at Jarama and Austria, \nFreddie \nSpencer \nin  \n1989, \nwhen \nhe \nreturned \nto  \nGP \nracing \nfor \nMarlboro \nYamaha. \nDMT Imaging \n\n76 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nSpencer \nwas  \ndesperate \nfor \na \nsolution. \nThe  \nthree-cylinder \nmachines \nridden \nby \nRandy \nMamola \nand \nWayne \nGardner \nin \n1984 \nwere \nmuch \nimproved \nover \nthe \nprevious \nversions. \n“In \n1983 \nthey \nstill \nhadn't \nfigured \nout \nhow \nto \nget \nrid \nof \nthe \nvibration? \nSpencer \nexplains. \n“They \nhit \non \nit \nfor \n1984; \nit \nhad \nless \nvibration \nand \ncould \nrun \na \nhigher \nrpm \nand \nwent \nup \n11 \nhorsepower \nall \nthrough \nthe \nrange.” \nUnfortunately, \nthe \nsignificantly \nimproved \n1984-spec \nthree-cylinder \nwould \nnot \nfit \nin \nSpencer’s \n1983 \nmachine, \nas \nthe \nengine \ndesign \nhad \ndifferent \nmotor \nmount \nlocations, \nso \nFreddie’s \nmount \nwas \nfitted \nwith \nthe \n1983-spec \ntriple \nfor \nthe \nnext \nrace \nat \nthe \nNurburgring. \nDespite \nthe \nhorsepower \ndisad- \nvantage, \nFreddie \nwon \nthe \nrace, \nalong \nwith \nthree \nof \nthe \nnext \nfour \nrounds. \nIn \nthe \nend, \nhowever, \nLawson’s \nconsistent \nspeed \npaid \noff, \ndespite \nthe \nfact \nthat \nSpencer's \nfive \nwins \nwere \nmore \nthan \nany \nother \nrider. \nAdd \nMamola’ \nthree \nvictories, \nand \nAmerican \nriders \nhad \nonce \nagain \nswept \nevery \nrace \nof \nthe \n500cc \nWorld \nChampionship. \nThe \nstage \nwas \nset \nfor \nthe \ngreatest \nseason \nby \nany \nAmerican \nor \nby \na \nGrand \nPrix \nracer \nof \nany \nera. \nIn 1985, Freddie Spencer dominated everywhere he raced. At Daytona, \nhe achieved a sweep of the 250  GP, Superbike race, and  Daytona 200, a feat \nthat  had  never been accomplished before, or  since. An  awestruck Kevin \nSchwantz was  making his first  start at  Daytona, sharing the grid with the \nAmerican world champion: \nThat's the  only race that I ever went to  where people said, “Watch \nFreddie Spencer .  ..  Holy s**t! You  want to  see  how it’s done? Watch \nthat  man.” I didn’t do any Grand Prix  in  1985, the Daytona 200  was  it. \nJust  knowing that the  1983 world champ, the  latest, greatest, fastest, \nand  flashiest thing in racing was  here, and  damn it, I was  going to get \nthe  chance to  race against him. Of course you  just looked up  to  the \nguy,  knowing what he had  done at such a young age. \nAt \nthe \ntime, \nit \nwas  \nwidely \nconsidered \nimpossible \nfor \na \nrider \nto \nsuccessfully \nrace \nfor \nboth \nthe \n250 \nand \n500 \nchampionships \nin \nthe \nsame \nyear. \nBut \nthis \nwas \nthe \ngoal \nFreddie \nSpencer \nhad \nset \nfor \nhimself. \nThe \n1985 \nseason \nwould \nbe \nincredibly \ndemanding, \nespecially \ngiven \nthe \nfact \nthat \nthe \n1984 \nHonda \nNSR500 \nclearly \nwasn’t \ngetting \nthe \njob \ndone \nand \nneeded \nto \nbe \nrethought. \n\nTHE PRODIGY: FREDDIE SPENCER 77 \nHowever, \nif \nany \nracer \nwas  \never  \nequipped \nwith \nthe \n“A-team” \nfor \nmaking \nsuch \nthings \npossible, \nit \nwas  \nSpencer \nin  \n1985. \nIn \naddition \nto \ncrew \nchief \nErv \nKanemoto, \nFreddie \nhad \nJeremy \nBurgess \nwrenching \non \nthe \n500 \nand \nStuart \nShenton \non \nthe \n250. \nFreddie recalls the task  at hand: \nBasically, I had  to  develop two  brand-new motorcycles. Honda didn’t \nhave a  250  Grand Prix bike at  the  time, and  we  were coming off the \nbike with the  gas  tank on  the  bottom and  the  pipes on  the  top.  I was \nalso developing the  radial tires, as  we  were making the  switch from \nbias-ply tires. For development, we  were taking a light fuel load on  the \n1984 bike and then adding weight to the top of it to simulate what we \nwere trying to  do with the  next-generation bike, and  that  was  tough. \nI was  trying to  develop the 250  and  500  bikes so  that  they had  a very \nsimilar feel.  But  they had different lines that  theyd need to take  in the \ncorners, and theyd have different corner speeds that  I needed to run. \nAs  for  Spencer’s goal of making both handle similarly, he says, “Most of \nthe time they didn’t” \nEven more problematic were the  almost-overlapping session times \nwhen one  class would immediately follow the other: \nAt most tracks, the practices were back to back, so  I'd have to wait  until \nafter I did  both sessions and  sit  down with the  crews and  tell  them \nwhat each bike needed. On  race day, I'd have to  make the  switchover \nbetween the  two  on  my  warmup lap.  Granted, they were both two- \nstrokes, and  they were both Grand Prix bikes, but  there was  such a \nhuge difference in  power delivery. My  1985 bike had  just about 160 \nhorsepower, maybe a little bit more, and weighed under three hundred \npounds. \nMy \n250 \nbike \nthat \nyear, \ndry \nwith \nnothing \nin \nit, \nwas \nunder \n200  pounds. \nKanemoto \nrecalls \nthe  \ndifficulties: \n“If \npeople \nwere \nonly \nable \nto  \nsee  \nwhat \nhe  \nwas  \ngoing \nthrough. \nHed \njust  \nget  \noff \none  \nbike \nfrom \na  \nrace \nand  \nthen \n\n78 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nhave \nto \nrace  \nthe \nother \none, \nhaving \nto \nrefocus \nagain \nand \nbe \nready, \nwith \nthe \nhuge \ndifferences \nin \npower \nand \nweight. \nIt \nwas \nfar \nmore \ndifficult \nthan \npeople \ncan \nimagine.” \nAlthough \nthe  \n1984 \nHonda \n500  \nGP  \nbike \nhad  \nbeen \ntruly \nrevolutionary, \nthe \n1985 \nbike \nwas \nto \nset \nthe \ndesign \ntheme \nfor \nan \nentire \ngeneration \nof \nHonda racing machinery. As Spencer notes: \nThe two-stroke 500s never changed that much in  dimensions and \ngeometry from 1985 through the last year they ran  them in 2001. We \nhad  such chattering problems that  we  found an  engine position that \nwould actually help it change direction. Also, we  were raising the  rear \nride height and kicking it out  to get it some more trail, which was  the \nopposite of what was  believed up to that time. They had been trying to \nkeep the bikes as  flat as  possible to help stabilize weight forward and \nback. Then the only way you  could make the  things change direction \nwas  to  make the front end  very steep, which made for a very narrow \nforgiveness once you got the thing on  its side. \nAsked if the  1985 V-4  was  more forgiving than the  three-cylinder 1983 \nchampionship bike, Spencer replies, “Oh yeah, because if for  nothing \nelse, we  had figured out  the chassis geometry. The  three-cylinder was  not \nforgiving at all.” \nArmed with an  arsenal of  well-developed and fast 250 and 500 \nGP  machines, Spencer carried his  momentum from Daytona to  take \nthe \nworld \nby \nstorm. \nHe \nbegan \nhis \n250 \nGP \ncampaign \nwith \na \nwin \nat \nthe \nseason-opening \n250 \nGP \nat \nSouth \nAfrica \nbefore \ngoing \non \nto \nsweep \nrounds \nfour \nthrough \nnine—a \nstaggering \nsix \nGrands \nPrix \nin \na \nrow, \nmaking \nthe \n250 \ntitle \na \nforegone \nconclusion. \nIn \nthe \n500 \nclass, \nhe \ntook \nvictories \nin \nthree \nof \nthe \nfirst \nfive \nGrands \nPrix \nand \nclosed \nout \nthe \nseason \nwith \nwins \nin \nfour \nof \nthe \nfinal \nfive \nraces, \ntaking \nthe \ntitle \nwith \nseven \nwins \nto \nLawson’ \nthree. \nSpencer \nhad \nwon \nthe \ndouble, \na \nfeat \nthat \nhas \nnot \nbeen \nrepeated since. \nAmerican \ndomination \nof \nthis \nworld-class \nsport \neven \ndrew \nthe \nattention \nof \nthe \nWhite \nHouse. \nSpencer \nreceived \na \nletter \nfrom \nthen \nPresident \nRonald \n\nTHE PRODIGY: FREDDIE SPENCER \nReagan, \ncongratulating \nhim \non  \nhis  \naccomplishments, \nsomething \nprevi- \nously \nunheard \nof \nfor \nAmerican \nmotorcycle \nracers. \nLater, \nwhen \nReagan \nwas \nvisiting \nDallas, \nTexas, \nFreddie \nwas \ninvited \nto \nmeet \nwith \nhim. \nAmerica \nagain \nhad \nmuch \nto \ncelebrate, \nas \nAmerican \nriders \nhad \nwon \n11 \nof \n12 \n500cc \nGPs and  Lawson had finished second in the championship. \nCHALLENGES AND COMEBACKS \nSpencer was  at the top of his game and  at the top of the sport everywhere \nhe  raced. At  the  time, no  one  would have believed that  Freddie Spencer \nhad  already won his last  Grand Prix. Spencer went into  the  1986 season \nas  a  massive favorite to  repeat as  500cc world champion. However, the \n24-year-old’s career was  about to be waylaid by a physical condition that \nwas  rarely diagnosed at the time. \nSpencer describes his  struggles with carpal-tunnel syndrome, a \ncompression injury to  the  nerves in  the  wrist that is usually caused by \nrepetitive motion: \nThey are  so  much more understanding of the  physiology involved \nnow of how it all works, with all  the  knowledge and  understanding \nof carpal-tunnel and  nerve issues, restrictions, and blockages. But we \njust didn't know back then. I had it operated on, but it was  exploratory; \nnobody even knew of carpal-tunnel back then. [My wrist] was  never \nthe  same and  it took a lot out  of me  physically, which in turn affects \nyou  mentally and  emotionally in how you  are  able  to  recover from it. \nWhen I started off the  1986 season, I did not  even test. \nDespite the  lingering injury, Spencer started off the  season in  impres- \nsive \nfashion. \nAt \nthe \nseason-opening \nSpanish \nGP \nat \nJarama, \nhe \nrocketed \noff \nfrom \npole \nposition \ninto \nthe \nlead, \nand \nit \nwas \nlooking \nas \nif \nthe \nnew \nGP \nseason \nwould \nbe \nanother \nSpencer \nromp. \n“I \nwas \nleading \nthe \nrace \nby \nabout \nten \nseconds \nwhen \nmy \nright \nhand \njust \nstopped \nworking. \nIt \nwas \nstill \ngoing \nnumb, \nbut \nit \nwas \nworse. \nIt \nliterally \nstopped \nworking,’ \nhe \nsays. \nSpencer, \nunable \nto \noperate \nthe \nfront \nbrake, \nwent \noff \nin \nthe \nhairpin, \nending \nhis \nseason when it had just barely begun. \n79 \n\n80 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nSpencer’s \nteammate \nWayne \nGardner \nmoved \npast \nto  \nwin  \nthe  \nrace, \nand \nfor \nSpencer, \nthe \nglory \ndays \nhad \nended \nat \nage \n24. \nCould \nit \nhave \nbeen \nthe \nrigors \nof \nthat \n1985 \nseason? \nHad \nall \nthat \neffort \njust \nbeen \ntoo \nmuch \nfor \nSpencer's \nbody \nto \nwithstand? \nSpencer \nreflects \non \nhis \nlong \njourney \nback \nfrom \ninjury \nand \nthe \npremature \nend \nto \nhis \nGP \ncareer. \n“I \nhave \nno \nregrets,’ \nhe \nsays. \n“It \nwould \nhave \nbeen \ngreat \n[to \nhave \nwon \nmore \nraces \nand \ntitles], \nbut \nthe \nchampionships \nwe \nwon \nwere \nvery \nspecial \nto \nall \nof \nus.” \nSpencer struggled with his injuries, missing most of the  1986 and  1987 \nseasons; a  seventh-place finish in  Sweden in  1987 was  the  highlight. He \nretired from GP motorcycle racing soon afterward, eyeing a career change \nthat  other GP world champions, such as  Hailwood and  John Surtees, had \nfound success with: “I was  going to race  cars. I flew to Del Mar to race the \nBarber Saab series. I was  leading until the  yellow flag came out  when I \noverheated the turbocharger and finished third. I also  got a test  with Chip \nGanassi in an  Indy Lights car.” \nUnfortunately, the  Indy car  route did  not  pan out. This stint was \nfollowed by an  unsuccessful comeback attempt for  Marlboro Yamaha \nin  1989. The highlight from that season was  a fifth at  the  Spanish \nGP  in Jerez: \nI was  running with the  lead group at  Australia, but  it went downhill \nfrom there. There wasn't a  problem with the  bike; the  problem was \nwith me.  I tried, I had  more surgeries, I had  neck surgery, had  bone \nchips removed that  were causing nerve issues, which had  something \nto  do  with it as  well. But  it reached the  point where my  whole arm \nwould just go weak; I couldn't even support it.  So  that was  basically \nit; \nit \nnever \ngot \nany \nbetter. \nThe \nnerve \nsignals \nwere \nweak, \nand \nthose \nnot \nonly \ncontrol \nyour \nmovements, \nbut  \ncontrol \nhow \nthe \nmuscle \nperforms. \nDespite \nall  \nthe  \ndifficulties, \nracing \nwas  \nnot  \nsomething \nSpencer \ncould \ngive \nup \neasily. \nHe \nreturned \nto \nrace \nin \nthe \nAMA \nSuperbike \nChampionships \nin \nAmerica \nand \nwas \na \nconsistent \npresence \nin \nthe \nearly \n1990s \nwith \nthe \nHonda \nRC30, \ntaking \na \nwin  \nat \nTexas \nWorld \nSpeedway \nin  \n1992. \nAt \nthe  \nend  \nof \nthat \n\nTHE PRODIGY: FREDDIE SPENCER 81 \nseason, \nSpencer \ntested \na  \nGP  \nbike \nfor  \nErv  \nKanemoto \nat  \nKyalami. \nDespite \nnot  \nhaving \nridden \na  \nGP  \nbike \nin  \nthree \nyears, \nhe \nturned \na  \ntime \nthat  \nwould \nhave \nput \nhim \nsecond \non \nthe \ngrid \nfor \nthe \nGrand \nPrix. \n“I \nran \npretty \nmuch \na \nrace \ndistance \nwith \nRothman’s \nHonda, \nand \nthen \nearlier \nin \nthe \nyear \nI \nset \na \nlap \nrecord \nin \nthe \n8 \nHours \nof \nSuzuka \n[in \nJapan]. \nIt \ngot \nme \nthinking \nabout \n[a comeback],” \nhe \nadmits. \nSpencer returned to  Grand Prix  once again for  1993. His  final hurrah \non  the  world stage was to  come with two points scored at  Misano in \n1993—on the dark day that will forever be remembered for the catastrophic \ncrash that ended Wayne Rainey’s racing career. After another year away \nfrom riding, Spencer returned to  American racing for  1995, winning the \nAMA Superbike race at  Laguna Seca on  the  new Fast  by Ferracci Ducati \n916. It had been 16 years since his first win in the class. Despite his physical \nissues, Freddie had been a winning presence for a generation. \nFor  Honda's GP  team manager, Gerald Davison, there are  two  greats \nthat  immediately come to mind: \nThere are  the perennial debates about who has been the best bike racer \nat  various times. My old  friend Mike Hailwood is  always a  serious \ncontender for  the  “best ever,’ because he  raced over many years \nand in  many classes. However, I have always believed that, number \nof races aside, Fred is  the  all-time greatest bike track racer. Plus \nhis  double 250/500 was  done in  an  age  when it just shouldn't have \nbeen possible. \nSpencer's style of early turn-in with trail braking, along with the rear  of the \nbike rotating to the point that  it lines up straight for the apex, allowing an \nearly \npower \napplication \nand \nhigh \nexit \nspeed, \nwasn't \na \ncommon \napproach. \n“My \nexit \nspeeds \nwould \nbe \nhigher \nbecause \nI \nwould \nget \non \nthe \nthrottle \nsooner, Spencer explains. \n“His \nlines \nwere \nalways \namazing, \nsays \nGerald \nDavison. \n“And \nother \nriders \ntried \nbut \nfailed \nto follow \nhim.’ \nRegardless \nof \nwho \nputs \ntogether \na \n“greatest \nof \nall-time” \nlist, \none  \nthing \nis certain: Freddie Spencer will be on  it. \n\nCHAPTER4 \nSieaahy.., aloral  FANS TE \nEddie Lawson \nEddie \nLawson \non  \nthe  \nTeam \nRoberts \nYamaha \nin  \n1990. \nDMT \nImaging \n82 \n\n“STEADY...

However, four podium finishes \nover the course of the  season showed that  Lawson had promise. \nThat promise blossomed in  1984, with Lawson winning the  season \nopener en  route to  the  championship over the  fast  but  erratic Honda \nof  Freddie Spencer. The 1984 title would be  the  first of four for  the \nCalifornian—the best record among all American riders. Eddie Lawson's \n31  Grand Prix wins also  make him  the winningest American GP  rider of \nall time. Add two Daytona 200 victories, a win at the 8 Hours of Suzuka, \nand two wins at  the  multidiscipline Superbikers competition—all of \nwhich had  followed a successful career in flat track racing—and Lawson's \non-track career achievements stand alone. His  consistency may have \nearned him  the nickname of Steady Eddie, but there was  no  venue where \nEddie Lawson could not  win  at the highest level. \n“SO FAR AHEAD OF EVERYBODY” \nEddie Ray Lawson was  born on  March 11,  1958, in  Upland, California. \nComing \nfrom \na \nlong \nline  \nof \nracers, \nyoung \nEddie \nstarted \nriding \nat \nthe  \nage \nof \nseven \non \nhis \nFather’s \nYamaha \n100, \nbefore \nmoving \nto \na \nKawasaki. \nThese \nsmall \nrotary \nvalve \nrockets \nwere \nperhaps \nbest \nknown \nfor \ntheir \nexplosive \nand \ntricky \npowerband, \nnarrow \neven \nfor \na \nbike \nin \nthe \n100cc \nclass. \n‘The \ndifficult- \nto-ride \nbikes \nwere \ngood \ntraining \nmachines \nfor \nany \naspiring \nracer, \nas \nthey \nrequired \nsome \ntalent \nand \ndetermination \nto \nride  \nto \ntheir \npotential. \n\n84 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nThanks \nto \nthe  \n1971 \nfilm  \nOn \nAny \nSunday, \nCalifornia \nmotorcycle \nracing \nculture \nwas \nin \nits \nheyday \nin \nthe \nearly \n1970s, \nand \nLawson \nwas \none \nof \nmany \nriders \nwho \narrived \non \nthe \nscene \nduring \nthis \nperiod. \nBy \nthe \nmiddle \nof \nthe \ndecade, \nthe \nyoung \nteenager \nwas \nracing \nin \nthe \nnovice \nclass \nat \nregional \ntracks \nlike \nAscot \nPark. \nIt \nwas \nobvious \nthat \nhe \nwas \none \nof \nthe \nquickest \nof \nthe \nnext \ngeneration \nof \nflat \ntrack \nracers. \nAs \nthey \nsay, \ntalent \nand \nfast \nmachinery \ntend \nto \ngravitate \ntoward \neach \nother. \n“I \nrode \neverybody’s \nbike,’ \nLawson \nrecalls. \n“Whatever \nI could \nget \nmy \nhands \non \nat \na \nlot \nof \nlocal \ndirt \ntracks \nuntil \nabout \n1976 \nwhen \nI \nturned \nNovice \nPro.” \nAs director of emergency services and  track paramedics at  Corona in \nthose days, Dusty Behrman was  there to witness the growth of many great \nriding talents, including the young kid from Upland: \nAt the time, Eddie was  riding Novice on  a  Bultaco. That was  his  first \ndecent Novice class ride. Eddie was  quiet; he was  very shy. There was \na whole lot of talent when he came up through the ranks. One time at \nan  Ascot National in the  Novice class, Eddie was  racing Mamola and \nRainey, and  Eddie was  falling back. Then on  the  last  lap, he  caught \nback up  like  a  bullet, passed Randy and  won the  race. He  reached \ndown and  shook the  back disc on  the  Bultaco. It was  loose and  kept \nlocking up! Hell of a race for Novice class. \nButch Sylva, who built 750  Yamahas, he  put  Eddie on  the  bike. \nEddie rode part of his junior year for  Butch, who had  built two  Shell \nThuet racers and a  Champion-framed version. When Eddie showed \nup at San  Jose in the Mile in  1976, the Shell blew up.  They put him  on \nthe other Shell, and he won the  San Jose Junior Invitational. \nDuring \nthose \nearly \nyears, \nEddie’s \ngrandfather \nhad \nalso \nbought \nhim \na \nproper \nroad \nracing \nmachine, \na \n50cc \nItaljet. \nSo \nthe \nteenager \nalso \nbegan \nto \nsharpen \nhis \nasphalt \nskills \nalong \nwith \nhis \nimproving \nresults \non  \nthe \nflat \ntracks. \nBehrman \ncontinues: \nEddie \nwas  \nconcentrating \non  \nroad \nracing \nand  \ndoing \nquite \nwell \nriding \nthe  \n250. \nThey \nwent \nback \nand  \nwon \nthe  \nNovice \nrace \nat  \nDaytona. \nI’ve \n\n“STEADY \n...  \nAND \nFAST”: \nEDDIE \nLAWSON \n85 \nwatched \nEddie \nride  \na \nbike \nto  \nthe  \npoint \nwhere \nI \nthought \nhe \nwas  \ngoing \nto \ncrash. \nIn \na \nfew \nraces \nat \nCorona, \nriding \nthe \nChampion-framed \nbike, \nButch \nwould \nhave \nto \ngo \nout \nthere \nand \ntell \nhim \nto \nslow \ndown. \nHe \nwas \nso \nfar \nahead \nof \neverybody; \nall \nhe \nwas  \ndoing \nwas  \nwearing \nout  \nan  \nengine. \nAs  \nhe \nhad  \ndone \nwith \nWayne \nRainey, \nShell \nThuet \nwas  \nto \nplay \na \nmajor \nrole \nin  \nthe  \nracing \neducation \nof \nEddie \nLawson. \nThuet, \na  \ntuner \nand  \nmechanic \nextraordinaire \nsince \nhis \nearly \ndays \npreparing \nflat \ntrack \nracing \nIndians \nin \nthe \n1930s, \nwould \nlater \nbuild \nthe \nXS650 \nflat \ntrackers \nthat \nKenny \nRoberts \nrode \nto \nGrand \nNational \nChampionships \nin 1973 \nand \n1974. \nThuet \ntook \nLawson \nunder \nhis \nwing \nas \na \nnovice \nrider \nin \nthe late \n1970s, \nand \nEddie \nbecame \nan \nExpert \nriding \nfor \nShell \nin \n1978. \nBy that point, the  Expert class was a  tough nut  to  crack riding the \n750  Yamaha, as  Behrman explains: “The Yamahas were really a  struggle \ncompared to  the  XR750s; you absolutely had  to  override the  Yamaha. \nEddie was  extremely good; the problem was  that the Yamahas werent that \nfast. Even Shell’s stuff, they really struggled to make them win. They just \nwerent as  fast  as  the deep-down horsepower of the XR750.” \nDusty Behrman goes on  to  describe how the  sport was  changing in \nthe  late  1970s: “There was  no  money in flat track racing; it was  just local \nprestige. All  the  money was in  Europe; Roberts had shown everybody \nthat. A lot  of guys were starting to rethink their racing careers, and Eddie \nwas  doing a whole lot of road racing.” \n“My grandfather got me  a 350  Yamaha RD  twin and then a 500  triple \nKawasaki,” recalls Lawson. “I rode that  for a while.” \nThe \n1979 \nseason \nmarked \nthe  \nbeginning \nof \nthe  \ngreat \nrivalry \nbetween \nLawson \nand \nSpencer \nin \nAMA \nprofessionai \nroad \nracing. \nThe \ncampaign \nopened \nin \nthe \n250 \nGP \nclass. \nThe \n1979 \ncampaign \nwas \nan \nabbreviated \nseason \nof \nonly \nthree \nraces, \nand \nSpencer \ntook \nthe \ntitle \nwith \ntwo \nwins \nat \nLoudon \nand \nSears \nPoint, \nwhile \nLawson \nfinished \nsecond \nin \nthe \nchampionship. \nIn \n1980, \nthe \ntwo \nwent \nhead-to-head \nin \nSuperbike, \nwith \nSpencer \nriding \nfor \nHonda \nand \nLawson \nfor \nKawasaki. \nBut \nbefore \nthat, \nthere \nwas \na \nmade-for-television \nseries \nof \nraces \nthat \nbrought \ntogether \nthe \nbest \nriders \nin \nthe \nworld \nfrom \nevery \ndisci- \npline. \nThis \nevent \nwould \nplay \na \nrole \nin \nEddie \nLawson's \nrise \nto \nprominence. \n\nHD \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nSUPERBIKERS \nLate \nin  \nthe  \n1979 \nseason \ncame \nthe  \nSuperbikers \ncompetition, \na  \ngrand \nplan \nto \npit \nthe \nbest \nmotorcycle \nracers \nin \nthe \nworld \ntrom \nevery \ndiscipline \nagainst \neach \nother \non \na \ncombination \nroad \nrace, \nflat \ntrack, \nand \nmotocross \nvenue \nto \nbe \ntelevised \non \nABC’s \nWide \nWorld \nof \nSports. \n(This \nevent \nlaunched \nthe \nconcept \nof \nSupermoto \nto \nthe \nworld.) \nPromoter \nand \nseries \ncreator \nGavin \nTrippe describes the  basic idea behind the  concept: \nThe  idea at  Carlsbad was  to  have equal time on  the  asphalt and  the \ndirt. I called Shell Thuet, and  I told  him I needed somebody who could \ngive a day to help us  lay out  the track. He sent his  rider Eddie Lawson, \nand Eddie spent an  entire day  with us  talking about if this  or  that \nwould work. Then I got a tractor and  built the  track. \nThe  interesting thing was  that they were all  racers. The thought \nof  going head-to-head with guys they don't normally get  to  race \nwith—the X factor, the curiosity—they loved the idea, thinking, “That \nguy,  I want to see  if I can  beat his ass.” \nThe made-for-TV extravaganza hada budget that dwarfed the other racing \nevents of the day. As a sign of the event's importance, ABC brought Jackie \nStewart, Chris Economaki, and Jim  McKay, likely the  most prestigious \nteam of television journalists to  ever cover a  motorcycle event. The races \nwere \ntelevised \nin \ntwo \nparts: \nPart \none \ncovered \nthe \nheat \nraces, \nand \npart \ntwo \nshowed the final. \nMark \nJohnson, \nwho \nwas  \nwith \nKawasaki's \nmotocross \ndepartment \nat \nthe \ntime \nand \nwho \nwould \nlater \nwork \nas \na \nmechanic \nfor \nWayne \nRainey, \ndescribes \nthe \nlevel \nof \nexcitement: \n“It \nwas \na \ngood \ntime; \nit \nwas \na \ndifferent \nevent, \nand \nit \nkind \nof \ngot \neverybody \nenergized. \nIt \nwas \nat \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \nyear, \nit \nbrought \nall \nthe \ndisciplines \ntogether \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime.” \nAnd \nso,  \non  \nthe  \nbiggest \nstage \nAmerican \nmotorcycle \nracing \nhad \never \nseen, \nEddie \nLawson \nmade \na \nlasting \nimpression. \nThe  \n1982 \n500cc \nworld \nMX \nchampion, \nBrad \nLackey, \nrecalls \nLawson's \nperformance: \n“We \ncame \ndown \nthe \nstraightaway/drag \nstrip, \nand \nwed \ngo \ninto \nthe \nTT \ndirt \ntrack \nsection \nat \nabout \n120-plus. \nAnd \nLawson, \nhe \nwas  \na \ngood \nroad \nracer \nand \ndirt \ntracker, \nso \n\n“STEADY \n...  \nAND \nFAST”: \nEDDIE \nLAWSON \nhe \nhad \na \nlot \nof \nadvantages, \nbut \nhe \ndidn’t \neven \nshut \noff \nwhen \nhed \ngo \ninto \nthe \ndirt \nfor \nthe \nlongest \ntime, \nand  \nI \nwas  \njust \nthinking, \n‘Madman!” \nWhen \ntold \nof \nLackey’s \ncomments, \nLawson \nlaughs. \n“I  \nprobably \njust \ndidn't \nknow \nany \nbetter. \nThey \nwere \nkind \nof \nupset \nbecause \nI \nhad \nlaid \nout \nthe \ntrack \nwith \na \nlot \nof \nroad \nrace \nand \nflat \ntrack. \nThere \nwasn’t \nmuch \nmotocross. \nThey \nweren't \ntoo \nthrilled. \nOh \nwell...” \nIn the first Superbikers competition, Lawson would end up crashing out \nof his  heat race and  the  semi, but  he had  certainly delivered a  memorable \nperformance in front of the biggest imaginable audience. For television rating \nof motorsports, the Indianapolis 500 was the most-watched American motor- \nsports event, with 10.8 million households tuning in to the 1979 race.  In second \nand third places, with 8.1 and 7.6 million, were Superbikers 1 and Superbikers \n2, ahead of NASCAR's Daytona 500, with 7.3 million households. \nThe upshot of this is  that the  Superbikers helped to  make riders \nlike Eddie Lawson household names. In  the seven-year history \nof the Superbikers event, Lawson was  the only nonmotocross rider to win \nthe event, taking victories in both the  1983 and  1985 races on  his Yamaha \nYZA490 equipped with 19-inch dirt track tires. \nDuring 1979, in  the  midst of  all  this success, Lawson suffered a \ncrushing accident at Riverside Raceway. He severely dislocated his hip, as \nDusty Behrman recalls: \n[The bike] threw him on  the  ground in turn six.  The  next morning, \nwhen I went to  work, I was  looking through the  inpatients and  it \nshowed “Lawson.” They had  taken him to  the  Fontana emergency \nroom \nafter \ntransporting \nhim \nfrom \nRiverside \nGeneral, \nand \nthe \nhip \nwas \nout \nfor \nso \nlong \nthey \nalmost \ncouldn't \nget \nit \nback \nin. \nAfter \nfour \nor \nfive \nhours, \nyou \nare \ngoing \nto \nhave \nan \nimmense \namount \nof \nswelling \nin \nthe \nhip \nsocket \narea. \nThere \ncan \nbe \nlong-term \neffects \nof \nsomething \nlike \nthat. \nHe \nwas \nin \ntraction \nfor \nsomething \nlike \nten \ndays. \nI \nmade \nsure \nthat \nthere \nwas  \nalways \nthe \nright \nnurse \nthere \nto \ntake  \ncare  \nof \nhim. \nDespite \nthe  \ntrauma, \nLawson \nwas \nto  \nspring \nback \nwith \nhis  \ncharacteristic \ndetermination, \nand \nthe  \ndamaged \nhip  \nwas \nnot  \na  \nfactor \nuntil \nafter \nhis \n87 \n\n88 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nretirement \nfrom \nracing. \n“I  \nnever \nthought \nabout \nit \nuntil \nmy  \nmid-forties. \nI’ve \nhad \na \nhip \nreplacement \nand \nnow \nit’s \nperfect.’ \nLawson’s \nperformances \nat \nthe  \nSuperbikers \nand  \nin  \n250  \nGP  \nearned \nhim \na \ntest  \nand, \neventually, \na \nspot \non  \nthe  \nKawasaki \nSuperbike \nteam \nfor  \n1980. \nIt \nis \nhard \nto \noverstate \nthe \nemerging \nimportance \nof \nSuperbike \nto \nthe \nmanu- \nfacturers \nin \nthose \nearly \ndays \nand \nequally \nhard \nto \noverstate \nthe \ndifficulty \nin \nriding \nthem. \n“[Superbike] \nwas \nreally \njust \nstarting \nto \nget \ngoing,’ \nLawson \nrecalls. \n“Coming \nfrom \nthe \nTZ250s, \nthey \nwere \njust \na \nhandful. \nThey \nwere \njust \nnasty \nto ride. \nThey \nwere \nhorrible. \nThey \nhad \na lot \nof \nengine \nand \nno \nchassis, \nno \nsuspension, \nno \ntires \n. \n. \n. \njust \na \nton \nof \nhorsepower.” \nLawson \nscored \nhis \nfirst \nseries \nwin \nat \nTalladega \nand \nwould \nbe \npart \nof \nthe \ncontroversial \nthree-way \nbattle \nfor \nthe \ntitle \nthat \nwas \neventually \nawarded \nto \nWes \nCooley \nand \nSuzuki \nafter \nmonths \nof \nwrangling \nover \nprotests \nand \ncounter-protests. \nThe  points race couldn't have been closer. Spencer and  Lawson each \nhad three wins going into the finale at Daytona, while Wes Cooley had two \non  the  Yoshimura-prepared Suzuki. Cooley won the  race by less  than a \nbike length over Spencer’s Honda, but then Kawasaki protested that  there \nwere illegal frame modifications to the Suzuki. Cooley was  excluded from \nthe results and Lawson declared the AMA Superbike Champion. The story \nwasnt over, however, and it wasn't long before Lawson was  disqualified as \nwell, losing the championship in his rookie year. \nLawson's teammate David Aldana explains the situation: \nWe \nwere \nin \na \nlot \nof \ntrouble \ntrying \nto \nkeep \nup \nwith \nFreddie \nSpencer \nat \nthe \ntime. \nI \nmade \na \nlot \nof \nchanges, \nmoving \nthe \nengine \nforward \non \none \nbike, \nshortening \nup \nthe \nswingarm \non \nanother, \nputting \nbig \nrotors \non \nanother. \nThat's \nwhat \nthey \npaid \nme \nfor. \nEddie \nand \nI \nalways \nhad \nabout \nthe \nsame \nequipment, \nbut  \nhe  \ntook \nit \nto  \nthe  \nnext \nlevel. \nOne \ntime \nat  Daytona], \nEddie \nblew \nup \nhis \nbike, \nand \nGary \nMathers, \nthe \nrace \nmanager, \nasked \nme \nif \nI \ncould \nlet \nhim \nhave \nmy \nmotorcycle. \nI \ntold \nthem \nthat \nI \nhad \nas \ngood \na \nchance \nof \nwinning \nthis \nthing \nas \nanyone, \nso \nthey \nsaid \ntheyd \ngive \nme \nthe \nfive \nthousand \ndollars \nin \ncontingency \nmoney \nif \nI \nlet \nthem \nhave \nthe \nmotorcycle, \nso  \nI \nsaid, \n“Okay.” \nSo, \nthey \nswitched \nthe \nnumber \nplates \non \n\n“STEADY... \nAND \nFAST”: \nEDDIE \nLAWSON \n89 \nthe  \nbikes. \nEventually \n[someone] \nfound \nout,  \nprotested, \nand  \n[Lawson] \ngot \ndisqualified. \n“We \nswapped \nnumber \nplates,” \nLawson \nremembers. \n“And \nit \nwasr't \nin \nthe \nrules. \nBut \nconsider \nthat \neveryone \nelse \nwas \non \nillegal \nframes \nand \neverything...” \nRule \nbending \nwas \nraised \nto \nan \nart \nform \nduring \nthose \nearly days of Superbikes. \nThe  \nfollowing \nseason \nwould \nbring \nbetter \nresults. \nRob \nMuzzy \nhad \njoined \nthe team \nas \ncrew \nchief \nat \nthe end \nof \n1980: \nI came into a fairly disappointed program because they had  lost  the \nchampionship. They had lost it kind of because of mechanical failures, \nor  at  least that  was  their feeling. We  started with a new bike in  1981, \nthe  physical bike itself was  a  new machine, and  we  didn't use  any  of \nthe stuff that  they had run  in  1980. So, we  built the new bike, went to \nDaytona, and got our  ass  kicked by Honda. To make a long story short, \nwe  just didn't have enough power at  the  first  couple of races. Pretty \nmuch what we had been using was  what Japan had sent. We made some \nchanges to  the  engine and  found some power. I remember having to \nport a  cylinder head in a closet at  Atlanta... in  the  distributorship \nthere. We won Talladega, and  from that  point on,  it was  competitive. \n“Yeah, that  was  a good season,” Lawson recalls. “We liad  something that \ncould \nrun \nwith \nthem \neven \nthough \nthey \nwere \noutspending \nus \nprobably \nabout \nten \nto \none. \nWed \nwin \nand \nfrom \nall \ntheir \nadvertising \nyoud \nthink \nthey \nhad \nwon. \nWed \nshow \nup \nwith \na \nbox \ntruck \nand \nlook \nlike \nprivateers \ncompared \nto \nHonda, \nwho \nwere \nshowing \nup \nwith \ndecked-out \neighteen \nwheelers. \nIt \nmade it more fun when wed beat  em.” \nFrans \nVandenbroek, \nPat  \nHennen’s \nmechanic \nfrom \nthe  \nGP  \ndays \nof \nthe \nmid-1970s, \nwas \non \nthe \nKawasaki \nteam \nat \nthe \ntime \nand \nrecalls \nthe \ntesting \nthat  \nLawson \nhad \nto \nendure \nin \nthe \npredata-acquisition \ntelemetry \ndays: \nKawasaki \nsent  \nme  \nto \nJapan \nto \nlearn \nhow \nto \nmount \nstrain \ngauges \non  \nbike \ncomponents. \nI \nput  \n120  \non  \nthe  \nKZ1000 \nswingarm, \nthen \nconstructed \n\n90 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \na  \nbackpack \nwith \na  \nstrain \ngauge \namplifier \nand  \nan  \neight-channel \ntape \nrecorder. \nWe \nstrapped \nit \nto \nEddie, \nand \nhe \nrode \naround \nDaytona \nat \nspeed \nso \nI \ncould \nrecord \nreadings. \nIt \nwas \nan \naluminum \nbox \nthe \nsize \nof \na \nsmall \nfridge! \n'm \namazed \nhe \ndidn't \ncomplain \nabout \ntaking \nit \naround \nDaytona. \nThat \n1981 \nseason \nwould \nbe \nthe \nlast \nyear \nof \nthe \nLawson-Spencer \nrivalry—at \nleast \nuntil \n1983, \nwhen \nEddie \nwould \njoin \nSpencer \non  \nthe  \nGP  \ncircuit. \nWith \nKenny \nRoberts \nhaving \nwon \nthe \nprevious \nthree \nworld \nGP \ntitles, \nthere \nwas \na \ngreat \ndeal \nof \ninterest \nin \nmotorcycle \nroad \nracing \nin \ngeneral, \nparticularly \nthe \nAmerican \nSuperbike \nseries. \nIt was  a golden era  for American Superbike racing, with a number of \nfuture American Grand Prix champions doing battle on  what were essen- \ntially factory hot rods, in which the engine development was  miles ahead \nof the chassis. Superbike racing was  the kind of platform that  allowed the \ntruly gifted to stand out  from the merely talented. \nThe  results for  Kawasaki were to  improve in  1981, as  Lawson not \nonly had the  ability to  develop the  machine but  had the  formidable \ntalents of Rob Muzzy focused on  the  search for  more power and  speed. \nIn  yet  another season-long title battle with both Spencer and Cooley, \nit all  came down to  the  final race. Despite Spencer winning the  season \nfinale at  Daytona, Lawson took the  title  by virtue of his  trademark run \nof steady finishes—this was  “Steady Eddie” Lawson at  his  finest. Lawson \nnot  only won the  AMA Superbike title  but  also  repeated as  champion in \nAMA  250 GP.   _ \nEven more impressive was  the fact that  Lawson repeated as  Superbike \nChampion \nin \n1982 \ndespite \nsuffering \nserious \ninjuries \non \nthe \nKawasaki \nwhile \nriding \nin \nthe \nAMA \nNational \nat \nLaguna \nSeca. \nMuzzy \nrecalls, \n“The \nmost \nserious \ninjury \nI \nknow \nof \nwas \nthe \nneck \ninjury \non \nthe \nKR500 \nat \nLaguna \nSeca. \nI \ngot \nmarried \nin \n1982, \nand \nhe \nhad \nthat \nhalo \n[head \nand \nneck \nbrace] \nscrewed into  his head.” \n“Yeah, \nI \nbroke \nmy \nneck, \nthe \nC-7,” \nLawson \nrecalls. \n“The \nrehab \nwas  \nabout \ntwo \nmonths. \nI \nfelt \ngood \nand \nwon \nthe \nfirst \nrace \nback. \nI \ndidn’t \neven \nthink \nabout \nit.” \nPulling \noff \nthe \nAMA \nSuperbike \nChampionship, \nEddie \nclearly \nhadn't \nlost \nany \nspeed \ndespite \nhis \nprevious \nmisfortune. \nObviously, \nLawson \n\n“STEADY... \nAND \nFAST”: \nEDDIE \nLAWSON \n91 \nhad \nthat  \nspecial \nquality \nthat \nenabled \nhim  \nto \nshut \nout  \nthe \npain \nand \nachieve \nresults \ndespite \ninjury—a \nquality \nthat \nwas \nperhaps \nas \nimportant \nas \nanything \nelse \nin \na \n500cc \nGP \nrider \nof \nthat \nera. \n“You're \njust \nyoung \nand \nstupid.” \nLawson \nsays \nof \nthose \ndays, \n“and \nyou \ndon't \nknow \nany \nbetter” \nNo  \none  \nwould \nquestion \nEddie \nLawson's \ntoughness. \nHis  \ndevelopment \nskills \nwere \nequally \nnotable, \nas Muzzy \nexplains: \nMy opinion is that  the  guys who are  really good development riders \ndevelop that ability through the teams they ride for. The best ever  was \nEddie Lawson, followed by Chandler and then [Scott] Russell. Rainey \nis in there too.  And all of those guys in their early stages rode for us. \nOf all the guys I’ve worked with, Eddie is the one  who is my favorite. \nHe  never, ever complained. If he had  a  crappy bike, we  all knew he \nhad  a crappy bike. When wed be going through the setup, and  if hed \nbe unhappy and want more than what he had, it wasn't in the form of \ncomplaining. It was  more, “It does this; it does that.” But come Sunday \nmorning, hed  throw his  leg over the  thing with a  smile and  ride  it \nas  hard as  it could possibly be  ridden.

I'm  sure you  have some concept of how hard \nthe  guys work—the guys who work on  the  bikes. Imagine what it’s \nlike  when you've worked your ass  off,  you've hardly slept and  were \ndoing everything you could possibly do, and the rider doesn’t win  and \ngets  off the  bike saying, “Well, if I had  a  better bike.” Eddie always \ngave \neverything \nhe \nhad \nto \ngive, \nno \nmatter \nhow \nbad \nor \nhow \ngood \nthe \nbike was. \nFor  \n1982, \nLawson \nwas  \nto \nhave \nyet \nanother \nteammate, \nthis \none  \na \nrider \nwho \nwould \nbecome \none \nof \nhis \ngreatest \nGP \nrivals. \nRob \nMuzzy \nrecalls \nthat \nseason \nwith \nthe \ntwo \nfuture \nworld \nchampions: \n“The \nreality \nis \nthat \nEddie \nreally \nhelped \nWayne. \nHe \ndidn’t \nhold \nanything \nback, \nadmittedly \nbecause, \nat \nthat \npoint \nin \ntime, \nWayne \nreally \nwasn't \nan \nequal \nto \nEddie.” \nLawson \nenjoyed \na \nstellar \nSuperbike \nseason, \nwinning \nthe  \ntitle  \nby \nnine \npoints \nover \nHonda’s \nMike \nBaldwin \nand \nKawasaki \nteammate \nRainey. \nEddie \n\n92 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nLawson \nhad \nbeaten \nall \ncomers \nin \nthe  \nUnited \nStates. \nIt \nwas \ntime \nfor \nhim \nto \nmove up to the world stage. \nTAKING ON THE WORLD \nA  \nrider \ncouldn't \nhave \nasked \nfor  \na  \nmuch \nbetter \nsituation \nthan \nthe  \none \nEddie \nLawson \nstepped \ninto \nin \n1983: \na \nyear \nto \nrace \nas \nthe \nunderstudy \nto \nthe \noutgoing \nthree-time \nworld \nchampion \non \nboard \none \nof \nthe \nbest \nbikes \nin the \nseries. \nThe \nyear \nstarted \nout \nin the \nbest \npossible \nway \nat \nthe \nDaytona \n200, \nwith \nRoberts \nleading \nLawson \nhome \nto \na \n1-2 \nfinish \non \nthe \nnew \n680cc \nYamaha \nOW-69. \nThe 1983 Grand Prix season is  covered in  depth elsewhere in  this \nbook: Suffice it  to  say,  there wasn't any room at  the  top  for  anyone \nother than Spencer and  Roberts, but  Lawson's four podiums comprised \na  more-than-respectable campaign in  support of his  teammate. Lawson \ntook his first  Grand Prix  podium in round three at  Monza, followed by a \nsecond to his teammate in Austria. \nLooking back on  his European debut season, Lawson remembers the \nadvantage that  Honda held over Yamaha that year: \nKenny may not  tell  you this, but  the  Honda was way better. That \nYamaha was  bad  that  year, it was  disc valve, wouldn't start, and  had \nno  bottom end or  midrange. [Honda] would just kill  us.  We  had a \nlittle bit of top end  on  them, but  it didn’t matter, they'd be long gone. \nWe  were on  Dunlops, they were on  Michelins, and  their tires were so \nmuch \nbetter \nthan \nwhat \nwe \nhad. \nKenny \nstill \ngot \nwithin \ntwo \npoints \nafter \nthey \nran \nhim \nout \nof \ngas \nat \nMonza; \nthe \nbike \nwouldn't \nstart \nin \nYugoslavia \nso \nhe \nstarted \ndead \nlast. \nFreddie’s \nHonda \ntriple \nwas \nway \nbetter \nand \nfor \nKenny \nto \nmatch \nhim  \non  \nthat  \nbike \nwas  \namazing. \nA  \nthird-place \nfinish \nat  \nRijeka \ncemented \nEddie’s \nposition \nas  \na  \nfuture \nGP \ncontender, \nbut \nat \nthe \nfinal \nround \nhe \nwas \nunable \nto \nhelp \nRoberts \nsecure \nthe \ntitle \nagainst \nSpencer. \nAll \ntold, \nLawson \ncompleted \nhis \nrookie \nGP \nseason \nfourth \nin \nthe \nWorld \nChampionship \nbehind \nSpencer, \nRoberts, \nand  \nMamola. \nThe  \nera  \nof \nKenny \nversus \nthe  \nworld \ncame \nto  \na  \nclose, \nand \n\n“STEADY \n...  \nAND \nFAST”: \nEDDIE \nLAWSON \nEddie \nLawson \nwas \nready \nto  \ntake \nup  \nthe  \nchallenge \nand \nthe  \nmantle \nof \nworld \nchampion. \nHelping \nLawson's \nchances \nin  \n1984 \nwas  \nthe  \ndebut \nof \nHonda’ \nrevolu- \ntionary \nV-4. \nThe \nstory \nof \nthis \nfast-but-fragile \nmachine \nis \ncovered \nat \nlength \nin \nChapter \n3. \nWhile \nHonda \nwas \nbusy \nout-thinking \nitself, \nLawson \nwould \nhave \nthe \nimproved, \nnewly \ndeveloped \nreed \nvalve \nYamaha \nGP \nengine \nthat \nformed \nthe \nbasis \nfor \nthe \nnext \n15 \nyears \nof \nYamaha \nGP \nbikes. \n“Yep, \nit \nwas \na \nbig \njump \nup, \nLawson \nrecalls \nof \nthe \nbike. \nIn \nthe \nright \nplace \nat \nthe \nright \ntime, \nhe \nalso \nhad \nthe \nluxury \nof \nbeing \nbacked \nby \nKenny \nRoberts’ \nformer \nmentor, \ntechnical \nwizard \nKel \nCarruthers. \nThe \npieces \nwere \nin \nplace, \nand \nLawson \nduly \nwon \nthe \nseason-opening \nrace \nat \nKyalami, \nSouth \nAfrica. \nSpencer \ncame \nback \nto \nwin \nat \nMisano, \nbut \nLawson \ncountered \nwith \ntwo \nwins \nin \nSpain \nand \nAustria. \nIn \nthe \nend, \nconsistency \nproved \nto \nbe \nthe \nkey \nto \nthe \ntitle \nthat \nseason, \nand \nthe \napproach \nbrought \nSteady \nEddie \nhis \nfirst \nWorld \nChampionship, \ndespite \nhaving \nfour \nGrands \nPrix \nwins \nto \nSpencer's \nfive. \nIt was \nLawson's \nfour \nsecond- \nplaces \nthat \nmade \nthe \ndifference. \nCrucially, \nLawson \nfinished \nevery \nrace, \nand \nhis \nworst \nfinish \nof \nthe \nentire \nseason \nwas \nfourth. \nHe \nwas \non \nthe \npodium \nfor \nnine \nof \nthe \ntwelve \nraces. \nRandy \nMamola \nwon \nthree \nof \nthe \nlast \nfive \nGPs, \nmaking \nit the \nsecond \nstraight \nyear \nwhere \nonly \nAmerican \nriders \nhad \nwon \na \n500cc \nGP. \nThe \nera \nof \nAmerican \ndominance \nwas \nat its \nzenith. \nThe  1985 season was  to be Freddie Spencer's greatest season—and one \nof the greatest all-time for any  rider—but Lawson would make him  work \nfor  it.  From the  beginning of the  season, it was  clear that  the  Yamaha \nwas  simply no  match for Spencer on  the  new V-4  Honda. Yet  despite the \ndisadvantage, \nLawson \nwon \nthree \nGPs \nand \nwas \nable \nto \nkeep \nSpencer \nfrom \ncompletely \nrunning \naway \nwith \nthe \ntitle. \nOnce \nagain, \nit \nwas \nhis \nconsistent \napproach \nthat \nallowed \nLawson \nto \nhang \nin \nwith \nSpencer: \nLawson \nhad \njust \none \nDNF \nand \nhis \nworst \nfinish \nwas \nagain \nfourth. \nAmericans \nfinished \n1-2 \nin \nthe championship for the second year in a row. \nAs  \nthe \n1986 \nseason \nbegan, \ninjuries \nwould \ndeal \na  \nblow \nto  \nFreddie \nSpencer's \nfuture \nhopes, \nallowing \nEddie \nLawson \nto  \nbecome \nthe  \ndominant \nforce \nin \nGrand \nPrix \nracing. \nWith \nSpencer \neffectively \nsidelined \nfor \nmuch \nof \nthe \nseason \nwith \ncarpal- \ntunnel \nsyndrome \nand  \nassorted \nnerve \nproblems, \nAussie \nWayne \nGardner \n93 \n\nQO 4 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nstepped \ninto  \nthe \nrole  \nof \nmain \nchallenger \nfor \nHonda. \nLawson \nand  \nGardner \nwould \nengage \nin \na \nseason-long \nduel, \nwith \nGardner \ntaking \nthe \nseason \nopener \nat \nJarama \nbefore \nLawson \nwent \non \na \nroll, \nwinning \nat \nMonza, \nthe \nNiirburgring, \nthe \nSalzburgring, \nand \nRijeka, \nYugoslavia. \nGardner \nfought \nback \nwith \nvictories \nat \nAssen \nand \nSilverstone, \nbut \nthen \nLawson \nsealed \nthe \ntitle \nwith \nwins \nin \nthree \nof \nthe \nseason's \nfinal \nfour \nraces \nat \nLe \nMans, \nAnderstorp, \nand \nMisano. \nClearly \ndemonstrating \nwhy \nhis \nother \nnickname \nwas \n“Fast \nEddie” \nLawson \nwon \nhis \nsecond \nWorld \nChampionship \nby \n22 \npoints \nover \nGardner, \nwith \nYamaha \nteammates \nMamola \nand \nBaldwin \nin \nthird \nand \nfourth. \nIt \nhad \nbeen \nanother \nstaggering \ndisplay \nof \nconsistency \nand \nspeed—Lawson \nhad \none \nDNF \nall \nseason. \nWith \nthe \nexception \nof \none \nthird-place \nfinish, \nevery \nother \nfinish \nhad \nbeen \nfirst \nor \nsecond \nplace. \nThe  1987 season would belong to  Honda's Wayne Gardner, as  he won \nfour  of the  first  six  races to  take  a  lead that  Lawson could not  overcome. \nAlthough the  Californian certainly made it  interesting, with wins at \nHockenheim, Assen, and Donington that pulled him back into contention, \nthe  gritty Australian responded by winning the  next two  Grands Prix to \nincrease his advantage. Despite finishing out  the year with wins at  Jarama \nand  Buenos Aires, two  of the last three races, Lawson finished third in the \ntitle chase, one  point adrift of Mamola. For only the third time in  10 years \nand  for  the  first  time since 1982, an  American was  not  the  500ce world \nchampion. “They missed it in  1987,” Lawson recalls. “The bike was  pretty \nslow. For  whatever reason, we  missed it on  the  top  speed. That, and  I fell \ndown in the  rain  a couple of times, and  that  was  that.” \nLawson’ \nsixth \nGP \ncampaign \nwould \nbe \na \nrematch \nwith \nGardner, \nalthough \nsome \nnew  \nfaces \nwould \nemerge \nto \njoin \nthe \nfight. \nOne \nnewcomer \nwas  \na \nyoung \nhotshot \nfrom \nTexas: \nKevin \nSchwantz \nopened \nthe \nseason \nwith \na \nvictory \nat \nthe \nJapanese \nGP \nat \nSuzuka, \nhis \nfirst \nof \nmany. \n“He \nwas \nlearning, \nlearning \nthe \nropes, \nLawson \nsays \nof \nSchwantz. \n“But \nlike \nall \nof \nus, \nthat \nfirst \nyear \non \na \n500 \nwas \na \nhandful.” \nGardner \nfollowed \nin \nsecond \nwith \nLawson \ntaking \nthird. \nThe \nsecond \nrace \nof \n1988 \nwas \nthe \nfirst \nGP \nheld \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates \nsince \nDaytona \n1965. \nNot \nsurprisingly, \nLawson \nwas \nthe \nman \nto \nbeat \nat \nLaguna \nSeca \nand \nwildly \ncelebrated \nhis \nvictory \nbefore \nhis \nhome \ncrowd, \nwhile \nGardner \nfinished \nsecond, \nJarama \nbrought \nanother \nsurprise \nwhen \nAustralian \nKevin \nMagee \ntook \n\n“STEADY \n...  \nAND \nFAST”: \nEDDIE \nLAWSON \nthe \nwin, \nfollowed \nby \nLawson \nand \nGardner. \nAt \nthat \npoint, \nLawson \nwent \nona \ntear, \nwinning \nthree \nof \nthe \nnext \nfour \nGrands \nPrix \nbefore \nGardner \nresponded \nwith \nthree \nstraight \nwins, \nalthough \nLawson \nminimized \nthe \ndamage \nby \ntaking \nsecond \nat \nSpa \nand \nAssen. \nWhatever \nmomentum \nGardner \nmight \nhave \nhad \nswung \nback \nto \nLawson \nfor \nthe \nfinal \nfive \nraces \nof \nthe \nseason: \nThe \nAmerican \nwon \nthree \nGrands \nPrix \nto \nclinch \nhis \nthird \n500cc \nWorld \nChampionship \nand \nYamahas \nsixth \nin \neleven \nseasons. \n“The \n1988 \nbike \nwas \na \nreally \ngood \nbike; \nrecalls \nLawson. \n“It \ndid \neverything \nwell.” \nFinishing \nthird \nin \nthe \npoints \nthat \nseason \nwas \nanother \nAmerican: \nWayne \nRainey. \nTHE SWITCH TO  HONDA \nEddie Lawson may have been fast, he may have been steady, but  he was \ncertainly not  complacent. To  the  shock of  nearly everyone, Lawson \nabruptly quit Yamaha after team manager Giacomo Agostini told \nLawson that his  pay  would be  reduced for  1989, despite having won a \nthird World Championship. “He was  always playing games,” Lawson says \nof his legendary former boss. “That was it for me. I said, ‘I’m out  of here. \nI'll take less  and  I’m going to  ride  the  other bike.’ I felt bad  for Yamaha, \nbecause [it was] a great company that  I had enjoyed being with, but  I was \nat that point with Ago.” Lawson contacted Erv Kanemoto and switched to \nHonda for  1989. To outside observers, a repeat title  seemed unlikely: No \nrider had  ever defended his  500cc World Championship after switching \nbrands of machine. Yet  the  Rothmans Honda certainly had  pace, espe- \ncially with Kanemoto tuning the bikes. Meanwhile, Freddie Spencer had \nreturned from retirement to  take Lawson’s place at  Marlboro Yamaha, \nand \nthe \nKenny \nRoberts \nteam \nreturned \nwith \nthe \nup-and-coming \nWayne \nRainey. \nThere \nwas \nalso \nthe \never-exciting \nKevin \nSchwantz... \nThe \n1989 \nGP \nseason certainly was  not  lacking for storylines. \nThe \nseason \nopener \nwas \nonce \nagain \nheld \nat  \nSuzuka. \nSchwantz \nand \nRainey \nimmediately \nshowed \nthat \nthey \nwere \nready \nto \ncontend \nfor \nthe \ntitle, \nfinishing \nfirst \nand \nsecond \nrespectively \nin \nan \nepic \nbattle. \nMeanwhile, \nLawson \nfollowed \nin \nthird. \nThe \nsecond \nrace, \nheld \nat \nPhillip \nIsland \nin \nAustralia, \nsaw \nGardner \ntake \nthe \nwin, \nfollowed \nby \nRainey. \nA \nfifth \nplace \nby \nLawson \nseemed \nto \nsignal \nthat \nthis \nwould \nnot \nbe \nhis \nyear. \n\n96 \nGRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nBut  \nSteady \nEddie \ncontinued \nracking \nup  \npoints, \ntaking \nthird \nat  \nthe \nUSGP \nand \ncatching \na \nbig \nbreak \nin \nSpain \nafter \nSchwantz \nthrew \naway \ncertain \nvictory, \nhanding \nthe \nwin \nto \nLawson. \nFollowed \nhome \nby \nthe \never-consistent \nRainey, \nEddie \nhad \nmoved \ninto \ncontention. \nThe \nnext \nrace \nwas \nthe \nrain \nfiasco \nof \nMisano, \nwhere \nthe \ntop \nriders \nrefused \nto \ncompete \non \nthe \nsoaked \nand \nslick \ncircuit. \nAdapting to the  new Honda was  difficult, as  Kanemoto explains: \nWe  tested during the  winter, but  the  bike development took a  while. \nSometimes you  don’t understand the  bike until you have someone \nride  it at  a  different, higher level. Almost every race there were new \nthings coming. It was  a  new bike for  Eddie, coming from riding the \nYamaha, and  we  were trying to  input a  lot of what he needed. It took \na  little while. We  were getting new frames, mostly things from the \nchassis side. \nWere the  changes to  the  bike individual? Were there different bikes for \nGardner and Lawson? \nLawson \nat  \nLaguna \nSeca \nin  \n1990, \nDMT \nImaging \n\n“STEADY \n...  \nAND \nFAST”: \nEDDIE \nLAWSON \n97 \nYes,  \nit \nwas  \nto \nsuit  \nEddie, \nas  \nGardner \ngot \nhurt \nearly. \nThe  \nHonda, \ndue \nto \nthe \ncharacter \nof \nthe \nengine, \nwas \na \nlot \nmore \naggressive. \nIt \nwasn’t \nvery \nforgiving \ncompared \nto \nthe \nYamaha. \nThe \npower \nwould \ncome \nin \nfairly \nabrupt; \nit \nwas \na \npretty \nviolent \nbike. \nThe \ntop \nspeed \nwas \ngood, \nbut \nit \nseemed \nthe \nbike \nwasn't \nas \nagile \nand \nforgiving \nas \nthe \nYamaha, \nwhich \nwas \na \nmuch \nnicer \nbike \nto \nride, \nbecause \nthe \npower \nand \nhandling \nwas \nso \nsmooth. \nSomebody \nwho \nnever \nraced \none \nof \nthose \nYamahas \nprobably \nwouldn't \nbe \naware \nof \nthe \ndifference. \nEddie \nwas \ntrying \nto \nchange \nthe \nHonda \ninto \nsomething \na \nlot \neasier \nto \nride. \nWe \ndid \na \nlot \nof \nwork \nin \nthe \nchassis \nand \nsuspension \narea. \nWe \nwould \nget \nchassis \ndelivered \nto \nthe \nracetrack \nand \nthings \nwere \ncoming \nin \nlate. \nWed \nhave \nto \nassemble \neverything \nin \na \nday \nor \nso \nbefore \nthe \nrace. \nIt \nwas \na \nlot \nof \nwork \nthat \nyear, \njust \ntrying \nto \nget \nsomething \nto \nwork, \njust \ngetting \nthrough \nand \nhoping \nthe next race  would be good. \nOne would think that  having to  qualify and  race a  different machine at \nevery event would result in radically inconsistent performances, but that \nwas  not  the case with Lawson. “Erv made a lot of changes,” says  Lawson. \n“And that  bike was  really good. The  press had  made it out  to  be kind of \nnasty to ride  and  all that, but it wasn’t. It was  a good bike.” \nRainey and  Schwantz traded victories in  the  four midseason races, \nwhile Lawson picked up three second-place finishes as well as a third. And \nthen, as  the  season began to  reach its  climax, Eddie Lawson again went \nona tear, winning three of the next four Grands Prix, including a defining \nvictory \nat \nthe \nSwedish \nGP \nat \nAnderstorp \nin \nwhich \nRainey \nhigh-sided \nduring \na \nlate-race \nbattle \nwith \nLawson, \nhanding \nthe \npoints \nlead \nto \nFast \nand \nSteady \nEddie—a \nlead \nhe \nwould \ncarry \nto \nhis \nfourth \nchampionship. \nLawson’s \nchampionship-winning \ndays \nwere \nover, \nalthough \nno  \none \nwould \nhave \nguessed \nit \nat \nthe \ntime. \nFor \nthe \nsecond \nstraight \nseason—after \nhaving \ndeveloped \nthe \nHonda \ninto \na \nchampionship \nmachine—Eddie \nthrew \nthe \nGP \ncommunity \na \ncurveball, \nsurprising \nmany \nby \nmoving \nback \nto \nYamaha \nfor \nthe \n1990 \nseason. \nWith \nRainey \nnow \nat \nthe \ntop \nof \nhis \ngame \nin \nhis \nthird \nseason, \nKenny \nRoberts’ \nteam \nlooked \nfearsome. \nUnfortunately, \ninjuries \nwould \ncurtail \nmuch \nof  \nthe \nfirst \nhalf \nof  \nLawson's \nseason. \n\n98 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nThe  \nmisery \nbegan \nwhen \nhe  \nbroke \nhis  \nleft  \nankle \nat  \nthe  \nseason \nopener \nat \nSuzuka. \nHe \nwould \nsuffer \nan \neven \nworse \ninjury \nto \nhis \nright \nankle \nat \nLaguna \nSeca. \nWayne \nRainey \ndescribes \nwhat \nhappened: \n“I \nremember \nhis \nfront \nbrake \npads \nfell \nout \nin \nqualifying. \nMy \ndad \nwas \nstanding \nnext \nto \nthe \npit \nwall \nas \nwe \nwere \nqualifying, \nand \nhe \nsaw \nsomething \nland \nnext \nto \nhim. \nIt \nwas \nbrake \npads, \nand \nthey \nwere \nEddie’s. \nHe \ngrabbed \nthe \nbrake \ngoing \ninto \nthe \nAndretti \nHairpin, \nand \nthere \nwere \nno \nbrakes. \nHe \ncrashed \nand \nhit \nthe \nwall, \ncrushed \nhis \nankle.” \nMeanwhile, Rainey won three of the first  four Grands Prix on  his way \nto the title. Lawson returned for the second half of the season and showed \nhimself still  capable of consistent performances, taking a  long series of \nseconds and thirds. His  seventh place in  the  standings was his  worst \nresult by far. In hindsight, his move back to Yamaha looked to have been a \nmistake. Kanemoto felt Lawson could have won a fifth title if he had stayed \nat Honda in  1990: \nOnce we  got the new  bike, I thought it was  really too  bad  [that he had \nleft], with all the  work Eddie did. Due to  Eddie’s input, most of the \nthings we  were looking for, and the things Eddie was  looking for, were \nbuilt into  the  following year’s bike. Trying to  get  all  of Eddie’s ideas \ninto  place with the  machine, it was  virtually impossible to  do  it in  a \nshort time. It’s  too  bad; the  following year it would have been a real \nadvantage for  him. We  were lucky enough to  win  the  championship \n[in 1989], but it would have been a whole lot easier the next year, with \nthe  1990 bike. \n“Yeah, \nif \nI \nhad \nany \nregrets, \nfor \nsure \nthat  \nwould \nbe \none,” \nLawson \nsays \ntoday. \n“In \nhindsight, \nI \nshould \nhave \nstayed. \nMick \n[Doohan] \nsaid \nthat \nwas \na \nbig \nstep \nup \nfrom \nthe \n1989 \nbike.” \nThe \n1990 \nseason \ndid  \nhave \nsome \nbright \nspots, \nmost \nnotably \nLawson's \nvictory \nat \nthe  \n8 \nHours \nof \nSuzuka, \nthe \nrace  \nthat \nmeans \nas \nmuch \nto \na \nJapanese \nmanufacturer \nas \nany \nGrand \nPrix \nwin. \nThe \nSteady \nEddie \nhallmark \nof \nfast \nand \nconsistent \nperformances \nwould \nundoubtedly \nhave \nmade \nhim \na \ngreat \nsuccess \nin \nendurance \nracing, \nhad \nhe \nchosen \nthat \npath. \n\n“STEADY \n...AND \nFAST”: \nEDDIE \nLAWSON \n99 \n“Eddie \nwas  \nsteady, \nand  \nthat’s \nwhy \nthey \ncalled \nhim  \nSteady \nEddie,” \nsays \nKenny \nRoberts. \n“He  \nknew \nwhat \nhe \nwanted \nwith \nthe \nbike \nand \nwhat \nit \nwas \ndoing; \nhed \ngive \nyou \nvery \ngood \nfeedback.” \nTHE CAGIVA YEARS \nAt \nthe  \nend  \nof \nthe  \n1990 \nseason, \nLawson \nleft \nYamaha \nto  \nride  \nfor \nstruggling \nItalian \nmanufacturer \nCagiva. \nLawson’s \nreasoning \nwas  \nsimple: \n“Well, \nthey \noffered \na \n/ot \nof \nmoney. \nI \nwas \nready \nto \nretire. \nI \nhad \nanother \nyear \nto \ngo \nwith \nKenny, \nbut \nI \ntold \nCagiva \nif \nthey \nwould \nbuy \nme \nout \nof \nmy \ncontract, \nI'd \nsign \nwith \nthem.’ \nThere \nwas \nfar \nmore \nto the \nstory \nthan \nmeets \nthe \neye, \nhowever, \nas  Kenny Roberts explains: \nLawson rode for me  at the end of his career, and we  moved him over  to \nCagiva. I had to  move John [Kocinski] up,  because he was world 250 \nGP  champion, so  I moved him up  into Eddie’s spot. Cagiva needed \nsomebody like  Eddie worse than Yamaha did. We  helped with the \ndevelopment of the  Cagiva. Nobody knows it, but  we  gave them a \nYamaha for a week—one of my race  bikes, the Grand Prix bike, the one \nthat Wayne rode. We pushed it into their factory, and I left a mechanic \nthere. They dynod it and tore  it apart, measured it all, and looked at it. \nI was  trying to help Cagiva because it was  to Yamaha's advantage that \nCagiva was  in  Grand Prix too;  there weren't a hell  of a lot of people \nin Grand Prix  at that  time. I asked Yamaha if they would mind if we \nwere to help Cagiva, and they said, “Okay.” So we  gave them a bike for \na week. That’s how they got their start; that’s what really started it all. \nWhen John went over to them, it was  good. The bike was  good. \nMotoGP \nrace \ndirector \nPaul \nButler, \nformerly \nwith \nthe  \nRoberts \nteam, \nconfirms \nthe  \nstory: \n“It \nwas  \na \ntime, \nnot  \ndissimilar \nto  \n[today], \nin \nthat  \nthey \nwanted \ncompetition. \nYamaha \nhas \nalways \nhad  \nan  \nopen \nmind; \nthey \nwanted \nto \nencourage \ncompetition, \nthey \nwanted \nto \nhelp. \nThey \nhad \nsympathy \nand \nadmiration \nfor \nwhat \nClaudio \nCastiglioni \nwas \ntrying \nto \ndo.’ \nGiven \nthe  \namount \nof \nmoney \nthat  \nteams \nspent \neach \nyear \nto  \ngain \nthe \nsmallest \nof \nadvantages, \nsuch \na \nmove \nwas  \nan  \nincredible \ngesture \non  \nYamaha's \n\n100 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \npart. \nButler \nagrees: \n“[Yamaha] \nwould \nprobably \ndeny \nit, \nbut  \nthose \nare  \nthe \nsort \nof \nthings \nthat \nthey \ndo \nprivately, \nand \nit \nis \none \nof \nthe \ncharacteristics \nthat \nis \nmost \nadmirable \nabout \nthem. \nYou \nhave \nto \nremember \nit \nwas \nthe \nfollowing \nyear \nthat \n[Yamaha] \nmade \nengines \navailable \nto \nteams. \nThey \nwere \nready \nto \nhelp \nthe \nclass \nsurvive.” \nAnd so  Cagiva’s GP  program was  given a  huge jump start, albeit in \nthe form of an  end  result rather than the years of experience and  develop- \nment customarily required to  reach that  point. Lawson would be the  key \nto  Cagiva’s plans—the Italians were counting on  his  experience to  fill  in \nthe gaps. The Italians didn’t take full advantage of the opportunity, though, \nas  Eddie explains: “I was there when it  [the GP  Yamaha] arrived [at the \ngarage]. We  looked at  every single thing. The  geometry was  really close \nbecause we  had all of [Yamaha's] numbers, but their engine was  incredibly \nheavy, and they didn’t build a Yamaha.” \nThe  1991 season began miserably, at least by Lawson's lofty standards. \nBut  after finishing fifth or  sixth in  the  first four races, the  four-time \nchampion had his breakout at Cagiva’s home race at Misano, taking a third \nplace. A  fourth at  Hockenheim and another fifth at  Austria confirmed \nthat the  Cagiva was not a  contender for  race wins, to  say nothing of \nDw NA \ncA \\GIVA \nLawson \non  \nthe  \nCagiva \nat  \nLaguna \nSeca \nin  \n1991. \nDMT \nImaging \n\n“STEADY \n...  \nAND \nFAST”: \nEDDIE \nLAWSON \nchampionships. \nLawson \ndid  \nmanage \nanother \nthird-place \nfinish \nin  \nthe \nFrench \nGP \nand \nfinished \nout \nthe \nyear \nsixth \nin \nthe \nchampionship. \nThe  \n1992 \nseason \nwould \nbe \nLawson's \nfinal \nGP \ncampaign. \nUnfortunately, \nCagivas \nresults \ndeteriorated \nfurther: \nLawson’s \noccasional \nsixth \nwas \na \nbetter-than-average \nplacing \nfor \nthe \nCagiva. \nOften, \nthe \nbike \nwas \na \nDNF \nor \noutside \nthe \ntop \n10. \nThe \nCagiva \nwas \nsimply \nno \nmatch \nfor \nthe \nbig-bang \nHonda \nengine, \nand \nthe \nfrustration \nfactor \nwas \nhigh. \nHowever, \nin \nthe  \nmidst \nof \nthis  \ndespair \ncame \nthe  \noccasional \nsurprising \nperformance. \nLawson \ntook \npole \nposition \nat Assen \nand later \ntook \na \nwin \nin \nchanging \nconditions \nat \nthe \nHungaroring \nin \nHungary. \nLawson \nhad \nrestarted \nfrom \nthe \nred \nflag with \na \ncut \nslick, \nwhich \nproved \nperfect \nfor \nthe \nconditions \nas \nhe went \nthrough \nthe \nfield \nto \nhis only \nwin \nof \nthe season. \nIt \nwould \nbe \nEddie \nLawson's \nlast Grand \nPrix \nvictory, \nand \na \nfitting \none \nat \nthat: \nThroughout \nhis \ncareer, \nLawson \nhad \nexcelled \nin wet \nconditions, \nwhich \nmight \nsurprise \nsome, \ngiven \nhis upbringing \nin \narid \nSouthern \nCalifornia. \nThe 1992 Hungarian Grand Prix was a  special day  in  many ways, \nas  Lawson shared his  final podium with polesitter Doug Chandler and \nRandy Mamola. With Schwantz in  fourth and  Rainey in  fifth, it was  a \ntop-five sweep for  the  United States, making that day in  Hungary the \ngreatest American sweep in GP  history. “To  be honest with you, yeah, it \nwas  fun, Lawson recalls. “We won a  Grand Prix, but  it was  under such \nspecial conditions that you  can't say  that’s a  win.

So when I finally got a shot to  race  Lawson, I thought .  .  .  this  is \nit for  me,  this  is the  big time. Unfortunately, they showed up  with a \nYamaha that  was just a little bit  too  fast  for us  that  year. I remember \ncoming off NASCAR turn four leading it, and  Lawson went by me  on \nthe high side. I was  thinking, “Uh  oh, I hope he’s nowhere around me \non  the last lap.” \nTerry \nVance \nwas \namazed \nby \nLawson's \nfocus \nthroughout \nthe \nevent: \nLawson \ncame \nin \nfor \nthe \nlast \npit \nstop—I \nthink \nwe  \nwere \nrunning \nsecond \nor \nthird—and \nhe \nhad \nsome \nground \nto \nmake \nup. \nI \nremember \nlooking \nat \nhis \nface \nwhen \nthey \nwere \nfueling \nthe \nbike, \nand \nI \nthought, \n“Man, \nthis \nguy \nis \nintense.” \nIt \nwas \nlike \nhe \nwas \ntotally \nfocused \non \nhis \nmission. \nHe \nwent \nout,  \nreeled \nthem \nin, \nand  \npassed \nRussell \nright \nat  \nthe  \nfinish. \nHe  \nreally \n\n“STEADY \n...  \nAND \nFAST”: \nEDDIE \nLAWSON \nmade \nthat  \nhappen. \nThe \nbike \nwas  \nvery \nfast, \nbut \nwithout \nhim  \non  \nit, \nthat \nwin  \nwouldn't \nhave \nhappened \nfor \nYamaha \nthat \nyear \nfor \nsure. \nScott \nRussell \ncontinues \nthe \nstory: \nWe  \ntraded \nthe \nlead \nback \nand  \nforth. \nI \nwanted \nto \nbeat \nhim  \nthrough \nthe \ninfield, \nbut  \nwhen \nyou  \nhit \nthe \nbanking, \nit’s \nthe  \nmotorcycle’s \njob \nat \nthat \npoint. \nBut \nSteady \nEddie, \nhe \nknew \nwhat \nwas \ngoing \nto \nhappen \nat \nthe \nend, \nand \nhe \nbeat \nme \nto the \nline. \nHe \nlooked \nat \nme \nafter \nI \ncrossed \nthe \nline, \npointed \nat \nme, \nand \nhad \nhis \nfinger \nup: \nnumber \none. \nTo \nlose \nto him \nwas \nlike winning. What a ride. \nSadly, the race  was  marred by the fatal crash of Ducati racing legend Jimmy \nAdamo, forever adding a tragic element to the triumph of Lawson’s return. \nLawson returned to  Daytona for a final time in  1994, taking third \nbehind Russell and Troy Corser despite early tire problems. Eddie Lawson \nwould finish his  motorcycle racing career later that year, running the \n8 Hours of Suzuka one last time for Yamaha. \nFROM TWO WHEELS TO  FOUR \nMoving on  from motorcycles, Lawson soon turned his considerable focus \nto  a  (slightly) safer form of racing: Indy cars. In  1993, Lawson began his \nopen-wheel racing career running in the  Indy Lights category, the feeder \nseries \nfor \nthe \nChampionship \nAuto \nRacing \nTeams \n(CART) \nWorld \nSeries. \nThe \nearly \n1990s \nwere \nthe \nheyday \nfor \nCART, \nwhen \nthe \nseries \nrivaled \nthe \nFormula \nOne \nWorld \nChampionship \nin \nterms \nof \nprestige \nand \ndriving \ntalent, \nfeaturing \nsome \nof \nthe \nworld’s \ntop \nracers, \nincluding \nEmerson \nFittipaldi, \nNigel \nMansell, \nMario \nAndretti, \nAl \nUnser \nJr., \nand \nMichael \nAndretti. \nFor \na \ndriver, \nthere \nwas \nno \ngreater \nchallenge \nthan \nthe \nCART \nWorld \nSeries, \nwith \nits \nmix \nof \nstreet \ncourses, \nroad \ncourses, \nshort \novals, \nand \nsuperspeedways. \nEddie \nLawson \nrecalls \nhis \nbrief \ntime \ndriving \nin \nCART: \nI \nwas  \ndriving \nfor \nRick \nGalles \nin \nchamp \ncar.  \nI \njust \ndid  \na \nhalf \na \nseason. \nWe  \n[the \nteam] \ndidn’t \nhave \nthe  \nright \ncombination \nof \nthings; \nwe  \nhad \na \n103 \n\nLola \nwhen \nwe  \nshould \nhave \nhad  \na  \nReynard. \nWe  \nhad  \nGoodyears \nwhen \nwe \nshould \nhave \nhad \nFirestones. \nIt \nwas \na \nbad \nthing, \nso \nabout \nhalfway \nthrough, \nI \nsaid \nthat \nthis \nwasn’t \nquite \nwhat \nI \nhad \nin \nmind, \nso \nI \nbailed \nout  of there. \nVeteran \nopen-wheel \njournalist \nRobin \nMiller \noffers \nan  \nopinion \non  \nLawsonss \nill-fated \nCART \ncareer: \nLawson got screwed over by Galles. He was a hell  of a lot better than \nthey ever  gave him a car  for.  He was  so  tough on  himself. He  ran  fifth \nor  sixth in the rain  at Detroit. I waited out  there for him  and told  him \nthat  was  a  hell  of a  job he did.  He  said, “Nah .  .  .  should have been \nthird.” I remember Owen Snyder, his  chief mechanic, said that they \nreally screwed over that guy; they never gave him the right stuff. Eddie \nhad the worst combination. \nWith no  chance of success, Lawson would compete for  only a  partial \nseason—11 races. His best finish of sixth place was a far cry from his hopes \nto match John Surtees’ feat  of winning World Championships on  both two \nand four wheels. \nAN AMERICAN LEGEND \nEddie Lawson continues to  race  on  four wheels, only now he competes in \nSuperKart in a machine prepared by Wayne Rainey’s father, Sandy.

We \ncalled it Checkered Flag Blues, because it would never see the checkered \nflag, because it would throw a rod.  I tried different style rods, I tried \ndifferent clearances, I had a handmade rod made out of Kryptonite... \nit went about twelve laps. \nWayne remembers the challenges of being the only rider struggling with a \nSuzuki in a flat track world dominated by other brands: “The thing would \nrev  so  high that you  couldn't shift it; the  transmission wouldn't let you \nshift. I was  getting good at catching seizures. We  would take it apart and \nsee  signs where the pistons were starting to crack before they failed. I was \nracing with Eddie Lawson, Mike Tidwell, and  Mike Minnig, and  they all \nrode Kawasakis and Yamahas.” \nThis experience would come in  handy years later when Wayne was \nriding the  temperamental 500cc GP  bikes that required keeping a  finger \nover the clutch lever as  a survival mechanism. \nSandy \nRainey \nsums \nup \nthat  \nparticular \nera  \nfor \nTeam \nRainey: \n“As \nEddie \n[Lawson] \nsaid, \n‘We \nused \nto \nbe \nreally \nscared \nof \nyou \nguys \nwhen \nyou  \nshowed \nup, \nbut \nthen \nwe \nlearned \nthat \nwe \nonly \nneeded \nto \nbe \nscared \nearly, \nbecause \nlater \non \nwe \ndidn’t \nhave \nto \nworry \nabout \nyou. \n” \nTaking, \nas \nalways, \nthe \nroad \nless \ntraveled, \nthe \nnext  \nwindmill \nthe \nRaineys \nchose \nto  \ntilt  \nat  \nwas  \nHonda’s \nfirst \ncompetition \ntwo-stroke \nracer, \nthe  \nnew \n125cc \nElsinore. \nWayne \nexplains: \n“I \nwas  \nthe \nonly \nguy \non  \na \nHonda \nand  \nwas \n109 \n\n110 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nthe  \nfirst  \none  \nto  \nhave \na  \ntwelve-pedal \nreed \non  \nit.  \n[We  \nused] \ntwo  \nsix-pedal \nreeds \n[from \nmy \ndad’s] \ngo-kart \ndays. \nWe \nhad \na \nspecial \nchrome-moly \nframe, \ndisc \nbrakes... \nI \ncould \ndrag \nrace \nthe \n250s \nand \nstay \nright \nwith \nthem.” \nSandy \nelaborates: \n“That \nwas  \nanother \nthing \nI \ntook \nto  \nthe  \nlimit. \nI \nkept \nblowing \nthe \ncylinder \noff \nthe \ncases. \n[Honda \nused] \nfour \nbolts \nto \nhold \nthe \ncylinder \non. \nI \nadded \nthree \nmore. \nI \ncouldn't \nkeep \nhead \ngaskets \nin \nit \neither. \nI \nmachined \nit for \nan \nO-ring \nusing \na piece \nof \ncopper \nwire.” \nIt \nwasn't \nlong \nbefore \nWayne \nmoved \nup \nto \nrace  \nthe \n250s, \nwith \na \nBultaco \nthat \nSandy \nhad \nconverted \nfrom \nright \nshift \nto \nleft \nshift. \n“I \nbuilt \nhim \na \n250 \nBultaco,” \nSandy \nexplains. \n“Because \nI had \nstarted \non \nthem, \nI \nthought, \n‘He has \nto ride \na \nBultaco’ \nI \nmade \nmy \nown \nhemispherical \nheads \nand \neverything.” \nWhile riding this  bike, Wayne came to  the  attention of the legendary \ntuner Shell Thuet. Sandy continues the  story: \nWe  ran  that  for about a year until we  made the  deal with Shell Thuet \nand John Reed. They had a 360 short track program in the AMA. They \nwere changing the  class back to  250, so  I told them, “How’s about | \ntake your chassis and  make a  template to  put  the  250  in?  Then you \ncan  go 250  or  360.” They said, “You got a  deal.” I bought the  engine, \nand  they had  a  brand-new chassis, brand-new wheels .  .  .  our  first \nexperience with everything brand new. That was  factory to  us. \nWayne recalls this first big break: “Shell Thuet and John Reed saw me  and \nsaid they would give me a short track bike if 'd come race Ascot. [They \nprovided] all  the. parts I needed, anything I had  to  pay  to  get  there like \nentry fees, gas... It was  huge.” \nSandy \ndescribes \nhow \nthe  \nRaineys \nmade \nthe  \nmost \nof \nthe  \nopportunity: \n“We \ngot \nthat \n250 \nrunning \nso \nwell \nthat \nWayne \nwould \nrun \nit \nat \nTulare \nin \nthe \nopen \nclass \nand \nwin \nagainst \n650 \nTriumphs, \n750 \nHarley-Davidsons, \nand \nWayne \nwould \nbeat \nthem \non \nthat \n250 \nShell-framed \nYamaha. \nIt \nwas \nthe \nonly \ntime \nin \nall \nmy \nyears \nthat \nI \ngot \nprotested \n. \n.. \nfor \nthat \nmotor.” \nIn  \n1978, \nWayne \nwould \nrace  \nall \nover \nthe \ncountry, \ntaking \n50 \nwins \nfrom \n52 \nstarts \nand \nfinishing \nsecond \nat \nthe \nAscot \nJunior \nInvitational. \nHe \nwas  \na \nyoung \nman \nin \na \nhurry, \nabout \nto \nswitch \nto \nProfessional \nclass, \nracing \nthe \nYamaha. \n\nNO \nSURRENDER: \nWAYNE \nRAINEY \nWayne \nRainey \nrecalls \nthat \nperiod, \nwhich \nwas  \na \ntime \nwhen \nthe \nYamaha \nwas \nnot \nthe \nbike \nto \nhave: \nAt \neighteen, \nin \nmy \nrookie \nyear \nas  \nExpert, \nShell, \nwho \nhad \nbeen \ntraveling \nevery \nyear \nbefore \nthat, \ndecided \nto \nstop \ntraveling. \nI \nwas \nracing \nProfessional \nagainst \nguys \nlike \nJay \nSpringsteen \nand \nGary \nScott, \nand \nI \nremember \nall \nthose \nguys \ntelling \nme \nthat \nI \nneed \nto \nget \noff \nthe \nYamaha \nand \n“get \non \na \nHarley. \nYou \ndon't \nhave \nShell \nhere \nwith \nyou \nand \nare \ntrying \nto \ndo \nthis \nall \nby \nyourself” \nMy \nfirst \nnational \nrace \nwas \nthe \nHouston \nAstrodome \n[in \n1979]. \nI \nthink \nI \ngot \neighth \nplace. \nI only \nmade \none \nmore \nnational \nafter \nthat \nwith \nthe Yamaha, and I think my confidence started to go a little bit. \nFor his second season, Rainey made the switch to the Harley-Davidson, riding \nChris Armstrong’s bike. It was  a hand-to-mouth existence. “We were racing \nweek to  week, living out  of the  van,” Wayne remembers. “We knew some \npeople back in  Indianapolis, and  we  could stay at  their house. We  weren't \nracing for the money; it’s just what we  did. You didn't race  to get rich” \nFor  1980, Rainey was  to  get his  next big opportunity, and  it came at \nthe expense of Eddie Lawson. Lawson was  going to be racing the new  250 \npiston-port Kawasaki MX engine in flat track racing in an aftermarket chassis \nby Viper. However, Lawson dislocated his hip and was  unable to ride. \nWayne explains the situation: “They asked [Eddie] if he knew anybody \nwho could ride this bike in the short track nationals, and Eddie mentioned \nme.  I won the consolation race  the first time out on  this thing, and it really \nexcited Kawasaki. I started racing all over  the Midwest. Back in those days, \nyou  could race seven times a week, and we  were winning more and more \non  it.” \nRainey \nwas \nstarting \nto  \ndabble \nwith \nroad \nracing, \ndoing \nsome \nAFM \n(American \nFederation \nof \nMotorcyclists) \namateur \nracing \nwhen \ntime \nallowed: \n“Kawasaki \nthen \nasked \nme \nif \nI \nwanted \nto \nride \nthe \nroad \nrace \nbike. \nI \nended \nup \ngoing \nto \nrace \nAFM \nat \nRiverside \nand \nWillow \nSprings \nin \nthe \n550cc \nand \n750cc \nclasses. \nI \nwon \nfifteen \nof \nthe \nsixteen \nraces \nand \nset \ntrack \nrecords \nat \neach \none.’ \nWayne's \nperformances \ncaught \nthe  \nattention \nof \nmany, \nand  \nhe \nreceived \nan  \noffer \nthat \nhe \nclearly \ncould \nnot  \nrefuse: \nV1 \n\n112 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nKawasaki \nasked \nme  \nif \nI \nwanted \nto  \nrace \nat  \nLoudon \n[New \nHampshire] \nin \na \nprofessional \nAMA \nnational \nroad \nrace. \nI \ngrabbed \na \nbuddy, \nand \nwe \ndrove \nfrom \nCalifornia \nto \nNew \nHampshire \nand \nrode \nthe \n250 \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nthere. \nThe \nNovice \nrace \nwas \nin \nthe \nrain, \nand \nI \nwas \nout \nthere \nin \nmy \ndirt \ntrack \nleathers \nand \nboots. \nI \nended \nup \nwinning \nthe \nrace \nby \ntwenty \nseconds. \nSo \nthe \nnext \nday, \nGary \nMathers \nof \nKawasaki \noffered \nme \na contract to  race Superbikes for  1982. \nRob \nMuzzy \nsums \nit  \nup:  \n“I  \nsuppose \nthat \nwas \nwhen \neveryone \nsuddenly \nrealized that  Rainey was  someone to reckon with.” \nSUPERBIKE RACER \nWayne Rainey had  made a  big career move, and  he  had done it  very \nquickly: “Eddie was  the  reigning Superbike champion from 1981, and  I \nwent from fooling around in club racing to becoming Lawson's teammate \non  the  1025cc Kawasaki. [That bike] was a monster.” \nRob Muzzy elaborates: \nAnd that was  the good news. Eddie's bike was  in a higher state of tune. \nOne of the  things when you  have multiple riders on  a  team, a  rider \nalways thinks the other guy has a better bike. In this case, it was  a fact. \nWe were doing tire testing at Daytona, so this would be early in the year \nfor Wayne. Wayne put in a zillion laps, and he really had improved. We \nsaid, “Do  you  want to  try Eddie’s bike?” Well, he climbed onto it and \nwent about a second and  a half slower, saying, “Nah, I’m  not  ready for \nthis  thing.” The  closer you  take it to  that  fine  edge, the  more capable \nthe guy has to be to  ride  the things. \nWayne \nRainey \nwent \non  \nto \nwin  \nhis \nfirst  \nSuperbike \nrace \nat  \nLoudon \nin  \n1982, \neventually \nfinishing \nthird \nin \nthe \npoints \nchase \nbehind \nLawson \nand \nsecond- \nplace \nMike \nBaldwin. \nHis \nfine \nperformance \nearned \nhim \nAMA \nRookie \nof \nthe \nYear \nhonors. \nThe \n1983 \nseason \nbrought \na  \nrules \nchange \nto  \n750cc, \na  \nfull  \nfactory \nonslaught \nfrom \nthe  \nnew \nwater-cooled \nHonda \nV-4, \nand \nbig \nchanges \nin \n\nNO SURRENDER: WAYNE RAINEY \nthe  \nclass. \nWith \nLawson \nmoving \non  \nto  \nGP  \nracing \nfor  \n1983, \nRainey’s \nnew \nteammate \nfor  \n1983 \nwould \nbe \nWes  \nCooley. \nSteve \nJohnson \nand \nMark \nJohnson \nwere \nput  \nin  \ncharge \nof \npreparing \nRainey’s \nbike. \nIt \nwould \nnot \nalways \nbe \nan \neasy \njob. \nMark \nJohnson \nrecalls \nan \nearly-season \nconversation: \nGary Mathers called us  in  the  office and said, “We've hired Wes \n[Cooley] to  replace Eddie.

It \nwas  better to get out  and regroup.” \nA TOUGH START IN GRAND PRIX \nSuperbike Champion Rainey found his career unexpectedly on  hold, and \nhe began to explore his options. What initially looked like a setback turned \nout  to be excellent timing: Kenny Roberts was  putting together a 250  GP \nteam for 1984, and the three-time world champion selected Rainey to ride \nfor him. Wayne Rainey was  going racing in Grand Prix. \nThe  team started out  with a  small-budget effort at  Daytona before \nmoving on  to  the  Grand Prix season. Rainey explains: “We came to \nDaytona—a couple of the  guys came over from Europe [Sito Pons and \nMartin Wimmer] to run  it as  a tune-up race—and we  blew their doors off \nwith \nthis \n250 \nYamaha. \nAfter \nthat, \nwe \nwent \nto \nKyalami, \nSouth \nAfrica, \nfor \nthe \nfirst \nrace. \nThe \nonly \nthing \nI \nknew \nabout \nGP \nracing \nwas \nlooking \nat \nthe \ntrack \nmaps that  Kenny gave me  to see  which way to go.” \nRainey \nrecalls \nthat  \nthe \nlow-budget \nteam \nlacked \neven \nthe  \nspare \nwheels \non  which to  mount a  set  of rain tires: \nKenny \ntold \nme  \nto  \ngo  \nout  \non  \nslicks. \nBarry \nSheene \ncame \nby \nand  \nsaid, \nWhat \nare  \nyou \ndoing \ngoing \nout  \nthere \non  \nslicks? \nIt’s \nraining.’ \nIn \npractice, \n\nNO SURRENDER: WAYNE RAINEY \nthe \ntrack \nstarted \ndrying \na \nlittle \nbit. \nThere \nwas  \na \ndry \nline, \nso \nI \njust \nstayed \non \nthat. \n[Later \non] \nI \nlocked \nup \nthe \nfront \nbrake \nand \ncrashed \nin \nthe \nfirst \nturn, \ntaking \nout \na \nfew \nriders, \ncrashing \ninto \na \nbig \nheap. \nI \nremember \nthis \nVenezuelan \nyelling \nand \nscreaming \nat \nme \nin \nSpanish. \nI \ndidn’t \neven \nknow \nwhat \nlanguage \nhe \nwas \nspeaking. \nIt \nwas \nmy \nfirst \nrace \noutside \nof \nthe \nUnited \nStates. \nNobody \nknew \nwho \nI \nwas \nbefore, \nbut \nthey \nremem- \nbered who I was after that. \nThey \nalso \nremembered \nWayne \nRainey \nas \nthe \nguy \nwho \ncouldn't \nget \nhis \nmotor- \ncycle \nto \nstart: \n“I qualified \nfourth \nor \nfifth, \non \nthe \nfront \nrow, \nbut the \nproblem \nwas \nthat \nit was \na \npush \nstart. \nId \nnever \ndone \nit; \nI \npushed, \nlet the \nclutch \nout \n. \n. \n. \nbikes \n[were] \ngoing \nby \nme... \n. \nI jumped \non, hoping \nit \nwould \nstart; \nit \ndidn’t. \nBy \nthe \ntime \nI \ngot \nit \ngoing, \nI \nwas \ntwenty \nseconds \nbehind \nthe pace \ncar.” \nThis problem was  to  ruin Rainey’s first  GP  season, as  he struggled to \nget the bike to  fire  on  the  line. The  second race of the season, at Misano, \nprovided more of the  same: “My bike seized in final qualifying. So with \nfifteen minutes left, I got  my  teammate Alan Carter's bike, so  I could \nqualify with his. I ended up qualifying fourth.” Rainey was  allowed to race, \nand  again he couldnt get the bike to fire up, leaving him [to start] behind \nthe pace car  again. He managed a surprising result anyway: \nI didn’t know what place I was  in, what lap I was  on,  where my  pit \nboard was  ...  The  next thing I know the  checkered flag was  out. I \ncome off the track, and  this big guard is making everyone go through \nand points to me,  telling me,  “That way.” I’m thinking, “What did I do \nnow?” I thought I was  in trouble for something.

Rainey swept the F1  and 250  GP races at Road America and Sears \nPoint, and he also won the 250  GPs  at Mid-Ohio and Kent, finishing third \nin 250  GP points for the season. Rainey describes his  1985 season: \nComing back to  the  AMA with a  team that was racing against the \nfactories, I had  done well  enough that  year to  get Honda’ attention. | \nhad my eye on  Europe also and wanted to ride  500 two-strokes. So they \nprovided me with a three-cylinder 500 to race  in the Formula One class. \nThat year in Formula One, you  could also race  Superbikes in that  class. \nThe  four-stroke was  like  cutting butter, it was  so  easy. The  two-stroke \nwas  much more difficult to  ride.

There was about a  70-mile-per-hour difference in  speed \n[between us  and  the lapped rider]; there’s just no  way, you  cant park \nit. So, they threw both Kevin and  I out,  and it cost  me  the champion- \nship.

I said \nsomething about, “Yeah .  .  .  the pressure must have gotten to him.’ So he \nsaid something about how I never would have caught him. \nRAINEY VERSUS SCHWANTZ \nThe \nbudding \nrivalry \ncontinued \nto  \ngrow \nas  \nthe  \ntwo \nwent \noverseas \nto \ncompete \nin \nthe \nTransatlantic \nMatch \nRaces. \nStretching \nthe \nconcept \nof \n“team” \nto \nthe \nlimit, \nthe \nAmericans \nwere \nled \nby \nRainey \nand \nSchwantz. \nFor \nthe \n1987 \nraces, \nRainey \nbrought \nthe \nmomentum \nfrom \nhis \nrecent \nDaytona \nwin, \nbut \nSchwantz \nhad \nthe \nconfidence \nthat \ncomes \nwith \nbeing \nthe \ndefending \nindividual \nmatch \nraces \nchampion. \n“He \nwas \nout  \nto \nget \nwhat \nI \nhad,” \nRainey \nry \n\n118 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nrecalls, \n“and \nI \nwanted \nto  \nmake \nsure \nhe \ndidn't \nhave \nit.  \nIf \nyou  \nwon \nall \nnine \nraces \nover \nthree \ndays, \nyou \nwould \nwin \n100,000 \npounds \nsterling.” \nIt \nhas \nbeen \nsaid \nthat  \nthere \nwas  \na \ndeal  \nbetween \nthe \ntwo  \nAmericans \nthat \nwhoever \nwon \nrace \none \nwould \nget \nthe \nfree \npass, \nand \nthe \nAmericans \ncould \nthen \nsplit \nthe \nbooty \nat \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \nseries. \nRainey \nwasn't \ngame \nand \ndenied \nthat \nit \nwas \never \na \nconsideration: \n“The \nproblem \nwas \nthat \nyou \ncannot \nbase \neverything \noff \none \nguy. \nYou \ndon’t \nknow \nif \nhe’s \ngoing \nto \nfall \noff, \nand \nKevin \ndidn’t \nhave \nthe \ngreatest \nreputation \nat that \ntime \nof \nstaying \non.” \nPayout scenarios aside, Kevin Schwantz took the  win in  race one  at \nBrands Hatch. With £100,000 at  stake, the  gloves—if they were ever on \nin the  first  place—came off.  Race two  could be best described as  savage, \nas  Schwantz recounts: “I come in there leading on  the last lap and  get just \nabout down to  the  line, and  I get hit.  It slowed me  down enough going \nsideways across the oil dry that going down Paddock, but I was  able to get \na run  back on  him to get past him .  .  .  but then I out-broke myself getting \ninto  there, ran a little wide, and he got back by me.” \nRainey recalls the  incident from his  perspective: “Coming into that \nblind turn one, hed left the door open and I stuffed it in there. He turned \ndown, we  made contact, and I knocked him off the  track. I didn’t want him \nto win  those races.” \nSchwantz continues the story: \nThere's not  but  one  other place to  pass, and  that’s the  left-right into \nClearways. At  that point I jumped the  curb, went up  the  inside of \nhim, and  laid: some rubber down the  right side  of his  leathers.

However, \nby season's end, everyone was  talking about Schwantz, who finished the \ncampaign by winning five of the last six races. \nTHE RIVALRY GOES GLOBAL \nHaving proven his worth with an  AMA Superbike Championship, Rainey \nwas  ready to return to GP racing. He had thought Honda would offer him \na slot on  its GP team, but HRC wanted Rainey to stay in the U.S. Superbike \nseries. Once again, the  timing was  right for  Rainey and  Kenny Roberts, \nwho had decided to let Randy Mamola and Mike Baldwin go for 1988. And \nso  Rainey made his  return to  GP  racing for Kenny Roberts’ Lucky Strike \nYamaha team, but this time in the premier class alongside new  teammate \nKevin \nMagee. \nRainey \nwas \nnot \nthe \nonly \nrider \nto \nmake \nhis \nfull-time \ndebut \nin \nthe \ntop \nclass: \nSchwantz \nwas \nalso \nmaking \nthe \njump \nfor \nSuzuki. \nThe  \nfirst  \nrace \nof \nthe  \n1988 \nseason \nwas  \nheld \nat  \nSuzuka, \na  \ntrack \nRainey \nhad \nnever \nseen \nbefore. \nHis \nfirst \npractice \nsession \nas \na \n500cc \nrider \nwould \nbe \nmemorable \nfor \nall \nthe \nwrong \nreasons. \nKnowing \nthat \nSchwantz \nhad \nrecently \nwon \nthe \n8 \nHours \nof \nSuzuka, \nRainey \ndecided \nto \nfollow \nthe \nTexan \nto \nlearn \na \nfew \ntricks: \n“The \nfirst \nlap, \nhe \nknows \nwhere \nhe’s \ngoing \nand \njust \ndisappears. \nSo \nI'm \ngoing \ninto \nthis \ncorner, \nand \nI \nlose \nthe \nfront \nand \ncrash—on \nmy \nout \nlap. \nIn \nfront \nof \nall \nthese \nteams \n. \n. \n. \nhere’s \nRainey \nwith \nthis \nbike \nall \ntore \nup \nand \ncrashed.’ \n119 \n\n120 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nSchwantz \nwould \npour \nmore \nsalt  \nin  \nRainey’s \nwounds \nby \nwinning \nthe \nrace. \nThe \nTexan \ntook \nthe \nlead \nin \nthe \nchampionship \nheading \nback \nhome \nto \nLaguna \nSeca \nfor \nthe \nfirst \nUnited \nStates \nGrand \nPrix \nheld \nsince \nthe \n1960s. \n“Tt  \nwas  \nthe  \nworst \nthing \nthat \ncould \nhave \nhappened,” \nRainey \nrecalls. \n“Kevin \nwon \nthe \nfirst \nrace \nin \nJapan. \nI \nwas \ndevastated.” \nSchwantz \ntook \nmore \nthan \na \nlittle \ndelight \nin \nthe \nsituation: \n“He \n[Wayne] \ngets \nback, \nand \nevery \npaper \nis \nsaying \n‘Schwantz \nwins \nJapan. \nI \nthought \nhe \nwas \ngoing \nto \nkill \nhimself” \nBut  Rainey quickly bounced back at  Laguna, taking his  first 500cc \npole and  finishing fourth behind winner Lawson. Rainey no  doubt took \nsome satisfaction in  finishing ahead of Schwantz in  the  race. However, \nWayne's confidence suffered yet  another blow when his  teammate, \nMagee, won the  next GP  at  Jarama. As  the  season went on,  Rainey \nfound himself just off  the  winning pace. In  most races, he  rode well \nenough to  finish near the  top  (five podiums in  nine midseason races), \nbut  that  first  win  continued to  elude him, and  his  frustration was  made \nworse at  the  Nurburgring, when he  finished second behind a victorious \nSchwantz. It was  only a matter of time before Rainey’s breakthrough win, \nhowever, and  he  duly earned it  in  August at  the  British Grand Prix at \nDonington Park. \nAs  noted in  the  previous chapter, the  1988 title race was mostly a \ntwo-way fight between Eddie Lawson and Wayne Gardner. But the lessons \nRainey had  learned in  Superbike paid off in his  first Grand Prix season: \nHis  consistent finishes added up  to  third in  the  World Championship. \n(Schwantz finished eighth.) \nLawsons \nswitch \nto  \nHonda \ngave \nRainey \nthe \nchance \nto  \nstep \ninto  \nthe \ntop \nYamaha \nslot. \nHe  \ntook \nfull  \nadvantage \nof \nthe  \nopportunity, \nstepping \nup  \nhis \ngame \nanother \nnotch. \nThe  \nseason \nbegan \nwith \na \ntightly \nfought \nbattle \nat  \nSuzuka. \nRainey \ncame \nout \non  \nthe \nlosing \nend \nto \nSchwantz. \nThe \nresults \nmight \nhave \nbeen \ndifferent \nif \nnot \nfor \na \nmistake \nby \nRainey: \n“I \nwas \nright \nbehind \nKevin, \nand \nnear \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \nrace \nI \nsaw \nL2 \n[on \nmy \npit \nboard]. \nThere \nwas \nreally \nonly \none \nlap \nto \ngo. \nI \nwas \ngoing \nto \nset \nhim \nup; \nI \ncame \nby \nand \nsaw \nthe \ncheckered \nflag \nwaving. \nI \njust \ncouldn't \nbelieve \nit, \nthat \nI \nhad \nmade \na \nmistake \nlike \nthat.” \n\nNO SURRENDER: WAYNE RAINEY \nAt \nthe \nsecond \nround, \nheld \nat  \nPhillip \nIsland \nin \nAustralia, \nit \nwas  \nWayne \nGardner \nwho \nnarrowly \ndefeated \nRainey \nfor  \nthe  \nwin. \nRound \nthree \nwas \nthe \nUSGP \nat \nLaguna \nSeca. \nRainey \nwould \nnot \nbe \ndenied \nvictory \non \nhome \nsoil. \nHe \nstarted \nfrom \npole \nand \nwon \nthe \nrace, \nfollowed \nby \nSchwantz \nand \nLawson \nto \nmake \nan \nall-American \npodium. \nSadly, \nthe \njoyous \ncelebration \nwould \nbe \ncut \nshort \nbecause \nLawson \nnever \narrived, \nhaving \nbeen \nat \nthe \nscene \nof \na \nterrible \ncrash \non \nthe \ncool-down \nlap. \nRainey’s \nbest \nfriend, \nBubba \nShobert, \nwas \nseriously \ninjured \nin \nthe \naccident. \nMeanwhile, \nGardner \nhad \nalso \ncrashed \nand \nbroken \nhis \nleg \nduring \nthe \nrace, \neliminating \nhim \nfrom \nthe \nchampionship \nequation. \nThe  rest  of the  season was  a  three-way fight between the  American \nsuperstars. The importance of consistency was  proved yet  again by the \nfact that Schwantz won six  races but  finished just fourth in  the  title \nchase. Rainey, on  the  other hand, took half as  many victories but  never \nfinished off of the podium. It would come down to  Rainey’s one  DNF—a \ncrash in  Sweden—to leave the  door open for  Lawson (four wins and \nonly one  finish off the  podium) to  take his  fourth World Championship \nfor Honda. \nWORLD CHAMPION \nYamaha brought Lawson back for  1990, giving the  team an  impressive \nrider lineup. “Marlboro said, “We want a  super team,” \n“The previous season they had [Alain] Prost and [Ayrton] Senna in \nFormula \nOne, \nso  \nKenny \nhired \nEddie \nand  \nI, \nnumbers \none  \nand  \ntwo  \nin \nthe \nRainey explains. \nworld... but Eddie was  coming to  my team.” \nKenny \nRoberts \ndescribes \nRainey \nat \nthat \ntime, \na \nyoung \nman \non  \nthe \ncusp \nof \nhis \nfirst \nworld \ntitle: \n“Wayne \nwas \nvery \neager, \nvery \nserious. \nBack \nthen \nhe \nwas \nnot  \nquite \nas  \ntechnical \nas  \nEddie, \nbut  \nhe  \nhad  \nan  \nextreme \namount \nof \ntalent. \nWe \nhaven't \nhad \na \nrider \nlike \nthat \nsince, \nto \nbe \nhonest.’ \nOne \nsuspects \nthe \nteam \nchemistry \nbetween \nRainey \nand \nLawson \nwas \nnot \nas \ncaustic \nas \nthe \nProst-Senna \nrelationship, \nbut \nboth \nriders \nwere \naccustomed \nto \nbeing \nnumber \none. \nThe \nsituation \nwas \nquickly \nresolved \nin \nRainey’s \nfavor \nafter \nhe \nwon \nthree \nof \nthe \nopening \nfour \nraces \nwhile \nLawson’s \ntitle  \ndefense \nwas  besieged with injuries. \n12h \n\nGRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nWith \nLawson \neliminated \nfrom \ncontention, \nit \nwould \nbe \na \nstraight \nfight \nbetween \nthe  \nsport’s \ntwo  \nyoung \nAmerican \nrivals, \nRainey \nand  \nSchwantz. \n“After \nEddie \ngot \nhurt, \nwe \nrealized \nthat \nthe \nchampionship \nwas \nbetween \nus,” \nrecalls \nSchwantz. \n“The \ndifference \nwas, \nwhen \nI \nwon, \nWayne \nwas \nnormally \nsecond.” \nSchwantz \n(five \nwins, \nfour \nDNFs) \nwas \nunable \nto \nmatch \nhis \nrival’s \nspeed \n(seven \nwins) \nor \nconsistency \n(five \nsecond-place \nfinishes, \ntwo \nthirds, \none \nDNF), \nand \nWayne \nRainey \ntook \nhis \nfirst \nWorld \nChampionship \nin \ncommanding \nfashion. \nWith Lawson moving on  to  Cagiva for  1991, Rainey was paired with \nanother American, defending 250cc World Champion John Kocinski. The \nmatchup was no  contest as  far as  the  team owner was concerned. In  fact, \nwhen it comes to riding style and technique, Kenny Roberts holds Rainey \nabove all others: \nThere was  chemistry. I had it with Kel, and  Wayne had it with me. \nHis  timing, to  get the  bike to  do  what it wanted to  do.  .  .  his  riding \nwas  perfect, and  John wasn't going to be able to  beat that.

Rainey won the following two  rounds, but \nDoohan took second both times. Doohan broke through with victories in \nthe  following two  races at Jerez and  Misano—the title  was  starting to tip \ntoward the  Australian. Schwantz and Doohan traded the  next two wins, \nwith Rainey runner-up each time. As the season passed the halfway mark, \nthe  defending champion went on a tear, winning four of the  next seven \nraces to seal his second straight title. Unfortunately, he broke his leg during \nthe last event of the season in Malyasia. The injuries sustained in the crash \nwould add to the challenge of defending his title the following season. \nFor 1992, Rainey tried to  return to  testing too  early and  crashed, \nbreaking bones in his hand. His inability to develop the Yamaha in the off- \nseason left him at a serious disadvantage to Doohan and the new  big-bang \nHonda. \nDuring \nthe \nearly \npart \nof \nthe \nseason, \nthe \nchampionship \nwas \nsimply \nno \ncontest: \nDoohan \nwon \nthe \nfirst \nfour \nraces, \nfollowed \nby \nseconds \nat \nMugello \nand \nCatalunya. \nDespite \nhis \ndisadvantage \nin \nequipment, \nRainey \nkept \nhis \nhead \ndown \nand \nrecorded \nthree \nsecond-place \nfinishes \nand \none \nwin \nfrom those first six races. \nHowever, \nthings \ngot \nworse \nfor \nthe \ndefending \nchampion \nat \nthe \nGerman \nGP  \nat  \nthe  \nHockenheimring: \nRainey \ncrashed, \ninjuring \nhis  \nback \nand \nbreaking \nboth \nhis \nhand \nand \nhis \nfoot. \nAdding \ninsult \nto \ninjury \nwas \nthe \nfact  \nthat \nDoohan \nwon \nthe  \nrace, \nand  \nthe  \ntitle \nappeared \nto  \nbe \na  \nforegone \n123 \n\n124 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nconclusion. \nRainey \ntried \nto  \ncome \nback \nfor  \nthe \nnext \nrace \nat  \nAssen, \nbut \nit \nwas \nnot \npossible \nand \nhe \nreturned \nhome. \nThen \nDoohan’s \nmisfortune \nbecame \nRainey’s \nopportunity: \n“I \ngot \na \nfax \nthat \nsaid \nthat \nDoohan \nhad \ncrashed, \nbut \nI \nstill \ndidn’t \nthink \nthat \nwe \nhad \na \nchance \nat \nthat \npoint. \nI \nthink \nI \nwas \n65 \npoints \nback. \nBut \nMick \nmade \na \nmistake, \nand \nwhen \nI \ncame \nback \nI \nhad \na \nbig-bang \nengine \nmyself.” \nDoohan’s \ncrash \nwas  \nparticularly \nbrutal. \nThe  \ninjuries \nto  \nhis  \nright \nleg \nwere \nso \nextensive \nthat \nthere \nwas \na \nrisk \nof \namputation. \nThe \nAustralian \nwould \nhave \nto \nuse a \nhand-operated \nrear brake \nfor \nthe rest \nof \nhis career. \nMeanwhile, \nRainey, \nstill \nrecovering \nfrom \nhis \nown \ninjuries, \nreturned \nto \nthe \ngrid \nto \ntake \nsecond \nat Donington \nand wins \nat Magny-Cours \nand \nBrazil. \nHe had \nerased \nmost \nof \nDoohan’s \npoints \nlead. \nDoohan, \nstill \nunable \nto \nwalk, \ngamely \nreturned \nto \nrace \nin \nthe \nfinal \ntwo \nevents, \nbut \nRainey’s \nthird-place \nfinish \nat \nthe \nfinale \nin \nKyalami \ndecided \nthe \nchampionship \nin \nthe \nAmerican's \nfavor.

After a  year \nunder the  guidance of  Stuart Shenton, the  Suzuki team had brought \npredictability and consistency to Rainey’s greatest rival. Finishes of 1-3-2- \n1-1-2-1-3-2 to  start the  season were decidedly unlike Schwantz, leading \none  to think that  perhaps the  “win or  crash” label may have had  as  much \nto do with the previous development program as  it did with the rider. The \nchallenge to  Rainey’s supremacy was  on,  as  Schwantz took a significant \npoints advantage going into Donington Park. \nIn  \nqualifying, \nit  \nall  \nwent \nwrong \nfor  \nWayne \nRainey: \n“I  \ncrashed \nand \nfractured \nthe \nvertebrae \nin \nmy \nback. \nI \nwas \nhurting \nso \nbad, \nI \ndidn’t \nknow \nwhere \nI \nwas \ngoing \nto \nfinish, \nor \neven \nif \nI \ncould \nfinish. \nDoohan \ntook \nout \n[Alex] \nBarros \nand \nSchwantz, \nand \nI \nfigured \nthat \nsince \nKevin \nwas \nout \nthat \nI \ncould \njust \ncruise \naround \nand \nget \nsecond, \nso \nthat’s \nwhat \nI \ndid” \nDespite \nthe  \nback \ninjury, \nRainey \nfollowed \nup  \nDonington \nwith \na  \nwin \nat \nBrno \n(Czech \nRepublic), \nretaking \nthe \npoints \nlead \nin \nthe \nprocess. \nThe \nchances \nfor \na \nfourth \nstraight \nchampionship \nlooked \npromising \nheading \ninto \nthree \nof  \nhis  \nfavorite \ncircuits: \nMisano, \nLaguna \nSeca, \nand \nJarama. \n\nNO SURRENDER: WAYNE RAINEY 125 \nThen \nit \nall  \nwent \nhorribly \nwrong \nat  \nMisano. \nRainey \nwas  \nrunning \nahead \nof \nSchwantz: \nMid-race, \ncoming \ninto  \nturn \none, \nI \nput \nthe  \nfront \nwheel \nabout \nthree \nor \nfour \ninches \noff \nline. \nI \ngot \nit \nback \non \nline... \nwhen \nI \njust \nstarted \nto \nopen \nthe \nthrottle, \nI \nlost \nside \ngrip \nand \nthe \nrear \nstepped \nout, \nhooked, \nand \nswung \nback \ntoward \nthe \ninside \nof \nthe \nturn. \nInstantly, \nI \nwas \nsliding \nin \nfront \nof the \nbike \nat well \nover \n100 \nmiles \nper \nhour. \nThe first thought I  had was, “Damn, I’ve lost this World \nChampionship.” I hit a curb, and that got me  up in the air, so  I cleared \nthe  grass and  landed in the  speed bumps in the  sand trap, which got \nme  flipping through the air, flying like  a rag doll.

I focused harder on  taking my \nnext breath than anything Id ever done in my career in trying to  win \na race. \nI had  what was  called a  “T-6 complete,’ which means I had no \nfeeling from the chest down. My spine was  completely broken in half \nand  it stretched the  aorta, which normally tears, and then you  just go \nto sleep as you bleed to death internally. The doctors were amazed that \nI lived through it because the  spine was  so  displaced. It was  a  miracle \nas  far as  I’m  concerned. But  it was  still  a  battle just  to  get  to  the  next \nbreath; the pain was  just tremendous .  .  .  It would have been so  easy to \njust say, “This is much too  hard. I don't want to battle this  to stay alive.” \nIt would be easier just to  slip away. \nThe \nEndless \nBattle: \nRainey \nleads \nSchwantz \nin  \n1993. \nAcross \ntheir \ncareers \nthe \ntwo \nwere \nseldom \nfurther \napart \nthan \nthis. \nMortons \nMedia \n\nNO SURRENDER: WAYNE RAINEY \nI \nremember \nseeing \nKenny \nand \nDean, \nmy  \ntrainer, \nat  \nthe  \ntrack \nhospital. \nWhen \nI \nsaw \nthe \nlook \non \nKenny’s \nface, \nI \nknew \nsomething \nserious \nwas \nwrong \nby \nthe \nway \nhe \nwas \nlooking \nat \nme. \nKenny \nknew \nthat \nI \nwas \nparalyzed, \nand \nwe \nwere \nvery, \nvery \nclose. \nThey \nput \nme \nin \nthe \nhelicopter, \nand \nI \nwas \ngrabbing \nthese \nItalian \ndoctors, \nlooking \nthem \nin \nthe \nface \nand \ntelling \nthem \nthat \nI \ndidn’t \nwant \nto \ndie \nin \nthat \nhelicopter. \nThey \nput \nme \nin \nan \nICU, \nand \nthere \nwas \na \nguy \nin \nthe \nbed \nnext \nto \nme \nwho \nwas \na \nspectator \nfrom \nthe \nrace \nwho \nhad \ngotten \ninto \na \nmotor- \ncycle \nwreck. \nI \nwas \ntrying \nto \nencourage \nhim \nto \nstay \nalive \nand \nnot \nto \ngive \nup \n.. \n.

He explains how \nthe  qualities that made him such a great rider helped him through this \nmost difficult period: \nIf you want to be the best and want to be world champion, you have to \nbe completely focused on  racing, with no  distractions. My teammates \nwould think, “I'll  just  wait until the  bike gets  better.” I was  going to \npush \nuntil \nthe \nend, \nwhatever \nit \ntook \nto \nbe \nchampion, \nand \nwe \nalmost \npulled \nit \noff \nfor  \na  \nfourth \ntime. \nI \nthink \nthat  \nis \nthe  \nsame \nmindset \nthat \nkept me  alive. \nIn \naddition \nto  \nsupport \nfrom \nhis \nfamily \nand  \nfriends, \nWayne \nalso  \nreceived \na \nboost \nfrom \nFormula \nOne \nteam \nowner \nFrank \nWilliams, \nwho \nvisited \nRainey \nin \nthe \nhospital. \nWilliams \nhad \nbeen \nin \na \nwheelchair \nsince \n1986, \nthe \nresult \nof \na \nroad \naccident. \nHe \nprovided \nsome \nmuch-needed \nwisdom \nand \ninspiration, \nand \nhelped \nto \npoint \nRainey \ntoward \nthe \nnext \nchapter \nin \nhis \nlife: \n“Seeing \nFrank \n127 \n\n128 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nand \nhis \ncondition, \nhe \nhad \nfocused \nall \nhis \nattention \nonto \nhis \nteam, \nand \nhe \nwas \nvery \nsuccessful. \nI \nhad \na \nlot \nof \nopportunities \nfrom \nYamaha, \nfrom \nKenny, \nfrom \nPhilip \nMorris. \nIf \nI \nhadn't \nstarted \nthe \nteam, \nI \nwould \nprobably \nhave \nstruggled \nmore \nbecause \nI \nwouldn't \nhave \nhad \nsomething \nto \nfocus \non. \nAnd \ns0,  \nless  \nthan \na \nyear \nremoved \nfrom \nhis  \ndevastating \ncrash, \nWayne \nRainey \nreturned \nto \nGrand \nPrix \nracing, \nthis \ntime \nrunning \nhis \nown \n250 \nGP \nteam. \nThe \ndetermination \nthat \nhad \nseen \nRainey \nreach \nthe \npinnacle \nof \ninternational \nGrand \nPrix \ncompetition \nwas \nnow \nredirected \ninto \nteam \nmanagement. \nFor  1996, Rainey moved his  team up  to  the  500cc category, signing \ndouble 125cc World Champion Loris Capirossi. The high point of the \nseason came when the  Italian took his  and  the  team’s first premier class \nvictory at the final race of the year at Eastern Creek, Australia. Capirossi \nrecalls that joyous moment: “That moment was  great for me  and also espe- \ncially for Wayne because it was  really his first big win  as  a team manager. I \nhave a beautiful picture in my home. I am  in the arms of Wayne.” \nIt was  only two  seasons later, at the  end  of 1998, that  Rainey decided \nthat  20 years of rigorous traveling in pursuit of racing glory was  enough. \nHe moved on  from GP  racing, turning his attention to his family. \nWayne Rainey remains a  legend, one  of America’s greatest racers in \nany  form of motorsport, a  fact  demonstrated by his  induction into the \nAMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in  1999 and the  FIM’s naming him a \nGrand Prix Legend the  following year. Laguna Seca paid homage to  the \nthree-time champion by renaming its  turn nine, the  sweeping downhill \nlefthander, \nRainey \nCurve. \nOnly \nBobby \nRahal \nand \nMario \nAndretti \nhave \nbeen \nso \nhonored. \n“That \nto \nme \nis \nvery \nflattering,” \nAndretti \ntold \nthe \nauthor \nrecently. \n“To \nbe \non \nthe \nsame \ncircuit \nwith \nWayne.” \nIt’s \ninteresting \nto \nnote \nthat \nthe \n1978 \nFormula \nOne \nWorld \nChampion \nand \none \nof \nthe \ngreatest \nAmerican \nauto \nracers \nactually \ndreamed \nof \nracing \ntwo-wheeled \nmachines \nin \nhis \nearly \nyears. \n“That's \nwhat \nI \ndreamed \nabout \ndoing, \nthat’s \nthe \npath \nthat \nI \nthought \nI \nwould \nfollow \nwhile \nI \nwas \nstill \na \nyoung \nkid \nin \nItaly,” \nAndretti \nexplains. \n“T \nalways \nhad \nthe \ngreatest \nrespect \nand \nadmiration \nfor \nthese \nguys; \nyou \nhave \nno \nidea \nhow \nmuch \nI \nlove \nthat \nkind \nof \nracing. \nNo \none \nappreciates \nthose \nguys \nmore \nthan \nme;  \nI \ncan  \ntell \nyou  \nthat  \nsincerely.” \n\nNO SURRENDER: WAYNE RAINEY \nSTILL COMPETING \nRainey \nhas  \nreturned \nto  \nracing, \nnow \non  \nfour \nwheels. \nIn  \ncontrast \nwith \nother \nSuperKarts, \nit \nis hardly \nsurprising \nto \nfind \nRainey’s \nkart \nhas \nhandle- \nbars \nand grips \ninstead \nof \na \nsteering \nwheel. \nSandy \nRainey \nprepared \nthe \nSuperKarts \nfor \nthe \n2009 \nLaguna \nSeca \nMotoGP \nshootout \nbetween \nWayne, \nValentino \nRossi, \nEddie \nLawson, \nand \nKenny \nRoberts, \nand \nknowing \nSandy, \none \ncouldnt \nhelp \nbut \nask, \n“Where \nare \nyou \nhiding \nthe nitrous \nbottle \nin \nWayne's \nkart?” \nPointing at  what appears to  be a  fire  bottle, Sandy grins. “That would \nbe  this  one  right here.” Sandy Rainey’s search for  the  slightest advantage \ncontinues and, as  ever, 40 years after the  nitro Mini-Trail, Wayne will  put \nit to  good use. \n= \n‘ \n-, \n. \nae \nE \nF \n“oa \nlayne \ntor \nthe \n2008 \nr \n- \njaguna \nSandy \nRainey \nwith \nthe \nSuperKart \nhe \ntuned \nfor \nWayne \nfor \nthe \n2008 \nrace \nat \nLaguni \nSeca. \nNote \nthe  \nmotorcycle \nhandlebar \nsetup \non  \nthe \nkart. \n\nCHAP LER G6 \nVictory above All: \nKevin Schwantz \nKevin \nSchwantz \nenjoying \none  \nof \nthe \n25 \nvictory \nlaps \nhe \nearned \nduring \nhis \ncareer. \nMortons \nMedia \n130 \n\nVICTORY \nABOVE \nALL: \nKEVIN \nSCHWANTZ \nKee \nSCHWANTZ \nRODE \nON \nthe  \nabsolute \nlimit, \nperiod. \nIn  \na \nclassic \nunderstatement, \nKevin's \nfather, \nJim, \nsums \nup \nhis \nWorld \nChampionship \nson's \npodium-or-gravel-trap \ncareer: \n“He’s \ndone \nhis \nshare \nof \ncrashing.” \nWayne \nRainey \nhad \nthe \nbest  \nview \nof \nmany \nof \nthose \ncrashes: \nKevin \nhad  \na  \nspecial \nfeel \nfor \nriding \non  \nor  \nover \nthe \nedge \nand \nmost \nof \nthe \ntime \ngetting \naway \nwith \nit. \nHe did \nthings \non \na \nbike, \nand \nI \nwould \nthink, \n“Man, \nhe is down.” \nHe \nhad \na \npeculiar \nway \nof riding; \nwith \nKevin \nI \ncould \nnever \npredict \nwhere \nhe \nwas \ngoing \nto \nbe, \nor \nhow \nconsistent \nhe was \ngoing \nto be.

Kevin picked up on  what Mick was  teaching. He  had  some \none-on-one, but at the school Kevin was  just another student.” \n“I  think I  gave up  trials about the  time I  outgrew my  TY-80,” \nKevin recalls. “I  wanted to   try motocross, enduro, and_ hare \nscrambles-type stuff.” \n“Before Kevin started doing local motocross, we  raced karts four or \nfive times a year,’ says  Jim.  “We went to  Baja on  a few occasions; he rode \na Yamaha IT-175 enduro.” \n“Tt was  on  a 1976 model YZ80C that  I started riding motocross,” Kevin \nexplains. “There was  Friday night motocross and a Sunday one. I did okay; \nI could always ride at the front of the group of minis.” \nJim explains that  it wasn’t long before Kevin was  ready to leapfrog the \n100/125/250 MX bikes to the largest class: “In MX, he started on  an  80 and \nthen \nwent \nstraight \nto \nthe \nopen \nclass. \nHe \nquickly \nbecame \nthe \nguy \nyou \nhad \nto beat in that area.” \nAlmost \nunbelievably, \nin \n1981, \n16-year-old \nKevin \nSchwantz \nwent \nstraight \nfrom \nthe \nYZ80 \nto \nthe \npowerful \nYZ465, \na \nmotocross \nbike \nsimilar \nto \nthe \none \nthat \nMarty \nMoates \nhad \nused \nto \nwin \nthe \n500cc \nmotocross \n1980 \nUSGP \nat \nCarlsbad. \nAfter \ngraduating \nfrom \nhigh \nschool \nin \n1982, \nKevin \nmoved \nup \nto \nExpert \nclass. \nThis \nwas \nabout \nthe \nsame \ntime \nYamaha \nintroduced \nthe \nbrutal \nYZ490 \nmotocrosser, \na \nquantum \nleap \nfrom \nthe \n465, \n\nVICTORY \nABOVE \nALL: \nKEVIN \nSCHWANTZ \n“I \nwas  \nrunning \nlocal \nstuff \nas  \nexpert) \nKevin \nrecalls. \n“I \ndid  \nSaddleback \nin \n1982 \nand \nthe \nHouston \nSupercross \nin \n1982 \nand \n1983” \n“One \ntime \nhe \nbrought \na \nYamaha \n490  \nto  \nrace  \nin \nSouthern \nCalifornia \nat \nthe \nSuperbikers \nrace, \nracing \nagainst \nEddie \nLawson,’ \nJim \nSchwantz \nsays. \n“That \nwas \na \nfun \nrace; \nit \nled \nmore \nthan \nanything \nelse \nto \nSupermoto \n. \n. \n. \nhaving \ncombined \nasphalt \nand \ndirt.” \nJust \nas  \nhe \nhad \noutgrown \ntrials, \nit \nwasn’t \nlong \nbefore \nKevin \nwas  \nready \nto \nmove \non from \nmotocross. \n“At \nHouston, \nI'd \nqualified \nfor \nthe \nprogram, \nmade \nthe \nsemis, \nbut \nnever \nmade \nit \nto \nthe \nmain \nevent,” \nKevin \nsays. \n“I \ndecided \nthis \nmotocross \ns**t \nis not \nfor \nme.” \nAside from his  parents, another big influence on  Kevin’s racing life \nwas  his  uncle, (his  mom Shirley’s brother) Darryl Hurst, a  professional \ndirt track racer who carried a familiar No.  34 number plate. According to \nJim  Schwantz, Hurst passed along some dirt  track wisdom to  his young \nnephew: “Because his  uncle was a dirt  tracker, he also  did a fair  amount \nof dirt tracking.” \nHurst also provided the  occasional burr under Kevin's saddle: “My \nuncle was  the  one  who never seemed to  give me  any  credit for anything \nI had done until I started racing professional AMA stuff. He  made a \ncomment when I was a kid... I told him  I'd won three or  four club races \non  that  weekend. He  said, “When you  win  an  AMA National, call  me  up \nand let me  know.” \nThis dismissal of his efforts would grate on  the young Kevin for many \nyears; he was  never to forget it. \n“IT CAN’T BE MUCH FUN” \nIt \nwasn't \nlong \nbefore \nKevin's \ninterest \nturned \ntoward \nendurance \nroad \nracing. \nMore \nas \na \nlark \nthan \nanything, \nhe \ndecided \nto \nenter \na \nrace \nat \nTexas \nWorld \nSpeedway: \n“At \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \nseason, \nsome \nof \nmy \nbuddies \nwere \nin \nthe \nshop, \nand \nthey \nsaid, \n‘Hey, \nwhy \ndon’t \nyou \ncome \nand \ndo \na \nroad \nrace \nwith \nus? \nWe're \ngonna \ndo \nan \nendurance \nrace’ \nI \nthought, \n'T'll \ngive \nit \na \ntry, \nthere's \nno \njumps, \nthere’s \nno \ndirt; \nit \ncan't \nbe \nmuch \nfun \n[laughs].” \nAnd \nso  \nthe \nfuture \nworld \nchampion \nmade \nhis \nroad \nracing \ndebut, \nriding \na  \n1982 \nshaft-drive \n750  \nYamaha \nSeca: \n133 \n\n134 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nI \nwent \nout  \nand  \ntried \nit, \nand  \nafter \nmy \nhour \nstint \nI \nwas  \ndoing \nthe  \nsame \ntimes \nas \nthese \nguys \nwhod \nbeen \ndoing \nthis \nstuff \nfor \neight \nor \nten \nyears. \nI \nthought \nthat \nmaybe \nI \nought \nto \ntry \nthis. \nWe \nhad \nfun, \nand \nthat \nwas \nthe \nmain \nthing. \nI \ntalked \nto \nmy \nparents, \nand \nwe \nhad \na \nVision, \na \nmodified \nXZ550, \nand \nput \nsome \ngood \ntires \non \nit \nand \nwent \nout \nand \nsprint \nraced \nit. \n[had \na \nvery \ngood \ntime \nsprint \nracing, \nand \nI \ntook \nto \nit \nthat \nweekend \nand thought maybe Id give this  a go next year. \nKevin's \nparents \nsoon \nupgraded \nhim \nto  \nan  \nFJ600, \nand  \nhe \nbegan \nracing \nin \nevery \nclass \nhe \ncould \nenter. \nAfter \nwinning \nhis \nfirst \nrace \non \nthe \n600 \nas \na \nnovice, he was  moved up to Expert: \nI could run  six or  eight classes.

So then I went home after the  first \nfull  weekend in  1984 and  told my  parents, “Hey, I want to  ride an \nRZ350 too!” Then I could ride  the smaller classes and  the four bigger \nclasses on the 600, win three or four of them, and run  right at the front \nin a couple of the others. \nKevin soon decided the  time was  right to  enter the  eight-hour national \nenduro at  Texas World Speedway.

John called and got me a test at Willow, \nand he asked me  to  come out  a couple of days early and let me  have a \npractice day, and that hed let me  ride his enduro bike.

Meanwhile, Honda had  the  formidable teaming of Rainey and \nFred Merkel on  VFR750s. Schwantz hung with the  lead battle of Lawson \nand  Rainey and  eventually finished second after Rainey hit  tire  trouble. \nIt was  a strong debut race with his  new American Suzuki team, but  even \nbigger things were to come just a few weeks later. \nMATCH RACE ACE \nKevin Schwantz's first chance to  compete in  Europe came thanks to  an \narrangement between Suzuki UK  and  four-time world champion Kork \nBallington. Two-time Daytona Superbike winner and  the  future founder \nof World Superbike, Steve McLaughlin explains the  arrangement: “We \nhad  made a deal..I had  gotten Korky Ballington, a  Kawasaki guy, to  ride \nfor \nSuzuki \nUK \nat \nDaytona. \nIt \nwas \na \nbig \ndeal; \nhe \nwas \na \nKawasaki \nworld \nchampion. \nIn \nturn, \nSuzuki \nUK \nwas \nsupposed \nto \ngive \nKevin \na \ngood \nbike \nfor the match races.” \nSuzuki \nUK  \ndidn’t \nexactly \nfulfill \nits  \nend  \nof \nthe  \nbargain, \nhowever, \nas \nSchwantz \nrecalls: \n“I \nturned \nup \non \nthe \npromise \nthat \nthere \nwould \nbe \na \nreally \nwell-prepared \nGSXR750 \nthere \nfor \nme \nto \nride. \nIt \nturned \nout \nthat \nthe \nbike \nwas \nTony \nRutter’s \nIsle \nof \nMan \nTT \nbike. \nTony \nshifted \non \nthe \nright. \nI \nwalked \ninto \nthe \ngarage \nand \nlooked \nat \nthis \nbike; \nit’s \nleaned \nup \nagainst \nthe \nwall \nwith \nright-hand \nshift \nand \na \nbig \npuddle \nof \noil \nunderneath \nit \n(laughs].” \n\nVICTORY \nABOVE \nALL: \nKEVIN \nSCHWANTZ \n137 \nMcLaughlin \ncontinues \nthe  \nstory: \nWe  \nget \nthere, \nand  \nthey \ngive \nus  \nthis  \nclapped-out \nTony \nRutter \nbike. \nIt \nwas \nfilthy, \nlike \nthey \ndrug \nit \noff \nthe \nIsle \nof \nMan. \nI \ndon’t \nthink \nit \nhad \nrun \nsince \nthe \nManx. \nThe \nfirst \nthing \nKevin \ndid \nwas \nwash \nthe \nbike. \nThe \nfirst \nthing \nI \ndid \nwas \nshame \nthe \nhell \nout \nof \nthe \nUK \nguys \nfor \ngiving \nus \nthis \npiece \nof \ns**t. \nThe \nwheels \nwere \nmade \nby \na \nBritish \nwheel \nmanufac- \nturer, \nand \nthey \nhad \nstamped \nsections \nriveted \ntogether. \nThe \nrivets \nwere \nloose, \nand \nthe \nwheel \nwas \nwobbling. \nFortunately, \nwe \nfound \nthe \nwheel \nmaker \nand \ngot \nnew \nwheels \nfor \nKevin. \nThey \ngot \na \nlot \nmore \ninterested \nonce \nKevin \ngot \non \nthe \ntrack \nand \nbroke \nthe \nlap \nrecord. \nSuddenly, \nwe \nhad a Jot of support from Suzuki UK. \nKevin recalls how the  1986 Transatlantic Match Races came together \nfor him: \nThe  guys at  Suzuki UK  were able to  get some spare parts and  switch \nthe thing back to a left-shift motorcycle. We were given some wheels \nso  we  could mount rains and  slicks at the same time. The bike was  an \nabsolute rocket; it had  the  standard suspension, but  they had  done \nsome work to the engine. It started off as  one  of those things I thought \nI would really regret going over and  doing. But  the  bike handled \ngreat and everything worked fine. Between Merkel and  I, we  won \nevery race. Merkel [who was  riding a Honda UK  750  Interceptor] fell \nin one  race, which gave me  the  advantage on  the points. \nMcLaughlin sums up the event: \nKevin \nwent \nout  \nand \nkicked \ntheir \nass  \non  \nthat \nbike. \nRutter \ncould \nnever \ngo \nso  \nfast \non  \nthis \nbike. \nHe \nand \nMerkel \nabsolutely \ndecimated \nthe \nBritish \non  their home track. \nThe \n1986 \nTransatlantic \nMatch \nRaces \nwere \na  \nturning \npoint \nin  \nKevin \nSchwantz’s \ncareer, \na \nfact \nhe \nknows \nfull \nwell: \n\n138 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nThere \nwas  \nabsolutely \nno  \ndoubt \nin \nmy \nmind, \nwith \nall \nof \nthe \nexposure \nthat \ngave \nme—Barry \nSheene \nwas \nthere, \nall \nthe \nTV \ncommentators \nwere \nthere, \nthe \nraces \nwere \non \nEurosport \n[TV] \nacross \nEurope—it \nreally \ngave \nme \nmy \nopportunity \nto \ncome \nto \nEurope \nand \ndo \nsome \nracing. \nI \nstayed \na \ncouple \nof \nweeks \nafter \nthe \nrace, \ntested \none \nof \nBarry’s \nold \nbikes, \ndid \nthe \nRace \nof \nthe \nYear \nat \nMallory \nPark. \nI \nwas \ndominating \nthe \nrace \nhandily \nuntil \nthe \ncables \npopped \nout—a \ncouple \nof \nthe \nthrottle \ncables \npopped \nout \nof \ntwo \nof \nthe \ncarburetors, \nso \nwe \nwere \non \na \n250 \nfor \nthe \nlast \nfive \nlaps—but \nI \nthink \nwe \nfinished \nsecond. \nBarry \nwent \nto \nHeron \nSuzuki \nand \nsaid, \n“Let's \nfind \na \nbike; \nlet’s \ndo \nsomething; \nlet’s \nget \nthis \nkid \non \na \n500.” \nI \nwas \nreally \ngrateful \nto him for all he did, especially early on  in my career. \nMcLaughlin explains how Schwantz became something of an  overnight \nsensation in Europe: \nIt was  the  first  time for  Kevin out  of the  country, and  the  races were \non  TV with Barry Sheene commentating. We went to get on  the  tube \nin London, and the people selling the tickets recognized him  from the \nTV  show on  the weekend. They wanted his  autograph. He had  never \nexperienced the European celebrity thing before. \nAnother successful American career in 500cc GP had been launched. \nReturning home to  America, Schwantz’s star  kept rising throughout \na  season dominated by the  American Honda riders, Wayne Rainey and \nFred Merkel. Schwantz finished the campaign seventh in points and was  a \ncontender \nfor \nwins. \nThe \npositive \nresults \nand \nsome \nfactory \nsupport \nallowed \nthe \nteam \nto \ncarry \nsome \nmomentum \ninto \nthe \n1987 \nseason, \nas  \nKevin \ndescribes: \nThere \nwere \nfull-factory \nSuzukis \nfor \nme  \nand  \nPolen \nin  \n1987. \nWe \ndid \nsome \ntesting \nover \nthe \nwinter \nwith \nthe  \nMichelin \ntires \non  \nthe \nGSXR \nand  \nreally \ngot \nour  \nbike \nworking \ngood. \nAt \nDaytona, \nI \nwas  \nthirteen \nseconds \nin \nfront \nof \nRainey, \nand \nI \nwas \nready \nto \nmake \nmy \nsecond \npit \nstop \nand \ngot \npinched \nout  \nby \na \nbackmarker \nin \nthe \nchicane. \nI \nfell \nand \nbroke \nmy \nlittle \nfinger. \n\nVICTORY ABOVE ALL: KEVIN SCHWANTZ 139 \nThe \nbattle \nat \nDaytona \nset  \nthe \nstage \nfor \nthe \ndrama \nof \nthe \n1987 \nTransatlantic \nMatch \nRaces. \nSchwantz \ntells  \nthe \nstory \nfrom \nhis \npoint \nof \nview: \nWhen I went to  Brands Hatch, I still  had  external pins sticking out \nof my  fingers. | had  to  tape my fingers together, because I found that \nwith tape on  only that  finger, the wind kept trying to blow that  finger \noff and  it really hurt. Rainey and  I had  an  agreement going in that we \nwere probably going to be the better guys here. We were going to run \nthis first race  and then maybe we'll talk about this £100,000 bonus that \nwas  there if one  rider can  win  all the races. We went really hard in the \nfirst  race, and  I came out  on  top.  But  there was  never a word said; he \nnever came over and  we  never talked. The  second race  went on,  and \nwe  did a bit  of pushing and banging. \nThat race and  Germany in  1991 with Wayne are  probably the two \nraces people talk  about the  most. People say,  “I saw  that  video from \nthe  match races. Oh  my  God, you  guys are  crazy, you  wanted to  kill \neach other, didn’t you?” \nIt was  full-contact, desperation-meets-determination racing, the  likes of \nwhich had  rarely been seen before or  since. In the end, Schwantz emerged \nA \nbattle \nfor \nthe \nages: \nKevin \nSchwantz \nleads \nWayne \nRainey \nat \nthe  \n1987 \nTransatlantic \nMatch \nRaces. \nMortons \nMedia \n\n140 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nas  \nthe  \nvictor, \nbecoming \nthe  \nmatch \nraces \nindividual \nchampion \nfor  \nthe \nsecond \nyear \nrunning. \nThe  \nred-hot \nrivalry \ncontinued \nback \nin \nthe  \nUnited \nStates. \nKevin \nrecalls \nthose \nvery \nintense \ntimes: \n“At \nthat \npoint \nin \nour \ncareers, \nwe \ndidn't \nthink \nthere \nwas \nroom \nfor \nboth \nof \nus \nin \nEurope. \nWe \nthought \nthat \nit \nwas \neither \ngoing \nto \nbe \nme \nthat \nmade \nit \nor \nthat \nhe \nwould \nmake \nit. \nWe \ndidn’t \nthink \nwe \ncould \nboth \nmake \nit.” \nRainey dominated the first  three races of the AMA Superbike season, \nbut  Schwantz would come through in  round four at  Loudon to  take \nhis  first Superbike win. Remembering Darryl Hurst's harsh response \nto his earlier achievements, Kevin placed a call  to his uncle soon after his \nLoudon triumph: “He  said, ‘When you  win  an  AMA National, call  me  up \nand let me  know: I called him  right after I won Loudon in  1987.” \nFrom that point forward, the  top  step of the  podium belonged to \nSchwantz, who won at Elkhart Lake, Mid-Ohio, Memphis, and Sears Point. \nThe  only exception was  Laguna Seca, where Wayne's Honda teammate \nBubba Shobert won. Yet  despite this  incredible run, the  Texan fell  short \nto his rival, losing the  title  to  Rainey by just nine points. This would not \nbe  the  last  time Schwantz would top  Rainey in  wins but  fall  short in \nthe championship. \nGP WINNER \nAs  it turned out,  Kevin was  wrong in his belief that  there wasn’t enough \nroom in  Europe for both him and  Rainey. In  fact, the  Schwantz-Rainey \nrivalry \nwas \nabout \nto \ngo \ninternational, \nas \nthe \ntwo \nAmericans \nmoved \nup \nto \nracing in the 500cc Grand Prix  class for  1988. \nA \npole \nanda \nwin \nat \nDaytona \ngave \nthe \nyoung \nTexan \nplenty \nof \nmomentum \ngoing \ninto \nthe  \nseason-opening \nGP  \nat  \nSuzuka. \nBut  \nwhat \nhappened \nthere \nsurprised \neven \nKevin: \nI \ngot \na \ngood \nstart, \n[and \n1987 \nchampion \nWayne] \nGardner \ngets \nby \nme, \nbut \nhe’s \nnot \ngoing \nanywhere. \nI \nlook \nback \nand \nI \ncan’t \nsee \nanybody \nbehind \nus. \nSo \nmy \nmindset \ngoing \ninto \nthe \nlast \nfew \nlaps \nof \nthe \nrace \nwas, \n“I'm  \nsecond, \nand  \nthe \nonly \nguy \nin \nfront \nof \nme  \nhas \nthe \nNo.  \n1 \non  \nthe \nside \n\nVICTORY \nABOVE \nALL: \nKEVIN \nSCHWANTZ \nof \nhis \nbike.” \nI'm \nthinking \nI’ve \nreally \naccomplished \nsomething, \nand \nthen \nthe \nnext \nthing \nI \nknow \nhe \nruns \noff \nthe \ntrack. \nAll  \non  \nits \nown, \nthe \nvictory \nwas  \nimpressive \nenough. \nBut  \nwhat \nfew \nknew \nat \nthe \ntime \nwas \nthat \nSchwantz \nhad \ndone \nit \nwith \na \nfracture \nin \nhis \nleft \narm, \nthe \nresult \nof \na practice \ncrash \nat \nDaytona. \nThe \nrookie \nracer \nwas \ncompletely \nunprepared \nfor  \nthe  \npostrace \ninter- \nviews: \n“I \nwas \na \nPR \nnightmare. \nI \nnever \nsaid \nthe \nword \n‘Suzuki? \nand \nworse \nyet, \nI \ncommented \non \nthe \nother \nguy’s \nHonda. \nI \nguess \nthe \ngood \nthing \nwas \nthat \nas long \nas \nyou \nwon \nthe \nJapanese \nGrand \nPrix, \nyou \ncould \nprobably \nsay anything” \nSchwantz’s brilliant debut had  a profound impact not just on  his own \ncareer, but also Wayne Rainey’. Rainey recalls: “Sometimes things happen \nearly in  one’s profession or  career that  you  don't really know what it did \nuntil it is all done, like the  Russians beating the Americans up into  space. \nIf that  hadn't happened, then America wouldn't have been so  determined \nto get to the moon. Basically that’s what Kevin did to me  by going out  and \nwinning that  first  race.” \nUnfortunately for Schwantz, he was  unable to carry much momentum \non  from Suzuka, and  his  1988 season was  plagued by the  inconsistency \nthat would become almost a  trademark of his  early GP  years. His  win \nin  Japan was followed by a fifth, two  DNFs, and a fourth place before \nhe  broke through for  a  second win  at  the  Nurburgring (a victory made \nall the  sweeter by the  fact  that it was  taken at  the  expense of a  despon- \ndent \nRainey). \nWith \njust \none \npodium \nand \nfour \nDNFs \nacross \nthe \nfollowing \neight \nraces, \nSchwantz \nwas \nleft \nwell \nbehind \nin \nthe \nchampionship \nchase; \nhe \nfinished eighth in points. \nBut  \nany \nanalysis \nof \nKevin \nSchwantz’s \nfirst  \nGP  \nseason \nmust \ninclude \nthe \nfact \nthat \nSuzuki \nwas \njust \nmaking \nits \nreturn \nto \nGP \nracing \nafter \na \nhiatus \nof \nseveral \nyears. \nThe \nfledgling \nteam \nhad \nno \nGP \nknowledge \non \nwhich \nto \ndevelop \nits \nbike, \nand \nit \nshowed. \nThe \nmanufacturer \ndelivered \na  \nmuch \nbetter \nmachine \nfor  \n1989, \nbut \nSchwantz \nhimself \nstill \nrequired \nsome \ndevelopment. \nSuffice \nit \nto \nsay, \nthe \nyoung \nTexan \nhad \nnot  \nquite \ngrasped \nthe \nconcept \nof \n“race \ncraft:” \n141 \n\n142 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nThe  \n1989 \nbike \nwas  \nprobably \nthe \nbest \nmotorcycle \nI \never \nrode. \nIf \nit \nhad \nhad \nsomebody \nintelligent \non \ntop \nof \nit, \ninstead \nof \nsomebody \nwho \njust \nwanted \nto \nwin \nwin \nwin, \nthat \nbike \nshould \nhave \nwon \nthe \nchampionship. \nIt \nwas \nthat \ngood. \nI \nsat \non \nthe \npole \nso \nmany \ntimes \nthat \nyear. \nAt \nthat \npoint, \nI \nreally \nwish \nI \nhad \nhad \nsomebody \nthere \nsaying \n“just \nfinish.” \nwanted \nto \nwin \nraces \nbeating \neverybody \nby \na \nlap; \nthat \nwas \nmy \nidea \nof \na victory. \nSchwantz began the  1989 season with a  repeat win at  Suzuka, this time \nnarrowly over Rainey. But pole position at Australia led to  no  points, and \nRainey returned the  Suzuka favor by winning at  Laguna Seca. The  next \nrace  was  at Jerez, where Schwantz learned a valuable and  painful lesson: \nI fell  off  [at Jerez] in  1989 trying to  do  one  more good lap because \nEddie Lawson was  five seconds behind with six laps to  go. I felt like  if \nI had  a second a lap to give away then he couldn't catch me.

Lawson's injury at round two  at Laguna Seca meant \nthe  title  fight would be  more or  less  a  two-man race, and  Schwantz duly \nraised his game when the championship arrived in Europe. The Texan took \nthird at  Jerez before finishing second at  Misano, followed by wins at  the \nNurburgring and the Salzburgring. The Rainey-Schwantz finish in the next \nGP at Rijeka was  offset by a Schwantz-Rainey finish at Assen. Rainey would \nmatch the Texan’s wins at Le Mans and Donington with his own  victories at \nSpa and Brno. The difference was  in the consistency. Across the first nine GPs \nof the season, Rainey’s worst finish was  second. Those results, coupled with \nfive wins, were enough to trump Schwantz’: five victories by 67 points. \nOnce again, the 1991 season began at Suzuka with what Kevin considers \nhis greatest race: \nWe  \nhad  \nbeen \nhorrible \nall  \nwinter \nin  \ntesting. \nThe  \nfirst  \nrace  \nof \nthe  \nyear \nwas \nin \nJapan, \nand \neverybody \nwas \nthere: \nLawson, \nDoohan, \nGardner, \nKocinski, \nMagee, \nNiall \nMackenzie, \nand \na \nhandful \nof \nJapanese \nwildcard \nguys. \nI \ngot \na \ngood \nstart \nand \ngot \nto \nthe \nfront, \nbut \nbefore \nI \nknew \nit \nI \nwas \nthe \nlength \nof \nthe \nfront \nstraightaway \nbehind. \nThat \nwas \nmy \nbest \nrace; \nthe \nbike \nwasn't \ngreat. \nIt \nwas \nreally \ngood \nto \nstart \nwith \nbut \nstarted \npushing \nthe  \nfront \nlike  \na \ntruck, \nand  \nI \nfound \na \nway \nto \nride  \naround \nthe \nproblems \n143 \n\n144 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nand \nget \nback \nin \nfront. \nWayne \nand \nI \nhad \nso \nmany \nknock-down \ndrag-out \nraces, \nbut \nI \nreally \nthink \nthat \nwas  \nmy \nbest \nrace \nbecause \nthe \nbike \nwasn't \ngreat and so  many great guys were there. \nUnfortunately, \nthe  \nfollowing \nraces \nsaw  \nthe  \nusual \nSchwantz \npattern \ntake \nhold. \nAfter \nSuzuka, \nhis \nresults \nwent \nfifth, \nthird, \nDNF, \nand \nseventh \nbefore \nhis \nnext \nwin \nat \nHockenheim. \nSchwantz \nwould \nalso \ntake \nvictories \nat \nAssen \nand \nDonington \nPark \nbefore \nfinishing \nout \nthe \nseason \nwith \nanother \npair \nof \nwins \nat Brno \nand \nBrazil. \nBut \nonce \nagain, \nthe \nconsistency \nwasn't \nthere, \nand \nRainey \nrepeated \nas \nworld \nchampion. \nIt would be unfair and  incorrect to  blame all of the  inconsistency on \nthe  rider, however. Testing had  never been extensive through Schwantz’s \nearly years at Suzuki, and the team’s development and  setups bordered on \ndesperation, as  Kevin explains: \n[During those years] we  didn’t do  nearly as  much testing. We  didn't \nkeep good enough notes, so  we  didn’t have much to  fall  back upon. \nIt was  always, “Well, I don’t know what the  f**k  we  do  now, let’s  try \nthis. We'd throw s**t at it, even after warmup we'd still be trying stuff. \nOn  certain weekends, it worked like  gangbusters, but  it was much \nmore of a gamble. That’s where I felt that  so  much of my inconsistency \nwas  coming from. If we  were way off in left field on  the setup after we \nworked and worked, then Sunday morning if we  were still behind the \neight ball, we'd go, “Watch this... seven come eleven .  .  .  yeah, maybe \nit ll work.” \nThings \nbegan \nto  \nchange \nfor  \nthe  \nbetter \nin  \n1992, \nwhen \nSuzuki \nbrought \nin \ntwo \nkey \npeople \nwho \nwould \nhelp \nchange \nthe \ndirection \nof \nthe \nteam. \nStuart \nShenton, \nFreddie \nSpencer’s \nformer \n250 \nmechanic \nat \nHonda, \ncame \nin \nas \nSchwantz’s \nrace \nengineer. \nDoug \nChandler \nalso \njoined \nthe \nteam \nas \nthe \nNo.  \n2 \nrider. \nHe \nwas  \nshocked \nby \nthe \nSuzuki \napproach: \nKevin \nwas  \na  \ngreat \nrider, \nand  \nhe’s  \na \ngreat \nperson. \nNot  \nto  \nknock \nhim \nin \nany \nway, \nbut \nhe \nwas  \nthe \ntotal \nopposite \nof \nwhat \nWayne \nRainey \nwas. \nIt \nwas \n\nVICTORY \nABOVE \nALL: \nKEVIN \nSCHWANTZ \n145 \nquite \nan  \nexperience, \nworking \nin \nmy \nfirst \nyear \nof \n1991 \nwith \nWayne \nand \nbeing \nable \nto \nlearn \nso \nmuch, \nand \nthen \nin \n1992 \nshuffling \nover \nto \nthe \nSuzuki \nside. \nAt \nthe \ntime \nI \nmade \nthe \nswitch, \nI’m \nthinking, \n“This \nis \ngreat, \nI'm \ngoing \nto \nbe \nteamed \nnow \nwith \nKevin. \nI’ve \nlearned \nfrom \nWayne; \nlet's \nsee \nwhat \nKevin \nknows.” \nI \nwas \ndumbfounded. \nThe \ninput \nwas \nvague \nfrom \nKevin, \nwhereas \nI \nwas \nbeing \nmore \npositive \nin \ntrying \nto \ngive \nthe \nJapanese \ndirection \nin \ntrying \nto \ncorrect \nthe \nproblems \nwith \nthe \nbike. \nKevin \nwould \njust \nget \non \nthat \nthing \nand \nride \nthe \nwheels \noff—which \nis \namazing \nto \nhave \na \nguy \nwho \ncould \ndo \nthat—but \nhe \nended \nup \non \nthe ground. \nShenton explains how he  brought engineering discipline to  the  team, \nalong with an  organized development program: \nIt wasn't a case  of making a new  bike; it was  more a case of “this is not \nthe  correct way to  do that  in terms of engineering” There were some \nfairly nasty things about [the bike] that  we  rectified. They were silly \nthings, like  not  having what Id call  proper bearings in the  swinging \narms. You need a  thrust bearing in  there as  well, rather than just \nbolting it up  and  shoving washers in  it.  [A lot  of our  focus was  on] \nstuff like that. \nSchwantz welcomed the new approach: \nFor  me,  Stuart was the  guy  who explained what was  going on.  He \ndidn’t just make changes and say,  “Go try  this.” He  would tell  me \nwhat he adjusted, tell me  what he thought it was  going to do, what it \nshould do.  By the  end  of 1992, we  knew what we  could try and  what \nwe \ncouldn't—wed \nthrown \neverything \nbut \nthe \nkitchen \nsink \nat \nit. \n[The \n1992 \nbike] \nnever \nwas \na \ngood \nconsistent \nmotorcycle, \nbut \nthat \nhelped \nus \na lot in  1993. \nMeanwhile, \nChandler’s \nmethodical \nand  \ndetailed \napproach \nto  \nsetup \nalso \nplayed \na \nhuge \nrole \nin \nmoving \nthe \nteam \nforward. \n“He \nwas  \njust \nthe \nopposite \n\n146 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nof \nme,” \nsays  \nSchwantz. \n“He \nwould \nbe \nworking \non  \nthe  \n[bike] \nSunday \nnight \n[after \nthe \nrace], \nalmost \nto \nan \nanal \nextent. \nHe \nwanted \nto \nknow \noil \nlevels, \nsprings, \ngeometry, \neverything. \nDoug \nwas \na \nbig \npart \nof \nthe \ndevelopment \nof \nour \nbike; \nhe \nand \nStuart \ntogether \ncame \nwith \nso \nmany \nnew \nideas; \na \nlot \nof \nthe \nadjustability \nfeatures \nof \nthe \nbike \nwere \nideas \nthat \nDoug \nhad.’ \nShenton concurs: \nDoug was  a real  professional. He  had a lot  of experience and had \nridden a lot of bikes even at that  early stage, having won on  all sorts \nof things. Doug was  able to  confirm a lot  of stuff for  us,  to  back us \nup when decisions were made and  parts were tried. He  was a  good \nguy to  have on  the  other side of  the  garage, someone we  could \nwork with and  get  stuff done. But  sometimes I think you can  get \ntoo  deep into the  motorcycle, with too  much of that stuff playing \non  your mind. There is  a happy medium. Kevin and  Doug are  very \ndifferent characters. Maybe getting too  deep into the  motorcycle, \nfocusing on  too  many things instead of  just riding it,  can  be  a \nhandicap. What is good for a test  rider maybe isn’t so  good for a racer; \nmaybe what you  don’t know and  what you  don't want to  know ain't \nhurting you. \nIn  the  case of Lucky Strike Suzuki, the  combination clicked. “Chandler \nwas  a  hands-on guy, and  FAST; says Schwantz’s mechanic at  the  time, \nHamish Jamieson. “He was a strong teammate, quite often beating Kevin \nin  races. When you've got  two  guys running as  quick as  that, it is really \ngood for the development of the bike.” \nCHAMPION AT LAST \nThe \npieces \nwere \nin  \nplace \nfor  \nSuzuki \nto  \nchallenge \nfor  \nthe  \ntitle \nin  \n1993. \nEndless \nwinter \ntesting \nresulted \nin \na \nconsistent \nand \nquick \nmachine. \n“I \nthink \nI \njust \nabout \nlived \nat \nEastern \nCreek, \nAustralia, \nwhere \nwe \ndid \nour \ntesting, \nShenton \nrecalls. \nBringing \nSchwantz \ninto \nthe \ndevelopment \nloop \nhelped \nhim \nto  \nunderstand \nand  \ngain \nconfidence \nin \nthe  \nbike. \nIn \nturn, \nhe \ndelivered \nthe \nbest \nseason \nof \nhis \ncareer. \n\nVICTORY \nABOVE \nALL: \nKEVIN \nSCHWANTZ \nThe  \ntrademark \nspeed \nwas  \nstill  \nthere, \nas  \nevidenced \nby \nSchwantz \ntaking \npole \nin \nthe \nfirst \nfive \nraces. \nBut \nthe \nbig \ndifference \ncame \nin \nthe \nresults. \n“In \n1993,\" \nWayne \nRainey \nrecalls, \n“Kevin \nwas \nriding \nraces, \nfinishing \nraces, \nand \ngoing \nreally \nwell. \nHe \nwasn’t \njumping \noff \nlike \nin \nthe \npast” \nAcross \nthe \nfirst \nnine \nGrands \nPrix, \nSchwantz \nfinished \nfirst, \nthird, \nsecond, \nfirst, \nfirst, \nsecond, \nfirst, \nthird, \nand \nsecond. \nAs \nthe \nBritish \nGP \nat \nDonington \nPark \napproached, \nSchwantz \nand \nhis \nbike \nwere \ndominant. \nHe \nheld \na \n23-point \nlead \nin \nthe \nstandings \nand \nappeared \nwell \non \nhis \nway \nto \nhis \nfirst \nWorld \nChampionship. \nEverything appeared to be going in the Texan’s favor. Schwantz’s three \nwins at the track had  earned him  the title  “King of Donington,” his confi- \ndence was  sky-high coming into the race, and he duly qualified more than \na  second faster than the  rest  of the  field. Meanwhile, Rainey sustained a \nserious back injury in practice and would struggle to compete. \nBut  Schwantz’ dream scenario soon became a  nightmare. Running \nsecond early in  the  race, he  found himself a victim of a banzai move by \nMick Doohan. Doohan took out  Alex Barros, whose bike slammed Kevin \ninto  the gravel trap: \nWith that, I did  a  big nasty flip that took me  out  of the  race. I left \nthere with a three-point lead instead of what should have been a full \nGrand Prix lead. This opened everything back up. Then Wayne won in \nBrno. To make matters worse, I had broken a few bones in my hand at \nDonington and  was  trying to keep that  as  quiet as  I could. \nJamieson recalls the situation: \nWe \nwent \ninto  \nDonington \nwith \nsomething \nlike  \na \nrace  \nlead  \nin \nthe \ncham- \npionship. \nBoth \nBarros’ \nand \nKevin's \nbikes \nwere \nbent, \nand \nat \nthe \ntime \nwe \ndidn't \nknow \nit, \nbut \nKevin \nwas \ninjured. \nHe \nkept \nthat \nto \nhimself. \nThe \ncouple \nof \nraces \nafter \nthat, \nwe \nreally \ndid \nstruggle. \nEarlier \nin \nthe \nseason \nwe \nhad \nbeen \nvery \nconsistent. \nThe \ndestruction \nof \nthe \nprimary \nbike \nwas \na \nhuge \nblow. \nWe \nreplaced \nthe \nchassis \nwith \nthe \nsame \nspecification, \nbut \nit \nis \nnever \nexactly \nthe \nsame. \nYou \nnever \nexpect \nsomething \nlike \nthat \nto \nhappen \nto \nboth \nriders \nbefore \nthe \nfirst \nlap \nis \neven \nover; \nit \njust \nkilled \nus. \n147 \n\nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nThe \nchampionship \nhad  \nbeen \nthrown \nwide \nopen, \nand  \nRainey’s \nwin  \nat  \nBrno \ngave \nhim \nthe  \npoints \nlead \nheading \ninto \nMisano, \nBut  \nthen \ncame \nRainey’s \ncrash; \nthe \nWorld \nChampionship \nwas \ndecided \nin \nSchwantz’s \nfavor, \nbut \nunder \nthe \nworst \npossible \ncircumstances. \nKevin \nSchwantz \nhad \nfinally \nachieved \nthe \ngoal \nthat \nhad \neluded \nhim \nfor \nso \nlong, \nbut \nthere \nwas \nlittle \nto \ncelebrate. \nHe \nwould \ngo \nthrough \nthe \nmotions \nat \nthe \nfinal \ntwo \nraces \nof \nthe \nseason, \ntaking \nfourth and  third, but  things would never be the same: \nThere is no  doubt that [Rainey’s crash] had  a  huge impact on  me.  | \ncalled Suzuki at  the  end  of that year and  said, “I’m going to  do  my \ndamnedest to  come back and ride in  1994, but  after seeing what's \nhappened to  Wayne, I'm  not  sure that  I'll be able to.” \nSchwantz did return to defend his title, and, ironically, it was  an  injury that \nhelped him  find  his tocus: \nWhat helped me  was falling off  my  mountain bike and breaking \nmy  arm three weeks before the  first  Grand Prix. At  that  point, I had \nsomething else  to  focus on,  instead of thinking, “S**t, there is just  no \nway... What am  I going to do?

We  put on  such a great race, and  had  it not  been for \nthe  Stoner-Rossi showdown [in the  premier class event], we  would have \nblown every other race  away for that  entire weekend. \nSadly, the  Red  Bull  AMA Rookie’s Cup was  not  to last.  The  series was \ncancelled before the 2009 season due  to a lack  of funding.

He would tell  me  how his grandson was  very very \ndetermined and should be a good racer, so  I put Sete  on  the team.” \nRiding a Yamaha for Team Roberts, Kenny Jr. won a few races and took \nsecond in the  points ahead of Gibernau, despite Kenny breaking his arm \nlate  in the season. The young American had  shown that  he had  the talent \nto  race in  the  World Championship. The  opportunity to  do  so  in  1994 \ncame from a family friend. \nON  THE WORLD STAGE \nIt \njust \nso  \nhappened \nthat  \nWayne \nRainey \nwas  \nfielding \na  \n250cc \nteam \nin  \nthe \n1994 \nWorld \nChampionship. \nRoberts \nJr. \nwas \na \nnatural \nchoice \nfor \none \nof \nthe \nMarlboro \nYamaha \nseats, \nwith \nJapanese \nrider \nTetsuya \nHarada \ncoming \naboard \nas \nhis \nteammate. \nThe \nfledgling \nteam \nstruggled \nin \nits \nfirst \nseason, \na \nyear \nthat \nsaw \nHonda \nand \nAprilia \ndominate. \nMax \nBiaggi \nrode \nhis \nAprilia \nto \nfive \nwins \nto \nsecure \nthe \ntitle; \nHarada \nwas \nthe \nhighest \nplaced \nYamaha \nin \nseventh, \nwhile \nRoberts \nfinished \nout \nthe \nseason \na \ndisappointing \neighteenth. \nHis \nbest \nfinish \nwas \na \nsixth \nin \nArgentina. \n\nDYNASTY: KENNY ROBERTS JR. \nRoberts \nand \nMarlboro \nYamaha \nfound \ntheir \nstride \nthe \nnext \nseason, \nthough. \nThe  \nyoung \nAmerican \nmoved \nup  \nto  \neighth \nin  \nthe  \npoints, \nalthough \nhe \nwas \nonce \nagain \ntopped \nby \nHarada, \nwho \nfinished \nrunner-up \nto \nBiaggi \nfor \nthe \ntitle. \n“The \n250 \nwas \njust \nnot \nmy \nkind \nof \nriding \nstyle? \nsays \nRoberts \nJr. \n“It’s \nall \ncorner \nspeed \nand \nnot \na \nlot \nof \nsliding. \nThere \nis \nnot \na \nlot \nhappening; \nit \nis \nall \nabout \nmomentum—not \nspinning, \nnot \nsliding—and \nbeing \nsuper \nsmooth. \nAs \na \ndirt \ntracker, \ngrowing \nup \non \nmotocrossers, \nyou \nwant \nthe \nthing \nmoving \naround” \nBut  \nRoberts \nhad  \ndone \nenough \nin \n250cc \nto  \nearn \na \nspot \nin \nthe \ntop \nclass \nfor  \n1996. \nHe \nmade \nhis \n500cc \nWorld \nChampionship \ndebut \nriding \nhis \nfather’s \nRoberts \nYamaha, \nfinishing \nthirteenth \nin his \nfirst \nseason. \nThe 23-year-old \nwas \none \nof \nmany \ntop-notch \nriders \nwho \ncould \nnot make \nthe Yamaha \ncompetitive \nin \nthat \npost-Rainey, \npre-Rossi \nera. \n(The \nfact \nthat \nMick \nDoohan \nand \nHonda \nwere \nsweeping \nall \nbefore \nthem \ndidn't \nhelp \neither.) \nRoberts’ \nbest \nfinish \nthat \nyear \nwas \nfourth \nat the \nCzech \nround, \nand \nhe \nalso \nhad \nthree \nother \ntop-six \nfinishes. \nThe \nworld \nchampion’ \nson \nhad \nproven \nthat \nhe \ncould \nproduce \nresults \nat the highest level and had done it while struggling with injuries: \nI was  hurt. I broke my ankle at the beginning of 1996 and had twenty- \ntwo  screws and two  plates put into  my ankle. I rode the first quarter of \nthe year injured, but I had some of the fastest laps in the races. I didn’t \nhave the experience at the time and that was  the biggest thing. I think \nwe  could have made the Yamaha competitive, but I only had one  year. \nMick Doohan said that I was  one  of the  up-and-coming guys, and \nthen I got on  my dad’s bike for the  next two  years. \nKenny \nand  \nKenny \nJr. \ntogether \nmoved \nfrom \nthe  \nYamaha \neffort \nto  \na  \nnew \nventure \nstarted \nby \nKenny \nusing \na \nnew \ndesign \nknown \nas \nthe \nModenas \nKR3. \nThe \nconcept \nof \na \nnarrow \nV-3 \ntwo-stroke \nwas \nunique \nin \nGP \nracing, \nbut \nin \nexecution \nit \naccomplished \nless \nthan \nwas \nexpected, \nand \nthe \nteam \nstruggled \nwith \nvarious \nversions \nof \nthe \nMalaysian-built \nmachine, \nlater \nknown \nas \nProton. \nKenny \nJr. \nlooks \nback \non  \nthose \ndays: \nIt \nwas  \nhard, \nbecause \nyou  \nare  \nriding \nas  \nhard \nas  \nyou  \ncan  \nfor  \npositions \nthat \naren't \nas  \ngood \nas  \nyou \nshould \nbe \nable \nto \nachieve. \nIt \nwas  \nfrustrating \n[37 \n\n158 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nriding \nthe  \nthree-cylinder \ntrying \nto  \nkeep \nup  \nwith \nthe  \nfour-cylinders. \nOur \nteam \nwas \ntrying \nto \nget \nan \nadvantage \n[with \nthree \ncylinders \ninstead \nof \nfour], \nbut \nit \njust \ndidn’t \nwork \nout \nthat \nway. \nThen \n[the \nFIM] \nswitched \nto \nfour-strokes \n[for \n2002]. \nA \nlot \nof \nit \nwas \nprobably \ndown \nto \nbad \ntiming. \nFor \nperspective, \nits  \nimportant \nto  \nnote \nthat \neveryone \nwas \nstrug- \ngling \nto  \nkeep \nup  \nwith \nDoohan \nand \nHonda \nat  \nthis \ntime. \nBut \nthe \nModenas were far  from the best of  the rest, and decent results were \nfew  and far  between for  Roberts Jr.  A  lowly sixteenth in  the  points \nin  1997 was  followed by thirteenth in  1998. By that time, it  was clear \nthat if Kenny Jr.  wanted to  achieve GP  success, it  would not  be  on \nthe Modenas. \nONWARD AND UPWARD \nWhile Kenny Jr.  was struggling through unproductive years on  his \nfather’s team, Suzuki had been in  a  steady decline since Schwantz's \nretirement. Daryl Beattie had  taken the  fight to  Doohan and  Honda in \n1995, taking second in  the  championship, but  Suzuki had  not  seen the \ntop step  of the  podium since. “I don’t think we  did  anything particularly \nwrong,’ Stuart Shenton recalls. “It’s just that  other teams did  a better job \nthan us,  and  Honda was  getting its  act  together. In  those days, [Honda \nwas] pretty tough to  beat.” Indeed, Mick Doohan and Honda won the \nWorld Championship for  Honda for  five straight years from 1994 \nthrough 1998. \nWorld Superbike champion Scott Russell had spent some time \non  \nthe  \nSuzuki \nand \nexperienced \nits  \nviolent \ntemper \nfirsthand. \n“It  \ndidmt \nhave \na  \nslipper \nclutch \nin  \nit  \nlike  \nId  \nbeen \nriding \nin  \nSuperbike. \nIt  \nswung \naround \nso  \nfast; \nit  \nslung \nme  \nover \nthe  \ntop, \nslapped \nme  \non  \nthe  \nground, \nand \nbroke \ntwo \ntoes. \nI  \nwas \nlying \nin  \nthe  \ngravel \ntrap \nsaying, \n“What \njust happened?” \nKevin \nSchwantz \nhas \nsimilar \nmemories: \n“Beattie \nwent \nfast \non  \nit \nwhen \nI \nleft, \nbut  \nwhen \nKenny \nJr. \ncame \nalong, \nhe \ntold  \nme,  \n‘I \ndon’t \nknow \nhow \nyou \nguys rode that  f**king thing.” \n\nDYNASTY: KENNY ROBERTS JR. \n“A \nfairer \nstatement \nis \nthat  \nI \ndidn’t \nsee  \nhow \nKevin \nhad \nbeen \nable  \nto \ndo \nwhat \nhe \nhad  \ndone \nwith \nthe \nlittle \nengineering \ndepartment \nthat  \nthey \nhad,” \nsays \nRoberts: \nAt  \none  \npoint, \nI \nwanted \nto  \ntest  \nthe  \n180-degree \ncrank \nmotor, \nand  \nthey \nhad \nit \nready \nfor \nthe \nnext  \ntest.  \nAt \nfirst, \nI \nwas  \nthinking, \n“This \nis \nawesome, \nhow \ndid \nthey \ndo \nthis \nso \nfast?” \nWell, \nthey \nhad \nbrought \na \ncrank \nin \na \nbag \nof oil; \nit \nwas \nKevin's \ncrankshaft \nfrom \n1993. \nSo \nI was \non \nthe \nsame \nmotor \nthat \nKevin \nhad \nridden \nin \n1993. \nRoberts signed with Suzuki for the  1999 season. Moving to a full \nfactory team might have seemed like  a  step up,  but  Roberts would \nsoon have his hands full  trying to tame the  Suzuki GP bike, working \nwith the team’s relatively modest engineering department. \nFortunately for Roberts and  Suzuki, Kenny Jr. had  access to the talents of \nWarren Willing, who had  moved from the KR team, to serve as  technical \ndirector for the  Suzuki 500cc GP  program. Roberts was  able  to  make the \nmost of this  budget-limited package. “When I got  on  the  Suzuki, I was \nquick out  of the  gate on  it.  It wasn’t so  bad  right out  of the  box, but  we \nhad a lot of chassis problems with the feel.  Warren softened the chassis up \nand that helped some of the feel problems that we  were having. The thing \nwasnt perfect, but  it was  maneuverable with an  okay engine.” \n“Quick out  of the gate” might be an  understatement: Roberts shocked \nthe GP world by winning the first two  races of the season, besting Doohan \nat Malaysia and  Suzuka. To  the surprise of everyone, Roberts and  Suzuki \nwere \nchallenging \nHondas \ndominance. \nAfter \nDoohan’s \ncareer-ending \ninjury \nat \nrace \nthree \nin \nSpain, \nRoberts’ \nmain \ntitle \nrival \nwould \nbe \nDoohans \nteammate, \nSpaniard \nAlex \nCriville. \nThe \nnew \nHonda \nteam \nleader \nrose \nto \nthe \nchallenge \nto \nwin \nfive \nof \nthe \nnext \nsix \nraces, \nwith \nDoohans \nreplacement, \nTadayuki \nOkada, \nwinning \nthe \nother. \nRoberts \nresponded \nwith \na \nsecond \nat \nAssen \nand \na \nwin \nat \nthe \nGerman \nGP, \nbut \nsubsequent \nwins \nby \nOkada \nand \nCriville \nbegan \nto \npush \nthe \nchampionship \nout \nof \nreach. \nThe \nnext \nround \nwas  \nValencia, \nwhere \nRoberts \nhad \nto \nmount \na \nchallenge. \nAustralian \nGarry \nMcCoy, \nwho \nshared \nthe  \npodium \nwith \nKenny \nthat  \nday, \nee) \n\n160 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nrecalls, \n“I \ngot \nthe  \nfirst  \npodium \non  \nthe  \nRed \nBull  \nYamaha, \nand  \nKenny \nwas \nsecond. \nI \nhad \na \nbit \nof \na \ndice \nwith \nhim, \nwe \nhad \na \nbit \nof \na \npush \nand \na \nshove; \nnothing \ntoo \naggressive \nor \ndirty. \nWe \nalways \nget \nalong \nwell, \nand \nhe \nwas \na \ntough \ncompetitor, \nthat’s \nfor \nsure. \nAfter \nall, \nhe \ngot \nsecond \nand \nI \ngot \nthird. \nWe \nspoke \nafter \nthe \nrace \nand \nhad \na \nbit \nof \na \nlaugh \nabout \nit.” \nDespite \nRoberts’ \ndetermination, \nthe  \ntitle \nall  \nbut  \nslipped \naway \nat  \nthe \nnext \nround \nat \nPhillip \nIsland. \nThe \nAmerican \nhad \nto \nsettle \nfor \ntenth, \nwhile \nOkada \nwon \nand \nCriville \nfinished \nfifth. \nA \nthird \nplace \nin \nBrazil \nand \na \nfourth \nwin \nin \nthe \nfinal \nGP \nof \nthe \nseason \nallowed \nRoberts \nto \nfinish \nthe \nseason \nsecond \nin \npoints, \nsplitting \nthe \nHondas. \nWhile the victories and  podiums were encouraging, a lack of consis- \ntency proved to be Suzuki’s undoing. As  in the  Schwantz years, the  great \nresults mixed with a thirteenth in Spain, twenty-second in  South Africa, \nand  a  DNF in  France. There was  no  way  of telling where Roberts might \nfinish on  any given weekend. \nRoberts remembers vividly the  trials and  tribulations of that up-and- \ndown season: \nIn Spain, on  the  first  lap, my teammate [Nobu] Aoki ran  into  the  back \nof me,  knocked me  off the  track, and  I was  dead last. I got back up to \nseventh or eighth, but a rock had gotten into  the airbox, and  I ended up \nfinishing on  three cylinders. In South Africa, we had a shock overheat. In \nFrance, we  took a front tire and mounted it on  a narrower rim.  I pushed \nthe front on  lap one, the  rear  stepped out,  and  I high-sided; it was  a big \nhigh-side. From then on,  we  were just  trying to  achieve second in the \nchampionship, and we  achieved that. I told myself, “I’m  not  falling down \nagain. I am  not  going to win  the World Championship falling down like \nthis. I cannot keep doing these stupid crashes and giving up points.” \nTHE CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON \nThe  \npieces \nwould \nfall  \ninto \nplace \nin  \n2000, \nhowever, \nas  \nSuzuki \ndelivered \nthe \nkind \nof \nconsistency \nand \nreliability \nneeded \nto \nfight \nfor \nthe \nworld \ntitle. \nRoberts’ \nmain \nrival \nwould \nbe \nMcCoy, \nand \nthe \nAustralian \nshowed \nhimself \nto \nbe \na \nforce \nby \nriding \nhis \nYamaha \nto \nvictory \nin \nthe \nseason \nopener. \nRoberts \n\nDYNASTY: KENNY ROBERTS JR. \nresponded \nwith \na  \nvictory \nin  \nthe  \nsecond \nrace \nin  \nMalaysia \nwhile \nMcCoy \ntook \nthird \nto \nhold \na \nslim \npoints \nadvantage \ngoing \ninto \nSuzuka. \nA \nsecond \nin \nJapan, \nfollowed \nby \ntwo \nwins \nand \ntwo \nsixths \nin \nthe \nfollowing \nfour \nevents, \nsolidified \nRoberts’ \nlead \nin \nthe \npoints. \nDid  \nGarry \nMcCoy \nconsider \nthe  \nSuzuki \nto  \nbe  \nthe  \nsuperior \nbike \nthat \nseason? \n“Nah, \n| \nthink \nwe \nwere \non \npretty \nmuch \nequal \nequipment, \nalthough \nI \ndid \nhave \nsome \nbad \nluck \nthat \nyear \nwith \nsome \naccidents \nand \nmechanical \nproblems.” \nRoberts \nagrees. \n“I \nthink \nthat \nthe \nYamaha \nwas \nequal \nequipment, \nbut \nI \ndon't \nknow \nthat \nGarry \nwas \non \nthe \nbest \nYamaha. \nI \nthink \n[Max] \nBiaggi \nwas \ntheir \nmain \nfocus.” \nAfter suffering through a  DNF at  Assen, Roberts bounced back at \nDonington Park to  take second behind Honda's rookie 500cc racer, the \nup-and-coming Valentino Rossi. Roberts’ title quest was  aided by the fact \nthat  the  season had  seen seven different winners in the first  nine races— \nRoberts’ three wins made him  the only repeat winner. \nRoberts understood that 2000 was going to  be  his  best chance to \nfollow in  his  father’s footsteps as  world champion. He  says, “We knew \nthat Valentino was  strong, and  anybody who could get it together on  a \nHonda would be strong. It was  our  time and we  had  to take  this champi- \nonship; otherwise it was  not  going to be ours, and Honda would have had \na ten-plus year winning streak. It was  a special place in time.” \nValentino Rossi recalls going up  against Roberts during that 2000 \nseason: “Kenny was  very determined, and  he  never gave up.  But  to  be \nhonest, in that  year I wasn't thinking so  much about the  championship, \njust about learning and trying to  win  races.” \nRoberts \nexplains \nthat  \nSuzuki \nstarted \nout  \nthe \nseason \nwith \nan  \nadvantage \nover the Hondas, but that  advantage soon slipped away: \nWe \nhad \na \nchassis \nadvantage \nfor \nthe \nfirst \nhalf \nof \nthe \nseason; \nthe \nadvantage \nwas  \nin \nturning \nand \nin \nus \nhaving \na \nlack \nof \nhorsepower. \nWe \nwere \non  \n17-inch \ntires \nthat \ndidn't \nhave \na \nlot \nof \nside \ngrip. \nThe \nHondas \nhad \na \nlot \nof \nacceleration \nbut \nthey \ncouldn’t \nuse \nit. \nWe \nswitched \nto \n16-inch \ntires \nhalfway \nthrough \nthe \nyear, \nand \nthat \nwas \nthe \nnail \nin \nthe \ncoffin \nat \nSuzuki. \nI \nkept \ncomplaining \nto \nthem \nthat \nwe  \ndidn’t \nhave \nenough \nhorsepower \nand \nthat \nthe \nengine \nhad \n161 \n\n162 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nto \nbe \ndeveloped. \nWe \nslowly \nmade \nprogress, \nbut \nit \nwas  \nnothing \nlike \nwhat \nHonda \nwas \ndoing; \nthey \nwere \nmaking \nprogress \nhand \nover \nfist. \nAs \nsoon \nas \nthey \ngot \nside \ngrip \nwith \nthe \n16-inch \ntires \nand \nthey \ngot \nit \nturning \nwith \na \nbigger \ncontact \npatch, \nwe \nwere \ndead. \nThat \nwas \nhalfway \nthrough \nthe \nseason. \nHondas \nwould \ncome \nout \nof \nthe \ncorner, \nnailing \nit, \nand \nthey \nhad \nthe \ngrip \nto \ngo. Wed be coming out full, and it's not even spinning. \nHowever, \nthe \nconsistency \nshown \nby \nRoberts \nand \nSuzuki \nwould \nbe \nenough \nto continue \nscoring \nsubstantial \npoints \nwhen \nhe \nwasn’t \nwinning. \nAs the \nseason \nwore \non, Roberts \nracked \nup \nan insurmountable \npoints \nlead \nand \nclinched \nthe \ntitle \nwith \ntwo \nraces \nremaining. \nHis last \nthree \nfinishes \nfor \nthe \nyear \nwere \ntypical \nof \nthe \nentire \nseason: \nsixth, \nfirst, \nand \nseventh. \nKenny \nRoberts \nJr. \nwas \nthe \nfirst \nsecond-generation, \npremier \nclass \nmotorcycle \nworld \nchampion, \nand he \nremains \nthe only \none to \ndate. \nKenny Roberts Jr. takes special pride in the fact that he won his World \nChampionship in the two-stroke era: \n“T rode with Eddie, quite a bit with Wayne, and  obviously my  dad. It \nwas  my childhood dream to be able  to win  it in the  500  class, during the \nera  when the  bikes were extremely difficult to  ride. It was  everything I \nwanted. The  power-to-weight ratio of those bikes and  the  precision you \nhad  to  have—there was  nothing even close. One tiny little mistake on  a \n500  and  you  fell  down. From a rider’s standpoint, the  [four-stroke 990s \nthat  made up the  MotoGP class from 2002 through 2006] were probably \nthe most fun.  But  for very precise riding, there was  nothing like  a 500  on \n17-inch tires. There was  nothing even close. \nSete Gibernau, who joined Suzuki in  2001 for  that final year of the \n500cc class, agrees. “The 500s were something special. You  really needed \nto \nunderstand \nthe \nbike; \nyou \nreally \nhad \nto \nadapt \nyourself \nto \nwin \nwith \na \n500. \nIf you  didn't, you  would never win.” \nHARD LANDING \nUnfortunately, \nthe \n2001 \nseason \nwould \nbe \na \ndisappointing \none  \nfor \nRoberts \nand  \nGibernau. \nAny \nhopes \nthat \nKenny \nJr. \nmight \nbe  \nable \nto  \nfollow \nin  \nhis \nfather’s \nfootsteps \nas  \na \nrepeat \nchampion \nwere \nsoon \ndashed \nby \nthe \nmight \nof \n\nDYNASTY: KENNY ROBERTS JR. \nHonda \nand \nValentino \nRossi. \n“At \nSuzuki, \nwe \nraced \nthe \nsame \nbike \nin \n2000 \nthat \nwe \nraced \nin \n2001,” \nRoberts \nexplains. \n“Whoever \nspends \nthe \nmost \nmoney \nis \ngoing \nto \nget \nthe \nbest \noutcome. \nOur \nwindow \nhad \ncome \nand \ngone. \nKenny \nRoberts \nSr. \nhad \nbeen \nworking \nwith \nSuzuki \nbehind \nthe \nscenes \nin \n2000 \nand \n2001, \nand \nhe \nwitnessed \nthe \nteam’s \nrapid \ndecline \nfirsthand. \n“The \nyear \nthat \n[Kenny \nJr.] \nwon \nthe \nchampionship, \nwe \nwere \nhelping \nwith \nthe \ndevelopment—cylinders \nand \nexhaust \npipes, \nporting, \nrunning \nthem \non \na \ndyno—stuft \nlike \nwhat \nwe \nhad \ndone \nwith \nYamaha, \ntrying \nto \nhelp \na \nlittle \nbit. \nBut \nafter \n2000 \nwe \nstopped; \n[Suzuki] \nran \nout \nof \nbudget. \nThey \ncouldn't \nafford \nto \nhave \nus \nhelp \nthem.” \nGibernau continues, “We were not  getting the  things that  Kenny had \nbeen asking for  in  2000, things that  we  needed to  go that  one  more step \nforward. All the other teams went forward, and the Suzukis just stayed there. \nIt was  very frustrating. The whole year Kenny and I were at the back.” \nNot  only was  the bike slower, it was  also  unreliable. Five DNFs would \ncontribute to  a miserable eleventh-place finish in the  standings, with his \nteammate Gibernau in ninth. The  season's highlight was  Gibernau’s win \nand Roberts’ third place in  the  wet  at  Valencia. This was  Roberts’ only \npodium of the season. \nThe Valencia result was  emotional for  a number of reasons. Not only was  it \nthe maiden win for the Spanish crowd's favorite son, it was  also the first Grand \nPrix held following the nightmare of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \non  New York and Washington D.C. Stopping on  his victory lap, Gibernau set \nAmerican and  Spanish flags into  the gravel trap  in front of the main grand- \nstand as  an  expression of solidarity with the people of the United States.

We ended up \nswitching three races into  the year back to Michelin. It was  a cluster— \ntrying to find an  advantage when you arent on  even equipment, trying \nto make up for a lack of horsepower.

Wed make an  improvement every year, \nbut it was  nowhere near the steps others made; we  were so  far behind. \nBasically the  electronics were really bad  on  it, and  we  were trying \neverything. Basically it seemed like  trial and  error. Wed have a lot of \nelectronic problems that  would either cause crashes or  breakdowns. \nRoberts became increasingly frustrated with Suzuki’s struggles. In \naddition, his  approach to  risk  taking was  becoming tempered with age, \nespecially in comparison to his ambitious young teammate: \nJohn went out  and risked everything. He  had a  couple of broken \nankles, he broke a bone in his wrist, chipped some teeth. He went out \nonto that  ledge to prove he was  fast, but I was  like,  “Screw this.” I told \nJohn, “Dude, you are  going to hurt yourself. This  isn’t the way to do it. \nYou  ought to think about what you  are  doing.” \nYou  have to  have an  end  goal, and  my end  goal was  to be able  to \nwalk away from the sport and  still  be able  play golf, or  play tennis, or \nracquetball, or  basketball, soccer, baseball. I didn’t want to  leave the \nsport at thirty-five and  not  be able  to run. I wanted to win  the World \nChampionship and  then walk away when my career was  done.

The  change clearly re-energized the  former world \nchampion as  well  as  the  team. Roberts Jr. was  particularly impressed by \nthe  Honda engine. “The chassis was  never even close to  what we  thought \nit was. We had made a lot of mistakes within the group. But  the bike had  a \ngood engine, and with a good engine you  can  see  how much better it was \nto ride. It was  the best  engine that  I’ve ever ridden with,” Roberts says. \nThe KR211V proved to be a strong contender at  numerous races, with \nKenny \nRoberts \nJr. \nrode \nhis \nfather’s \nHonda-powered \nKR  \nwith \na \nspecial \nStars \nand \nStripes \nlivery \nat \nthe \n2006 \nUS \nMotoGP \nJoe \nBonnello \n\nDYNASTY: KENNY ROBERTS JR. \na \nbest \nfinish \nof \nthird \nat \nCatalunya. \nCertainly \nthe \nseason \nhighlight \nwas  \nwhen \nRoberts \nled \nthe \nfirst \nlap \nof \nthe \nUnited \nStates \nGrand \nPrix; \nit \nwas \narguably \nthe \nhighlight \nof \nthe \nentire \nhistory \nof \nKR \nracing \nin \nthe \npost-Yamaha \nera. \nKenny \nJr. \nremembers \nthat \nrace \nwell, \nbut \nnot \nfor \ngood \nreasons. \nThe \nbrutal \nheat was  nearly unbearable: \nIt  was torture. That weekend was ridiculously hot; that’s all  I \nremember. For  me,  it was  the  hottest Grand Prix race that  I’ve  ever \nraced in, by far. The track temperature was  157  [degrees F]. It was just \nridiculous—no breeze, no  time to  rest  on  this  track; it was  just sick. I \njust wanted that  race done. Chris [Vermeulen, Roberts’ replacement \nat  Suzuki] passed me  going into the  last  turn of the  first  lap, and  I \nremember thinking, “If you want to lead, dude, go ahead, because it’s \nway too  f**king hot  to  be  fighting for  the  lead on  the  first  lap.” He \ntook off and  atomized the  fuel  on  the  Suzuki about three-quarters \nof the way  through, so  we  passed him. Valentino passed us,  then his \nYamaha blew up.  Nicky [Hayden] won, Dani [Pedrosa] was second, \n[Marco] Melandri was third, and I was fourth. We  all  wanted that \nrace  done. The last three laps, Melandri was  looking over his shoulder \nand I was trying to  catch him, but  when we  stopped we  were all \njust destroyed. \nThe  team might have earned a win  at the  Portuguese GP  at Estoril, were \nit not  for a lapse in concentration from Roberts. His  father explains how \nKenny Jr. dropped from the lead down to third on  the last lap: “He thought \nthe next-to-the-last lap was  the last lap. He didn’t look at his pit board; he \nhad looked at Valentino’s. The checkered didn’t come out, and he was like, \n‘What happened?’ So he ended up third” \nA fourth at  Brno helped to  lift  the  team to  sixth in  the  final points \nstandings, \ngiving \nRoberts \nhis \nbest \nfinish \nsince \nhis \nchampionship \nyear. \nThe \nteam \ncarried \nhigh \nhopes \ninto \n2007, \nthe \nfirst \nyear \nof \nthe \n800cc \nMotoGP \nformula. \nIt \nwasn’t \nto \nbe, \nhowever. \nThe \nV-4 \nHonda \n800 \nwas \nunderpow- \nered \ncompared \nto \nthe \ncompetition \nfrom \nDucati \nand \nYamaha, \nand \nKenny \nJr’s \nthirteenth \nplace \nin  \nthe  \nseason \nopener \nat  \nMalaysia \nwould \nbe \n167 \n\n168 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nthe highlight. \nHonda’ \nstruggles \nwere \na \nsurprise \nto \nmany, \nincluding \nRoberts \nJr.: \nWe \nfigured \nthat \nwhatever \nengine \nthey \nwere \ngoing \nto \nbuild, \nwed \njust \nput \nit \nin \nand \nit \nwould \nbe \nperfect. \nIt \nturned \nout \nto \nbe \nthe \nexact \nopposite. \nYou \nnever \nwould \nhave \nthought \nthat \nHonda \nwould \nhave \none \nof \nthe \nworst \npackages \nright \nout \nof \nthe \ngate; \nyoud \nhave \nthought \ntheyd \nhave \nbeen \nthe \nbest. \nThe \nbike \nwas \njust \nhorrible. \nIt \nwas \na \nhalf-second \noff \nfrom \nlast \nplace. \nThe \nengine \nwas \njust... \nnothing \nthere. \nWhen \nthe \nbike \nwas \nperfect, \nit \nwas \ntwo \nor \nthree \ntenths \nslower \nthan \nthe \nfifteenth \nspot. \nWe \nfinished \nevery \nrace \ndead \nlast. \nI \nwas \ndone. \nI \nsaid \nI didn’t \nwant \nto \nride \nthis \nthing, \ndidn't \nwant \nto \nend \nmy \ncareer \nfalling \ndown \non \nsomething \nI'm \ngoing \nto \nbe \nfinishing \ndead \nlast \nwith. \nSo [Kenny Jr’s brother] Kurtis, if he’s having fun doing it, let him have it. \nJoined by his brother Kurtis for the Misano round, Kenny finished seven- \nteenth while his brother DNFd. A sixteenth at  the  Circuit de Catalunya \nahead of his brother in eighteenth was  enough for  Kenny Jr.; he decided \nthat  racing the  machine was  pointless in its current configuration. \nRoberts’ decision to  stop racing wasn't meant as  a permanent retire- \nment from the  sport; at  the  time, he believed that further chassis devel- \nopment would permit a  competitive return later in  the  season. But  the \nstruggles continued at Team KR.  At the  United States Grand Prix, Kurtis \nwas  unable to keep tires under the bike; there was  no  way  the bike could \nmake the finish without a pit stop for a tire  change. At the event, Kenny Jr. \nwas  often seen  at his father’s paddock motorhome, but to the frustration of \nall \nin \nattendance, \nthe \nman \nwho \nhad \nled \nthe \nprevious \nyear’s \nGP \ndidn't \nrace. \nThe GP  racing career of Kenny Roberts Jr. was  over. \nKenny \nRoberts \nSr. \nsums \nup \nthe \ncareer \nof \nhis \nworld \nchampion \nson: \nKenny \nwas  \na \ngood \nracer. \nHe \nhad  \nall \nthe \nqualities \nto \nbe \na \ngreat \nracer, \nand \nwhen \nhe \nwanted \nto \nwin, \nhe \nwon. \nHe  \nhad \neverything \nit \ntook \nto \ndo \nit; \nthe \nproblem \nwas \nthe \nequipment. \nWhen \nthe \nequipment \nstarted \nlacking, \nhe \nwas \ndone. \nHe \ndidirt \ngo \nto \nHonda, \ndidn't \ngo \nto \nYamaha; \nhe \nstayed \nwith \nSuzuki \nwhen \nthe \nbike \nwasn't \ncapable \nof \nwinning \na \nWorld \nChampionship. \n\nDYNASTY: KENNY ROBERTS JR. \nMeanwhile, the  history of Team KR  was  coming to  its  own end. Kurtis \nwas  unable to achieve anything better than his older brother in the way of \nresults—the highlight of his 2007 season was  a twelfth at the Sachsenring, \nfollowed by DNFs in  four of the  final eight GPs. Unable to  secure suffi- \ncient sponsorship, Team KR  closed its  doors before the  start of  the \n2008 season. \nKenny Roberts Jr.,  for  one, was  not  a  fan  of the  800cc bikes and  the \nsports heavy reliance on  electronics. And he will  tell  you  so  in  the  blunt \nmanner made famous by his father. “That's what MotoGP is like  now. You \nride  out  of your mind and  out  of your bike's ability to finish fourteenth. If \nyou  don't have the  best electronics package or  the  best engine mapping, \nthat’s where you  are  at.  It’s not  a riding style that  makes sense. It’s a riding \nstyle that’s all about corner speed.” \nSete Gibernau, who returned to  the  sport briefly in  2009, has  similar \nopinions about the  sport’s current fascination with high-tech: \nWith the  800s, I'm  just  trying to  get  them to... think [laughs].

I have to thank him  for all my championships.” \nKenny Roberts is certainly proud of all  of his world champion protégés, \nalthough naturally, he  has  a  favorite. “I  didn't make all  of them; I only \nmade this one  [laughs, nodding to Kenny Jr.].

That was  his whole focus, \nand  that was  his  everything. There was no,  ‘I’ve got  to  hurry and go  to \ndinner, or  things like that.” \nThis grit and determination are  driven by an  intense competitiveness \nthat  belies Hayden's easy smile and  charm. “He hates to  lose more than \nanybody I’ve ever known,’ says  his older brother, Tommy. These qualities \ncarried Nicky Hayden from the  small town of Owensboro, Kentucky, \nto  the  world stage of MotoGP, where the  riding skills range between \ngifted and  surreal.

Earl and Rose Hayden made every sacrifice to allow their kids to \nrace, and they wasted no  time in doing so,  as  Earl  explains: \nTommy's first race was with training wheels the  week before he \nwas three years old. The next week, I  took the  training wheels \noff.  [Nicky's older sister] Jenny and  Nick started at  about three and a \nhalf. {Nicky's younger brother] Roger was  four. I got kind ofa  late start \nwith him. Not long ago,  somebody asked me  when their kid, who was \nseven, should start racing. I said, “I think you're about three or  four \nyears late.” They looked at me  like  I was  crazy. \nNicky’s development was  surely accelerated by the fact that  he had  to try \nto keep up with Tommy, who was  three years his senior. The older brother \nrecalls the many hours they spent racing on  their backyard track: \nThat’s where we  really started riding; we  still ride there a lot to this day. \nWe've had a lot of good races there, had a lot of fun, and learned a lot. \nLooking at  the  videos from back then, not  much has  changed really \nfrom fifteen years ago.

The injuries \nsuffered by Miguel Duhamel at Road Atlanta had  provided the opportunity \nfor Hayden to  ride  a top-tier highly developed factory Superbike. His  main \nrival for  the  600  Supersport Championship would be his  brother Tommy. \nThe season would unfold as a close-fought battle, but Nicky’s five wins would \nprevail, and  the younger brother took the  title  with 372  points to  Tommy’s \n364. Both Haydens finished ahead of a  strong field of AMA stars of the future, \nincluding Kurtis Roberts, Jamie Hacking, Aaron Yates, and Josh Hayes. \nTommy Hayden recalls their 1999 sibling rivalry: \nThe  highlight was  the  race that we  had  at  Ohio. On  the  last  lap, we \nbumped into each other two or  three times; we  went side-by-side \npretty \nmuch \nmost \nof \nthe \nway \naround \nthe \nlast \nlap. \nNick \nended \nup \nbeating \nme \nthere; \nit \nwas \na \nlittle \ndisappointing. \nI \nhad \nbeen \nfaster \nall \nweekend, \nand \nthis \nwas \na \nrace \nthat \nI \nneeded \nto \nwin. \nHe \ncame \nalive \nfor \nthe \nrace  \nand  \nmade \na  \nbattle \nout  \nof \nit. \nIt \nwas  \nfun  \nthat  \nwhole \nyear” \nNicky \nwas \narguably \nbetter \nin  \nthe  \nquicker \nFormula \nXtreme \nclass \nthat \nseason, \nwinning \nseven \nof \nten  \nraces, \nincluding \nthe  \nfinal \nfour \nin  \na  \nrow. \nYet \n\nGRIT AND DETERMINATION: NICKY HAYDEN \nthese \nresults \nweren't \nenough \nto  \ntake \nthe  \ntitle \nfrom \nthree-time \nwinner \nKurtis \nRoberts. \nWhile \ngoing \nall-out \nin \nthe \nlower \nclasses, \nthe \nhigh \nschool \nsenior \nused \na \nmore \nconservative \napproach \nto \nthe \nSuperbike \nclass, \nas  \nAl \nLudington \nexplains: \nWhen I dealt with him, I don’t think Nicky’s expectations were that \nhigh. It was more, “Let's see  what this  Superbike thing is all  about, \nget one  under my butt and  see.” In the other classes, he was  definitely \nriding fiery. But  Honda's thinking was, “Let’s throw one  more class at \nhim.’ So  he  was  riding three classes on  three different motorcycles. \nI think that  was  very difficult. \nEven as  a teenager, Nicky put his signature riding style on  full display. His \nskill at  backing the  bike into corners was a result of his  years of racing \non  dirt  ovals. “He's definitely a  rear-steerer, no  question about it;  says \nLudington. “But that  was  how you  had  to  steer them [in those days], as \nyou didnt have traction control. If you wanted to  finish the  corner— \nparticularly on  a Honda in that day and  age—you had  to  rear  steer it, as \nthe bikes weren't known for their brilliant cornering capabilities.” \n“Nicky likes to  slide the  bike around,’ says John Hopkins. “He  does \nthat more than any of the other riders.” \nAs if graduating from high school and racing in three different classes \nwasnt enough for  Nicky, in  1999 he  also competed in  Grand National \nevents (winning a half-mile dirt  track race and  taking dirt  track racing's \nRookie of the  Year award) and was named AMA Athlete of the  Year. The \nsky was  the limit for the well-grounded and focused Nicky Hayden. \nTHE SUPERBIKE YEARS \nFor 2000, he rode for the factory Honda team in AMA Superbike, fielding \nthe \nRC51, \nthe \nmanufacturer’s \nnew \nV-twin \nracer. \nNicky \nwas \nin \nthe \nright \nplace \nat \nthe \nright \ntime, \nas \nthe \nnew \nHonda \nchallenger \nproved \nto \nbe \na \nworthy \nmachine \nthat \nwas \ncapable \nof \ntaking \nthe \nfight \nto \nSuzuki \nand \ndefending \nchampion \nMat \nMladin. \nThe \ntitle \nfight \nwas \na \nclose-fought \nbattle, \nalthough \nin \nend \nthe \nAustralian \nnipped \nHayden \nby \njust \nfive \npoints—388 \nto \n383. \nNees \n\n176 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nNo \none  \nelse \nwas  \neven \nclose. \nThe \nmany \nhighlights \nof \nNicky's \nseason \nincluded \nhis \nfirst \nwin \n(a \ndouble \nat \nRoad \nAmerica) \nand \na \nwin \nat \nLaguna \nSeca \non \nWorld \nSuperbike \nweekend, \nthe \none \nrace \nof \nthe \nyear \nin \nwhich \nAmericans \nwere \nperforming \non \nthe \nworld \nstage. \nMladin \nwould \ndefend \nhis \ntitle \nonce \nagain \nin \n2001 \non \nthe \nnew  \nGSXR. \nAnd \nalthough \nEric \nBostrom \nbeat \nNicky \nto  \nsecond \nin \nthe  \npoints, \nHayden \ngave \na \nhint \nof \nthings \nto \ncome \nby \nwinning \nthe \nfinal \nfour \nraces \nof \nthe \nyear. \nMany \nfelt \nit \nwas \njust \na \nmatter \nof \ntime \nbefore \nHayden \nhad \nhis \nbreakout \nyear. \n“At \nthe \nend \nof \n2001, \nwe  \nchanged \nsome \nstuff \nand \nreally \ngot \ninto  \na \nrhythm \nwith \nthe \nbike \nand \nteam,” \nHayden \nrecalls. \n“Everything \nstarted \nto \nfall \ninto \nplace. \nFrom \nthere, \nwe \ncarried \nthat \nmomentum \nthrough \nwinter \ntesting. \nIt \nwas \na \ngreat \nyear \nfor \nme; \neverything \njust \nclicked. \nThe \nbike \nwas \ngreat; \nthe \nteam \nwas \nawesome; \neverybody \njust \nworked \nwell \ntogether \nand \neverybody \nknew \ntheir \njob. \nIt \nwas \nspecial \nto \nbe \npart \nof \nsomething \nlike \nthat \nwhen \neverybody \nwas \non \npoint.” \nAfter winning the season-opening Daytona 200,  Hayden reeled off five \nwins in  the  next six  races to  take a commanding lead in  the  points. By \nseasons end, he  was  trading wins with Eric Bostrom on  the  Kawasaki, \nbut  Bostrom’s effort was  too  little too  late. Hayden was  the  2002 AMA \nSuperbike champion on  the  strength of nine wins from 16  races. He  had \nalso broken the  Mladin- Yoshimura stranglehold on  the series: From 1999 \nuntil 2009, Nicky Hayden was  the only rider to beat the mighty Yoshimura \nSuzuki team for the championship. \nSomehow, in  the  midst of his  championship run, Hayden also found \ntime to compete in dirt track racing. He won four dirt track races, including \na \nnever-before-seen \nsweep \nof \nthe \npodium \nby \nthe \nHayden \nfamily \nat \nthe \nSpringfield \nT'T. \nWhen \ntime \npermitted, \nNicky \nalso \nshowed \nup \nat \nunsanc- \ntioned \nevents, \nsuch \nas \nthe \nparking \nlot \nSupermoto \nraces \nat \nAnaheim \nStadium. \nRacing \nall \nthe \ntime, \non \nanything \navailable, \nclearly \nwas \npaying \noff. \nNicky \nHayden \nhad  \nconquered \nAmerica: \nHe \nwas  \nnow \nready \nto \ntake  \non  \nthe \nworld. \nNO  EXCUSES \nNot  \nonly \ndid  \nthe  \n21-year-old \nmove \nup  \nto  \nMotoGP \nfor  \nthe  \n2003 \nseason, \nhe \nlanded \nthe \nbest \nseat \navailable: \nNicky \nHayden \nsigned \nto \nride \nfor \nthe \n\nGRIT AND DETERMINATION: NICKY HAYDEN \nRepsol \nHonda \nfactory \nteam \nas  \nteammate \nto \nValentino \nRossi, \nthe \nman \nwho \nis \nunquestionably \nthe  \ngreatest \nrider \nof \nhis \ntime. \nThe  \nHonda \nriders \nwould \nfield \nthe  \ndominant \nmachine \nof \nthe  \nday, \nthe  \nmighty \nV-5  \n990  \nHonda. \nFor \nHayden, \nthere \nwould \nbe \nno \nexcuses \nfor \na lack \nof \npace. \nSadly, \nthe  \nrookie’s \nGP  \ndebut \nat  \nSuzuka \nwould \nbe \nmarred \nby \ntragedy. \nDaijiro \nKato, \nHonda’ \nshaggy-haired \nfavorite \nson, \nwas \nmortally \ninjured \nin \na \ncrash. \n“It \nwas a \nbad \nsight,” \nNicky \nrecalls. \n“When \nI \nwas \ncoming \naround, \nhis \nboots \nwere \nin \nthe \nmiddle \nof \nthe \ntrack. \nIt was \ntough. \nIn \nthis \nsport, \nyou’ve \ngot \nto \nprepare \nyourself \nfor \nwhat \ncan \nhappen \nand \nknow \nthat you've \ngot \nto \nbe \nwilling \nto \npay the \nultimate \nprice. \nI \nnever \nreally \ngot \na \nchance \nto \nknow \nDaijiro \nor \nride \nwith \nhim.” \nSadly, the comatose Kato succumbed to his injuries two  weeks later. \nIn  the  race, Hayden finished seventh, less  than a  tenth of a  second \nbehind fellow American and MotoGP debutant Colin Edwards. “I started \nin the  back and  finished seventh,” Nicky recalls. “So  it wasn’t such a bad \nfirst GP  result for  me.  Our bike was  really good that  year, but  it was  a \nhard weekend.” \nThe first half of  Hayden’s debut season would best be  described \nas  unremarkable, as  he  came to  grips with the  new machinery, tracks, \nand tires. However, as  the  season progressed, his  results began to \nimprove, and he finished strong with a pair of fifths in Germany and Brazil \nfollowed by a pair of podiums in the last four races of the season. Hayden's \nlate-season form was  enough to  lift  him to  fifth in  the  points, ahead of \nTroy Bayliss on  the factory Ducati. \nHayden took advantage of the fact that he shared a garage with one  of \nthe  sport's greatest riders. He  says, “I watched [Rossi] and  his  crew and \nhow they did things. I certainly studied them, because they sure  knew what \nthey \nwere \ndoing. \nThey \nknew \nhow \nto \nput \na \nweekend \ntogether. \nRossi \nstarts \nout \non \nFriday \nand \nkeeps \nworking, \nworking \n. \n.. \nCome \nSunday \nafternoon, \nhe puts it all together.” \nHayden \nleft  \na  \npositive \nimpression \non  \nRossi: \n“Nicky \nwas \na  \ngood \nteammate, \nno  \ntrouble, \nno  \npolemics. \nHe \nis \na \nnice  \nguy.  \nIt \nwas  \nthe \nsame \nwith \nthe \nchampionship \nin \n2006, \nalways \nrespectful \nand \nfair \nbetween \nus.  \nI \nenjoyed \n. . . » \nracing against him. \n1 \nlyf \n/ 7 \n\n178 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \nRossi \nwould \nwin \nhis  \nthird \nstraight \ntitle \nfor  \nHonda \nin  \n2003 \nbefore \nsurprising \neveryone \nby \nmoving \nto \nYamaha. \nAlex \nBarros \nwas \nbrought \nin \nas \nHayden's \nteammate \nfor \n2004. \nNicky \nhad \nhoped \nthat \nhis  \nstrong \nfinish \nto  \nthe  \n2003 \nseason \nwould \ngive \nhim \nsome \nmomentum \ngoing \ninto \n2004. \nIt \nwas \nnot \nto \nbe, \nhowever. \nPodium \nfinishes \nin \nGermany \nand \nBrazil \nand \na \npair \nof \nfourths \nin \nEngland \nand \nMalaysia \nwere \nthe \nhighlights \nof \na \nmostly \ndisappointing \nseason. \nHayden \nfinished \neighth \nin \npoints, \na \nresult \nthat \nwas \nunacceptable \nto \nboth \nHayden \nand \nHonda: \nThat was  a  tough year.

I crashed and  broke my  collarbone training, and  it kind \nof set  the  season back. I missed a  race, came back a little bit  injured, \nand  hurt my knee, which kind of hurt my momentum. That was  the \nyear that  Honda basically cleaned house at  the  end  of the  year. They \nmade a lot of changes in personnel, the second half of the season was \na disaster, and a lot of the mechanics knew they weren't coming back, \nand the atmosphere wasn‘ a lot of fun. \nMaking matters worse was the  fact that Hayden had finished behind \nnot  only his  teammate Barros (fourth) but  also  behind four riders from \nHonda’ satellite teams. The 23-year-old managed to escape the off-season \nhousecleaning (unlike Barros, who was replaced by Max Biaggi), but he \nknew that  he needed to  show marked improvement in  2005 in  order to \nkeep his factory Honda ride. \nHayden \nrecalls \nthat \nthe  \nseason \ndid  \nnot  \nstart \non  \na  \npromising \nnote: \n“In \nthe  \nfirst \nrace \nat  \nJerez, \nI \ncrashed \nout  \nwhen \nI \nwas \nrunning \nthird \nwith \na  \nfew \nlaps \nto \ngo.” \nThe \nseason \nwould \nturn \nout  \nto \nbe \na \nchampionship \nbattle \nbetween \nRossi \nand  \nGibernau. \nBut  \nHayden \nshowed \nsteady \nimprovement \nas  \nthe \nyear \nwent \non.  \n“We \nkind \nof \nhad \na \nslow \nstart \ngoing, \nbut  \nI \nhad  \nbasically \na \nwhole \nnew \nteam. \nAbout \nmidseason, \nabout \nthe \ntime \nwe \ngot \nto \nAssen \nand \njust \nbefore \nLaguna, things started to come together” \n\nGRIT AND DETERMINATION: NICKY HAYDEN \nHayden finished fourth at  Assen, and  he was  feeling confident as  the \nMotoGP circus arrived at  Laguna Seca for  the  first United States Grand \nPrix since 1994. Returning to  familiar territory would prove to  be  the \nformula Hayden needed, and  he proceeded to  dominate the  weekend en \nroute to  his  first win in  the  premier class to  the  delight of the  partisan \ncrowd. The  image of the  victorious Hayden carrying the  large American \nflag while riding down the  corkscrew section of the  track is one  of the \niconic images of MotoGP racing in  the  United States. “From there, we \nwere able  to build momentum and  keep going,” Hayden recalls. “That was \nreally when I realized how important it is to  have the  right guys around \nyou. Not  just ‘good’ guys, but the  right guys.” \nHayden and  the team carried that  momentum all the  way  through the \nsecond half of the  season, taking top-five finishes in the last  eight races of \nThe \nimage \nof \nHayden \ncarrying \nthe  \nAmerican \nflag \non  \nhis \nvictory \nlap \nfollowing \nthe \n2005 \nUSGP \nat \nLaguna \nSeca \nis \none  \nof \nthe \niconic \nimages \nof \nMotoGP \nracing \nin \nthe  \nUnited \nStates.

Hayden’s new teammate would start \nout  the season by throwing down the gauntlet for team supremacy with a \nsecond-place finish at the  Spanish Grand Prix at  Jerez. Three races later, \nthe ambitious Spaniard snatched his maiden MotoGP win with a stunning \nperformance at  the  Chinese Grand Prix at  Shanghai. It was clear that \nHayden was matched up against his strongest teammate since Rossi. And \nwith Yamaha's superstar struggling with some uncharacteristic DNFs to \nstart the  season, it began to  look like  Hayden's biggest rival for  the  title \nmight be coming from across his own garage. However, the now-seasoned \nHayden was  up to the task, scoring seven podiums in the  first  eight races \nto  take a  42-point lead over Pedrosa. “In  racing you need to  be  good, \nbut  you need a  bit  of luck too,” Hayden says. “And that year—early in \nthe  season especially—it seemed like  we  were always in  the  right place \nat the right time and  took advantage of every opportunity.” \nThat eighth race of  the season, the  Dutch TT  at  Assen, would be one \nof \nthe \ndefining \nmoments \nof \nHayden's \n2006 \ncampaign. \nThe \ncontest \nwould \ncome \ndown \nto \nan \nepic \nlast-lap \nbattle \nbetween \nHayden \nand \nfellow \nAmerican \nColin \nEdwards. \nIn \none \nof \nthe \nwildest \nconclusions \nto \na \nrace \nin \nyears, \nthe \ntwo \nclashed \non \nthe \nfinal \nchicane: \nWhen \nthe \ndust \ncleared, \nonly \none \nman \nwas \nleft \non \nthe \ntrack—Nicky \nHayden. \n“That \nwas \nmy \none \nand \nonly \nwin \noutside \nof \nhome \nsoil,” \nhe \nrecalls. \nThose \nearly-season \npoints \nwould \nprove \ncrucial \nas \nthe  \nseason \nwore \non,  \nbecause \nRossi \nand \nYamaha \nwere \nfinding \nthe \nmagic \nonce \nagain. \n\nGRIT AND DETERMINATION: NICKY HAYDEN \nAfter \na \ndifficult \nseventh-place \nfinish \nat \nDonington \n(where \nPedrosa \nwon), \nHayden \nrebounded \nto \na  \nstrong \nthird \nin \nGermany. \nOnce \nagain, \nHayden \nhad \nsome \nmomentum \ngoing \nas \nthe \nseries \nmade \nits \nway \nto \nthe \nUnited \nStates \nand \nLaguna \nSeca \nRaceway. \nThe \nAmerican \nneeded \na \ngood \nresult \nto \nkeep \nhis \nchampionship \nhopes \non \ntrack: \nRossi’s \nwin \nat \nGermany \nhad \ncut \nHayden's \npoints \nlead \ndown \nto \n26. \nUnlike 2005, Hayden did  not  dominate the  weekend. He  started the \nrace sixth on  the  grid behind Vermeulen, Edwards, Roberts Jr., Pedrosa, \nand  Hopkins. With four Americans starting in the  first  six  spots, hopes \nwere high for an  American victory, and  truth be told, the partisan crowd \nwas  well  and truly behind the championship leader, roaring with approval \nat  every mention of his  name. Meanwhile, Rossi struggled through the \nweekend, qualifying tenth. In  the  brutal heat described so  vividly by \nRoberts Jr. in the previous chapter, Hayden made a strong start, launching \nstraight into  third; he then proceeded to work his way up into  the lead by \nmid-race on  his way to a win  over teammate Pedrosa. Meanwhile, a huge \nroar came up  through the  crowd as  smoke was  seen pouring from the \nRossi Yamaha with only a few laps remaining, the DNF a fitting result for \na difficult weekend. \nThe 25  points earned for  the  victory allowed Hayden and Honda \nto  go  into the  summer break with a  big points lead. Nicky had high \nhopes for  the  rest  of the  season. But  the  most difficult times were still \nto  come. “After the  summer break, we  lost  a bit of momentum,’ Hayden \nrecalls. “There were some difficult times, but  really, it was  our  year. I had \nthat feeling from about the  third race in,  when I took over the  points \nlead—that this was  going to be my year.’ \nAs the momentum waned for Hayden, others stepped up the pressure. \nLoris \nCapirossi \nwon \nthe \nnext \nrace \nat \nBrno, \nand \nRossi \ntook \nthe \ncheckered \nflag \nat \nSepang. \nPedrosa \nfinished \nthird \nin \nboth \nraces. \nHayden \nwatched \nhis \npoints \nlead \ndwindle \nto \n22 \nas \nhe \nfinished \nwell \nback \nin \nninth \nat \nBrno \nand \nfourth in Sepang. \nThe \nAustralian \nGrand \nPrix \nat  \nPhillip \nIsland \nwas \nnext, \nand \nHayden \nshowed \nhis \nfighting \nspirit \nby \ntaking \npole. \nUnfortunately, \nhe \nmade \na \nmiserable \nstart \nand \nfound \nhimself \nnear \nthe \nback \nof \nthe \nfield \nbefore \nhe \n181 \n\n182 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nhad  \nreached \nthe  \nfirst  \nturn. \nBut  \nshowing \nhis  \ncharacteristic \ngrit \nand  \ndeter- \nmination, \nHayden \nfought \nback \nin \nrainy \nconditions \nto \nsalvage \nfifth. \nRossi \nfinished \nthird \nin \nthe \nrace \nto \ncut \nHayden’s \npoints \nlead \ndown \nto \n21 \nwith \njust \nthree \nraces \nremaining. \nMore \nstruggles \nwere \nto  \ncome \nat  \nthe  \nJapanese \nGrand \nPrix \nat  \nMotegi. \nHayden \ncould \nonly \nmanage \nseventh \nin \nqualifying, \nand \nthe \nclutch \nproblems \nthat \nruined \nhis \nstart \nin \nAustralia \nwould \ncontinue, \ndropping \nhim \nto \neleventh \nby \nturn \none. \nHe \nfought \nback \nto \nfinish \nfifth, \nbut \nRossi's \nsecond \nplace \nmeant \nthat \nHayden’s \npoints \nlead \nwas \nnow \njust \n12. \nAs the series returned to Europe for the final two races, Marco Melandri \nand  Capirossi were also  within reach of the  championship. But  at  least a \npair of miserable finishes by Pedrosa had  knocked the  Spaniard down to \nfifth  place, 34 points behind Hayden and  making his title  chances remote \nat best. Yet, despite the pressure coming from all sides, all Hayden needed \nto  do  was  finish strong: A pair of good finishes would likely earn him \nthe  title. But  then it all  came undone in  the  most unimaginable way in \nEstoril, Portugal. \nFor the previous two seasons, Honda had lost the World Championship \nto  Rossi and  Yamaha. The  team badly wanted the  title  back, and  Hayden \nwas  obviously its  best hope. In  situations such as  these, it’s  accepted— \nor  perhaps even expected—practice that team orders will  be  imposed. \nThat is, the  rider with the  best chance of winning the  title can count on \nhis  teammate to  do  whatever he  can  to  help the  team claim the  crown. \nHowever, Honda apparently didn't feel  that  team orders should be given \nbefore \nthe \npenultimate \nrace \nof \nthe \nseason \nat \nEstoril. \n“There \nwere \nnever \nany \nteam \nmeetings \nor \nnothing \nlike \nthat \n[before \nEstoril], \nexplains \nHayden. \n“But \nreally, \nthere \ndidn't \nneed \nto \nbe. \nIn \nthat \nsituation, \nyou \nwould \nhave \nthought \nwe \nkind \nof \nknew \nwhat \nto \ndo.’ \nThe \nteam \nwould \npay \nfor \nits \nmistake \nby \nnearly \nlosing the championship. \nTommy \nHayden \nwas  \nthere \nfor \nthat  \nfateful \nweekend: \n“Nick \ncame \ninto \nPortugal \npretty \nconfident, \nand \nhe \nwas \nriding \nthat \nway. \nThe \nweekend \noverall \nseemed \nlike  \nit \nwas  \ngoing \npretty \nsmooth. \nNicky \nwas  \ngoing \npretty \nfast  \nall \nweekend, \nhe \nqualified \non \nthe \nfront \nrow, \nand \nwas \nalways \nin \nthe \nhunt. \nThe \nrace  \nwent \non  \nand \nthere \nwas  \na \npretty \ngood \nbattle \nthere.” \n\nGRIT AND DETERMINATION: NICKY HAYDEN \nRossi \nled  \nfrom \npole, \nfollowed \nby  \nhis  \nteammate \nEdwards, \nwith \nHayden \nrunning \nthird \nand \nPedrosa \nfourth. \nBoth \nHonda \nriders \npassed \nEdwards \non \nthe \nfirst \nlap, \nbut \nthe \nYamaha \nrider \nbattled \nback \nto \nretake \nhis \nposition \nbehind \nhis \nteammate, \nenabling \nRossi \nto \nwork \nup \na \nlead. \nOn \nlap \nfour, \nNicky \nscrapped \npast \nPedrosa \nand \nset \noff \nafter \nEdwards. \nColin \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \nacting \nas \na \nbetter \nteammate \nand \nwas \ndoing \nexactly \nwhat \nRossi \nneeded. \nThe \nsame \ncould \nnot \nbe \nsaid \nfor \nPedrosa, \nwho \non \nlap \nfive \ncame \ncharging \nup \nthe \ninside \nof \nHayden \nimpossibly \nlate. \nThe \nSpaniard’s \nfront \nwheel \ntucked, \nand \nhe \nslid \nright \ninto \nhis \nteammate, \nsending \nboth \nof \nthem \ninto \nthe \ngravel \ntrap. \nIn \nan \ninstant, \nthe \nrace \nwas \nover \nfor \nboth \nriders, \nand \nNicky \nHayden’s \nWorld \nChampionship \ndream \nlooked \nto \nbe \nslipping \naway. \nThe \nagony \nin \nHayden’s \nface \nas \nhe \nrealized \nhis \nrace \nwas \nover \nsaid \neverything. \nThe \nsole \nbright \nspot \nfrom \nthe \ndisastrous \nweekend \ncame \nfrom \nthe \nfact \nthat \nTony \nElias \nhad \nridden \nthe \nrace \nof his \nlife \nto \nsnatch \nthe \nwin \nfrom \nRossi. \nThe \ndefending \nchampion \nwould \ngo \ninto \nthe \nfinale \nat \nValencia \nwith \nan \neight-point \nlead \nover \nHayden, \nwhen \nhe \ncould \nhave \nhad \n13 \npoints. \nThe  Pedrosa—Hayden debacle sent shockwaves through the sport. For \nAmerican fans  of motorcycle road racing, this was  one  of those moments \nwhere everyone will forever remember exactly where they were and what \nthey were doing when they saw  Pedrosa take out Hayden. “There are  many \nstories of people who lost TVs and got holes in the walls,” Tommy Hayden \nsays. And while historically Honda has  typically avoided imposing team \norders on  its riders, in this  case the company had  seriously compromised \nHayden's championship chances; Pedrosa’s misjudgment had  swung the \ndoor wide open for Valentino Rossi and Yamaha. Honda was  heavily criti- \ncized by the  media and  fans  across the globe, but  most of the venom was \ndirected at Dani Pedrosa. \nThe always supremely confident young Spaniard understood the \ngravity \nof \nhis \nerror \nand \noffered \na \nhumble \napology: \n“I \nmade \na \nmistake \nand \nI'm \nreally \nsorry. \nIt’s \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nI’ve \nhit \nanother \nrider \nin \nmy \ncareer. \nIt's \nnever \nhappened \nbefore \nin \npractice \nor \nracing \nin \nsix \nyears, \nand \nit’s \nhappened \nat \nthe \nworst \nmoment \nthat  \nI \ncould \ndo \nit. \nI \njust \nwant \nto \napologize \nbecause \nI \nmade a mistake.” \n183 \n\n184 \nGRAND \nPRIX \nMOTORCYCLE \nRACERS \n“It  \nwas \ndefinitely \na  \nvery \nemotional \nkind \nof  \nweekend,” \nrecalls \nTommy Hayden: \nIt \nwas  \nan  \nintense \nfew  \nweeks \nwhen \nyou  \ntake \nValencia \nand  \nall \nthat  \ninto \nconsideration. \nThose \nwere \ncrazy, \ncrazy \nemotional \nevents. \nYou  \nknow, \n| \npicked \n[Nicky] \nup \non \na \nscooter \nin \nthe \ngravel \ntrap \nat \nPortugal. \nHe \nwas \nvery \nupset, \nand \nthere \nwere \ndefinitely \nsome \ninteresting \nconversations \nin \nthe \nbus. \nHe \nwas \npretty \ncrushed \ninitially, \nbut \nhe \nrealized \npretty \nquickly \nthat \nit \nwasn’t \ncompletely \nover. \nThe \nodds \nwere \nbecoming \nstacked \nagainst \nhim, \nbut \nit definitely \nwas \nnot \nover. \nBut \nNick \ndid \nwhat \nhe \nneeded \nto \ndo; \nhe \nput it behind him, headed for Valencia, and came there ready to race. \nAn  eight-point deficit was  not  insurmountable, but  it did  mean that \nHayden would have to finish at least two  spots ahead of Rossi, if not  more, \ndepending on positioning. The best scenario for Hayden and Honda would \nhave been a Hayden-Pedrosa 1-2 finish with Rossi fourth or worse. Honda \nwould not  repeat its mistake and  made sure that  both riders understood \ntheir roles come race day. “Before Valencia, me  and  Dani, my crew chief, \nand Alberto [Puig, Pedrosa’s manager] had a little chat about what was  the \nplan,’ Nicky says. \nOne of the  positives of the  situation was that Hayden was able to \napproach the  Valencia weekend from a  fresh perspective, as  his  brother \nTommy explains: \nFor  the  first  time all year, he  felt  like  there was  no  pressure on  him. \nHed been leading the  championship for  such a  long time, and  Rossi \nwas  slowly closing in. At Valencia, [Nicky] didn’t have that  pressure on \nhim \nanymore; \nhe \ncould \njust \ngo \nout, \nride \nhard, \nand \ndo \nhis \npart. \nHe \nwas \naggressive \nearly \nand \ngot \nhimself \ninto \na \ngood \nposition, \nwhere \neven \nif \nRossi \ndidn't \ncrash, \nhe \ncould \nfight \nfor \nthe \nwin. \nThat \nwould \nkeep \npressure \non  \nValentino, \nwho \nwas  \ngoing \nto \nhave \nto \nget \nthird \nif \nNick \nwon. \nThe \nsituation \ndid  \nnot  \nlook \ngood \nas  \nthe  \nweekend \nunfolded, \nhowever. \nRossi, \nwho \nhad \nwon \nat \nthe \ntrack \ntwice \nbefore, \ntook \npole \nposition; \nHayden \n\nGRIT AND DETERMINATION: NICKY HAYDEN \nqualified \nfifth. \nThe \nveteran \nseven-time \nworld \nchampion \nwas  \nfamous \nfor \nhis \nsupreme \nconfidence \nand  \nability \nto \ndeliver \nresults \nunder \npressure. \nBut  \nas  \nthe  \nfield \ntook \nposition \nafter \nthe  \nwarmup \nlap, \nit \nall \nbegan \nto  \ngo \nwrong \nfor \nRossi. \nRace \nofficials \nheld \nthe \ngrid \nfor \nlonger \nthan \nusual \nbefore \nthe \nlaunch, \ncausing \nhis \nYamaha \nto \noverheat. \nAs \na \nresult, \nhe \nhad \na \npoor \nstart \nand \ndropped \ndown \nto \nseventh \non \nthe \nfirst \nlap. \nOn \nlap \nfive, \ncame \nthe \nunthinkable: \nThe \nseemingly \ninvincible \nworld \nchampion \ntucked \nthe \nfront \nand \ncrashed. \nHe \nquickly \nremounted \nand \nproceeded \nto \nput \non \na \ncharge \nwith \nhis \ndamaged \nbike, \nbut \n13th \nwas \nthe \nbest \nhe \ncould \nmanage. \nMeanwhile, \nHayden \ndelivered \na \nconsistent \nride \nto \nfinish \nthird \nbehind \nthe \ntwo \nfactory \nDucatis: \nBy \na mere \nfive \npoints—the \ndifference \nbetween \nfirst \nand \nsecond \nplace \nat \nAssen—Nicky \nHayden \nwas \nthe \nMotoGP \nworld \nchampion. \nNicky Hayden was  ecstatic as  he celebrated his victory lap, as  were his \nmany supporters and  family at the track. It was  the crowning achievement \nof his career. “You dedicate your life to  something, and when you win  you \njust feel really good,’ an  emotional Hayden said in his post-race interview. “T \nthought the championship was  over after the first ten laps in Estoril. Thanks \nto everyone who helped me  get here; I’m so  humbled by all this and it’s been \na great day for me.” If there was  ever  a lesson in tenacity rewarded, this was \nit. The  wild family celebration at the conclusion of the race  could not  have \nbeen a more extreme counterpoint to the dejection of Estoril. \nDespite his  disappointment, Valentino Rossi was  gracious in  defeat \nand  quick to  congratulate his  rival: “To  arrive at  the  final race with an \neight-point advantage and  then not  win  the title  is a disaster. It has been \na very emotional season, with some great moments, some bad  luck, and \nnow some mistakes. But this is racing. All I can  say now is a big ‘congratu- \nlations’ \nto \nNicky \nbecause \nhe \nis \na \ngreat \nguy, \na \ngreat \nrider, \nand \nhe \nis \nthe \nworld \nchampion because he has been the best this year.” \nThe \nemotional \nroller \ncoaster \nfor  \nthe  \nHayden \nfamily \nhad \nended \nin \nvictory, \nand \nNicky \nHayden, \nagainst \nall \nodds, \nhad  \nachieved \nhis \ndream. \nAN UNFAMILIAR DIRECTION \nNicky \nwould \ncelebrate \nhis  \ntriumph \nwith \nhis  \nfamily \nand  \nfriends \nat  \nhome \nin \nOwensboro \na \nfew \nweeks \nlater. \nBut  \nhe \nhad \nteam \ncommitments \nto \nhonor \n\n186 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nfirst: \nThe  \nseason \nfinale \nwas  \nfollowed \nthe  \nnext \nday \nby \nthe  \nfirst  \ntests \nof \nthe \n2007 \nbikes. \nThe \nValencia \nrace \nhad \nmarked \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \n990cc \nera, \nand \nall \nthe \nteams \nwere \neager \nto \ntest \nthe \nnew \n800cc \nbikes. \nAt \nfirst \nglance, \nit \nwas \nobvious \nthat \nthe \ntiny \nnew \nHonda \nhad \nbeen \ndesigned \nfor \nthe \ndiminutive \n(110-pound) \nPedrosa. \n“Initially, \nthe \nHonda \nthat \nyear \nlooked \nlike \na \nminibike,” \nexplains \nTommy \nHayden. \n“It \nwas  \nkind \nof \nan  \neye \nopener \nright \nout  \nof \nthe  \ngate \nfor \nhim. \nThat \nparticular \nbike \nwas \ntoo small, \nand \nNick \ncould \nhardly \nfit \non it. It was \na \nlot \ndifferent \nthan \nwhat \nhe \nwas \nused \nto, \nand \nit \ndidn't \nfit \nhis \nstyle \nvery \nwell.” \n“It’s true  that bike wasn't designed for me,’ Hayden explains with charac- \nteristic diplomacy. “I mean, Honda admitted that. It was a tough blow mentally \nfor me  as  much as  anything, as  I certainly never really felt comfortable on  it \nand a lot of it was  the size.  But you know what? When we  went to the 800s, \nthings changed and with [Spanish oil and  gas  company] Repsol paying the \nbills, things were certainly focused a lot more around Dani. That's pretty open \ninformation, and that's just the way it was  so  I had to deal with it” \nMoreover, the new  RC212V 800cc V-4 MotoGP bike was  not  nearly as \neffective as  Honda's previous machines, especially compared to the Ducati \nthat Australian Casey Stoner used to romp to the 2007 title. (The fact that \nthe Michelin tires that Honda was  running were clearly inferior to Ducati’s \nBridgestones only added to  the  misery.) Many riders compared the  feel \nof the bikes to 250cc Grand Prix machines, the bikes that  the  majority of \nEuropeans riders had  raced on  as  they moved up the ranks to  MotoGP. \nFor Hayden, the new  bikes were a huge move in an  unfamiliar direction. \nHis \nseason \ncarrying \nthe \nNo. \n| \nplate \nwould \nbe \nmostly \nforgettable, \nwith \nthe \nexception \nof \na \nmidseason \nrun \nof \nthree \nthird-place \nfinishes. \nHe \nfinished \neighth \nin \nthe \nchampionship. \nNot \nsurprisingly, \nPedrosa \nadapted \nwell \nto \nthe \nbike \nbuilt \nfor \nhim \n(the \nSpaniard \nsaid \nhe \ncould \ntouch \nhis \nknee \nto \nhis \nelbows \nwhile \nriding \nit) \nand \nwas \nable \nto \nnip \nRossi \nfor \nsecond \nin \nthe \nstandings \nby \na \nsingle \npoint. \nFor  \nNicky \nHayden, \n2008 \nwould \nbe \na \ncritical \nyear \nfor  \nhis  \nfuture \nwith \nthe  \ncompany \nthat  \nhad  \nbrought \nhim \nto  \nEurope. \nUnfortunately, \nthe  \nseason \nwould \nbe \nanother \nstruggle, \nand \nHayden \nnever \nwould \ncome \nto \nterms \nwith \nthe \n800cc \nHonda. \nThe \nseason \ndid \nhave \na \nfew \nbright \nspots, \nhowever, \nincluding \ntwo  \npodiums, \nthe \nfirst \nof \nthem \ncoming \nat \nNicky’s \n“home \ntrack,” \n\nGRIT AND DETERMINATION: NICKY HAYDEN \nthe  \niconic \nIndianapolis \nMotor \nSpeedway. \nThe  \n2008 \nMotoGP \nIndy \nwas  \nthe \nfirst \nmotorcycle \nrace \nheld \nat \nthe \nSpeedway \nsince \nthe \n1909 \nevent \nthat \nJake \nDeRosier \nhad \nparticipated \nin. \nNicky Hayden was  honored to  be a  part of what many hope will  be a \nnew American tradition: “It  is  a dream come true to  get to  race in what is \nbasically my  backyard. To  be a  part of it is awesome. Indianapolis Motor \nSpeedway, the  tradition and  history here is second to  none. There is not  a \nmore famous place to  race  a  motorcycle or  car  anywhere in the world.” \nHayden was called upon to  help promote the  race, and his  duties \nincluded making an  appearance at  the  2008 Indianapolis 500 race on \nMemorial Day weekend. Before the  race, the  Kentucky Kid  ran  two  exhi- \nbition laps on  the  famed 2.5-mile oval in  front of the  huge crowd, the \nlargest attendance for any  one-day sporting event on  earth. \nHayden’ss presence at  the  Indy 500  gave him a chance to  answer some \nquestions from the  automotive press. When asked about the  wisdom \nof  racing a  motorcycle at  200 miles per  hour, Hayden, always the \nambassador, answered: \nOur sport certainly takes guts and  nerve. It's not  a cupcake sport where \njust about anybody can  do it. You've got to be brave, but you need a bigger \nDIRECTY \nDuring \nthe \n2008 \nIndy \n500  \nweekend, \nNicky \nHayden \nanswered \nquestions \nfrom \nthe \nCc \nautomotive \npress \nregarding \nthe \nupcoming \nInaugural \nIndianapolis \nMotoGP \nat \nIndianapolis \nMotor \nSpeedway. \nThe \never-smiling \nHayden \nis \na \nperfect \nambassador \nfor his sport. \n187 \n\n188 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nbrain \nthan \njust \nballs, \nor  \nyou  \nwon't \nbe \naround \nlong \nenough \nto  \nget \nto \nthis \nlevel. \nYou \nhave \nto \nknow \nwhen \nto \nhang \nit \nout \nand \ntake \nrisks, \nand \nwhen \nto \nhold \nit \nback. \nYou \nhave \nto \nbe \nsmart \nbecause \nit’s \na \nlong \nseason. \nI \ndon’t \nthink \nof \nmyself \nas \na \ndaredevil, \na \nfool, \nor  \nsomebody \nwho \ndoesn't \nvalue \nhis \nlife. \nHowever, \nHayden's \nchance \nof \nparticipating \nin  \nthe  \nevent \nlooked \nto  \nbe \nin \njeopardy \nafter \nhe \nwas \ninjured \npracticing \nfor \na \nSupermoto \nrace \nat \nthe \nX-Games. \nHe \nhad \nto \nsit \nout \nthe \ntwo \nGrands \nPrix \nleading \nup \nto \nIndy, \nand \nhe \nwas \nstill \nnot \n100 \npercent \nheading \ninto \nthe \nrace \nin mid-September. \nThe  inaugural Indianapolis MotoGP would run  counterclockwise on \nthe  famous oval, using most of the Speedway’s pit straight before turning \ninto the track’s flat infield portion and following a series of twists and turns \nto  make up a roval, or  road course dropped into the  middle of an  oval. \nEager to give his home crowd something to cheer about, Hayden grabbed \nhis Honda by the throat and manhandled it around the circuit, defying the \nconventional wisdom that 800cc racers don’t respond to a flat track riding \nstyle. He  qualified fourth, just one  half-second off the  pace of pole-sitter \nValentino Rossi. It was  a  stellar performance, especially considering the \nfact that  Hayden was  still  hobbling around the pits on  crutches. \nIt was  intriguing to watch Nicky back the  Honda into  the  turns, with \nhis tail out, employing the flat track style from his 990cc days. In this more \nadvanced era  of electronic engine management systems, it was  clear that \na rider still  had  the  ability to  adjust the  bike to  suit  his  individual riding \nstyle. “You can adjust your engine management to  adjust however much \nengine braking that  you  want,’ says John Hopkins. “But nobody else  is \ndoing that; nobody else  is sliding around that  much.” \nItalian \nAndrea \nDovizioso, \nwho \nrode \nfor  \nthe \nJiR \nTeam \nScot \nHonda \nsatellite \nteam \nin \n2008 \nand  \nwent \non  \nto  \nreplace \nHayden \nat \nRepsol \nHonda \nin \n2009, compares his riding style to Nicky's: \nThere \nis \na \nvery \nbig \ndifference. \nHe \ncomes \nfrom \nSuperbike, \nI \nthink, \nand \nhis \nstyle \nis \ndirty \non \nthe \nentry \nand \nthe \nexit. \nWith \nthe \n250, \nyou \ncannot \nride \ndirty; \nalso \nwithout \nengine \nbraking, \nyou \ncannot \nslide \non \nthe \nengine. \n[The \nEuropean] \nstyle \nis \nthat \nyou  \ndon't \nslide, \nand  \nI \nthink \n[that \nstyle \nfits] \n\nGRIT AND DETERMINATION: NICKY HAYDEN \nbetter \nwith \nthe  \n800s. \nWith \nthe  \n990, \n[Nicky] \nwon \nthe  \nchampionship. \nWith \n800s \nthe \npower \nis \nless \nso \nwe \nneed \nto \nuse \nall \nthe \npower \nof \nthe \nengine; \nwe  \nneed \nto \nbe \nprecise \nand  \nnot  \nslide \ntoo  \nmuch. \n“Nicky \nis  \nstill  \none \nof \nthe  \nbest \nguys \nas  \nfar  \nas  \nworking \nhard \nand \nbeing \ndedicated,” \nsays \nKenny \nRoberts \nJr. \n“But \nthe \n800 \nis \nnot \nhis \ncup \nof \nsoup. \nI \nwould \nthink \nhe \nwould \nbe \nthe \none \nmore \nlikely \nto \nswitch \nover \nto \nsomething \nlike \nWorld \nSuperbike \nwith \na \nbigger \nengine \nthat \nbetter \nsuits \nthe \ncharacter \nof his \nriding \nstyle.” \n“It's  been an  uphill battle for  [Nicky] in a lot of ways, trying to adjust \nhis style” Tommy Hayden says: \nIts  been a  lot  of work. When you  get  to  that level, it is difficult to \nmake drastic changes when you've been practicing and perfecting the \nthings you do for your entire life.  Making a change like that  [the 800], \nreally threw a  wrench in what he was  doing. A lot  of people had  to \nchange also, but  it seemed like  naturally some people adapted better \nthan Nick. But  that’s part of it, and  it’s  the  same for  everyone. Nick \nrealizes that if you  want to  race Grand Prix you  race 800s, and  he's \ntrying to  make it happen. \nThe  first motorcycle races at  Indianapolis Motor Speedway in  1909 had \nbeen an  unmitigated disaster, the abysmal track conditions causing nearly \nall  the  riders to  refuse to  take part. Giving credence to  Mark Twain's \noft-repeated phrase, “History may not  repeat itself, but  it rhymes,” the \n2008 Indianapolis MotoGP was  held in equally abysmal conditions. The \nremains of Hurricane Ike slammed into  the Speedway on  Sunday, leading \nto  the shortening or  cancellation of every race. The  premier class did run \nas  planned, albeit amid rain  and  treacherous winds. \nDespite \nthe  \nappalling \nweather, \nHayden \nwas \nyet  \nagain \na  \nfactor \nat \nan \nAmerican \nGrand \nPrix. \nHe \nrocketed \noff \ninto \nan \nearly \nlead, \nand \nafter \nswapping \nthe \nlead \nwith \nAndrea \nDovizioso, \nNicky \nled \nfor \n13 \nlaps \nbefore \ngiving \nway \nto \nRossi. \nHayden's \nsoft \nrear \ntire \nhad \nbegun \nto \ngo \naway, \nand \nJorge \nLorenzo \nwas  \nclosing \nin,  \nso  \nperhaps \nHayden \nwas  \nfortunate \nthat  \nthe \n189 \n\n190 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nrace  \nwas  \nred-flagged \nafter \n20 \nof \nthe \n28 \nscheduled \nlaps \ndue \nto  \nrapidly \ndete- \nriorating \ntrack \nconditions. \nRossi \ntook \nthe \nvictory, \nwith \nHayden \ncoming \nin \nsecond. \nIn \nhis \npost-race \ninterview, \nthe \nItalian \nnoted \nthat \nthe \ncondi- \ntions \nwere \nthe \nworst \nin \nwhich \nhe \nhad \never \nraced. \nHe \nalso \npointed \nout \nthat \nsharing \nthe \npodium \nwith \nHayden \nreminded \nhim \nof \nall \nthe \ntimes \nthey \nhad \nstood \non \nthe \npodium \ntogether \nin \n2006. \nMAKING THE SWITCH \nIt was  obvious to  everyone that Nicky Hayden was  in  his  last  year with \nRepsol Honda. There were plenty of rumors and lots of speculation about \nwhere the American was  going to wind up in 2009, including hints that he \nwould switch to  the  World Superbike series. But  the  majority of rumors \nlinked Hayden to  Ducati, and  soon after the  Indy GP,  the announcement \nwas  made that  Nicky Hayden would join the  Italian team as  teammate to \nCasey Stoner. \nThe  Ducati ride  was  a huge gamble. On  the one  hand, the  Desmodici \nwas  clearly one  of the  fastest bikes of the  800cc era;  Stoner had  demon- \nstrated that by running away with the title  in 2007. But on  the other hand, \nonly Stoner seemed capable of taming the  beast. Loris Capirossi had \nmanaged to show occasional flashes of brilliance on  the bike in 2007, but \nnot  enough to keep his ride  in 2008. Marco Melandri, Capirossi’s replace- \nment at Ducati, was  completely confounded by the  bike. He  finished the \n2008 season 17th in points, 15 places behind Stoner. \nHayden was  not  oblivious to the struggles of his predecessors: “I knew \nthat  was  a risk  I was  taking when I signed the  deal. I felt like  it was  a risk \nworth taking. The  bike has  potential if you  can  find it.  I realized it was \na  risky move, but  I felt  like  if I ever wanted to  win races and  be  world \nchampion again, I had  to be willing to  take that  risk.” \nNo \ndoubt \nbuoyed \nby \nhopes \nfor \nthe \nfuture, \nHayden \nmade \na \nstrong \nfinish \nto \n2008, \nclosing \nout \nhis \nRepsol \nHonda \ncareer \nwith \nfive \ntop-five \nfinishes, \nincluding \na \nthird \nplace \nin \nAustralia. \nIn \nso \ndoing, \nhe \nmoved \nahead \nof \nEdwards \nin \nthe \npoints \nto take sixth \nin \nthe championship. \nHaving \nstarted \nhis  \nMotoGP \ncareer \nas  \nteammate \nto  \nValentino \nRossi, \nHayden \nwas  \nno  \nstranger \nto  \nsharing \na  \ngarage \nwith \nan  \nintimidating \nworld \n\nGRIT AND DETERMINATION: NICKY HAYDEN \nchampion. \nNot \nunexpectedly, \nthe \nAmerican \nstruggled \nto \nadapt \nto \nthe \nnew \nbike \nand \nnew \nteam \nin \ntesting. \nAnd \nthen, \njust \nas \nthings \nwere \nbeginning \nto \nimprove, \nhe \nsuffered \na \nvicious \n130-mile-per-hour \nhigh-side \nduring \nquali- \nfying \nfor \nthe \nseason \nopener \nin \nQatar. \nHe \nraced \nthrough \npain \nto \nfinish \n12th \nwhile \nhis \nteammate \nwon. \nMore \nmisery \nwas \nto \ncome \nat \nMotegi, \nwhere \nhe \nwas \nrear-ended \non \nthe \nfirst \nlap, \nknocking \nhim \nout \nof \nthe \nrace. \nThrough the first  five  races of the season, it was  beginning to look like \nHayden’ risky move to Ducati wasn't going to work out. While Stoner fought \nfor wins and podiums, Hayden was  finishing outside the top 10. The author \nspoke to Tommy Hayden during this period, and he had this to say: \nThey are trying, and they are working with Nick, giving him good support. \nThey don't want to make a bike that is a one-rider bike, as  it doesn't look \ngreat for them. There is no question of them working hard, and that means \na lot to Nick to keep him motivated. He's trying hard, giving his best every \nlap. Usually that prevails. They are making huge steps, but it hasn't been an \novernight thing. It’s  a competitive series. \nBy the  time the  circus reached Circuit Catalunya in  June, Nicky was \nstarting to  turn things around. After a  great deal of effort and  extensive \nmodifications to  the  machine and electronics package, he  finished a \nfighting 10th in the  race. This was  his best result of the year, giving him \nsome momentum going forward to two  of his favorite venues, Assen and \nLaguna Seca. \nThe  upward swing continued at Assen, with Hayden finishing eighth. \nReturning home to  Laguna, Nicky recovered from a  lowside crash in \npractice \nto \ntake \na \nseason-best \nfifth \nin \nthe \nrace. \nAlthough \npleased \nwith \nthe \nimprovement, \nHayden \nmade \nit \nclear \nthat \nhe \nwas \nnot \nsatisfied: \n“There \nis \nstill \na \nbig \ngap \nbetween \nme \nand \nthe \nfront. \nI \nknow \nthat. \nI've \ngot \nhigher \nexpectations \nthan \nthis; \nI’m \nnot \nthrilled \nabout \nan \neighth \nplace \nor \na \nfifth- \nplace \nresult. \nI \nknow \nI \nam \ncapable \nof \nmore \nand \nthe \nbike \ncan \ndo \nmore, \nas \ncan \nthe \nteam. \nBut \nit \nfeels \ngood \nto \nfinally \nhave \nsome \nmomentum \nand \nto \nhave \nthe \nteam \nstart \nto \nunderstand \nme \nbetter. \nI \nreally \nhope \nI’m \non \nmy \nway; \nI’m \na \nmomentum \nguy \nand \nI \nneeded \nsome \ndecent \nresults.’ \n19] \n\n192 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nFor \nthe \nsecond \nstraight \nyear, \nthe \nIndianapolis \nrace \nwould \nbe \nthe \nbright \nspot \nas \nNicky \nbattled \nthe \nentire \nway \nand \nfinished \nwith \na \nstrong \nthird \nplace. \nSoon \nafter \nthe \nrace, \nDucati \nannounced \nthat \nit \nhad \nsigned \na \ndeal \nto \nbring \nHayden \nback \nfor \na \nsecond \nseason. \nNicky’s \nWorld \nChampionship \nlatest \nchallenge \ncontinues. \nWhenever Nicky decides to move on  from his Grand Prix career, he will \nhave some unfinished business to attend to in America. The  Kentucky Kid \ncan  proudly claim to have won in three of the four flat track disciplines. He \nhas  won on  the  half-mile, TT,  and  short track, but  he still  needs to  win  a \nrace  on  the mile in order to achieve the flat track Grand Slam. If and when \nhe does so,  he will join Kenny Roberts Sr. as  the only GP world champions \nachieve this feat. “I would say that mile win is still in the cards,” says Hayden. \n“That's still  in  the  plan.

It  wasn't \nanything nice like  a Mini-Trail; it was  a step-through that had been abused \nand was  in a nonrunning state. I bought it for $5.  It taught me  how to do \na valve job.” \nThe closest track to Mike's home was  Bridgehampton, on  Long Island. \nHe  recalls attending a  club race there and seeing some of the  AMA's \nhotshoes in action: \nA  friend of mine saw  an  ad  for  the  races in  the  New York Times. He \nhad a  Norton Commando and I had an  H2  Kawasaki [750 two-stroke \ntriple]. \nWe \nwere \ninto \nthe \ncafé \nracing \nthing \nback \nthen. \nWe \nsaw \nGary \nFisher \nrunning \naround \nthat \ntrack \non \na \n350 \nYamaha; \nit \nwas \nscary \nto \nwatch. \nFisher \nwas \nmaking \na \nrare \nappearance \nat \na \nclub \nrace; \nthere \nwas \na \nrough \ndownhill \nsection—a \ntank \nslapper \nthe \nwhole \nway—and \nhe \nlooked \nlike \na \nfish \ngoing \nthrough \nwater \nwith \nthe \nthing \nwiggling \nlike \nit \ndid. \nWithin \nabout \neight \nhours \nof \ngetting \nhome, \nwe \nboth \nhad \nnumber \nplates \nbolted \nup. \nWe \nwere \ngoing \nto \ngo \nout  \nand  \ntry \nto \nbeat  \nGary \nFisher \n..  \n.  \nor \npretend \nwe  \nwere. \n\nTHE CONTENDERS 195 \nI \nwent \nto  \na \nKawasaki \ntraining \ncourse \nand  \nworked \nfor \na  \nKawasaki \ndealership \nin  \n1974. \nI \nmet  \na \ncustomer \nwho \nbought \na \nZ1  \nand \nwanted \nall \nthis \nperformance \nequipment \nput \non: \na \n1,000-cc \nbig-bore \nkit, \nwheels, \npipe—all \nthe  \nYoshimura \nstuff. \nOne \nweekend, \nhe \nsaw  \nmy \nH2  \nwith \nthe \nnumber \nplates, \nDunstall \nfairing, \nand \nclip-ons. \nHe \nasked \nwhere \nI \nraced \nit. \nTurns \nout \nhe \nhad \na \nhouse \nout \nnear \nBridgehampton. \nThe \nman’s \nname \nwas \nGeorge \nBeavers, \nand \nhe \nwas \nan \nexecutive \nfrom \nNew \nYork \nCity \nwith \nplenty \nof \nmoney \nto \nburn \non \nbikes. \nHe asked \nif I'd \nlike \nto \ntake \nmy \nbike \nand \nhis bike \nout \nracing. \nAt  Bridgehampton, he  commented about the bright white \nYamahas with the  red  stripes and  wanted to  know where they came \nfrom. Those Yamahas had open expansion chambers; when they went \nby, they sounded like low-flying fighter planes. He was  shocked at how \nfast  they were and  wanted to  know where to  get  some. He  bought \na  TA125 and made arrangements to  also buy a  new TZ350 from \nTom Bovaird. It turned out  that the  125  had  been a  championship- \nwinning 125  and  was  extremely fast  with another 1,000 rpm on  top \nversus the  stock bike. I took it to  Canada and raced it at  Sanair; that \ntrack was  like  a drag strip, and  the  bike was  an  absolute missile. Steve \nBaker was  there with the Yamaha Canada entourage, and my bike  was \nstaying with him on  the  straight. We  actually ended up  beating him \nthere. The [Yamaha Canada people] came running back to  the  pits \nsaying, “This kid’s got to be cheating!” They were convinced it was  a 200. \nFrom that point forward, the H2 and the Z1  were left in the garage. \nRising Star \nMike had made an  impression, and his  rapidly growing reputation \nhelped \nhim \nto \nmake \nanother \nconnection, \none \nthat \nwould \nsend \nhis \ncareer \ninto  high-gear: \nA \nfew \nweeks \nlater, \nnear \nthe \nend \nof \n1974, \nI \ngot \na \nchance \nto \nride  \na \nDucati \nSS \n750  \nthat \nwas  \nbuilt \nup \nby \nReno \nLeoni \nat \nBridgehampton. \nAt \nthe \nspur \nof \nthe \nmoment, \nhe \nwalked \nup \nto \nme \nand \nasked, \n“Do \nyou \nwant \nto \nride \nin  \nan  \nendurance \nrace?” \nAt  \nthe  \ntime, \nI \nwas  \nalso \nracing \na  \nDucati \n250 \n\n196 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nsingle \nthat \nwe  \nhad \nresurrected \nout \nof \nsomebody's \nbarn. \nIt \nturned \nout \nto \nbe \na \nFormula \nFour \nDucati, \nwhich \nis \na \nrare  \ntwin-loop \nframe, \nsand-cast \nengine \nDucati. \nIt \nwould \nbeat \nthe \n125 \nYamahas \ndown \nthe \nstraights, \nand \nthat \ncaught \nReno’ \neye. \nIt \nwas \na \nnice \ngesture \non \nRenos \npart, \nand \nwe \nended up winning the race. \nThe  \n1975 \nseason \nwould \nbe \nMike \nBaldwin's \nfirst  \nfull  \nAMA \ncampaign. \nHe \nsoon \nfound \nhimself \nfacing \nthe \nbest \nriders \nin \nthe \nnation: \n“We \nwere \nthinking \nwe \nare \ngoing \nto \ngo \nride \nagainst \njuniors, \nand \nguys \nthat \nwe \nknew,’ \nBaldwin \nrecalls. \n“Suddenly, \nthey \ntold \nus \nwe \nwere \ngoing \nto \nbe racing \nagainst \nKenny \nRoberts \nand \nSteve \nBaker.” \nThe following year saw the debut of the AMA Superbike Championship, \nand Mike would compete in the inaugural campaign astride a Reno Leoni \nMoto Guzzi. Baldwin explains: \nWe were actually as  fast as  anybody, but at Daytona we  could only run \nthe stock rear  tire and wheel because the slick was  interfering with the \ndriveshaft and  swingarm. It wouldnt fit,  so  I had  to  ride around on \nthis  street tire. [Baldwin finished fifth. | \nFor the next race [at Loudon], we  cut  a chunk out  of the swingarm \nso we could fit a slick. Once we did that, it was  all over for them. Loudon \nwas  the shocker; nobody thought that would have been possible. I won \nand  shut up Steve McLaughlin and  all the  BMW riders for a  change. \nAfter that  race, my  friends told  me  that  Romero, Nixon—all the guys \nthat rode the  Formula One bikes—were cheering for  me  because \nthe  Guzzi sounded like  a  dirt  track bike. For  me,  the  best thing was \nin the 250 class. I was  able to stay with Steve Baker and  Yvon Duhamel \nand was  able to pass Kenny Roberts down the straight, and I got on  the \npodium. That was  the biggest deal for me. \nMike \nfinished \nthe  \nSuperbike \nseason \nfifth \nin  \npoints, \none  \npoint \nbehind \nCook \nNeilson \nand \nGary \nFisher \nand  \nthree \npoints \nbehind \nMcLaughlin. \nEven \nbetter \nresults \ncame \nin \n1977 \nas \nBaldwin \nwon \non \nthe \nmighty \nGuzzi \nat \nCharlotte \non  \nhis \nway \nto \nthird \nin \nSuperbike \npoints \nbehind \nJason \nPridmore \n\nTHE CONTENDERS \nand  \nNeilson. \nIn  \nthe  \n250  \nGP  \nclass, \nhe  \nfinished \nfifth \nin  \npoints. \nHowever, \nBaldwin does not  look upon that  season with much fondness: \n1977 was  a  tough year. I bought a  twin-shock Yamaha TZ750A from \nBoston Cycle and raced it  in  the  AMA Formula One [Road Race \nNational] class. I would say probably my best race  that  season was  the \nnonpoints AMA race  at  Long Beach, where I rode the Yamaha on  the \nweekend that was headlined by the  Formula One [car] race. Kevin \nCameron built a  really good set  of pipes for it; it had  good power up \ntop, but I ran  out  of gas.  That year, I was  focusing more on  the 250 and \nthe Superbikes. In Loudon, I had a spectacularly unsuccessful event by \ncrashing in all three events. \nBattling for third place with Barry Sheene at Long Beach helped established \nBaldwin in  AMA Formula One, while he  gained valuable experience. \nHe  would put  that experience—along with the  new Yamaha TZ750D \nmonoshock—to good use  on  his way to winning the AMA Formula One \nChampionship in  1978. Baldwin looks upon that legendary bike with \ngreat affection: \nThat was a  good bike. The D  was the  one  to  have, that everybody \ncould get.  They were $5,800 or  something. It was  amazing, a  cheap \nway to get into  racing, and the bikes were reliable and fast. I remember \ngetting third at Laguna that year behind Roberts and Baker, who were \nprobably on  OW-31s. \nThat \nchampionship \nseason \nincluded \nBaldwin's \nfirst \nwin  \nin  \nthe  \nFormula \nOne \nclass \nat \nSears \nPoint. \nHe \nrecalls \nthat \nmemorable \nevent: \nAt \nSears \nPoint, \nI \nwas  \nbehind \nSkip \nAksland \ncoming \ndown \nthe \ncarousel, \nand  \nhe  \ngot  \nsideways \nand  \ngot  \nhigh-sided \noff \nthe  \nbike. \nHe  \nhad  \nsuch \na \ntight \ngrip \non \nthe \nthrottle \nthat \nit \ncame \noff \nthe \nbar, \nand \nall \nfour \ncarbs \nwere \nattached \nto \nthe \nthrottle \nand \ncame \noff \nthe \nbike. \nAll \nof \nthis \nstuff \nwas \ngoing \ndown \nthe \ntrack \nlike \nfootballs \nleft \nand \nright. \nI \nhit \none \nof \nthe \n197 \n\n198 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \ncarburetors \nand  \njust  \nabout \ncrashed \nmyself. \nI \nwon, \nand  \nat  \nthe  \nend  \nof \nthe \nrace, \nthe \ntire \nhad \na \nhalf-moon \nslice \ndown \nto \nthe \ntube \nand \nthe \ntube \nwas \ncoming \nout \nthrough \nthe \nhole. \nThe \nwheel \nwas \ncracked \nand \nthe \ntube \nwas \ncoming \nout \nthrough \nthe \ncrack. \nThe \nfunny \nthings \nis, \nthe \nday \nbefore, \nall \nthe \nGoodyear \nguys \nwere \nmaking \nfun \nof \nme \nfor \nusing \ntubes. \nI \nshowed \nthem \nthe \nslice, \nand \nthey \ncouldn't \nbelieve \nit. \nThat \nwheel \nis \nstill \nin \nmy basement. \nBaldwin followed up his first win with another at the next round at Pocono. \nThen he flew to Japan with Wes Cooley, where the two  of them teamed up \nto win  the  8 Hours of Suzuka, a feat  that  certainly improved his standing \nwith the Japanese manufacturers, including Kawasaki. \nBaldwin would sign up  to  race for  Kawasaki in  1979. His  debut was \nmemorable, but  not  for good reasons: “Kawasaki had  been trying to  get \nme  to ride  it in Formula One, but  I said  no  way to a four-stroke; it had  to \nbe a two-stroke. We went to Daytona with a KR750, a 250, and  a KZ1000 \nSuperbike. In 750 qualifying, I went out on  the first lap; the fuel was  puking \nout  through the  breather. It went onto the  rear  tire,  and  I landed on  my \nhead and broke my collarbone.” \nDespite his  injuries, Baldwin still  raced the  200. He  started dead last \nbut finished a very impressive fourth. \nDisappointment and Comeback \nAfter Daytona, Baldwin made his  European debut in  the  Transatlantic \nMatch \nRaces, \nwhere \nhe \nwas \nindividual \nhigh \npoints-scorer. \nHe \nthen \ngot \na \nchance \nto \ncompete \nin \na \nhandful \nof \nraces \nin \nEurope, \nin \nboth \nthe \nE750 \nclass \nand \n500 \nGP \nclass. \n“I \nhad \na \nsecondary \nsponsor \nthat \ngave \nme \na \nTZ750 \nand \nan \nRG500 \nto \nride \nin \nthe \nGrand \nPrix,’ \nBaldwin \nexplains. \n“The \nbest \nI \ndid \nwas \nat \n[the \n500cc \nrace] \nat \nJarama, \nSpain, \nwhere \nI \ntook \nthe \npole \n[and \nfinished \nthird]. \nEvery \nweek, \nI \nwas \nriding \na \ndifferent \nbike \non \ntracks \nI'd \nnever \nseen before.” \nBaldwin’ \nstrong \nshowings \nin \nEurope \nhad \nearned \nhim \na \nlot \nof \nattention, \nand  \nfurther \nopportunities \nduring \nthe  \n1979 \nseason \nwere \nlikely; \nhowever, \nthings \nchanged \ndramatically \nfor \nthe \nworse \nduring \nhis \nfirst \nrace  \nback \nin \nthe \n\nTHE CONTENDERS \nStates. \nAt \nLoudon, \nBaldwin \nsuffered \na \nseverely \nbroken \nleg \nafter \na \nhigh-side \non \nthe \nKR750 \nthrew \nhim \ninto \na \nfire \nextinguisher \nthat \nhad \nbeen \nleft \nstanding \nupright \nby \nthe \nedge \nof \nthe \ntrack. \n“I \ncaught \nit \nright \nin \nthe \nmiddle \nof \nmy \nleg? \nBaldwin \nsays. \n“I \nsmashed \nmy \nfemur \ninto \nabout \nfifty \npieces.” \nThe \ninjuries \nwere \nso \nsevere \nthat \nhe \ndid \nnot \nrace \nagain \nfor \na year. \nBaldwin \nreturned \nin  \n1980, \nonly \nthen \nhe \nwas  \nriding \nfor \nHonda. \n“Steve \nMcLaughlin \nasked \nme  \nto \ncome \nand \nride \nfor \nHonda \nina  \nsix-hour \nendurance \nrace, \nBaldwin \nexplains. \n“And \nwe \nwon. \nThen \nI \nwent \nto \nride \nthe \nSuperbike; \nI \nthink \nthey \nwere \nhoping \nI \ncould \nfinish \nup there \nbetween \nFreddie \nand \nEddie \nor \nsomething” \nIn 1981, he would ride for Team Honda France in the World Endurance \nChampionships. Paired with David Aldana, Baldwin would score his \nsecond 8 Hours of Suzuka win  that season, on  his way to further rehabili- \ntating his career. \nWith Freddie Spencer moving on  to  the  World Championship in \n1982, Honda pegged Baldwin as  its  new AMA golden boy. The  27-year- \nold  veteran would lead Honda’s Superbike campaign and  narrowly lose \nthe  title to  Kawasaki's Eddie Lawson. Baldwin also raced in  the  AMA \nFormula One class—in fact, he would dominate the  1982 season, winning \nhis  second AMA F1  Championship astride the  legendary 1,000cc FWS \nV-4. “When they loaded [the  FWS V-4] off the  truck at  Laguna Seca,” \nBaldwin recalls, “you could see  it had just been built by HRC, never \nbeen ridden. Out  of the  box, not  touching one  setting, it was  under the \ntrack record.” \nFor the 1983 Superbike season, Honda unleashed the water-cooled 750 \n\\V-4  Interceptor. The bike was  dominant right out of the gate, and Baldwin \nappeared \non \nhis \nway \nto \nwinning \nthe \ntitle. \nBut \nthen \nRainey \nmounted \na \nlate- \nseason \ncharge. \n“It \ncame \ndown \nto \nthe \nvery \nlast \nfew \nraces,’ \nBaldwin \nexplains, \n“and \nI \njust \nsimply \nthrew \nthe \nthing \naway. \nEverybody \nwarned \nme \nabout \nthe \ncrosswinds.” \nCaught \nout \nby \nthe \ntricky \ncrosswinds \nat \nWillow \nSprings, \nBaldwin \nhad \na \nmassive \ncrash \nand \nlost \nthe \nSuperbike \nChampionship \nto \nWayne \nRainey \nand \nKawasaki. \nHis \n1983 \nFormula \nOne \nseason \nwould \nhave \na \nhappier \nending, \nthough, \nas \nthe \n28-year-old \nwon \nhis \nsecond \nstraight title. \nieee) \n\n200 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nBaldwin \nmade \nit \nthree \nF1  \ntitles \nin \na \nrow  \nin  \n1984, \nwinning \nfive \nof \neight \nraces \non \nHonda's \nRS500 \nthree-cylinder. \nEarlier \nin \nthe \nseason, \nhe \nbecame \nthe \nfirst \nrider \nto \nwin \nthe \n8 \nHours \nof \nSuzuka \nthree \ntimes. \nReturn to Europe \nHaving \naccomplished \nso  \nmuch \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates, \nBaldwin \nwas  \nready \nto \nhave \nanother \ngo \nat \nthe \nWorld \nChampionship. \nWith \nno  \noffers \ncoming \nfrom \nestablished \nGP \nteams, \nhe \nchose \nto \ntread \nhis \nown \npath. \nIronically, \nHonda's \ndecision \nto \npull \nout \nof \nAMA \nFormula \nOne \nracing \nin \n1985 \nwould \naid \nhis \ncause. \n“I \nbought \nall \nmy \nbikes \nfrom \nthem,’ \nBaldwin \nexplains. \n“Then \nI \ndecided \nto \nrace \nin \nthe \nGPs \nin \nEurope, \nrace \nin \nthe \nevents \nthat \ndidn’t \nconflict \nwith \nthe \nUS. race \nschedule.” \nEquipped \nwith \nthe \nold \nthree-cylinder \nHonda \nRS500s, \nBaldwin \nhad \nlittle \nchance \nof \nmaking \na major \nimpact \nin GP \nracing. \nBaldwin was  well aware of the challenge of racing as a privateer against \nthe works teams. “In the Grand Prix, first  through fifteenth was  normally \nlocked up by the works bikes,” he says. Yet Baldwin was  up to the challenge \nand finished a very respectable 11th in the World Championship, scoring \n18 points and a best finish of eighth at Misano on  the Honda. Meanwhile, \nhe continued his unprecedented run  in AMA Formula One, winning the \nchampionship for  the  fifth and  final time. Baldwin's focus was  directed \noverseas by then, and  his  privateer GP  season captured the  attention of \nKenny Roberts. King Kenny was  launching a  new 500cc team for  1986, \nand he brought Baldwin aboard, alongside Randy Mamola. \nExtensive preseason testing gave the  team some momentum heading \ninto  the opening round, and  Baldwin showed what he and  the team could \ndo, taking third at Jarama with Mamola behind in fourth. Baldwin's strong \nstart \ncontinued, \nwith \nanother \nthird \n(as \nwell \nas \nfastest \nlap) \nat \nMonza, \nand \nyet \nanother \nplace \non \nthe \nbottom \nstep \nof \nthe \npodium \nat \nthe \nNiirburgring. \nBaldwin \nfinished \nthe \nseason \nwith \ntwo \nmore \npodiums, \nand \nhis \nimpressive \nspeed \nand \nconsistency \nearned \nhim \nfourth \nin \nthe \n500ce \nWorld \nChampionship. \nHopes \nwere \nhigh \ncoming \ninto \n1987, \nbut  \nonce \nagain, \nBaldwin's \ncareer \nwould \nbe \nhampered \nby \ninjury. \nReturning \nto \nKenny \nRoberts’ \nteam \nfor \n1987, \nhe \nfractured \nhis \nwrist \nin \nround \nthree \nat  \nHockenheim. \nHe  \ndid  \nmake \na \ncomeback \nbefore \nthe \nend  \nof \nthe \nyear, \nscoring \na \nseason-high \nsixth \nin \nthe \n\nTHE CONTENDERS \nseason \nfinale \nat  \nArgentina, \nbut  \nRoberts \nhad  \nWayne \nRainey \nwaiting \nin \nthe \nwings. \nMike \nBaldwin, \nnow \n32  \nyears \nold, \nwould \nnot  \nget  \nanother \noppor- \ntunity \nfor a \ntop \nGP \nride. \nHe explains, \n“In \nGP \nracing, \nwhen \nyou \nget \nto \nbe \nthirty, \nthey \nthink \nyou \nare \ndone.” \nBaldwin returned to  the  States, racing in  assorted AMA series \nover the following three seasons. During that time, he made a brief return \nto the World Championship when he competed in a handful of races with \na  privateer Honda team. The  highlight of that experience would be  the \nUSGP at  Laguna Seca in  1989, where Baldwin finished a very impressive \ntenth. But  by that time, Mike was  starting to  shift his  focus away from \nracing; he  was making movies and had started a  riding school, which \noperated from 1988 through 1990. \nAlthough Mike Baldwin's career may not  have reached the  heights of \nsome of his compatriots, he still  owns a very impressive list of Grand Prix \nracing achievements, including a  500cc GP  pole position, six  podiums, \nand  fourth in the  1986 World Championship—facts all recognized by the \nMotorcycle Hall of Fame, which inducted him  in 2001.

He is Grand Prix motorcycle racing's nearly man, and perhaps more \ndeserving of the title world champion than any racer since Stirling Moss. \nRandy Mamola was a spectator favorite, a racer who loved to entertain \nthe  fans by doing stoppies, waving, and throwing his  gloves into the \nstands. He has  never forgotten what it is like  to  be a  fan,  an  attitude that \nhas made Randy one  of the most beloved racers of his generation. “He's a \ndynamic type of rider and definitely a crowd favorite,” says Mike Baldwin. \n“Everybody loves Randy.” \nOvernight Sensation \nRandy \nMamola \nwas \nborn \non  \nNovember \n10,  \n1959 \nin  \nSan \nJose, \nCalifornia. \nLike \nso  \nmany \nCalifornians, \nhe \ngrew \nup \non  \ndirt \nbikes \nbefore \nmoving \ninto \nflat \ntrack \nracing. \nAs \na \nteenager \nin \nthe \nmid-1970s, \nhe \nidolized \nKenny \nRoberts, \nand \nby \nthe \ntime \nRandy \nwas \n14, \nhe \nwas \nfollowing \nin \nKR’s \nfootsteps, \nhaving \nacquired \nsponsorship \nfrom \nYamaha \nand \neven \npainting \nhis \nracers \nin \nthe \nclassic Yamaha bumblebee color scheme. \n\nTHE CONTENDERS \nRon \nGrant, \nthe  \nman \nwho \ndid  \nso  \nmuch \nto  \nlaunch \nPat  \nHennen’s \ncareer, \nwould \nalso \nplay \na \nhuge \nrole \nin \nRandy’s \nascendance. \nIn \n1975, \nGrant \nbrought \nMamola \nto \nNew \nZealand \nto \nrace \na \nTA125 \nYamaha \nGP \nbike \nin \nthe \nsame \nseries \nthat \nHennen \nwas \ncompeting \nin \nso \nsuccessfully \nfrom \n1974 \nto \n1977. \nRandy \nwon \nthe \n125cc \nseries \ntitle \nand \nreturned \nto \nthe \nUnited \nStates \nwith \nthe \ngoal \nof \nbecoming \na \nroad \nracing \nchampion. \nUpon \ngraduating \nfrom \nhigh \nschool, \nMamola \nturned \nprofessional \nand \nspent \nhis \nfirst \ntwo \nseasons \nracing \nin \nthe \nAMA’s \n250 \nGP \nclass. \nHe \ndidn't \nhave \nto \nwait \nlong \nto \nenjoy \nsuccess, \nwinning \nthe \ntitle \non \na Yamaha \nin \nhis \nsecond \nyear. \nChanging rides for 1979, Mamola brought his 250 GP Bimota to Daytona, \nwhere he gave Freddie Spencer and Skip Aksland a run for their money before \nfalling back with brake trouble and settling for third. It was  such an impressive \nperformance that it earned him a spot on the Transatlantic Match Races team, \nwhere he finished second to Mike Baldwin. Randy Mamola, just 19 years old, \nhad  arrived in Europe. He would remain there for the next 13 seasons. This \nis perhaps the most amazing aspect of Mamolas career: He went straight to \nthe  top  levels of European Grand Prix, bypassing the  Superbikes that  were \nvirtually a mandatory career stop for any American riders. \nMamola would start the  season competing in  the  250cc class on  his \nBimota while also racing in the  500cc class on  a privateer Suzuki. In 250  GP, \nthese were the  days when Kork Ballington was  simply untouchable on  his \nKawasaki GP bike, but Mamola turned in stunning performances on tracks he \nhad never seen before. Following a midseason switch to Yamaha, he finished \nfourth in the class. Perhaps even more incredible was  Mamolas performance \nin the 500cc championship, where despite running only a partial schedule he \nscored a  sixth in  Sweden, followed by shocking seconds in two  of the final \nthree races (at Finland and France). Mamola had finished eighth in the 500cc \nWorld Championship, securing his place in 500cc Grand Prix racing. \nSigned \non  \nto  \nrace \nfor  \nthe  \nHeron \nTexaco \nSuzuki \nfactory \nteam \nfor \n1980, \nthe \n20-year-old \nsuddenly \nfound \nhimself \nin  \na  \nbattle \nfor  \nthe  \nWorld \nChampionship, \nchallenging \nthe  \nrider \nhe  \nhad  \ngrown \nup  \nidolizing. \nKenny \nRoberts \nstarted \nthe  \nseason \nwith \nthree \nconsecutive \nwins, \nbut  \nMamola \ncontinued \nto \nmake \nprogress \nas \nhe \ngained \nexperience. \nHelped \nby \nthe \nfact \nthat \nhe \nwas  \nriding \nSuzuki’s \nvery \npotent \nbike, \nMamola'’s \nfirst  \nwin  \nappeared \n203 \n\n204 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \ninevitable, \nand  \nthe  \nyoung \nCalifornian \nput \nhis  \nname \nin  \nthe  \nrecord \nbooks \nduring \nthe \nmidseason \nrace \nat \nSpa-Francorchamps. \nAnother \nwin \nat \nthe \nBritish \nGP \nat \nSilverstone, \ncoupled \nwith \nan \nimpressive \nrun \nof \nconsistent \nfinishes, \nallowed \nMamola \nto \nend \nthe \nseason \na \nstunning \nsecond \nin \nthe \nchampionship, \nonly \n15 \npoints \nbehind \nRoberts. \nPerhaps \njust \nas \nimpressive \nwas \nthe \nfact \nthat \nMamola \nhad \nfinished \nahead \nof \nthe \nrest \nof \nthe \nSuzukis, \na \nroster \nthat \nincluded \nfuture \nworld \nchampions \nMarco \nLucchinelli \nand \nFranco \nUncini, \nas \nwell \nas \nGraziano \nRossi \n(father \nof \nValentino). \nNeedless to  say,  expectations were high going into 1981, especially \nwhen it  became clear that the  performance pendulum was swinging \ntoward Suzuki and  away from Yamaha. The Suzuki was the  dominant \nmachine, and  the  championship unfolded into a  straight fight between \nMamola and  Lucchinelli. Randy struck first, winning the  season opener \nat  the  Salzburgring in  Austria. After Roberts won the  next two races, \nLucchinelli posted his  first  win. Mamola answered with another victory \nof his own at Opatija, Yugoslavia. But Mamola’s championship hopes soon \nwithered under Lucchinelli’s onslaught. The  Italian won four of the  next \nfive  races on  his  way to  the  title; Mamola ended the  season in  second \nplace once again, 11 points behind the leader. It was  a disappointing result, \nbut Randy was  still just 21  years old,  and  most observers felt  it was  just a \nmatter of time before he broke through. \nYet  1982 belonged to Franco Uncini (Mamola finished sixth), and  1983 \nwas the  epic battle between Roberts and Spencer (Mamola took third). \nThe following years brought a  switch to  Honda. A  tough start would \nultimately doom Mamola’s 1984 title  effort, although he  would mount a \nvaliant charge to  finish behind Eddie Lawson who won the  title on  his \npowerful and effective four-cylinder Yamaha. \nLate \nin \nthe \nseason, \nRandy \nwas  \ngiven \nan  \nopportunity \nto \nrace  \nthe \nradical \nfour-cylinder \n“over \nand \nunder” \nbike \nand \nfound \nit \nsuited \nhis \nriding \nstyle \nfar \nmore \nthan \nit \nhad  \nfor \nSpencer. \n“I \nrode \nit \nat  \nSilverstone,” \nMamola \nexplains. \n“Freddie \ngot \nhurt \nso  \nHonda \ngave \nme  \nthat  \nbike, \nand  \nI \nwon. \nThe  \nproblem \nwas \nthat \nthe \nthree-cylinder \nwasn't \nstrong \nenough \nto \ngo \nup \nagainst \nEddie’s \nYamaha. \nIt \ndepended \nupon \nthe \nracetracks; \nat \ncertain \ntracks \nit \nwould \nwork; \nthe  \nbest \npoint \nof \nthat  \nthree-cylinder \nwas  \ngetting \nout  \nof \nthe  \ncorners, \nthe \n\nTHE CONTENDERS \nacceleration. \nIn \ntop \nspeed, \nthe  \nfour-cylinder \nbikes \nhad  \nit \nover \nus  \nbig \ntime. \nHaslam, \nmyself, \nand \nRaymond \nRoche \nall \ngot \ninvited \nto \nride \nthe \nfour- \ncylinder \nat \nSilverstone, \nbut \nthose \nguys \nopted \nto \nride \nthe \nthree-cylinder. \nThey \nweren't \neven \nin \nthe \nsame \nrace... \n” \nThe  \nauthor \nasked \nMamola \nif \nhe  \nfound \nthat \nthe  \nincreased \nspeed \nwas \noffset \nby \nthe \nhandling \nproblems \nthat \nSpencer \nexperienced. \n“I \nactually \nthought \nit \nsteered \nbetter \nthan \nthe \nthree-cylinder,” \nsaid \nMamola: \nThe three-cylinder really was  built for Freddie Spencer, in terms of his \nriding style. To this day, when you look at photos of me  with my leg off \nthe side  of it, it was  because I could not  get that thing to turn. Freddie \ncould get the  three-cylinder to  turn by spinning it much earlier than \nmyself—or anybody else. I won races on  it, whether it was  in the rain \nor  in  the  dry, but  I just  didn’t get  along with it.  It always felt  like  it \nhad a really big rear  and a really narrow front. On  the  other hand, \nthe  four-cylinder felt  completely the  opposite; it had  a  much more \nstable front end. Of course, Silverstone is a  huge track, and  I didn't \nget to  ride  the four-cylinder on  any racetrack where you had to really \nman-handle it. \nIn final race  of 1984, Mamola made a statement by taking fastest lap and \nwinning the race, and in hindsight it might have been far better for Honda \nin  1984 to  have given Freddie the updated triple while fielding Randy on \nthe  “over and  under” V-4. In  terms of points, it was  Mamola’s best  year \nyet,  but  it was  his  third second-place finish of the  previous five  seasons. \nIn  the  end, Randy had taken eight podiums in  the  season's 12  races, \nincluding three wins. \nUnfortunately, \nMamola \nwas \nunable \nto  \ncarry \nthe  \nmomentum \ninto \n1985, \nthe \nyear \ndominated \nby \nFreddie \nSpencer \nand \nEddie \nLawson. \nMamola \ndid \nget \ninto \nthe \nwin \ncolumn \nat \nAssen, \nbut \noverall \nit \nwas \na \ndisappointing \nseason \nby \nhis \nlofty \nstandards. \nOne \nvery \nfleeting \nmoment \nof \nthat \nseason \nhas \nbecome \na \nmajor \npart \nof \nthe \nMamola \nlegend. \nRiding \nthe  \nRothmans \nHonda \nat \nMisano, \nhe \npulled \noff \none  \nof \nthe \nmost \nunbelievable \nsaves \nin \nGP \nhistory. \nThe \nincident \noccurred \nwhen \nMamola \nwas \n205 \n\n206 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nforced \nto \ncorrect \na \nrear-wheel \nslide \ncoming \nout  \nof \na \nleft-hand \nturn. \nAfter \nresisting \nthe \nHonda’ \ninitial \nattempt \nto \nthrow \nhim \nover \nthe \nhandlebars, \nMamola \nstuck \nout \nhis \nleft \nfoot \non \nthe \npavement \nand \nwas \nthrown \nheadfirst \nover \nthe \nfairing. \nWith \nalmost \nsuperhuman \nstrength, \nhe \ncontinued \nto \nhang \non \nand \npull \nhimself \nbackward, \ndespite \nhaving \nboth \nlegs \nbucked \noff \nthe \nseat. \nWith \nboth \nfeet \nnow \ndragging \non \nthe \nright \nside \nof \nthe \nbike, \nthe \nside-saddle- \nriding \nMamola \nstill \nheld \nthe \nmachine \nupright \nwhile \nit \ncareened \nthrough \nthe \ngravel \ntrap \nbefore \nultimately \nthrowing \nhis \nleft \nleg \nover \nthe \nseat \nand \ncontinuing \non. \nNo  doubt a  contributing factor to  the  save is  Mamolas physique, \nprobably best  summed up by saying that  if Popeye wanted to take him in \narm  wrestling, hed best bring extra spinach. Mamola is known for literally \nbending the handlebars off the bike with his counter-steering riding style, \nto the point that wrestling the thing into  submission is often referred to as \nhaving to Mamola the bike—using a riding style as  a verb. \nTeam Roberts \nRandy joined Kenny Roberts at Yamaha in 1986 and  1987. His  first season \nwith the  team brought seconds at  Imola, Yugoslavia, Assen, and  France, \nalong with a win  at the  Belgian GP  at Spa. However, the  entire rest  of the \nseason was  won by either Wayne Gardner or  Eddie Lawson, and  Mamola \nhad  to  settle for third behind the  dominant pair. More importantly, that \nwas also the  year that Randy became involved with the  global charity \nprogram Save the  Children. His  work with the  organization gave him \nanother mission in  life  to  go  along with his  determination to  become \nworld champion.. \nIn  \n1987, \nRandy \ncame \nout  \nof \nthe  \ngate  \nhot  \nwith \na \nwin  \nat  \nSuzuka, \nbut  \nas \nthe \nseason \nwore \non,  \nWayne \nGardner \ntook \ncontrol \nof \nthe \ntitle \nchase. \nDespite \nadditional \nwins \nat \nLe \nMans \nand \nMisano, \nMamola \nonce \nagain \nfound \nhimself \nrunner-up—this \ntime \n20  \npoints \nbehind \nGardner, \nwho \nbecame \nAustralia’s \nfirst \nworld \nchampion. \nFor \n1988, \nTeam \nRoberts \ndecided \nto \ngo \nin \nanother \ndirection, \nreplacing \nboth \nMamola \nand \nBaldwin. \nRandy \nwould \nmove \non \nto \nCagiva, \nand \nalthough \nthe \n28-year-old \nmay \nnot \nhave \nrealized \nit \nat \nthe \ntime, \nhis \nwindow \nfor \nwinning \nthe \nWorld \nChampionship \nwas  \nnow \nclosed. \n\nTHE CONTENDERS \nAs  \na  \nthree-time \nworld \nchampion \nrider \nwho \nalso  \nemployed \nsome \nof \nthe  \ngreatest \nriders \nof \nthe  \nera,  \nKenny \nRoberts’ \nopinions \ncarry \na  \nconsider- \nable \namount \nof \nweight. \nHe  \nhas  \na \ngreat \ndeal \nof \nrespect \nfor \nRandy \nMamola \nand \nfeels \nthat \nhis \nfailure \nto \nwin \na \ntitle \nhas \nmore \nto \ndo \nwith \nthe \nriders \nhe \ncompeted against: \nRandy had a lot of natural talent, and he didn’t waste it. But he wasn’t \ngoing to  beat Wayne Rainey. He was a great racer. Randy could have \nbeen world champion, and if that bike hadn't screwed up that one  time, \nhe would have been. [In  1987] Randy was  putting in good rides and \nwinning races—there was  nothing wrong with Randy’s riding. It was \njust that  in comparison to  Wayne Rainey .  .  .  1 knew what I had with \nWayne, and  that’s why I brought him  on  for  1988. It’s like  Valentino \nRossi today. There are  some great riders riding MotoGP bikes right \nnow, but Valentino is just a step up. \nThe Cagiva Years \nThe  frustrations at  Cagiva were many, and  the  under-funded new  team \nstruggled for any kind of decent result. Mamola finished the season with a \ncareer worst 12th place in the standings. There was  one highlight, however: \na sole podium at one  of his favorite tracks, Spa-Francorchamps, following \nhome Gardner and  Lawson. He  also managed a  decent finish at  Rijeka, \nYugoslavia, taking fourth. \nThe  struggles of  1988 would seem easy compared to  the  disaster of \n1989. A seventh place at  Rijeka would be his  best result on  his way  to  a \ndismal 18th place in  the  standings. The 1990 season, his  final year with \nCagiva, would not  be  much better, with a  best finish of fifth and 13th \noverall in the championship. \nKevin \nSchwantz \nremembers \nMamola \nfrom \nthose \nlast \nyears \nat \nCagiva: \nWhen \nI  \nwent \nover \nfull-time \nin  \n1988, \nhe  \nhad \njust \ngotten \nonto \nthe  \nCagiva. \nAt  \nthat \npoint, \nRandy \nwasn't \ndoing \nmuch \nbut  \ndevel- \noping \nmachinery. \nIt \nkept \nbreaking, \nand  \nhis  \nfocus \non  \nracing \nI \ndont \nthink \nwas  \nall  \nthat \ngreat, \nbecause \nhe  \nknew \nmore \noften \nthan \nnot  \nthe \n207 \n\n208 \nGRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nequipment was  going to  let him down. He wasn't a guy  I got to  see  in \nhis prime. \nMamola sat  out  the  1991 season before making a comeback the following \nyear, riding for  a  privateer Yamaha team. He  took 10th in  the  standings, \nwith his  best finish a  third at  the  Hungaroring. This would be  the  final \npodium of Randy Mamola’s glittering 500cc Grand Prix career, one  that \nhad  seen him win 13  races in  13 seasons. He  stayed involved in the  sport \nfor several more years as  a test  rider for Yamaha, while making his charity \nwork a larger focus of his life. \nPhilanthropist \nIn  1996, Mamola helped found Riders for  Health, an  organization that \nprovides motorcycle-based medical outreach efforts in  Africa.

These between-race demonstra- \ntion  runs are  the ultimate thrill ride for any motorcycle fan, and riding along \nwith Mamola might be best described as the two-wheel equivalent of bungee \njumping. The high-speed experience has been known to leave even seasoned \nriders breathless. “It's amazing how much grip the tires  have,’ recalls 15-time \nmotocross and Supercross champion Ricky Carmichael. “But what impressed \nme  the most besides the braking was  the high-speed sweepers.” \n“It’s  a leap of faith,” says multiple Supercross champ Chad Reed. “Not \nthat  I doubted him  or  anything like  that. It was  a blast. Id do it again and \nrecommend it to  anyone.” \nThe author recently asked Mamola to  name his  most memorable \npassenger. His  answer came without hesitation: “That would be [Formula \nOne supremo] Bernie Ecclestone, 73 years old.  I’m  sure the  stock market \nwas  dropping as I let the clutch out.” \nAlways the fan favorite, always with his heart in the right place, Randy \nmaintains one  of the most visible roles of any American GP  racer and is a \ntrue ambassador for the sport. \nBUBBA SHOBERT \nOf \nall \nthe  \nriders \nprofiled \nin \nthis  \nchapter, \nBubba \nShobert \nhad  \nthe  \nshortest \nGrand \nPrix \ncareer. \nSuch \na  \nfate  \nwould \nnever \nhave \nbeen \nexpected \nwhen \nShobert \nwas \ndominating \nflat \ntrack \nracing \nand \nwinning \nthe \nAMA \nSuperbike \nChampionship \nin \nthe \nmid-1980s. \nOne \nof \nthe \nmost \ntalented \nriders \nof \nhis \nera, \nhe \nhad \nhis \ncareer \ncut \nshort \nby \na \nfreak \naccident \nat \nthe \n1989 \nUSGP \nat \nLaguna Seca. \n209 \n\n2110 \nGRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nDon \nWayne \nShobert \nwas  \nborn \non  \nJanuary \n29,  \n1962, \nin \nLubbock, \nTexas. \nLike \nso \nmany \nothers \nin \nthis \nstory, \nBubba \nstarted \nout \nriding \nminibikes \nas \na \nchild. \nIn \n1980, \nhe \nwon \nAMA \nGrand \nNational \nRookie \nof \nthe \nYear \nhonors \nin \nhis \nfirst \nprofessional \nseason, \nand \nin \n1982, \nhe \nscored \nhis first \nnational \nwins \nat \nthe \nIndy \nmile \nand \nwon \nagain \nat \nthe \nSyracuse \nmile. \n“Bubba \nShobert \nis \none \nof \nmy riders,” \nSandy \nRainey \nexplains. \n“He \nand \nI \nwere \nprobably \nthe \nfirst \nindependents \nto \nwin \nthe \nIndy \nMile \ndirt \ntrack, \nand \nme \nand \nhim \ndid \nit—beat \nSpringer \n[Jay \nSpringsteen], \nRandy \nGoss, \nand \nthe \nrest \nwhen \nwe \nwon \nthat \nthing. \nWe \nwere \nin the \nwinners’ \ncircle, \nand \nwe \nwere \nthe \nonly \nones \nwithout \na \nHarley \nfactory \nshirt \non, \nbecause \nwe \nsell \nBubba's \njerky.” \nBy the  end  of the  1983 season, Honda was  courting Shobert, with an \neye on  hiring him as  teammate to Ricky Graham. “I had finished fourth in \nthe  Grand National Championship, and  Graham finished third,” Shobert \nexplains, “so  Honda took the  two  top  guys who weren't already taken \nby Harley.’ \n“He  left  me  for Honda,’ confirms Rainey. “But I have to  admit that I \nwas the first one he called.” \noe >  ba \ni \nPR. \n[SV \nWael. \nSs \nx \nible \n+ \n: \n: \nphate \nrs \n: \nan \nBubba \nShobert \nmaneuvers \nhis \nHonda \naround \nthe \nSan \nJose \nMile. \nOne \nof \nthe \ngreat \nracers \nof \nhis \nera,  \nhe \nnever \nhad \na \nchance \nto \nmake \nhis \nmark \nin \nGP \nracing. \nMahony \n> \noO \nPhoto \nArchive \n\nTHE CONTENDERS \nRoad Race Debut \nShobert \nwould \nget \nan  \nopportunity \nto \ntry \nroad \nracing \nthat \nyear, \nalbeit \nunder \nunusual \ncircumstances, \nas  \nhe \nexplains: \n“In  \n1984, \nI \nwon \nthe  \nSan  \nJose  \nMile \nand \nshort \ntrack, \nback \nto \nback. \nLater \nin \nthe year, \nI \nhad \nan altercation \nwith \nTerry \nPoovey.” \nSandy Rainey clarifies: “He  hit him. He hit him  right in the jaw.” \nShobert continues the story: \nSo [had the opportunity to do the road racing because I got suspended \nfor nine races. When I came back from that, I was  way down in points. \nThe  only way to pick up some extra points would be to do some road \nraces. It turned out  Honda had an  extra Superbike with an  850 engine \nthat  they couldn't run  in the Superbike class. Honda asked if I wanted \nto  run  the  bike so  I could get some extra points. I said, “Sure, I'll try \nsome road races.” What did  I have to  lose? It was  the  Formula One \nclass where the  guys were running 500s, and I won Mid-Ohio in \nthe rain. \nIt would be difficult to  overestimate what a  remarkable achievement this \nwas. Racing an  850cc Superbike he  had never ridden before, in  his  first \nrace on  pavement, in  the rain, Shobert won. “It wasn’t nothin’ new  to me, \nsliding around corners,” he says, nonchalantly. “Of course, I was  riding a \nfour-stroke and  90 percent of the field was  riding two-strokes.” \nBubba Shobert had claimed his first road racing win, and the flat track \nsuperstar now had  a new frontier to  conquer. Meanwhile, he wasn't quite \nready to give up on  the flat track title, despite missing nine races: \nWhen I got back from being suspended in  1984, I got first  or  second \nin every race  I raced in. At Springfield for the last race, I was  14 points \nbehind, \nso \nthe \nchances \nweren't \nreal \ngood. \nGraham \ncrashed \nand \nI \nsaw \nhim \ngo \ndown \nout \nof \nthe \ncorner \nof \nmy \neye. \nI \nthought, \n“I \ndon't \nhave \nto \nwin.” \nSecond \nplace \nwould \ngive \nme \n16 \npoints \nand \nI \nwas \nonly \n14 \nbehind. \nBut \nother \nguys \nhad \nbroken \nearlier \nin \nthe \nrace, \nso \nGraham \nended \nup \nscoring \npoints \nanyway \nand \nhe \nbeat \nme  \nby \na \npoint. \n\n212 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nShobert \nwould \nmake \nup \nfor \nhis  \nnear \nmiss \nby \nwinning \nthe  \nGrand \nNational \ntitle \nthe \nnext \nthree \nseasons. \nMeanwhile, \nthe \nAMA \nhad \nrestructured \nits \npro \nracing \nchampionships, \nseparating \ndirt \ntrack \nand \nroad \nracing. \nWhile \nShobert \nwas \nwinning \nthe \ndirt \ntrack \nGrand \nNational \ntitle, \nhe \nwas \nalso \nmaking \nforays \ninto \nroad \nracing. \n“In \n1985, \nI \nwas \ndoing \nthe \nroad \nracing \non \nmy \nown, \nhe \nsays. \n“Honda \ndidn't \nhave \na \nbudget \nfor \nme, \nbut \nthey \ngave \nme \na \nbike \nfor \nmy \nown \ndeal.” \nIn \n1986, \nthe \nsame \nformula \nearned \nShobert \nhis \nsecond \nstraight \nGrand \nNational \ntitle, \nwhile \nhe \nalso \nfinished \nfourth \nin \nAMA \nSuperbike. \nFred Merkel’s move to Europe left an  opening at the Honda factory team. \nShobert stepped in  as  teammate to  Wayne Rainey for the  1987 Superbike \nseason. “I was  kind of the  up-and-coming guy,’ Shobert recalls. “I  was \ngetting a  lot of good lessons from Wayne. Being a  close friend, he always \ngave me  lots of insights that they don't give to other riders these days.’ \nThe  25-year-old Texan would make his  international debut that year \nin the Transatlantic Match Races. It was  a brief appearance: “I was  on  the \nteam, but I crashed in the first  race.” \nThe epic Rainey-Schwantz duel that made up the  1987 AMA Superbike \nseason has  been covered earlier in  the  book. But  it should be noted that \nShobert was  the only other rider to win  an  AMA Superbike race  that year, \nthe  round at  Laguna Seca. On  the  dirt  track side, Shobert made it three \nGrand National Championships in a row. \nWith Schwantz and Rainey moving on  to the World Championship for \n1988, Shobert'’s key rival for the AMA Superbike title would be newcomer \nDoug Polen on  the  Yoshimura Suzuki. Shobert describes the  season \nopener at  Daytona: “I  took off on  the  warmup lap and  halfway around, \nmy bike quit in the  infield. I had  to  get off and  push it back to  the  grid. \nBy \nthe \ntime \nI \ngot \nback, \nthe \nrace \nhad \nstarted. \nMy \nmechanics \ngot \nit \nstarted \nback \nup; \nit \nwas \nvapor \nlock \nor \nsomething. \nI \nstarted \nthe \nrace \na \nlap \ndown \nand \nfinished third; Polen got second.” \nIt \nhad  \nbeen \nan  \nimpressive \nfight \nback, \nto  \nsay  \nthe  \nleast. \nMeanwhile, \na \nrivalry \nappeared \nto \nbe \nbrewing \nbetween \nShobert \nand  \nPolen: \nThe  \nnext \nrace \nwas  \nat  \nRoad \nAtlanta, \nand  \nPolen \nwas  \npretty \nmuch \nfaster \nthan \nme  \nall \nweek. \nCome \nthe \nrace, \nPolen \nwasn't \ngoing \nas \nfast \nas \nhe \ncould; \n\nTHE CONTENDERS \nhe  \nwas  \njust  \ngoing \nto  \nfollow \nme  \naround \nand  \nthen \npass \nme  \nlate  \nin  \nthe \nrace. \nI \ndon't \nknow, \nbut \nI \nthought \nhe \nwas \nkind \nof \nmaking \nme \nlook \nbad \nby \nplaying \nwith \nme. \nOn \nthe \nlast \nlap, \non \nthe \nback \nstraight, \nhis \nbike \nkind \nof \nhesitated \nor something \ncoming \nout \nof \nthe \nturn, \nand \nI \npassed \nhim \nback. \nHe \ngot \ntucked \ninto \nmy \ndraft, \nbut \nat the \nend \nof the \nstraight \nhe \nmissed \nthe \nturn and went off into  the dirt, so  I ended up winning that race. \nShobert’s win  at Atlanta, along with another win  at Laguna Seca, put him \nfirmly in the title  hunt. In fact, every race  that  season (with the exception \nof Daytona, where Schwantz had  won) would be won by either Shobert \nor  Polen. The  duel between the  two  Texans included plenty of drama. \nShobert explains what happened at Mid-Ohio: \nSunday morning in practice, I got off the bike and  demolished it; the \nframe was  wrecked. They had a rule that you couldn’ use a spare bike, \nand  I had  a spare bike but we  couldn't use  it. The  AMA watched my \nmechanics disassemble my  spare bike down to  parts and  put it back \ntogether. It was  the  only way I could use  it.  I was  following Polen on \nthe  last  lap,  and  when he  came around a corner, a  lapper took him \noff the  track. So we  won that  race, and that  was a big one. \nIn the  end, Shobert managed to  squeak by with the  title  by a  mere four \npoints over Polen, a victory that helped to soften the blow of losing out  on \nthe Grand National title. \nMeanwhile, Shobert made his World Championship debut that season \nin a one-off ride in the 250cc class at Laguna Seca. “I qualified like sixteenth \nand  led the  first  lap.” Shobert recalls. “I ended up  in fifth.” It was  a  stag- \ngering \nGP \ndebut \nfor \nsomebody \nriding \nunfamiliar \nmachinery, \nsuggesting \nthat \nShobert \nwas \nready \nto \nfollow \nin \nthe \nfootsteps \nof \nthe \nmany \nAmericans \nwho had found Grand Prix success. \nWhat Might Have Been \nFor \n1989, \nhe \nsigned \nfor \nHonda \nto \nrace \nin \n500cc \nGrand \nPrix. \n“I \ndidn’t \nwant \nto  \ncontinue \nracing \nover \nhere,’ \nShobert \nexplains. \n“And \nthat  \nwas  \nthe  \nyear \n213 \n\n214 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nthey \nwere \ngetting \nthe  \nRC30 \nout;  \nthey \ndidn't \nhave \nany  \nbike \navailable. \nMy \ncontract \nwas \nactually \nwith \nAmerican \nHonda.” \nThe  \n1989 \nGrand \nPrix \ngrid \nwould \nbe \npopulated \nwith \nmore \nAmericans \nthan \never \nbefore \nor \nsince, \nwith \na \nroll \ncall \nthat \nincluded \nLawson, \nSpencer, \nRainey, \nSchwantz, \nMamola, \nand \nShobert. \nThe \nlatter's \nGP \ndebut \ncame \nat \nSuzuka, \nwhere \nhe \nfinished \nin \n11th \nplace \non \na \nyear-old \nHonda \nin \nthe \nJapanese \nGP. \n“The \nsecond \nrace, \nI \ncrashed \nin \nPhillip \nIsland,” \nShobert \nrecalls. \n“I \njust \ntipped \nover.” \nRound three was  held at  Laguna Seca, one  of the  Texan’s favorite \ntracks and  a  place where he  had always found success. The race itself \nwent reasonably well, and  Shobert finished ninth, his  best top-class GP \nresult to  date. But  then it all went horribly wrong during the  cooldown \nlap. Wayne Rainey, who had won the race, explains what happened to his \nbest  friend, the man who had been best  man at his wedding: \nKevin Magee was  racing Eddie [Lawson] for third, and going up the start- \nfinish straight for the checkered flag, his bike sputtered and Eddie passed \nhim. So going around the track, Kevin [Magee] stopped out of frustration, \nand he decided to do a burnout. He was  well off the  race  line, way over to \nthe inside in turn  five.  Well, Eddie and Bubba were looking at each other \ngoing up the straightaway out of turn five and were shaking hands. Eddie \nsaid that the next  thing he knew, Bubba wasnt there! What had happened \nwas  that  when they were looking at  each other, Kevin was  doing the \nburnout, but they never saw  that, and  Bubba just ran  into the back of him. \nI didn't know about it; actually Schwantz told  me  on  the podium. Bubba \nwas  in a  coma for  nine days and never did race  again after that. \n“Tt \nwas  \njust \none  \nof \nthose \ndeals, \nI \nguess,” \nsays \nShobert, \nwho \nhas  \nno  \nrecol- \nlection \nof \nthe \nincident. \n“I \nhave \nmemories \nof \npractice. \nI \nremember \npulling \noff \non \nthe \nmain \nstraightaway \nwhere \nwe'd \ndo \na \nplug \nchop. \nI \nremember \nthat \nand \nwhere \nwe \nwere \npitted \nat, \nour \npit \nsetup. \nI \nremember \nall \nthat, \nbut \nI \nhave \nno \nmemory \nof \nthe \nactual \nrace. \nEven \nnow \nthere \nis \nsome \nstuff \nthat \nI’ve \nforgotten \nabout, \nbut \nthen \nsomebody \nwill \nstart \ntalking \nand \nbring \nthings \nup, and  then I remember it now.” \n\nTHE CONTENDERS 215 \nFrom \nconversations, \nit \nis \nobvious \nthat \nBubba \nrecalls \nmost \nof \nthe \nprecise \ndetails \nof \nhis \ncareer, \nwith \nthe \nUSGP \nin  \n1989 \nbeing \nthe \none  \nexception. \nThe  \n27-year-old \nShobert \nrecovered \nsufficiently \nto  \npursue \na  \nnormal \nlife \noutside \nof \nriding \nracing \nmotorcycles, \nand \nhe \nwould \ngo \non  \nto \nmanage \nracing \nteams, \nmost \nnotably \nin \nthe \nAMA \n250  \nGP \nclass. \nAnd \nwhile \nBubba \nShobert’s \nGP racing \ncareer \nwill \nalways \nbe \nassociated \nwith \nthe \nquestion \n“What \nif?,” \nhis \nprowess \nas a \nflat \ntrack \nracer \nis \npart \nof \nAmerican \nmotorcycle \nracing \nlegend. \n“Bubba was  my  childhood idol  growing up,” says  Nicky Hayden, who \npaid tribute to Shobert by wearing a replica of the Texan's helmet at the 2006 \nUSGP at Laguna Seca. “He was  my hero, and he was  the guy I looked up to. I \nwatched as he made his transition from dirt track to road racing, and it just \nseemed fitting [to wear the helmet], as this was  the track where he ended his \ncareer. It helped make the weekend special. It was  a big honor to wear his \nreplica and to take the win; it was  one  of the highlights of my career” \nDOUG CHANDLER \nAmong the generation of flat track—racing Californians who would go on \nto  make their mark in  road racing, John Douglas Chandler was  perhaps \nthe  most versatile. Born on  September 27,  1965, in  Salinas, California, \nDoug got into  bikes at an  early age. \n“We hada neighbor at the time that raced,” Chandler recalls. “I thought \nhe was  the coolest guy ever. He persuaded my parents to let him bring me \nto one  of the local races, try it out.  I kind of got hooked and started racing \nwhen I was  five  on  a Honda Trail 50.” \nHe  would quickly rise  through the  ranks up  to  the  Grand National \nChampionship series: “I won my  first  National on  an  Illinois short track \nand  missed being the youngest rider ever to win  by about a week.’ Doug \nwas  on a vertical career path, and in 1983, at just 18 years of age, he capped \noff \nhis  \nfirst  \nfull  \nprofessional \nracing \nseason \nwith \nthe  \nAMA \nRookie \nof \nthe \nYear award. \nRoad Racer \n“At \nthat \ntime, \nI \nwasn’t \neven \nlooking \nat \nthe \nroad \nrace \nstuff,’ \nChandler \nexplains. \n“I \nwanted \nto \nbe \nGrand \nNational \nChampion. \nThe \nfollowing \nyear, \nwe \ngot \npicked \n\n216 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nup \nby \nHonda, \nand \nback \nthen \nroad \nrace  \nand \nflat \ntrack \nwere \ncombined \nfor \none \nchampionship. \nHonda \nhad \nthe \nidea \nthat \nif \nwe \nweren't \ndoing \na \nflat \ntrack \nthat \nmaybe \nwe \ncould \ngo \nto \none \nof \nthese \nroad \nraces \nto \npick \nup \nextra \npoints.” \nChandler \nwould \nstart \nat \nthe \ntop. \nHis \nfirst \nprofessional \nroad \nrace \nwas \nin \nthe \npremier \nSuperbike \nclass \nin \n1984 \nat \nLoudon, \nNew \nHampshire. \nHe \nfinished \na \nvery \nstrong \nsixth. \nThis \nintroduction \nto \nthe \nroad \nracing \nworld \nwould have a profound effect on  Chandler: \nGoing to  the  road races and seeing all  those other manufacturers \nthere, it really opened my eyes as  to how much further you  could go \nby road racing. In flat  track, we  had  Harley dominating with Honda \ntrying to get in there; they were the only two. At road races there were \na lot more, so  I thought this was  something I could try, with what was \ngoing on  over in Europe with World Championships. \nChandler would spend the 1984 through 1988 seasons competing in both flat \ntrack and road racing. Among the highlights of those years were five Grand \nNational wins in 1986 and  1987; he would finish third in the standings both \nyears. In  1988, he took his  first  road racing win, in the  Pro-Twins class at \nMid-Ohio. The  feat  earned him a  spot in AMA history as  the  fourth and \nmost recent rider to  achieve the  AMA Grand Slam (in  1989), the  others \nbeing Dick Mann, Kenny Roberts, and Bubba Shobert. \nAfter finishing the  1988 AMA Superbike season third in points behind \nShobert and Polen, Chandler decided to shift his emphasis from dirt track \nto road racing. He says, “1989 was  the first year that  I put road racing over \nflat track. Kawasaki was  going to come out  with a new 750  Superbike, and \nRob  Muzzy was  going to do a team. So we  did a deal.” \n“We \nhad  \ndone \na  \nreal  \nminor \nlittle \nthing \nwith \nKawasaki \nin  \n1988. \nMuzzy \nexplains. \n“It  \nwas  \na  \n500cc \nsingle \ndirt  \ntrack \nbike \nthat  \nRicky \nGraham \nrode \nat \nDaytona \nand \nthe \nshort \ntrack, \nand  \na \n750  \nthat  \nwas  \nbased \non  \nthe \nwater-cooled \nNinja. \nThey \ncame \nout  \nwith \na \nnew  \nbike, \nso  \nin \n1989 \nwe  \ntook \nthat \nnew  \nbike \nand \nhired \nChandler” \n“The \n1989 \nseason \nstarted \noff \na  \nlittle \nrough,” \nChandler \nrecalls. \n“It \nwas \na \nnew  \nbike, \nnew  \nteam. \nBut  \nwe  \nfinished \nstrong \nand  \nwon \nthe \nlast \ntwo  \nraces \n\nTHE CONTENDERS \n[at \nMid-Ohio \nand \nTopeka]. \nThe \nthing \nwas  \nreally \ngood, \nand \nI \nknew \nwe  \nhad \nsomething \npretty \ngood \nfor \nthe \nfollowing \nyear \nwhen \nit \nall \ncame \ntogether.” \n“Because \nhe  \nhad  \nwon \na  \ncouple \nof \nraces,” \nsays \nMuzzy, \n“Kawasaki \ngot \nreally \nenthused \nand \nramped \nup \nthe \nprogram.” \nThings \ndid \nindeed \ncome \ntogether. \nNot \nonly \ndid \nChandler \nearn \nthe \nSuperbike \nchampionship \non \nthe \nstrength \nof \nwins \nat \nMid-Ohio, \nRoad \nAmerica, \nLoudon, \nand \nMiami, \nbut \nhe \nalso \ntook \nfour \nwins \nin \nthe \n750 \nSupersport class to  finish second in points. \nGoing Global \nChandler also  made his debut on  the world stage that year, competing in \nthe  Brainerd, Minnesota, round of the  World Superbike Championship. \n“We were just going to do the Brainerd round, Chandler explains, “but we \nhad  success and won one of the legs [finishing third in the other].” \n“We ran  Brainerd and  that was  the  year the  track was  falling apart; \nMuzzy recalls. “Guys were putting cardboard in  their leathers to  keep \nfrom beating their chests up.  In  any  event, we  won one  round and  that \ncaused quite a stir.” \nIt would be more than a one-off appearance in the series, as  Chandler \nexplains: “I think we  had  to  prove our  worthiness to  the  rest  of the guys \nby going back over to  Japan and  doing the  round there at Sugo to  make \nsure that they didn't see  [the Brainerd win] as just an  American guy on  an \nAmerican track.” \nMuzzy continues: “Kawasaki was  saying, “Why don’t you  guys come \nover? Bring your bike and  run  our  race’ Of course, then we  won a round \nthere too.  When Doug came back from Japan, that’s when he made his \ndecision that  he wanted to race  in the GPs.” \nChandler describes how Kenny Roberts helped the  next step in \nhis career: \nId  known Kenny going back to  the  late  1970s. Kenny had  sort of \nwatched me  since I was a little kid  at  one of the  places where we \nwere \nracing \nlocally. \nThose \nyears, \n1988 \nand \n1989, \nId \ngo \nover \nthere \nin \nthe \nwinter \ntime \nand \nride \ndirt \nbikes \nwith \nWayne \n[Rainey] \nand \nEddie \nPAGE \n\n218 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \n[Lawson] \nand \nthat \nclan \nover \nat  \nKenny’s \nplace, \nthe  \nranch \nup  \nthere \nin \nHickman. \nKenny \nJr. \nand \nKurtis \nwere \nriding \nminibikes \nwith \nus \nas \nwell. \nSo, \nthe \nconnection \nwas \nthere, \nhe \nwas \ntrying \nto \nput \nanother \nteam \ntogether, \nand \nthey \ncreated \nessentially \na \n“B” \nteam \nfor \na \nfirst-year \nrider \nto kind of go over and get his feet wet. \nDoug's \ndebut \nGrand \nPrix \nseason \ncame \nin \n1991. \nHe \nsays, \n“I \nwas  \npretty \nmuch \nriding \non \nyear-old \nbikes, \ngetting \na sense \nfor \nthe \ntracks, \nthe atmosphere, \nand \nall \nthat. \nMy \nfirst \nrace was \nat \nSuzuka, \nand \nwe \nwere \ngoing \npretty \ngood, \nwhich \nwas surprising \nto me. \nMy \nrain \nexperience \nwas very \nlow \nat the time, \nand \nto \nbe \nout \nthere \nright \nin \nthe \nmiddle \nof \nit, \nI was \ngaining \nconfidence \nas \nI \nwent, \nwhich \nwas a big \nplus.” \nFor  1992, Lucky Strike Suzuki hired Chandler to  partner with Kevin \nSchwantz on  the  500  GP  bikes. As  chronicled in  the  Schwantz chapter, \nChandler was  able to make a big contribution to the team, especially when \nit came to  developing the  bike. “I thought it was  a  pretty good bike,” he \nsays of the RGV500. “Those bikes were either the best bikes you  ever rode \nor  the  worst, and  it really depended on  how you  had  the  bike set  up  for \nyourself as  a rider. There wasn't any in-between. You  were good or  bad.” \nChandler credits his  good friend Wayne Rainey with teaching him \nabout the sport's technical side: \nData acquisition was  just starting to  come on  board. I would get on \nthe  computer with Wayne and  just look at  our  traces—front suspen- \nsion, rear suspension. To  me,  I never felt  like  I was  the  fastest guy \nout  there. I was  going to win  the  race  by having a bike that’s working \na  lot better and  was  easier on  the  tires, so  Id have something at  the \nend. I wanted to  have that  thing set  up  the  best I possibly could and \nunderstand everything. \nMert \nLawwill \nis \none  \nman  \nwho \nappreciated \nthe \ntechnical \nnous \nthat \nChandler \ncould \nbring \nto \na \nteam: \n“He \nwas \nprobably \nthe \nsmartest \nrider, \nas \nfar \nas \ngiving \nme \nfeedback \nabout \nhow \nit \nwas \ndoing \nthis \nor \nthat. \nI've \nonly \nhad \na \nhandful \nof \nguys \nwho \ncould \nactually \nassist \nwith \nsetup. \nAnother \nwas  \nKenny \nRoberts, \n\nTHE CONTENDERS 219 \nbecause of all his experience. But  some of the other guys I won't bother to \nmention. It is an  art  form.” \n“I want to  know as  much as  I can  about the bikes,” says  Chandler: \nI want to  know all  the  mechanics. The  gearboxes, I totally under- \nstood all  of that, and  I had  a  lot of help. I could talk to the suspension \nguys about what I’m  feeling and  suggest what I thought we  needed to \ndo about the valving in the shocks. I would stay out  on  the track until \nI knew what it was  that I didn’t like. Is the  compression too  harsh \nover the  ripple bumps on  a  certain part of the  track? Is it sitting too \nhigh on  the  ride height and  putting too  much weight on  the  front? I \nwanted to  understand that stuff and  give the  technicians better data \nso  we  could have a better bike. \nRob  Muzzy compares Chandler's approach to  Eddie Lawson's: \nWhatever the  bike's limitations were, Eddie would take it  right to \nthat  limit, or  maybe just one  hair  past that. He  would never try to do \nsomething that  the bike wouldn't do, which is why he didn't crash very \nChandler \non  \nthe \nSuzuki \nGP \nbike, \nen  \nroute \nto \nsecond \nplace \nat  \nthe  \n1992 \nJapanese \nGrand \nPrix. \nDoug \nChandler \nCollection \n\n220 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nmuch. \nDoug \nwas  \nthe  \nsame \nway. \nA \nlot  \nof \nit \nwas  \na  \ncomfort \nlevel \nwith \nDoug. \nThe  \nwhole \npurpose \nof \nsetting \nthe  \nbike \nup  \nwas  \nto  \nmake \nDoug \nhappy \non  \nthe \nbike. \nHe \nwas  \nreally \ngood \nand \nhe \nknew \nwhat \nhe \nwanted, \nand \nin \ntime \nhe \nlearned \nto \ncommunicate \nthat \nbetween \nus. \nIf \nDoug \nwas \ncomfortable \non \nthe \nbike, \nhe \nwould \nride \nit \nas \nhard \nas \nhe \ncould \nride, \nas \nfast  as  it would go. \nChandler \nhad  \nsome \nsuccess \nwith \nthe  \nSuzuki, \nas  \nhe  \npushed \nhard \non  \nthe \ndevelopment side: \nThat whole year of 1992, we just kept plugging away. At the end of 1992, I \nknew that  1993 bike was  going to be good. In 1992, I sat on  pole position \nat two  tracks that I had never seen  before in my life, the Hungaroring and \nMagny-Cours. I was  pretty excited to be able to do that at that level. \nDoug finished the season fifth in points, just five points behind teammate \nSchwantz. And Chandler had  played a  major role  in  developing the  bike \nthat Schwantz rode to  the  1993 World Championship. Sadly, Chandler \nwould not  reap the  rewards of his development work. Instead, he moved \non  to Cagiva for 1993: \nThat was  a  tough decision. It was one  of those things. In  the  GPs, \nyou  had  riders willing to  go  over there for  basically no  pay, just to \nget the opportunity to  ride. You  are  going over there and  are  making \nNO  money, putting yourself at  risk  of getting hurt. Kevin was  their \ntop guy,  and  they had  no  more money for anybody else. With Cagiva \nthe  money was  night-and-day different. fd  made the  Suzuki pretty \ngood throughout the  year, and  I thought if these Italian guys will \nwork with me,  I know we  can  get  this  thing working pretty good \nas \nwell. \nUltimately \nthe \nCagiva \nended \nup \nbeing \nreally \ngood. \nWe \njust \nhad \nsome \nproblems \nmechanically. \nWed \nbegin \nto \nmake \nsome \npower \nand \nthen \nthe \nbike \nwould \nstart \nletting \ngo \non \nus, \nwhich \nwas \na \nbummer. \nBut \nas \nfar \nas \ngoing \naround \na \nracetrack, \nthat \nwas \na \nreally \nnice \nbike \nto ride. \n\nTHE CONTENDERS \nChandler’s teammate for  1993 was fellow American John Kocinski. There \nwas not  the  usual animosity between teammates. “I  wanted to  help him \nout, because I wanted to  see  the  team do  well, says Chandler. “A  lot  of \ntimes hed kind of get  out  in  left  field, and theyd kind of come back and \nput on  the  setup I had” \nChandler sums up his two  seasons with Cagiva before the team folded: \nWe  were starting to  lead a  few  races but  had  quite a  few  DNEFs; it was \nkind of frustrating. I got second in Buenos Aires behind Mick Doohan, \nand John got  third there. I was  trying to  get  past Criville for  the  lead \nat  Le  Mans when it popped a  cylinder. It was  frustrating, but  we  had \ntwo  years and  the thing was  getting better. We  had  a  lot of misfortune, \nthough, and  right as  we  were ready to turn the page and get some good \nfinishes out  of it, that’s when they closed the book. \nDoug \nChandler \non  \nthe \nCagiva \nGP \nbike  \nin  \n1993. \nDoug \nChandler \nCollection \n\n222 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nThe  \n1994 \nseason \nwould \nalso \nbe \nthe \nfinal \nchapter \nof \nChandler’s \nGrand \nPrix \ncareer, \nin \nwhich \nhe \nhad  \nachieved \nsix \npodiums \nover \nfour \nseasons. \nBack to the States \nChandler \nreturned \nto \nthe \nAMA \nin \n1995 \nbut \nsuffered \nthrough \na \nconfidence- \nshattering \nseason \non \nthe \nHarley-Davidson \nSuperbike. \n“It \nwas \na \nbad \ndecision, \nhe \nsays \nof \nsigning \nup \nwith \nHarley. \n“And \nyou \njust \nhave \nto \nlive \nwith \nit and \nmove \non. \nI \nwas \npretty \ndisgusted \nand \nwas \nactually \nbeginning \nto \ndoubt \nmyself. \nThat \nHarley \nwas \nback \nto \nthe \ndrawing \nboard; \nI \nbroke \nmy \ncollarbone \ntwice.” \nThe next year, Chandler reunited with Muzzy and Kawasaki to embark \non  some of the  hardest fought campaigns in  AMA Superbike history. In \n1996, Chandler won his second AMA Superbike title, with wins at Laguna \nSeca and  Las  Vegas helping him to  finish the  season with a  narrow lead \nover Miguel Duhamel. \nChandler repeated the  feat in  1997, besting challenges from both \nDuhamel and Mat  Mladin. This championship was  particularly impressive, \nas  it highlighted Chandler's consistency, persistence, and  racecratt: Mladin \nand Duhamel had won four races each, while Chandler won just once. \nThe string of championships was  broken in  1998, when Chandler had \nto  settle for  runner-up to  Ben Bostrom. Unfortunately, the  Chandler- \nMuzzy dynamic came to  an  end after that season when Kawasaki \nbrought the  team back in-house for  AMA Superbike and  Muzzy moved \non.  Doug did  not  understand the  rationale for  pulling the  team from \nMuzzy, as  it had  gone from success to  success across the  years. “I think \nit  was tough; we  had a  pretty successful team.” Chandler stayed on \nwith \nKawasaki, \nwinning \nthree \nmore \nraces \nin \n1999 \nand \nfinishing \nfourth \nin  points. \nThese \ndays, \nDoug \nkeeps \nhimself \noccupied \nwith \nleisure \npursuits, \nsuch \nas \ncompeting \nwith \nhis  \nkids \nin  \n24-hour \nbicycle \nraces \n(they \nwon \nin  \n2009) \nand \nrunning \na \nschool \nfor \nmotorcycle \nroad \nracing. \nDoug \nChandler \ncan \nlay \nclaim \nto \nbeing \none \nof \nthe \ngreatest \nall-around \nmotorcycle \nracers \nin \nU.S. \nhistory. \nThrow \nin \nthe \nfact \nthat \nDoug \nhas \nwon \na \nround \nof \nthe \nAMA \nSupermoto \nChampionship \n(in \n2003), \nand \nthe \ndepth \nof \nhis \ntalent \nis \neven \nmore \namazing. \n\nTHE CONTENDERS \nChandler \nbelieves \nthat \nvariety \nis \npart \nof \nwhat \nhelped \nhim  \nenjoy \nsuch \na \nlong, \nsuccessful \ncareer. \n“I \nthink \nif \n'd \nnever \ngotten \nto \ntry \nthe \nroad \nrace \nstuff, \nId \nhave \nbeen \ndone \nand \nburnt \nout \na \nlong \ntime \nago. \nI’ve \nbeen \nable \nto \nkind \nof \njump \naround, \ncoming \nback \nto \nAmerican \nroad \nracing \nand \nthen \njump \non \nthe \nSupermoto. \nThere \nwas \nalways \nsomething \nreally \ncool. \nThat's \nan important \npart, being inspired.” \nJOHN HOPKINS \nJohn Thomas Hopkins is a rider of two  nations. Born on  May 22,  1983, in \nRamona, California, he  is the  only member ot his  family who was  born \nin  the  United States; John’s three older sisters were all born in  England. \nHopkins’ father raced the  Isle  of Man TT  before settling into the  rural \nSouthern California environs east  of San Diego. Growing up in the Golden \nState, it was  only natural that  John got his start in off-road racing: \nI was  a motocross guy since I was  about six years old. Most of my racing \nwas  local, at Perris, Barona Oaks, Glen Helen—the local tracks. My first \nbike was  a Honda Mini-Trail, and  then I went straight to  the  PW-50s \nand  eventually RM  and  Kawasaki 80s,  then the YZ125. I was  at Ponca \nCity, Oklahoma, for the national and  that  was  the first  time I did  road \nracing, funnily enough. They have a go-kart track on  their facility, and \nthey were having YSR nationals for 50cc bikes. They had  an  exhibition \nwhere we  could enter our  PW-50 into the race, and J actually raced that \nwith the knobby tires and lapped second place in every race  I entered. \nMeanwhile, John was  also  racing in the  motocross events, his real  reason \nfor being there. “I raced in  the  same race against Roger Lee  Hayden on \nhis \nlittle \ndirt \ntrack \nPW-50. \nNicky, \nwho \nwas \na \nlittle \nbit \nolder, \nwas \nracing \non  the YSR50.” \nHopkins \nwas  \na  \nregular \nat  \nthe  \nmotocross \nchampionships \nheld \nat  \neach \nyear \nat  \nLoretta \nLynn’s \nranch: \n“I \ndid  \nthem \nthrough \nwhen \nI \nwas  \nnine \nyears \nold, \nand \nI \nhad \na \nfew \ntop-five \nfinishes. \nWe \nwere \na \ncouple \nof \nyears \nbehind \nRicky \nCarmichael, \nwho \nwas \non \n80s \nwhen \nwe \nwere \non \n60s, \nand \na \ncouple \nof \nyears ahead of James Stewart.” \nDIPS \n\n224 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nGoing Ballistic \nAt \nage \n12, \nthere \ncame \na \ntipping \npoint \nthat \nled \nJohn \ninto \nroad \nracing \nfull- \ntime. \nIt \nwas \nthe \nopportunity \nto \nride \na \nproper \n125cc \nroad \nracer \nat \nthe \nStreets \nof Willow Springs: \nI rode an  Aprilia RS-125 for the  first  time. Going over 100  miles per \nhour was a  pretty exciting experience. There was a  guy, Al  Lyons, \nwho helped me  out;  my dad had just passed away and  we  didn't have \nany  money whatsoever. We  were having a  hard enough time with \nmotocross. Al  Lyons ran  a  mini-moto racing series, and he  always \nlooked out  for  me  and  got everything for  me  with the  125. It wasn't \nuntil I turned sixteen that I could run  on  any other tracks than Willow \nSprings. The  Hayden brothers had  just  been busted for  lying about \ntheir age, so  they completely changed the  rules around just before \nI was  about to  turn fourteen and  go  into WERA. That completely \nruined it for me,  because they made it age sixteen. I was  thinking that \nthis  wasn't going anywhere, and  I was  about to  put all my  focus back \ninto motocross. At that point, John Ulrich picked me  up  and offered \nme  a $40,000 contract. \nI was  ecstatic over that, and  I signed a  contract for  the  next two \nyears. He  put  me  into Aprilia Cup just  to  get  practice on  the  other \ntracks. We  had  a  couple of really good races with Ben Spies in  it; he \ngot me  at his home track at the old  Texas World. \nThat \nfirst \nyear \nwith \nUlrich \nwas \n2000, \nand \nHopkins \nwould \nwin \nthe  \n750 \nSupersport \ntitle \nin  \nhis  \nfirst \nattempt \nat  \nage  \n17.  \n“I  \nwas  \nactually \nriding \nthe \nFormula \nXtreme \nbike \nthat \nyear \nas \nwell, \nto \nget \na \nfeel \nfor \nit,” \nhe \nsays. \n“Also \nin \n2000, \nfunnily \nenough, \nI \nhad \njust \nbeen \nriding \nthe \n600 \nand \n750 \nfour-strokes, \nand \nthat \nwas \nwhen \nPeter \nClifford \nasked \nme \nto \ntest \nthe \nRed \nBull \nYamaha \n[500cc \nGP \nbike] \nover \nat \nBrno. \nThey \nwere \npretty \nhappy \nwith \nhow \nthe \ntest \nwent, \nso \nthey \noffered \nme \na \ntest \nthe \nfollowing \nyear” \nHopkins’ \nballistic \ncareer \npath \nhad  \ntaken \nhim \nfrom \ntrack \nday \nRS125s \nstraight \nto \nbeing \na \nsalaried \nAMA \nFormula \nXtreme \nracer, \nwhile \ntesting \na \n500cc \ntwo-stroke \nGP \nYamaha \nat \nBrno. \n\nTHE CONTENDERS \nHopkins \ncontinues: \n“In  \n2001, \nSuzuki \ncame \nout  \nwith \na  \nbrand-new \ndesign \nand \nthe \nteam \nworked \nhard \nand \nput \ntogether \na \nreally \ngood \nFormula \nXtreme \nbike \ngoing \ninto \nthe \nseason. \nIt \nwasn't \nfar \nfrom \nwhat \na \nSuperbike \nwas; \nwe \nhad \na \ncouple \nof really \ngood \nraces.” \nKeith Perry is the crew chief for M4 Suzuki, and he was  on  hand when \nSpies and  Hopkins were teammates in 2000: \nI have a  picture in  my  office of Ben  and  John racing back and  forth \non  the  Valvoline Suzukis in the  600  class. It’s pretty cool to  see  those \nguys and  where they are  now. Early on,  John didn't have a lot of feel \nfor what the bike did underneath him; he rode to the setup. We would \nknow from the  stopwatch because John rode the bike to the ultimate. \nHe  didn't learn that  stuff about setup until later with the  750  and  the \nFormula Xtreme bike, when he started giving much better feedback. \nJohn won the  750  Superstock Championship for  us  first  in 2000 \nand the  Formula Xtreme Championship the  following year. After \nJohn left  for  MotoGP, Ben  Spies returned to  run  the  750  Superstock \nfor  us.  It was  clear that both of those guys were extremely talented, \nand  if they kept their focus they were going to  go places. One thing \nthat  impressed me  is that  Hopkins was  so  focused; he could truly dial \neverything out  and  really focus on  the  bike, the  track, and  the  race. \nJohn Ulrich was a friend of the  MotoGP team owner that Hopkins \nwent to  [Peter Clifford], and  he asked about young kids coming up. \nUlrich told him, “Hey, I’ve got one  for you now.’ Connections and luck \nwith the timing played a huge role  for both of those guys. \nHopkins’ final AMA race  was  memorable and helped serve as  his spring- \nboard \nonto \nthe \nworld \nstage. \n“The \nFormula \nXtreme \ntitle \nwas \nup \nfor \ngrabs,” \nKeith Perry recalls: \nIn  \nthe  \nrace, \na  \nbolt  \nbroke \non  \nabout \nlap \nthree, \nand  \nJohn \nlost  \nmaybe \na \nsecond \nand \na \nhalf \nfor \na \nlap \nor \ntwo, \nbefore \nhe \nlearned \nhow \nto \nride \nthe \nthing \nwith \nthe \ntop \ntriple \ntree \nnot \neven \nconnected \nto \nthe \nsteering \nstem. \nThere \nwas  \na  \n30mm \ngap  \nbetween \nthe  \nsteering \nstem \nand  \nthe  \ntop  \ntriple \n\n226 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \ntree. \nHe \nknew \nit \nfelt \nfunny, \nbut \nhe \ndidn’t \nlook \ndown \nbecause \nhe \ndidnt \nwant \nto \nknow. \nIt \nwas  \none  \nof \nthe \nmost \namazing \nthings \nI’ve  \nseen \nin \nmy \nwhole \ntwenty \nyears \nwith \nTeam \nHammer, \nwhat \nJohn \ndid \nto \nwin \nthat \nchampionship. \nJohn \nhad \nthe \nability \nto \nturn \nwhatever \nproblems \nhe \nhad \ninto  a nonfactor and do it in a nonchalant way. \nHopkins won't forget the experience any time soon: \nIt was  the  toughest race to  get  through mentally, thinking that the \nentire front end was  going to fall off. It was  only about four or  five laps \ninto  the  race, and  it had  about an  inch and a half of thrust, so  every \ntime I'd hit the brakes the thing would clank and  shake like crazy. The \ndeal with Red  Bull  Yamaha was  still  up  in the  air  at  the  time; I think \nmy performance in that race was  what clinched it. \nStraight to MotoGP \nHopkins was  still  just 18  years old  when he joined the  Red Bull World \nChampionship Motorsports (WCM) 500cc GP  Yamaha team for  the \n2002 season: \nMy teammate was  Garry McCoy, and  the  bikes were more based on \nGarry’s riding style. McCoy had the thing sliding around all the time, \neven with Michelin tires, more than anybody. The  way that Dunlops \nmoved around all  the  time and  slid, Peter Clifford thought it would \nbe  a  better option for  the  team to  go  to  the  Dunlops. It completely \nbackfired, on.McCoy as  well, because the  Michelins weren't supposed \nto \nslide, \nbut \nwhen \nthey \ndid, \nthey \nwere \nstill \ndriving. \nDespite \nthat, \nwe \nhad \nsome \nreally \ngood \nraces. \nI \nqualified \nsixth \nin \na \ncouple \nof \nplaces \n. \n. \n. \ntook \nseventh \nat \nAssen. \nI \nwas \nconsistently \none \nof \nthe \ntop \ntwo-stroke \nfinishers throughout the year. \nThe  \ninaugural \nMotoGP \nseason \nhad  \nbeen \na \ntransitional \nyear. \nTeams \nhad \nthe  \noption \nof \nrunning \nthe  \nnew \nfour-stroke \n990cc \nbikes \nor  \ncontinuing \nto \nrace  \nthe \n500cc \ntwo-strokes. \nThe  \nRed  \nBull  \nYamaha \nteam \nhad  \nopted \nfor \nthe \n\nTHE CONTENDERS \nlatter \nand  \nwould \nstruggle \nas  \na \nresult, \nas  \nthe  \nseason \nwas  \ndominated \nby \nthe \nnew \n990cc \nmachinery. \nIt \ndid, \nhowever \ngive \nJohn \nHopkins \nan  \nappreciation \nfor \nracing \nthe \ntwo  \ndifferent \nkinds \nof \nmachinery \nwith \nadvanced \nelectronics \nthat  \nhe \nrode \nin \nlater \nseasons. \n“Back \nthen \non  \nthose \nmachines \nit \nwas  \npurely \njust \nriding \ndumb. \nThere \nwas \nso \nmuch \nmore \nthrottle \ncontrol \ninvolved; \na \n500 \nwas just \na pure \nbeast \nwith \nsuch \nlimited \ntraction.” \nHopkins finished the season 15th in points. Although he had finished \n25  points ahead of his teammate, he wasn't optimistic about his future in \nthe World Championship: “I thought, okay, this has been fun, and thought \nfor  sure Id  head back to  the  AMA and  race Superbike. Gary Taylor of \nSuzuki approached us  and offered us  a  ride on  the  Suzuki. For  sure I \nwanted to remain in Grand Prix.” \nHopkins spent the next five  seasons with Suzuki, where he developed \na lot of respect for his crew chief. “Stuart Shenton was  my crew chief the \nentire time I was  there; he's  a  really good guy  and  we  had a really good \nrelationship throughout the  entire time we  were working together.” The \nfirst  three years were marked by a lot of growing pains and the occasional \nglimmer of promise. The  2003 season included his crash with teammate \nRoberts Jr. and  a  one-race suspension for an  on-track incident in Japan. \nThe young American dropped to  17th in  the  final points standings, \nalthough this finish still put him  seven points ahead of Roberts. The 2004 \nresults were little better, as  Hopkins finished 16th, ahead of Roberts in \n18th. The  teammates would finish even in  points in  2005, with Roberts \nwinning the tiebreaker, relegating Hopkins to  14th. \n“The Suzuki was  always quite at bit down on  power in comparison to \nthe other machines,’ Hopkins explains: \nOne thing I learned is that  you  are  only as  good as  the  bike you  are \non.  Still, I was  in  Grand Prix, and  Id climb off the  bike happy with \nmyself \nbecause \nI \nknew \nthat \nI'd \ndone \nabsolutely \neverything \nthat \nI \ncould \nin \nevery \nrace \nthat \nI \nwas \nin. \nI \nalways \nhad \nto \nover-ride \nthe \nSuzuki \neven \nto \nget \na \ntop-ten \nposition. \nThe \nstyle \nI \ndeveloped \nwas \nsuper \nlate \nbraking; \nwed \nlose \nso \nmuch \nground \non \nthe \nstraightaway, \nI \nwould \nhave \nto \nmake \nit  \nup  \nsomewhere. \nI'd  \nbrake \nreally \nlate  \nand  \nhave \nthe  \nfront \npushing \na0 \n\n228 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \neverywhere; \nit \nwas  \na  \nstyle \nI \nadapted \nfrom \nover-riding \nthe  \nmachine. \nI \nguess \nmy \nthing \nis \nlate \nbraking; \nI’m \nreally \nlate \non \nthe \nbrakes. \nSuzuki \nput \nin a \nlot \nmore \ndevelopment, \nchanged \na lot \nof \npeople, \nand \nwe \nstarted \nmaking some big headway in 2005 and  2006. \nIn 2006, Suzuki brought in World Superbike champion Chris Vermeulen as \nHopkins’ teammate. This was  the year when Suzuki began the  turnaround \nin results, as  Hopkins finished tenth in the  points. Suzuki brought the  air \nvalve pneumatic valve closure system into its  new 75-degree V-twin 990 \nengine, typically known for giving less valve float, less friction, and allowing \nmore extreme cam  profiling than conventional valve spring engines. \nSuzuki was  thinking ahead, and  the pieces were being put  into  place, \nwith the  air valve engine just being one  part of the  puzzle. “We had  990 \nmotors in the 800  chassis for the entire year of 2006,” Hopkins recalls: \nSo  when we  came out  with the  800 [in 2007], it was really good. It \nhad  a smoother, more manageable throttle connection—that was  the \nmost substantial thing. There was  a  lot  of refinement; corner entry, \ncorner exit was  a lot smoother, and  it wasn’t jumping around as  much. \nIn  comparison with a lot  of the  other machines, it was  right there, \ndead even in  the  beginning of the  year. Unfortunately a  lot  of the \nJohn \nHopkins \non  \nthe \nRizla \nSuzuki \nin \n2007, \nthe \nyear \nin \nwhich \nhe \nfinished \nfourth \nin \nthe \nMotoGP \nWorld \nChampionship. \n\nTHE CONTENDERS \nother \nteams \ngot \na \nlot \nmore \nengine \npower \nmidway \nthrough \nthe \nseason, \naround Brno, so  we  started losing ground. \nRiding \na \ncompetitive \nbike \nat \nlast, \nHopkins \nfinally \nbroke \nthrough \nin \n2007, \ntaking \nhis  \nfirst \nWorld \nChampionship \npodium—a \nthird \nplace \nin  \nChina. \nThis \nwas \nfollowed \nby \nthree \nmore \npodiums \nand \nfourth \nplace \nin \nthe \nfinal \nstandings, ahead of Melandri and his Suzuki teammate Vermeulen. \nThe Switch to Kawasaki \nThings were looking up  for  Suzuki, but  Hopkins had  already decided to \nmove on  long before the end  of the 2007 campaign: \nI was  happy with the way the bike was  running, but it seemed we  were \non  a plateau a  lot  of the  time, and  I was  ready to  take a new look at \nracing. Id been in GPs as  a part of that family for so long, and I wanted \nto  change it up a little bit.  For  the last  two  years or  so,  it seemed like \nKawasaki had  made quite a few improvements; we  had a lot of confi- \ndence in the beginning of the season that they would do this or that in \nthe following years. We signed the Kawasaki contract early in the 2007 \nseason, for two  years [2008 and 2009]. \nHopkins’ experience at Kawasaki was  miserable and culminated with the \nmanufacturer abandoning its MotoGP program after the 2008 season: \nComing off the podium at Valencia in 2007, the best  finish Id ever  had \nfor  a  season, I went to  Kawasaki and  it was  just a  disaster. I’ve  hardly \nbeen able to ride; looking back, I’m not  sure  if Kawasaki knew they were \ngoing to pull out.  One thing that was  strange is that we  never got one  part \nthroughout the year. It was  identical to the bike they raced in 2007. \nTo \nmake \nmatters \nworse, \nHopkins \nsuffered \na \ndamaged \nvertebrae \nin \n2008 \nand \nthen \nendured \nankle \nand \nleg \nfractures \nafter \nmaking \nimpact \nwith \na \ntire \nwall \nat \nAssen. \nBetween \ninjuries \nand \nKawasaki's \ndeparture, \nJohn \nHopkins \nfound \nhimself \nwithout \na \nseat \nfor \nthe \n2009 \nMotoGP \nseason. \nHe \neventually \ntook \na \nride \n229 \n\n230 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nwith \nthe \nStiggy \nHonda \nWorld \nSuperbike \nteam \nat \nmidseason. \n“I \ngot \nthe \ncall \nto \ndo \nWorld \nSuperbike \nand \nwas  \nreally \nexcited,’ \nHopkins \nexplains. \n“I \ndidn't \nwant \nto \nbe \nhere \njust \nsitting \non \nmy \nbutt \nall \nyear \nand \nnot \nracing \na \nmotorcycle: \nSpeaking \nto \nHopkins \nin \n2009, \nhe \nwas  \noptimistic \nabout \nhis \nfuture \nand \nexcited \nto \nbe \ninvolved \nin \nthe \nSuperbike \nWorld \nChampionship: \nI'm  happy with what I’m  doing, as  I’m  racing a  motorcycle for  a \nliving. To be honest, I wouldn't even consider going back to MotoGP \nunless it was  on  a bike that was  competitive and could be winning. \n90 percent of the MotoGP racers on  the grid are  about 90 percent of \nmy size, and I’m not  exactly the tallest guy in the world [five feet, ten \ninches, 140 pounds]. The bikes are  built completely around these tiny \nguys. That was  one of the biggest issues that I had  at Kawasaki; it was \none  of the  smallest bikes on  the  grid and  | did  not  fit on  it whatso- \never. Between that, and  with the  electronics, there is no  movement \non  the  machine; they've taken a hell  of a  lot of  the fun  out  of riding \nthe bikes. I think every rider on  the  MotoGP grid would agree that \nWorld Superbike would be more fun  from the rider’s point of view. \nUnfortunately, 2009 would be another tough year. A shattering accident at \nAssen in his second event with the team left Hopkins with a dislocated hip. \nHe  returned a  few  months later to  race at  Donington, where he  finished \na fighting eighth. But  a few weeks later, he was  run  over in  a crash at  the \nNurburgring, suffering a brain injury that  was  at first  undiagnosed.

American rider and entrepreneur Steve McLaughlin, who had been \ninstrumental in  the  creation of the  AMA Superbike series, would play \na  similar role in  the  founding of the  World Superbike Championship. \nLarge minimum production numbers for the  new class resulted in an  era \nof quickly escalating production bike performance, with homologation \nspecials such as the Honda RC30 and Ducati 851 being coveted by a genera- \ntion  of riders. And from its very beginning in  1988, the new  series would \nbecome \na \nmagnet \nfor \nAmerican \nroad \nracing \ntalent. \nAmerican \ndominance \nof \nGP \nracing \nwas \nat \nits \npeak, \nand \nthe \nnew \nproduction-based \nseries \nwould \ngo \non \nto \nhave \nmore \nthan \nits \nfair \nshare \nof \nAmerican \nchampions, \nstarting \nwith the first World Superbike champion, Fred Merkel. \nFRED MERKEL \nFred \nNels \nMerkel \nwas  \nborn \non  \nSeptember \n28,  \n1962, \nin \nStockton, \nCalifornia. \nYet  \nanother \nin  \na  \nlong \nline  \nof \ngifted \nCalifornia \nracers, \nhe  \nrose \nrapidly \nthrough \nthe \nranks \nof \ndirt \ntrack \nand \nroad \nracing \nin \nthe \nearly \n1980s. \nSigned \nby \nHonda \nfor \nthe \n1983 \nSuperbike \ncampaign, \nhe \nexploded \nonto \nthe \nnational \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nscene, taking his first  win  at  the  midseason race at  Portland and  finishing \nwith a  victory at  the  season finale in  Daytona to  grab third in  the  points \nstandings behind Wayne Rainey and  teammate Mike Baldwin. \nMerkel was just  getting started. In  1984, he  dominated the  AMA \nSuperbike series, winning 10  of  13  races to  run  away with the  champi- \nonship. Perhaps of  more importance to  Honda, he  and Mike Baldwin \nwon the  8  Hours of  Suzuka that year as  well. Merkel would take his \nsecond straight AMA Superbike title  in  1985 on  the  strength of six  wins \nto  Kevin Schwantz’s three, while also giving the  Texan a  run for  his \nmoney in  the  Transatlantic Match Races, where Merkel finished a close \nsecond. For  1986 in AMA Superbike, Merkel’s main challenge came from \nhis  new Honda teammate, Wayne Rainey. Despite six  wins for  Rainey \nto  Merkel’s two, it  was Merkel who came out  on  top  to  take his  third \nconsective title. \nFred \nMerkel \n(left) \nwith \na \nyoung \nKevin \nSchwantz. \nDMT \nImaging \nin) \nWwW \n\n234 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nHaving \nmoved \nto \nItaly \nfor \nthe  \n1987 \nseason, \nMerkel \nwas  \nperfectly \nposi- \ntioned \nto \ncarry \nhis \ndominance \nacross \nto \nEurope \nwith \nthe \ncreation \nof \nWorld \nSuperbike \nfor \n1988. \nThe \nflamboyant \nMerkel \nand \nthe \nnew \nHonda \nRC30 \nfound \nimmediate \nsuccess \nin \nthe \nnew \nseries, \nwinning \nthe \ntight \n1988 \nWorld \nSuperbike \nChampionship \nwith \ntwo \nwins \nand \nnumerous \nstrong \nfinishes, \ndespite \nstrong \ncompetition \nfrom \nthe \nlikes \nof \nfuture \nfive-time \nGP \nworld \nchampion \nMick \nDoohan \n(Yamaha, \nthree \nwins), \nlongtime \nDucati \nWorld \nSuperbike \nteam \nmanager \nDavide \nTardozzi \n(Bimota, \nfive \nwins), \nand \n1981 \nGP \nworld \nchampion \nMarco \nLucchinelli \n(Ducati, \ntwo \nwins). \nMerkel would repeat as  champion in  1989, once again fending off \nintense competition from several different directions. The Californian \nstarted strong with a  sweep of the  Hungarian rounds to  move into the \nchampionship lead. He  remained atop the  standings until Stephane \nMertens (RC30) began a  strong midseason run  for  the  title, as  did  GP \nveteran Raymond Roche (five wins) when the Ducati didn’t let him down. \nThe  battle between Merkel and  Mertens came down to  the  final event, \nand  with a  catastrophic brake failure for  Mertens in  race one, Merkel’s \nthird-place finish gave him a  commanding lead in  points. Mertens did \neverything he could by winning race two, but  Merkel rode to  a  podium \nfinish to secure his second straight World Superbike Championship. \nHaving achieved the  Superbike hat  trick in the  United States, Merkel \nwas  now attempting to  do the  same on  the  world stage. The  1990 season \nunfolded as  a  battle royale between Merkel, Roche, and  Mertens. With \nthree wins and a second in the first  eight races, Merkel started strong, but \nRoche started stronger, with three wins and  four seconds. Sadly, Merkel \nwould not  get  a-chance to  properly defend his  titles: He  was seriously \ninjured at the midseason 8 Hours of Suzuka 8 race. \nMerkel \nrecovered \nto  \nreturn \nto  \naction \nin  \n1991 \nriding \nfor  \nYamaha. \nHowever, \nhis  \nthree \nseasons \nwith \nthe  \nteam \nwould \nprove \ncomparatively \nfruitless. \nHe  \nheaded \nback \nto  \nAmerica \nin  \n1994, \nwhere \nhe  \nwon \nseven \nof \nten  \nraces \nin  \nthe  \n1995 \n750  \nSupersport \nseries. \nBut  \nthis  \nwould \nbe  \nhis  \nfinal \ncampaign, \nas \nFred \nsuffered \ngrievous \ninjuries \nwhen \nhe \ncrashed \nagainst \na \nbarrier \nin \nthe \nseason \nfinale \nat \nFirebird \nRaceway. \nHe \nwould \neventually \nrecovery \nfrom \nhis \nwounds, \nalthough \nhe \nretired \nfrom \nracing \nand  \nnow \nlives \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nin \nNew \nZealand. \nFred \nMerkel, \nthe \nfirst \nWorld \nSuperbike \nchampion, \nblazed \na trail in the  series that many Americans would follow. \nDOUG POLEN \nFrenchman Raymond Roche won the World Superbike Championship in \n1990 aboard the factory Ducati 888. He remains the only European to win \nthe  WSB Championship. Roche would not  retain his  title  a  second year, \nhowever, as  he  was  soon overtaken by another American, Doug Polen, \nwho had  some of his  first professional motorcycle racing experience as \nFreddie Spencer's mechanic. Starting a professional racing career on  the \nworld stage at  the  age  of 30  is an  unusual path to  success, but  much like \nArgentina’ Juan Manuel Fangio (who started his European racing career \nin  his  late 30s), both were to  find immediate success. The 1991 and 1992 \nWorld Superbike seasons would be dominated by the man from Texas. \nDoug Polen was  born September 2,  1960, in  Detroit, Michigan. His \nfamily would eventually settle in Texas, and Doug would be one  of several \nriders from the Lone Star State to take the racing world by storm in the late \n1980s and  early 1990s. In  1987, he would compete full-time in the AMA \nSuperbike class and  finish an  impressive fourth in points behind Rainey, \nSchwantz, and Shobert. He would also win the 600  Supersport title on  the \nstrength of eight victories out  of nine races. \nFor  1988, Polen switched to  Suzuki. He  would be the  busiest guy  in \nthe  pit lane that season, riding in  600  Supersport, 750  Supersport, and \nSuperbike. In  the  top  class, he  would fall  short in  a  season-long battle \nwith fellow Texan Bubba Shobert. In  600 Supersport, Polen success- \nfully defended his  1987 title, taking two  wins along the  way. And in  a \nnear sweep of America’s three premier series, Polen nipped Scott Russell \nby \nthree \npoints \nin \n750 \nSupersport, \nwinning \nfive \nof \nthe \nnine \nraces, \nincluding Daytona. \nDoug \nwas  \nready \nto  \nstep  \nonto \nthe  \nworld \nstage, \nand  \nin  \n1989 \nhe \nmoved \non \nto \nrace \nfor \nSuzuki \nin \nJapan. \nWhile \nracing \nin \nthe \n1989 \nJapanese \nnational \nseries, \nPolen \ngot \nthe \nopportunity \nto \ndo \na \none-off \nappearance \nat \nthe \nJapanese \nround \nof \nthe \nWorld \nSuperbike \nChampionship \nat \nSugo, \nwhere \nhe \nwould \nmake \nan  \nimmediate \nimpact \nby \nwinning \nrace \none. \nFor  \n1990 \nPolen \ners) \n\n236 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \ncontinued \nto  \nrace \nin \nthe  \nJapan \nseries, \nbut  \nthe  \nfollowing \nyear \nhe \nmade \nthe \nswitch \nto \nEraldo \nFerracci’s \nDucati \nteam \nin \nWSB. \nThe  rest  would be history, as  the  Superbike world was  unprepared for \nwhat was  surely the  most dominant season in  World Superbike history. \nPolen destroyed everyone in  his  path, winning 12  of the  first 16  races in \ndominant fashion. Roche and  Mertens managed to  scratch out  a few wins \nas  the season rolled along but almost always when Polen struck some sort \nof mechanical problem. Polen started almost every race from pole, and his \nrecord of six straight pole positions stood for  18 years before fellow Texan \nBen  Spies broke it in 2009. \nIn  1992, Polen made an  attempt at  an  unheard-of double, going for \nboth the  World and AMA Superbike Championships. Moving over to \nthe  factory Ducati team, Polen won nine races to  again claim the  World \nDoug \nPolen, \n1991 \nWorld \nSuperbike \nChampion \naboard \nthe \nDucati \n888. \nDMT \nImaging \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nSuperbike \ncrown, \nalbeit \nin  \na  \nconsiderably \ncloser \nrace \nthan \nthe  \nprevious \nseason. \nIn  \nthe  \nUnited \nStates, \nPolen \nwas  \nunable \nto  \nachieve \nhis  \nambitious \ngoal despite \nthree \nwins \nin \nthe \nnine-race \nschedule. \nThe \nAMA \ncrown \nwould \ngo \nto \nhis \ngreat \nrival, \nScott \nRussell. \nThe careers of Scott Russell and Doug Polen will forever be intertwined, \ntheir head-to-head duels among the  greatest in the  history of Superbike \nracing in the United States. Their most memorable confrontation came at \nDaytona in 1992. For 200  miles, the pair battled on  the track and in the pits \nin a race of speed and strategy. Russell knew he had a top speed advantage \nover Polen, but he never showed his hand until he made a surprise move \nto  slingshot past Polen on  the  run  to  the  finish. Polen was  denied the \nDaytona win  he coveted, and  Ducati has yet to win  the  Daytona 200. \nFor 1993, Polen narrowed his  focus to  the  AMA Superbike series. \nLarry Ferracci recalls the  Texan's AMA championship season: “When he \ngot on  the bike, he got it done. He was  at a career point where everything \njelled for him; he had  total focus, everything was  racing. Hed had  such a \nrun  with the  World Championships, he was  relaxed and  focused.” Polen \nwon six  of the  first  eight races on  his  way  to joining Fred Merkel as  the \nwinner of both AMA Superbike and World Superbike championships. \nPolen returned to the world stage in  1994, that time riding on  Honda's \nRC45. It was  not  to  be  a  successful move, and  Polen finished the  season \nwithout a  win but  pulled out  an  impressive fourth in  points. Doug \nreturned to  race  in America and eventually moved on  to success in World \nEndurance racing, becoming the  World Endurance Champion in  1997 at \nthe age of 37.  Doug Polen continues to race. He is a regular in the MotoST \nseries \nand \noccasionally \nmakes \nforays \ninto \nAMA \nSuperbike. \nIn \n2009, \nthe \n48-year-old finished 13th at Road America in the Superbike class. \nSCOTT RUSSELL \nRaymond \nScott \nRussell \nwas  \nborn \nin  \nEast \nPoint, \nGeorgia, \non  \nOctober \n28, \n1964. \nHe \nstarted \nfrom \nhumble \nbeginnings. \nAfter \nhigh \nschool, \nhe \nworked \nlong \nhours \nina \ntrash \nbag \nassembly \nplant. \nIn \n1985, \nRussell \nattended \nDaytona \nBike \nWeek \nas \na \nspectator. \nThere \nhe \nwatched \nFreddie \nSpencer \ndominate \nthe \nweek \nas \nnobody \nhas \nbefore \nor \nsince, \nsweeping \nSuperbike, \n250 \nGP, \nand \n237 \n\n238 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nthe  \nDaytona \n200  \nraces. \nThe  \n20  \nyear \nold  \nRussell, \ninspired \nby \nseeing \nthe \nAmerican \nWorld \nChampion \nat \nthe \npeak \nof \nhis \nabilities, \nbegan \nto \npractice \nby \nriding \nthe \nmountain \nroads \nof \nGeorgia \non \na \nKawasaki \nNinja \n600. \nBy \nthe \nfollowing \nyear, \nhe \nwas \nappearing—and \nwinning—at \nvarious \nracetracks \nthrough \nthe \nsouth. \nRussell \nprogressed \nquickly, \nand \nin \n1988, \nhe \ntook \nhis \nfirst \npro \nwin, \nand \na \nsweet \none \nat \nthat: \nOn \nhis \nhome \ntrack \nat \nRoad \nAtlanta, \nriding \nhis \nown \nSuzuki, \nRussell \ndefeated \nDoug \nPolen \non \nhis \nYoshimura \nSuzuki. \nThe \nfollowing \nyear, \nRussell \nhimself \nwas \nriding \nfor \nYoshimura, \nand \nthe \nup-and-coming \nyoung \nGeorgian \nnotched \nhis \nfirst \nSuperbike \nwin, \nonce \nagain \nat his \nhome \ntrack \nof \nRoad \nAtlanta. \nThe  1990 season brought a switch to Muzzy Kawasaki, and  from 1990 \nto  1992, Russell would rule  the  AMA 750  Superstock class, winning the \nchampionship three straight years. In  1992, Russell won the Daytona 200, \nconsidered by many to be the greatest 200  ever. \nRussell’s crew chief, Rob Muzzy, recalls the  race: “We knew through \ntire  testing and practice that if we  were within drafting distance on \nthe  last lap, we  could pass him. But  we  didn't want [Polen] to  know that. \nSo, the entire weekend, if Scott was  near Doug, he would never pass him \non  the straightaway.” It turned out  that Polen had been holding something \nin reserve as  well, as  Russell explains: “I was  just sitting on  him, thinking \nI've got this in the bag, waiting for the race  to be over. As it turned out,  on \nthe  last lap coming through the  chicane, he came out  of there a lot faster \nthan he had the whole race. I learned from one  of the best  following that \nguy around.” \nIt came down to  a timely draft from a  lapped rider to  launch Russell \npast \nright \nat \nthe \nfinish. \nFor \nScott \nRussell, \nthe \nMr. \nDaytona \nlegend \nhad begun. \nRussell \nwould \nwin \nthe  \nAMA \nSuperbike \ntitle \nthat \nyear, \nwhile \nalso \ntaking \na  \nfew \npodiums \nin  \na  \nhandful \nof  \nexploratory \nrides \nin  \nWorld \nSuperbike \non  \nthe  \nMuzzy \nKawasaki. \nIronically, \nRussell \nand \nPolen \nwould \nswitch \ntheir \npriorities \nfor \n1993, \nas \nRussell \nheaded \noff \nto \nWorld \nSuperbike \nwith \nthe \nMuzzy \nKawasaki \nand \nDoug \nreturned \nto \nthe \nUnited \nStates \nto \nagain \nride \nthe \nPast \nby \nFerracci \nDucati \nin \nanother \nattempt \nat \nthe \nAMA \nSuperbike \ntitle. \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nNarrowly beaten at  Daytona by Lawson (0.05 seconds), Russell made \nup  for  it by winning the  8 Hours of Suzuka for  Kawasaki—the first, and \nstill  only, win  for Kawasaki in this  most important of races. \nMoving into World Superbike full-time, Russell soon found himself \ninvolved in yet another epic rivalry, this time with the Ducati-mounted Carl \nFogarty. “Fogarty was  the opposition, the extreme rivalry,” says Muzzy. “And \nthe  press made a  big deal of it.  | don’t know if it was  anywhere as  personal \nas  the press made it out  to be, but the rivalry was  between the two.” \n“We got  along quite well with all  the  Ducati guys,” Kawasaki WSB \nteam manager Peter Doyle recalls. “It  was just a  thing between Russell \nand  Fogarty, and  we  didn't help the  situation with Fogarty because wed \nbait  Scott up with things. Wed push that  along a bit.” \nThere were enough differences between the  riders and  the  teams to \nmake a good rivalry: the  British Fogarty versus the Georgian Russell; the \nare ON ee \nRussell \non  \nthe \nMuzzy \nKawasaki \nSuperbike \nexiting \nthe \nfinal \nturn  \nat  \nLaguna \nSeca’ \nAMA \nNational \nin  \n1993, \nthe \nsame \nyear \nhe \nwas  \nto \nbecome \nWorld \nSuperbike \nChampion. \nDMT \nImaging \nZo, \n\n240 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nall-conquering \nItalian \nDucati \nfactory \nteam \nversus \nMuzzy’s \nmuch \nmore \nhumble \norganization. \n“By \ncomparison, \nour \nprogram \nbudget-wise \nwas \nnowhere \nnear \ntheirs” \nMuzzy \nexplains. \n“It \nwas \nScott's \ndetermination, \nwill, \nand \nconsistency \nthat \nultimately \nwon \nthe \nchampionship. \nIt \nwasn't \nthat \nwe \nhad \na \nbetter \nbike \nthan \nDucati, \nbecause \nwe \ndidn't.’ \n“In \n1993 \nwe \nwere \nrunning \nWSB \nout \nof \nthe \nback \nof \na \nbox \ntruck, \nbasically,’ \nsays \nRussell. \n“It \nwasn’t \nlike \nthe \nDucati \nsetup \nwith \nten \ndifferent \nmotors \nready \nto \nslap \ninto \nthe \nbikes.” \nThe  championship might never have been so  close but  for  Fogarty’s \nwin-it-or-bin-it approach. The  Brit  won 11  of the  26  races in  1993, but \nhis  other results would ultimately leave the  door open for  Russell. The \nAmerican’s five  wins would be  less  than half of  Fogarty’s total; it  was \nRussell’s 12 second-place finishes that made all the difference. Much of the \ndrama came at Donington Park. “Scott had  a big one  in practice,” recalls \nDoyle. “He was  lucky that he could ride. His teammate Aaron [Slight] was \nprobably the quickest guy,  but slowed and  he helped Scott.” \nRussell swept both races at  Donington Park to  take a commanding \nlead going to the penultimate round at  Portugal. There, Fogarty was  only \nable to  take three points back from Russell, and  the  American carried a \n29-point lead  into  the final round at Mexico City. \nAn  intense and  exciting season would come to  a  bizarre and  chaotic \nend  in Mexico. “The whole thing was  just a disaster,” recalls Doyle: \nSoccer balls on  the track, trucks going across the track in front of your \nriders. Aaron [Slight, Russell's teammate] got hit in the head by a soccer \nball  going through the  esses around back. The  track was  dangerous; \nthere was  no  security. Our tires didn’t turn up;  they wouldn't let  the \nAmerican teams through the  border; it was  just  a  disaster. Michelin \nhad  its tires there, but there were no  Dunlops.” \nThe  \nMexico \nCity \nrace \nwas  \nat  \nthe  \nsame \ncircuit \nwhere \nthe  \n1970 \nFormula \nOne \nMexican \nGrand \nPrix \nsaw  \nspectators \nclimbing \nover \nthe  \nfences, \nsitting \ntrackside. \nIn  \nthat \nevent, \nthe  \ndrivers \neventually \nraced \nto  \navoid \na \nriot  \nafter \nunsuccessfully \npleading \ntheir \ncase \nto  \nthe \nassembled \nspectators. \nIn \nthe \nrace \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nJackie \nStewart \nhit \na \ndog \nwith \nhis \nTyrrell. \nIn \nthe  \n1993 \nversion \nof \nthe \nasylum, \nbetween \ndodging \ndogs \nand \ngarbage, \nScott \nRussell \nhada \npickup \ntruck \ncross \nthe \ntrack \nas \nhe \nclosed \nat \n190 \nmiles \nper \nhour. \nThe \nrace \nwas \neventually \nabandoned \nfor safety \nreasons, \nand \nRussell \nwas \nthe \nWorld \nSuperbike \nchampion. \nBizarre ending or  not,  Russell, Muzzy, and  Kawasaki had  managed a \nremarkable accomplishment. “What a great rivalry that turned out  to be?” \nRussell says proudly. “Ducati had such a  stranglehold on  the series, and for \nus  to  come in there and  beat them was  unheard of?  Peter Doyle told  the \nauthor that  the celebrations were equally impressive: “Scott, Aaron, a few \nof the mechanics .  .  .  after the  race  we  went down to Acapulco for  a week \nof drinking beer, laying around on  the beach, and playing golf.” \nThe author asked Doyle if  he  remembers much of  that week: \n“No [laughs] ...” \nRussell was  the first rider on  an  inline four to win  the World Superbike \ntitle, in an era  dominated by V-twin and V-4 low-volume production racers. \nRussell's title  meant that Americans had been World Superbike champions \nfor five  of the  series’ first  six  seasons. “You could see a little bit of Spies in \nhim,” says  Doyle. “They are  highly different people, Spies and  Russell, but \nsimilar as  far as  the racing goes, quick to pick up tracks and always fast.’ \nThe 1994 season was another epic battle between Fogarty/Ducati \nand  Russell/Muzzy Kawasaki. On  paper at least, the determined Fogarty, \narmed with the new  Ducati 916,  looked to be the overwhelming favorite. \nBut Russell and the Muzzy Kawasaki effort continued to punch well above \ntheir weight. A broken wrist would sideline the  Englishman for  several \nraces, and  Russell took advantage. After six  races Russell had  four wins \nand  a  62-point lead over the  Englishman. Upon his return, Fogarty won \nfive of the next six races and the battle was  on.  Russell responded with two \nwins at Sugo in the Japan rounds, to which Carl responded with two  wins \nat \nAssen. \nThey \nsplit \nwins \nat \nSan \nMarino, \nand \nRussell \nswept \nDonington \nPark \nto \nclose \nwithin \nfive \npoints \ngoing \ninto \nthe \nfinale \nat \nPhillip \nIsland. \nFogarty \nwould \nwin \nrace \none \nand \ntake \nsecond \nin \nrace \ntwo \nto \nseal \nthe \ntitle, \nbut \nit \nhad \nbeen an  unforgettable season. \nRussell \ngot \nsome \nmeasure \nof \npayback \nat \nDaytona \nin  \n1995: \n“I \nfell \ndown \nand  \nstill  \nwon \nby \n45  \nseconds \nover \nFogarty, \nwhich \nwas  \nthe  \nbest  \nthing \nin \n241 \n\n1) iw) \nGRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nthe  world. He  was  in the  papers going on  about how he hates the  Yanks, \nhe hates Daytona, blah blah blah. So we  sent him  home. Come on,  dude, \nI’ve  seen the  Isle of Man. You  did  what you  did  there, and  you  are  scared \nof this  place?” \nUnfortunately, a third straight season of Russell versus Fogarty was  not \nin the cards for 1995. The new  Kawasaki that was  introduced post-Daytona \nwas  well down on  power and off the  pace. “I tried as  hard as  I could, and in \nthe first  three races,” says  Russell, “I had  my ass  handed to  me.” \nMeanwhile, Kevin Schwantz’s abrupt midseason retirement left a spot \nopen at the Lucky Strike Suzuki GP team. Russell was  offered the chance to \ndo a test  on  the GP bike. Seeing this  as  his once-in-a-lifetime opportunity \nto race  in Grand Prix—which it likely was—he rode the unfamiliar bike for \nall it was  worth. Russell clocked faster times than Schwantz had previously \nand  Scott was  offered the ride, to the dismay and  anger of Rob  Muzzy. \n> \n1 \n=~ \nEN \nmae \npee \n*y \nScott \nRussell \ntoday. \nIf \nhe \nhadn't \nbeen \na  \nmotorcycle \nracer, \nhe \nwould \nhave \nmade \nan \nexcellent \ncourt \njester... \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nWhile \nhis  \nLucky \nStrike \nSuzuki \nteammate, \nDaryl \nBeattie, \nwon \ntwo \nGrands \nPrix \nand \nfinished \nsecond \nin \nthe \n1995 \ntitle \nchase, \nRussell \nwas  \nunable \nto \nmatch \nthat \nkind \nof \nform. \n“I \ndidn't \nknow \nwhat \nI \nwas \ndoing,” \nRussell \nsays \nwith \nthe \nbenefit \nof \nhindsight. \n“I \ndidn’t \nknow \nanything \nabout \ntwo-strokes. \nAnd \nhere \nI \nam \non \nthe \nbaddest \nmotorcycle \nin \nthe \nworld.” \nRussell had shown enough to warrant another season with Suzuki, and \nhe improved his form in 1996, finishing in sixth place in the championship \nand  taking over as  team leader after Beattie suffered serious head injuries \nin  preseason testing. Russell would never really come to  grips with the \n500cc GP Suzuki; he returned to World Superbike in 1997 and  1998 riding \nfor Yamaha, but he was  unable to recapture the form of 1993 and  1994. He \nwould, however, cement his reputation as Mr.  Daytona by winning the 200 \nboth years, making it five wins. \nRussell's career spiral led him to race  the Harley-Davidson VR1000 in \nAMA Superbike for two  wasted seasons before signing to race  the Ducati \nin 2001. A horrendous crash when the stationary Russell was  collected by \nthe pack at the start essentially ended his racing career. \nInducted into the  AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in  2005, Russell \nmade a  one  race return to  motorcycle racing in  2008 at—appropriately \nenough—Daytona. Russell currently offers his  knowledge, wisdom, and \ntrademark southern charm to Speed TV’s AMA racing broadcast team. \nJOHN KOCINSKI \nJohn Kocinski was  and  still  is the only American rider to earn the title  of \nWorld Champion in both GP racing (250cc in 1990) and World Superbike \n(1997). A  rider of unquestioned and  at  times unsurpassed talent, some \nsay that  watching Kocinski ride a 250  GP bike was  to witness the ultimate \nexpression of riding on  the limit. Blessed with otherworldly riding skills, \nit  may have been his  off-the-bike demeanor that held him back from \nachieving \nhis \nultimate \nambition: \nto \nbecome \n500cc \nworld \nchampion. \n“John \nwas, I think, a very talented man,’ says Steve McLaughlin: \nHe \nhas  \nalso  \nprobably \ngot \nsome \nsort  \nof \nissues, \nbut  \nwe  \nhave \nour  \nquirks. \nLike \nmany \nof \nthe \nguys \nwho \ncame \nup, \nhe \nwas  \nyoung, \nprobably \nshy, \nand \n243 \n\n244 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nin \nsome \nways \nthe \ncommunication \nskills \nweren't \nthere. \nHe \ndidn't \ncome \noff \nas \nthe \ngood \nguy \nthat \nhe \nprobably \nwas. \nHe \nnever \nreally \nhad \nmanage- \nment; \nhe \ndid \nit \nall \non \nhis \nown. \nIf \nhe \nhad \nany \nmanagement, \nit \nwasn't \nvery \ngood. \nA \nlot \nof \npeople \nhave \nstories \nabout \nhim \nthat \nwere \nless \nthan \nflattering, but I never saw  him  that  way. \nJohn \nM.  \nKocinski \nwas \nborn \non  \nMarch \n20,  \n1968, \nin \nLittle \nRock, \nArkansas. \nLike \nmost \nof \nthe \nriders \nprofiled \nin \nthis \nbook, \nhe \nstarted \nyoung \nand \nsoon \ndemonstrated \nan \nuncanny \nknack \nfor \ntwo-wheeled \nracing. \nMcLaughlin \nremembers \nthe \nfirst time \nhe \nsaw him: \n“In \n1980, \nwhen \nI \nran Team \nHonda, \nI was \nat \nBrainerd. \n[Former \nKawasaki \nfactory \nracer] \nWalt \nFulton \ncame \nup \nand \nintroduced \nme \nto \nthis \nlittle \nkid. \nHe \ntold \nme, “This \nkid \nis \nreally \nfast’ \nThat was when I met John Kocinski.” \nKing of the 250s \nKocinski had  a meteoric rise  through the  ranks of racing. In  1987, at the \nage of 19, he won five  of the  nine rounds of the  AMA 250  series to  earn \nhis first  AMA 250  Grand Prix Championship. In  1988, he  raised the  bar \neven higher, winning six  of seven races to  repeat as  250  champion, and \nhe was  the  pole-sitter at  the  World Championship 250  USGP. In  1989, \nKocinski won six  of eight races in 250  GP,  while also  taking a dominant \nwin in 600 Supersport at Daytona. He also competed in some 250cc World \nChampionship races that  season, winning both the Japanese and  U.S.  250 \nGrands Prix. \nIt was obvious that Kocinski deserved a full-time World Championship \nopportunity, \nand \nKenny \nRoberts \nbrought \nhim \non \nboard \nhis \nYamaha \n250 \nGP \nteam \nfor \n1990. \nThe \nyoung \nAmerican \ncontinued \nhis \nwinning \nways, \ntaking \nthree \nof \nthe \nfirst \nfour \nGrands \nPrix \nof \nthe \nseason. \nHe \nwould \nface \na \nspirited \nchallenged \nfrom \nSpain’s \nCarlos \nCardus, \nwho \nwon \nfour \nraces \nmidseason, \nbut \nKocinski \nwas \nup \nto \nthe \ntask, \ntaking \nthe \nfinal \ntwo \nraces \nto \nclinch \nthe \ntitle. \nIn \nall, \nhe \nhad \nwon \nseven \nof \nthe \nfifteen \nGrands \nPrix, \nleaving \nlittle \ndoubt \nthat \nhe \nwas \nthe \nmaster \nof \nthe \n250 \nGPs \non \nboth \nsides \nof \nthe \nAtlantic. \nWith \nnothing \nleft \nto \nprove \non  \nthe \n250s, \nKocinski \nwas  \nready \nto \nmove \nup \nto \nthe \npremier \nclass. \nOnce \nagain, \nKenny \nRoberts \ngave \nhim \nthe \nnod, \nbringing \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nKocinski up to ride alongside the defending 500cc world champion, Wayne \nRainey, for  1991. At  age  22,  Kocinski found himself riding for the  sport’s \ntop team with a chance to learn from the best rider of his era.  It looked like \na dream scenario, but  things did  not  turn out  as  planned. \nPersonality Conflicts \nThe  campaign started out  well  enough for Kocinski. In the season-opening \nJapanese Grand Prix, he was  right in the middle of a furious four-way battle \nwith Schwantz, Doohan, and Rainey. Kocinski finished fourth, but  only \none-half second covered the four riders at the finish. At the second GP of the \nseason in Australia, Rainey won over Doohan, with Kocinski a few seconds \nbehind. A   tense rivalry was  brewing between the  Yamaha teammates, and \ntheir worlds would collide at round three at Laguna Seca. \nA teammate is perhaps the only yardstick by which a rider can  measure \nhimself, given the  admittedly hypothetical premise that the  equipment \nis  equal. Kocinski was accustomed to  being the  fastest rider in  every \nJohn Kocinski in 1991.

Every qualifying session, every \npractice session, I made sure  I was  quickest, even if it was  only by a tenth \n[of a  second]. It all started unwinding for John when we  came here to \nLaguna Seca. I was  on the pole over  him, I think by less than a tenth, and \nI remember reading in the newspaper on  race day where Kocinski had \nsaid, “We're going to  see  who the  real  king of Laguna Seca is this  year \nand  from now on.”  You  don't want to  say that  to your fellow rider who \nis going to kick your ass.  Before he said that, I didn’t need motivation to \nbeat  him, just having him  there was  enough. But  after he said  that... \nWell, now I was  just going to have fun doing it. So, in the race I got the \nhole shot, and I just took off. I think I had about a five-second lead, and \nhe threw it away. Never heard from John much after that again. \nRainey repeated as  500cc world champion, although Kocinski salvaged a \nsomewhat humbling season by winning the season-ending Malaysian GP \nover Honda teammates Mick Doohan and Wayne Gardner. (Both Rainey \nand  Schwantz sat  out  the  race with injuries.) There have been compari- \nsons drawn between Howard Hughes’ obsession with cleanliness and \nsimilar tendencies in  Kocinski. Doohan and  Gardner took great delight \nin  unloading their podium champagne on  Kocinski, who was  less  than \namused. \nAs \nMcLaughin \nhad \nsaid, \n“We \nall \nhave \nour \nquirks.” \nKocinski’s \nwin \nprovided \nthe \ntie-breaker \nthat \nenabled \nhim \nto \nclinch \nfourth \nin \nthe \nchampi- \nonship \nover \nWayne \nGardner. \nThis \nwas \na \nvery \nsuccessful \nyear \nfor \na \nrookie \n500cc \nGP \nrider \nby \nany \nstandard \nof \nmeasurement. \nThe \nsky \nwas \nstill \nthe \nlimit \nfor John Kocinski. \nHe  \nopened \nthe  \n1992 \nseason \nwith \na  \npole \nposition \nat  \nSuzuka, \nalthough \nhe  \nwould \nfail  \nto  \nscore \nany  \npoints \nin  \nthe  \nrace, \ncrashing \nfrom \nthe  \nbattle \nfor  \nthe  \nlead. \nInjuries \nkept \nhim \nout  \nof \ntwo \nraces, \nbut  \nhe  \nbounced \nback \nto  \ntake \nfour \npodiums \nbefore \nonce \nagain \nwinning \nthe  \nseason \nfinale, \nthis \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS 247 \ntime \nfrom \npole \nat  \nKyalami, \nSouth \nAfrica. \nKocinski \nfinished \nthe  \nseason \nthird \nin  \nthe  \nWorld \nChampionship, \nbehind \nonly \nRainey \nand \nDoohan. \nMeanwhile, \nthe  \natmosphere \nwithin \nthe  \nYamaha \nteam \nhad \nreached \na \npoisonous \nstate. \nOne \nrider \nwas going \nto have \nto \ngo, \nand \nit certainly \nwasn't \ngoing \nto \nbe \nthe three-time \ndefending \nworld \nchampion. \nIt  was never a  difficult decision for  Kenny Roberts, who clearly \nunderstood Rainey’s strengths and  Kocinski’s weaknesses: \nI think that  Wayne could do his  lap time all day long, and  John had \nto  really work hard to  do  that lap time. John had a little flaw in  his \nmakeup on corner speed, and he couldn't overcome that. He was always \nrushing, and  Wayne never had that. John, in another era,  would have \nbeen a 500cc world champion, but  not  against Rainey. You're talking \nabout fractions of an  inch. He wasn’t going to beat Wayne. \nKocinski moved on  to Suzuki for  1993, but in 250cc, not the premier class. \nIf the 25-year-old was  expecting a more benevolent scenario at Suzuki, \nhe was  disappointed, as  he would soon draw the ire of the team’s top-class \nsuperstar, Kevin Schwantz: \nHe  |Kocinski] was  a lot like Cadalora [known as The Enigma]. If he had \neverything right between his ears, you would struggle to see  which way \nhe went. Knock on  wood, it didn’t happen very often. He  was  one  of \nthose guys who was  pretty erratic; hed win  one  race, then wouldn't be \nin the top six  the  next three races. I made the mistake that  I thought I \ncould be John’s teammate for 1993, and they put him on  the Suzuki 250. \nWe were on  the same team, but he wasn't riding the 500.  Once I got to \nknow a little bit more about him  from what he did, how he tested, and \nwhat he was  like  from a behind-the-scenes viewpoint, I couldn't stand \nhim. He definitely has his own little quirks about him, and there is a lot \nof that in this sport, but John took it to a little bit different level. \nSchwantz \nwould \ntorment \nKocinski \nat  \nevery \nopportunity, \nand \nhe \ndescribes \none  \nexample: \n“His \ngirlfriend \nwas  \na  \nSpanish \ngirl  \nand  \nwas  \nan \n\n248 \nGRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nokay \nperson. \nBut  \nany  \ntime \nyoud \ntalk  \nwith \nher,  \nhe \nwould \ncome \nover \nand \nstand \nbetween \nyou, \nand  \nsay  \nhow \nyou  \ncouldn't \ntalk  \nto  \nher.  \nHe  \nwas  \nreally \nprotective \nof \nher.  \nSo,  \nat  \none  \npoint \nI \nput  \na  \n$10,000 \nbounty \non  \nwhoever \ncould \nsleep \nwith \nhis \ngirlfriend.” \nKevin \ntook \nno \nquarter \nwhen \nit \ncame \nto \nJohn. \nKocinski’s \ndeal \nwith \nSuzuki \nimploded \nmidseason, \nand  \nhe  \neventually \nfound \nhis \nway \nto \nCagiva, \nwhere \nhe \nfinished \nout \nthe \nyear \nin \nthe \n500cc \nclass. \nIt \nshould \nbe \nnoted \nthat \nhis \nteammate, \nDoug \nChandler—an \neasier \ngoing \npersonality \nthan \nmost—had \nno issues \nwith \nKocinski. \nChandler \nsays, \n“I \ngot \nalong \nwith \nhim, \nbut \nI \nhad \nknown \nhim \nsince \n1988 \nwhen \nhe \nwas \nstill \nracing \n250s \nover \nhere. \nI'd \ngo over \nto \nKenny’s \nin \nthe \nwinter, \nand \nwed \nall ride \ndirt \nbikes \ntogether. \nIn \nreality, \nhe wasn't \na bad \nguy \n. \n. \n. \nHed \nwin, \nwhich \nis \nwhat \nyou \nwant \nyour \nrider \nto do.” \nAnd win he  did. Although the  personality conflicts and behavior \ntended to  garner headlines over the  years, the  key  point in  hindsight \nwas that John Kocinski was blindingly fast. In  1994, he  won the \nseason-opening 500cc GP  in  Australia and  would take Cagiva to  a  very \nimpressive third in  the  World Championship. Sadly, Cagiva withdrew \nfrom the  sport at the  end  of the year, and  Kocinski would end  up  sitting \nout  the  1995 season. \nWorld Superbike \nThe Castiglioni brothers, who had  been behind the  Cagiva GP effort and \nwere also the  ownership group behind Ducati, brought Kocinski into \nthe  Ducati team for  1996. The  American was  brought in  to  replace Carl \nFogarty, \nwho \nhad \ngone \nto \nCastrol \nHonda. \nFrom \nthe \nvery \nbeginning, \nthe \nAmerican \nwas \non \nthe \npace, \nwinning \nboth \nraces \nat \nthe \nopening \nround \nat \nMisano \nand \ntaking \na \nvictory \nin \nfront \nof \nthe \nhome \ncrowd \nin \nrace \none \nat \nLaguna \nSeca. \nThe \nseason \nunfolded \nas \na \nfour-horse \nbattle \nbetween \nKocinski, \nAustralian \nTroy \nCorser, \nAaron \nSlight, \nand \nCarl \nFogarty, \nwith \nKocinski \neventually \nsettling \nfor \nthird \nin \nthe \npoints. \nBut \nonce \nagain, \npersonality \nconflicts \narose \nas \nthe \nseason \nwent \non, \nand \nthe \nrelationship \nbetween \nDucati \nteam \nmanager \nVirginio \nFerrari \nand \nKocinski \ndeteriorated \nto the point of no  return. \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nKocinski \nand \nFogarty \nessentially \ntraded \nplaces \nfor \n1997, \nwith \nthe \nBriton \nreturning \nto \nDucati \nwhile \nthe \nAmerican \nmoved \nto \nCastrol \nHonda. \nIf \nthe \npress \nhad \neaten \nup \nthe \nprodding \nbetween \nFogarty \nand  \nRussell \nin \nthe \nmid-1990s, \nthey \nwould \nfeast \non \nthe \nopen \nanimosity \nof \nFogarty \nversus \nKocinski, \ncirca \n1997. \nFogarty \nwould \nbait \nKocinski \nwith \ncomments \nabout \nhow \nthe \nDucati \nteam \nhad \nhated \nJohn \nto \nthe \nextent \nthat \nin \n1996 \nthey \nhad \nasked \nCarl \nto \nplease \nbeat \ntheir \nown \nrider. \nJohn’s \ncomments \nabout \nhow \nCarl \nwas \nriding \nfor \nthe \nMafia \nwere \nequally \nscathing. \nIt \nwent \ndownhill \nfrom \nthere. \nThe American quickly adapted to the Honda RC45 and won a race in \neach of the first two  events to open the season. Fogarty hung with him and \nwould hold the points lead for much of the season. As the season began to \nwind down, Kocinski swept the Laguna Seca races, cutting Fogarty’s lead \nto just four points. After race two  in Austria, Kocinski took the title lead \nfor good, winning four of the final eight races to become world champion \nonce again. \nJohn Kocinski was again a  world champion yet  brought scorn \nupon himself by his  aggressive moves in  the  final races in  Indonesia, \ntaking himself and  Simon Crafar on  the Kawasaki out  of race  two  during \na failed pass for the  lead. What should have been the  story of the RC45’s \npromise finally being fulfilled by an  American Grand Prix ace  turned into \nyet another volley of concerns raised about Kocinski. Doug Chandler says, \n“T think he was  his own worst enemy.” \nKocinski’s success for Honda in WSB enabled him  to  return to  500cc \nGP  racing in  1998 with the privateer Movistar-Honda team, and then in \n1999 for Erv  Kanemoto’s 500cc GP  Honda team with mixed results. John \nthen returned to the AMA for a final year riding for Vance and Hines on \nthe Ducati. Retiring from racing, Kocinski became involved in the Beverly \nHills real  estate scene, where he found as  much or  more success than he \never had  racing motorcycles. \n“I  \nunderstand \nhe  \nhas  \nmade \na  \nfortune \ndesigning \nhouses \nfor  \nrich \npeople” \nsays \nSteve \nMcLaughlin. \n“He \nfixed \nup \na \nhouse \nnext \ndoor \nto \nWill \nSmith \nor \nsomebody, \nWill \ntold \nhis \nfriend, \nwho \ntold \nhis \nfriend \n. \n. \n. \nThe \nnext \nthing \nyou \nknow, \nhe \nwas \nthe \nguy \nyou \nhad \nto \nhave \nin \nBeverly \nHills.” \n249 \n\n250 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nOne \nday \nin \n2003, \nit \ncrossed \nthe  \nmotorcycle \nnews \nwires \nthat \nKocinski \nhad  \nsold \nhis  \nhome \nin  \nBeverly \nHills \nfor  \nnearly \n$7 \nmillion. \nIt \nappears \nthat \nJohn’s \nlifetime \nstory \nof \nsuccess \nand \nconflict \nwill \nlikely \nhave \na \nprosperous \nending, \nand \nhis \nentry \nat \nthe \n2009 \nAMA \nPomona \nflat \ntrack \nfinale \nshows \nthat \nthe \nKocinski \nstory \nmay \nyet \nhave \nadditional \nracing \nchapters \nto \nbe \nwritten. \nCOLIN EDWARDS \nColin \nEdwards \nII \nhas \nfollowed \nin \nthe \nfootsteps \nof \nfellow \nTexans \nSchwantz, \nShobert, \nand  \nPolen \nto  \nbecome \none  \nof \nmotorcycle \nroad \nracing’s \nbiggest \nstars. \nBorn \nin \nHouston, \nTexas, \non \nFebruary \n26, \n1974, \nhis \nracing \nroots \nwere \nsimilar \nto \nKevin \nSchwantz’s—he \ngrew \nup \nriding \nthe \nmotocross \ncircuits \nof \nthe \nSouthwest, \nand \nhe \nstarted \nracing \nat age \nfour. \n“My \nfirst \nbike \nwas \na \nJR50 \nSuzuki, Edwards recalls: \nI did the Loretta’s [Loretta Lynn's Amateur Motocross Championships], \nbut I always had bad luck at Loretta’s running 60s and 80s.  But we ended \nup  winning three or  four national championships on  the  minibikes. \nIf I'd started racing motocross at maybe age six or  seven, I might have \ncontinued with it forever or  until I retired, but  I just burned out. I \ndidn't really have a life:  It was  get out  of school, get picked up, go ride \ntwo  or  three hours, come home and  clean the filter, clean the gear, do \nsome homework, eat  some dinner, and  go to bed. \n“I  took a  two-year hiatus,” Edwards continues, explaining how he  got \ninvolved in road racing when he was  17.  “What prompted the switch was \nthere was  a  guy  I used to  ride motocross with that I used to  beat pretty \nhandily. \nHe \nwas \nroad \nracing \nand \nhe \nwas \nwinning. \nI \nthought, \n‘If \nhe \ncan \ndo \nit, \n'm \ncertain \nI \ncan \ndo \nit’ \nThe \nfirst \nbike \nI \nhad \non \ntrack \nwas \na \nNinja \n250, \nand \nthen we  played around with some YSR stuff” \nIt \nwasn't \nlong \nbefore \nEdwards \nwas  \nenjoying \nsuccess \nas  \na  \nprofessional \nroad \nracer. \nIn  \n1992, \nhe \nwon \nthe  \nAMA \n250  \nGP  \nclass \non  \nthe  \nstrength \nof \nfive \nvictories \nin \nnine \nraces, \nincluding \na \nwin \nat \nDaytona. \nAt \nthat \npoint, \nhe \nhad \nthe \nopportunity \nto \nfollow \nin \nRandy \nMamola’s \nfootsteps \nby \njumping \nstraight \nup \ninto \nthe  \n500cc \nWorld \nChampionship. \n“Cagiva \nhad  \nwritten \nme  \na  \nproposal \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nKERSA \nan  eneney \nnoe \nColin Edwards, the  Texas Tornado, sporting his  Tech 3 Yamaha MotoGP bike  with \nspecial patriotic livery for the 2008 USGP. \nto  go  ride  the  500s midway through my  250  year in  the  AMA,” Edwards \nexplains. “We said no, because I wanted to see  my contract out with Yamaha. \nMat [Mladin] went over and did it, and crashed his brains out. He had a few \nbig ones. I was  quite happy I didn't do it after seeing that.” \nInstead, Edwards raced in the AMA Superbike series in 1993, finishing \nsixth in  points for  Vance &  Hines Yamaha. A  second season followed, \nwith Edwards taking sixth in  points, but  more importantly winning \nthree of the  last  four races to  attract the  attention of Yamaha's World \nSuperbike program. \n“Yeah, right about that time, I had  already been signed by Yamaha \nhere, and Yamaha decided to  do  this World [Superbike] effort,” Edwards \nrecalls. “When the guys from Japan came over, we  had a little meeting, and \nthey asked, ‘What do  you  think about going to  World Superbike instead \nof staying here?” \n“They were definitely hot on  having him,” says  Terry Vance. “While he \nwas \nhere, \nfor \nthe  \nlast \nfour \nor  \nfive \nmonths, \nhe \nwas \nunbeatable. \nI \nremember \nZo \n\n252 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nwe  \nwent \nto \nRoad \nAtlanta, \nand \ncoming \ndown \nthe \nhill \ntoward \nthe \nstart \nline, \nhe \nwas \nsliding \nboth \ntires \ncoming \nout \nof \nthat \ncorner \nand \nhe \nwas \npicking \ntwo \nor \nthree \nbike \nlengths \non \neverybody \nin \nthat \ncorner. \nIt \nwas \nunbelievable \nhow \nwell \nhe \nwas \nriding \nthe \nbike.” \nAnd \nso \nColin \nEdwards, \nage \n21, \nwent \nstraight \nto \nWorld \nSuperbike \nfor \nthe \n1995 \nseason. \nHe \nwould \nendure \nsome \nstruggles \nin \nhis \ndebut \ncampaign, \nand \nthe \nworst \nof \nthem \ncame \nlate \nin \nthe \nseason \nat \nAssen, \nwhen \nhis \nteammate, \nYasu \nNagai, \nwas \nkilled \nafter \nbeing \nstruck \nby \nhis \nown \nbike. \nThe \nYamaha \nteam \nwithdrew \nfrom \nthe \nseries \nfor \nthe \nremainder \nof \nthe \nseason. \nEdwards took his  first  international victory the  following year when \nhe teamed with Noriyuki Haga to win  the 8 Hours of Suzuka for Yamaha. \nSimilar success in  World Superbike was  not  to  be;  he  finished a  distant \nfifth behind the Corser-Slight-Fogarty-Kocinski battle. \nThe  1997 season would be even worse, as  Edwards explains: “Another \nYamaha rider at the time, Jean-Philippe Ruggia, he took me  out  at Monza \nand broke just about everything I had. I only did four races that year; I was \nout  the whole year.” \nComing into 1998, the young Texan had  few prospects: \nI was  out  the  whole year in  1997, so  I wasn't out  there showcasing \ntalent of any level; I was  swimming a lot in my pool trying to get better. \nUnfortunately, there are  no  cameras around so  nobody can  see  that. \nLuckily, Kocinski had  a deal in his  contract that  if he won the  cham- \npionship, he got to go back to 500s somehow, someway. So, I went [to \nCastrol Honda to take his place]. \nBack \nfrom \nthe \nbrink, \nEdwards \nwas  \nready \nto \nbreak \nthrough \nin  \n1998, \nand \nhe \nwould \ndo \nso  \nin \nstyle, \ntaking \nthe \ndouble \nat \nthe \nhallowed \ngrounds \nof \nMonza. \n“Probably \nit \nwas  \nthe \nonly \ntime \nI \nwas  \nkind \nof \nteary-eyed \non  \nthe \npodium,” \nhe \nrecalls. \n“That \nplace \nhas \nso \nmuch \nhistory, \nand \nthe \ndevil \nleft \nme \nthat \nweekend \nand \nI \nwon \nmy \nfirst \nand \nsecond \nat \na \nWorld \nChampionship \nevent.” \nEdwards \nfinished \nfifth \nin \nthe \nstandings, \nand \nthe \nfuture \nwas \nlooking \nbright. \nIn  \n1999, \nEdwards \nenjoyed \nhis  \nbest \nseason \nyet, \nwinning \nfive \nraces \nand \nfinishing \nsecond \nbehind \na  \ndominant \nFogarty. \nFor \n2000, \nmany \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nobservers \nexpected \na  \nrepeat. \nWhile \nthe \nFogarty-Ducati \ncombina- \ntion \nlooked \nunbeatable, \nHonda \nwas \ndebuting \nits  \nnew \nVTR1000 \ntwin \ncylinder. \nThe \nnew \nmachine \nwas \nimpressive, \nbut  \nteething \nproblems \nare \nalways \nexpected \nwith \na  \nnew \nbike. \nThese \npredictions \nturned \nout  \nto  \nbe \nincorrect, \nas Colin \nEdwards, \nthe Texas \nTornado, \nrode \nthe new \nbike \nto \nthe \nWorld \nChampionship. \nWorld Champion \n“Once we  got on  the twin, it was  like  mano e mano, a level playing field,” \nEdwards recalls. “We had some teething problems that first year with \nthe V-twin; we  bookended it with wins in the beginning and  in the end.” \nIndeed, Edwards started his 2000 campaign with a sweep of South Africa, \nfollowed by wins at  Donington and Monza. Both Corser (Aprilia) and \nHaga (Yamaha) answered, bringing the  fight to  Edwards. After trading \nwins at  Assen in  September, Haga and  Edwards were tied  at  the  top  of \nthe points chart. The  Texan raised his game to  sweep the German round \nto  go  into the  final round at  Brands Hatch with a  32-point lead. Haga’s \nchallenge ended on  an  anticlimactic note when, after months of legal \nwrangling, he  was  given a  two-week ban  as  the  result of a  positive test \nfor ephedrine. \nAt  the  completion of  race one at  Brands Hatch, Colin Edwards \nbecame the  fifth American to  become World Superbike champion. \nIn  order to  dispel any doubts about whether he  deserved the honor, \nthe  Texas Tornado put  an  exclamation point on  his  title by winning \nrace  two. \nEdwards made a strong defense of his  title in  2001 but  ultimately \ncame up  short to  the  talented Australian, Troy Bayliss, who made 15 \npodiums across the  season, 6  of them wins. The  Texan’s 4  wins and \n12 podiums were enough for second in the standings. \nThe  next year was a tale  of two  seasons. Bayliss, riding the  factory \nDucati, \nmade \na \nbrilliant \nstart \nto \nthe \nseason, \nwinning \n14 \nof \nthe \nfirst \n17 \nraces. \nWith \njust \n9 \nraces \nleft, \nit \nappeared \nthat \nBayliss \nwould \ncruise \nto \nthe \ntitle. \nEdwards \nhad \nother \nideas. \nThroughout \nthe \nAustralian’s \ndominant \nrun, \nhe \nhad \nbeen \nstaying \nclose \nbehind, \nfinishing \nin \nsecond \nin  \n10 \nof \nthose \n205 \n\n254 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nfirst  \n17 \nraces \nand \nwinning \ntwice. \nAnd \nhe \nwent \non  \nto \ndominate \nthe \nsecond \nhalf \nof \nthe \nseason \nin \nspectacular \nfashion. \n“The \nbike \nthat \nyear \nwas \njust \nawesome,” \nEdwards \nrecalls: \nThe chassis was  incredible. I think they weakened it forty percent, and \nit was  much softer; we  never had  chatter. So,  in 2002 we  had a really \ngood bike, but  Bayliss was  awesome. Pretty much, we  were fighting \ntooth and nail, both of us,  only he was  always getting the  upper hand. \nWe  were just lacking a little bit of acceleration. After the  Eight Hours \n[of Suzuka, Honda] came through .  .  .  You  never got  anything new \nbefore the Eight Hours; you always get development parts AFTER the \nEight Hours. We  went back to  the  double exhaust; we  got some little \nparts that made it run a little better... and  then we  were even. \nFrom race two at  Laguna (the 18th race of the  season), Edwards ran  the \ntable to finish out  the season, winning all nine of the  remaining races. \n“At Laguna, we  didn’t have the new stuff,” he explains: \nThat was  just do  or  die.  I knew I had  to  do  it.  At  Brands Hatch, we \ndoubled and I didn’t have the new stuff there either, so  that was  three \nin a row. And then we  went to  Oschersleben [in Germany], and then \nwe  got the new stuff. I just knew we  would win  every race out,  and  it \nwas  up  to  [Bayliss to  beat me]. I needed to  push hard enough to  try \nand  push him into a  mistake. He  could have gotten second in  every \nrace and  still won the  championship, but  he  made a  little mistake \nwhen he crashed in Assen. That gave me  twenty-five points, and  it all \ncame down to  the last race. \nThe  \nfinal \nbattleground \nwas \nImola, \nthe  \nsite  \nwhere \nKenny \nRoberts \nand \nFreddie \nSpencer \nhad \nvied \nfor \nglory \nnearly \n20 \nyears \nearlier. \n“That \nwas  \na \nspecial \nweekend \nat \nImola,” \nEdwards \nrecalls: \nThat \nrivalry \n...  \nthe  \nair,  \nthe  \natmosphere, \nyou  \ncould \njust \ncut  \nit \nwith \na \nknife. \nBecause \nof \nhow \nwell \nhe \nhad \nridden, \nand \nhow \nwell \nI \nhad \nridden, \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS 255 \nit \nwas  \nkind \nof \na \nmutual \nthing. \nWe \nwere \njust \ngoing \nto \nthrow \nit \nout \nthere \nand  \nwhoever \nwins, \nwins. \nIf \nyou  \ngive \naway \na \nchampionship, \nyou  \nwill \nbe \nupset \nwith \nyourself, \nbut  \nif \nyou \ngive \nit \neverything \nyou \nhave... \nEdwards \nwould \ngo  \non  \nto  \nsweep \nboth \nraces, \nearning \nhis  \nsecond \nWorld \nChampionship. \nIt  \nhad \nbeen \nan  \nepic \nseason, \nand \nthe  \ntwo \nrivals \nhad \ncompeted without bitterness: \n[Bayliss] was the first person to  say “congratulations” to  me. \nSportsmanship that weekend was  like no  other, and I would have done \nthe same. I had said, even before the race, “You know what, it was  just \nawesome to be here and whoever wins, I’m not going to be upset either \nway.’ It had to go down as  one  of the best  Superbike races in history. \nOf the  26  races that season, Bayliss and  Edwards would win  25.  Colin \nEdwards’ astonishing late-season charge had  once again confirmed that \nold saying, “It ain't over, 'til it’s over.” \nGrand Prix Racer \nGiven his extraordinary season, Edwards had high hopes for moving up to \nHonda's factory MotoGP team. But  that  ride  would go to Nicky Hayden. \nThis was  a tough blow, but Edwards was  already mulling other options: \nI was  pretty much locked in  with Ducati to  stay [in WSB]. Bayless \nwas going on  to  some other project. At  the  eleventh hour, Honda \nhad this Bridgestone project going on,  and they asked if I would come \nride this privateer Honda with Bridgestones. I had been with Michelin \ndeveloping tires with them forsolong...theideaofgoingtoGrand Prix... \nI wanted to go there smoothly. I was  on  a high, having won the cham- \npionship and  didn’t want to  go there at that  time, to  a  privateer-type \nteam. At the end I declined the Honda offer—money was  an  issue, too, \nas  what I was  asking for wasn't there. Then Aprilia said  theyd like  me \nto  come, and  they were one  of the  few  factory efforts with the  four- \nstroke \nbikes. \nThere \nwas \na \nlot \nof \npress \nabout \nhow \nfast \nthe \nAprilia \nwas. \nI \n\n256 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nwanted \nMichelins \nand  \nI \nthink \nAprilia \nthought \nI \nmight \nbe \nthe  \ntie \nthat \ncould \nget \n{[Michelins] \nfor \nthem.” \nAt  \nfirst \nlook, \nit  \nseemed \nlike  \na  \ngood \nfit.  \nEdwards \nwould \nget  \nhis  \nshot \nat \nMotoGP \non  \nMichelin \nrubber \nriding \nthe  \nAprilia \nRS3 \nCube, \na  \nseemingly \nstate-of-the-art \nthree-cylinder \nprototype \nwith \na \npneumatic \nvalvetrain \ndeveloped \nin \nconjunction \nwith \nlegendary \nrace \nengine—builder \nCosworth. \nOn \ncloser \ninspection, \n2003 \nwould \nturn \nout \nto \nbe \na \nnightmarish \nseason \nof \norganizational ineptitude: \nThe way it  was, it  wasn't all  handled in-house. You had chassis \nstuff in-house, you had little things in-house, but  the  motor stuff \nwasnt in-house. Some of the  requests and  some of the  ideas that we \nhad  werent really possible. You  might request five  or  six  things, and \ntheyd say, “What's the number one  thing we  need to focus on,  change, \nor  fix?” And that would go on  race after race. It was  a valuable experi- \nence, and I rode my ass  off that year. We had  some moments, but  [the \nseason opener at] Suzuka was  the best race we  had  all year. \nEdwards finished sixth at the  Japanese Grand Prix, making sure to  come \nout  ahead of Nicky Hayden. It was  all downhill from there, however, and \nhe ended the season 13th in points, just ahead of his teammate and former \nWorld Superbike rival, Noriyuki Haga. \nBetter days were to come, though. In 2004, the Texan signed on as teammate \nto Sete Gibernau at Telefonica Movistar Honda, one  of the best rides in the pit \nlane. \nEdwards \ntook \nfull \nadvantage \nof \nthe \nopportunity, \nsupporting \nthe \nSpaniard \nin \nhis \nbid \nfor \nthe \nWorld \nChampionship \nand \ntaking \nhis \nfirst \ntwo \nGP \npodiums, \nsecond \nplaces \nat \nDonington \nand \nQatar. \nThe \nTexan \nfinished \nthe \nseason \nfifth \nin \npoints, \nonly \neight \npoints \nbehind \nAlex \nBarros \non \nthe \nRepsol \nHonda \nand \nahead \nof \nNicky \nHayden, \nwho \nhad \nended \nhis \nsophomore \nseason \nin \neighth \nplace. \nEdwards \nearned \nGibernau’s \nrespect \nin \ntheir \none  \nseason \ntogether: \nColin \nis  \nan  \neasygoing \nguy. \nHe  \nenjoys \nriding, \nand \nit’s  \na  \npity \nhe  \nhas \nnot  \nbeen \nwinning \nin  \nMotoGP \nbecause \nhe’s  \na  \ncool \nguy  \nand  \nhe’s  \nfast. \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nWhen I started riding with Kenny Jr. in the  early 1990s, I remember \ngetting to know Colin because he was  here riding in the AMA, and his \nunderstanding of racing is like  Kenny’s, and  being a World Superbike \nchampion, he’s got a whole bunch of talent there. \nEdwards was  a hot  commodity, and  when Yamaha called on  him  to join \nits factory team as  teammate to Valentino Rossi, he accepted. “Everything \nwas right,” says Edwards. “We had been eight-hour teammates [at Suzuka, \nwhen both were riding for Honda], and he had been pushing to have me \nas  his teammate. It all worked out  good, for three years.” \nThere was never any  doubt who was  the  number one  rider on  the \nteam, a fact that  Edwards accepted in his typical amiable fashion: “I knew \nmy place in the team. I knew where the  money was  spent, and  mine was \npurely a supporting role. But I still was  riding my ass  off; I was  still trying \nto  win  every race. But  yeah, if Valentino was  near, Id give him another \ninch or  two  [laughs]. It was  good, he was  great, and  I enjoyed it.” \nThe admiration is mutual, as  Rossi explains: \nAh! Racing with Colin was always fun  and we  are  great, great \nfriends. He  could always make me  laugh and  we  had some good \nparties! We  would talk a  lot  together about the  setting, tires, and \nthings, and we  always tried to help each other. My favorite memory is \nmaybe Laguna 2005, both [of our  Yamahas painted] in yellow for the \nanniversary, and Colin passes me  into  the corkscrew. On the final lap, \nI was  close enough to try, but then I thought of two  yellow bikes in the \ndirt  and  thought “better not!” Colin was  very determined! \nRossi was referring to  the  USGP at  Laguna Seca, where Yamaha had \npainted \nthe \nfactory \nbikes \nin \nthe \nyellow \nand \nblack \nbumblebee \npaint \nscheme \nas \na \ntribute \nto \nthe \n1970s \nU.S. \nteam \nand \nKenny \nRoberts. \nEdwards \nwould \nfinish \nsecond \nin \nthe \nrace, \nbehind \nHayden \nand \nin \nfront \nof \nRossi. \nThe \nTexan \nwould \nend \nup \nwith \nthree \npodiums \non \nthe \nseason—not \nthe \nresults \nhe \nhad \nhoped \nfor. \nBut \nhis \nfourth-place \nfinish \nin \nthe \nstandings \nis \nstill \nhis \nbest \nthrough the 2009 season. \n208 \n\n258 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nThe \n2006 \nseason \nwas \ntroublesome \nfor  \nYamaha. \nThe \nbike \nwas \nprob- \nlematic \nand \nat \ntimes \nunreliable. \nEdwards \nmanaged \njust \none \npodium \nand \na \nseventh-place \nfinish \nin \nthe \npoints, \nputting \nhim \nbehind \nnot \nonly \nworld \nchampion \nNicky \nHayden, \nbut \nalso \nbehind \nthe \nresurgent \nKenny \nRoberts \nJr. \nPerhaps \nthe \nmost \nmemorable \nmoment \nof \nthe \nseason \nwas \nAssen, \nwhen \nEdwards \nlooked \nset \nto \ntake \nhis \nfirst \nwin \nbefore \ncrashing \nout \nof \na \nfinal-lap \nduel \nwith \nHayden. \nThe  Texan’s third season with the  factory Yamaha team was  the  first \nyear  of the 800cc formula. Casey Stoner and  Ducati would run  away with \nthe  title, leaving even Valentino Rossi without an  answer. For  Edwards, \n2007 went much like  the  previous two  seasons, with flashes of brilliance \nand speed but only a pair of podiums and another midpack championship \nfinish, that time in ninth. \nEdwards prefers the 800s over the 990s: \nI think the  800s more suit  my  style to  be honest. I’ve  always been a \nfront-end guy,  kind of a  250-style, sweeping style. I never really felt \nright with the point and shoot of the 990s; I always felt like  I was  making \na mistake; I was  always trying to learn how to make that time back up. \nWith the 800s, you  make a mistake and you lost  time, everybody did. \nIt suited my style more, there is more precision involved in it. \nWith the arrival of two-time 250cc world champion Jorge Lorenzo to the \nYamaha factory team for  2008, Edwards signed on  to  race for  the  Tech \n3 Yamaha satellite team. \nAt age  34,  and  now racing for  a  smaller outfit, few  expected to  see  a \ncareer \nresurgence \nfrom \nthe \nTexan. \nBut \nEdwards \ncame \nout \nstrong \nto \nput \ntogether \nan \nexcellent \nfirst \nhalf \nof \nthe \nseason. \nWith \na \nthird-place \nfinish \nat \nAssen, \nhe \nmoved \ninto \nthe \ntop \nfive \nin \npoints; \nit \nwas \nclear \nthat \nriding \nthe \nTech \n3 \nbikes \nwas \nnot \nmuch \nof \na \ndisadvantage. \nUnfortunately, \nthe \nmomentum \ndid \nnot \nlast \nthrough \nthe \nseason. \n“The \nfirst \nhalf \nof \nthe \nseason \nwas \ngreat, \nbut \nthen \nwe \ngot \nlet \ndown,” \nEdwards \nexplains. \n“Come \nto \nfind \nout \nthat \nthrough \nbudget \ncuts \nor \ndevelopment, \nthings \ngot \nrun \nin \na \ndifferent \ndirection \nfrom \nwhere \nwe  \nwanted \nto \ngo.  \nLaguna, \nBrno, \nIndy \nwas  \na \ndisaster” \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nDespite the setbacks, Edwards appeared to have settled in with his new \nteam. He signed a contract extension for 2009, announcing the new  deal at \nLaguna Seca with his trademark humor. “I’m here to say that  I will  be here \nnext year as  well. I think the  deciding factor was probably when [team \nowner] Herve [Poncharal] came to  my  motorhome, he was on  his  hands \nand  knees, crying a  little bit... He pulled his wallet out,  he had  five  Euros \nin  it, and I tookit...” \nThe Texan's career resurgence continued in  2009. His  best result of \nthe  season was  a  second place at  Donington, a  race in  which he charged \nthrough the  field on  cold slicks in  semi-damp conditions. Edwards has \nColin \nEdwards: \n2000 \nand \n2002 \nWorld \nSuperbike \nChampion, \nMotoGP \nstar, \nand \nfavorite of the motorcycle racing press. \n\n260 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nnothing \nbut \npraise \nfor \nhis \nteam, \nand \nhe \nis \nquick \nto \nexpress \nhis \nappreciation \nof how Yamaha treats its satellite teams: \nWe  \nmight \nnot  \nhave \none  \nhundred \npercent \nof \nwhat \n[the \nfactory \nteam] \nhas,  \nbut  \nit’s \nnot  \nlike  \n2004 \nwith \nthe  \nother \nbrand. \nThey \nhave \ntreated \nus \nas \na \npart \nof \nYamaha \nand \nit \ndoesn't \ndo \nthem \nany \ngood \nto \ngive \nus \nsubpar \nstuff \nto \nrun \naround \nin \ntenth. \nThey \nlike \nwhat \nhappened \nin \nAssen, \nwith \nfour Yamahas in the top six. \nEdwards finished the season fifth  in the standings, best among all satellite \nteam riders. He  signed on  for  2010, which will  be his  third with Tech 3 \nand  his  eighth in  Grand Prix racing’s premier class. His  teammate will \nbe a  fellow Texan, the  2009 World Superbike champion, Ben Spies, who \nwill be making his debut as a full-time racer in MotoGP. The  two  will  no \ndoubt be providing a double dose of “Don't mess with Texas.” \nBEN SPIES \nBenjamin Spies was  born July 11, 1984, in Germantown, Tennessee, but he \nis a true-blue Texan. “I pulled up stakes when I was  about six months old,” \nhe explains. “I didn’t hang out  there long... ’m a Texan.” \nSpies got  his  start racing a Yamaha YSR50 and  quickly climbed the \ntalent ladder. However, his  experience did  not  include dirt ovals or \nmotocross: “I rode dirt  bikes, but  I didn’t race them. The CMRA [Central \nMotorcycle Roadracing Association] organization they have is very good. \nThere are  some good riders.” \nBen \nwon \nhis  \nfirst \nCMRA \nChampionship \nat  \nage  \n11,  \nencouraged, \nas \nalways, \nby \nhis  \nmother, \nMary \nSpies, \nwho \nis \nalso \nhis  \npersonal \nmanager. \nIt \nwasnt \nlong \nbefore \nBen \nwas \nracing \nin \nthe \nAprilia \nCup. \n“That \nwas \njust \nkind \nof \na \nfun \ndeal \nthat \nI \ngot \ninto \nlate,” \nSpies \nsays. \n“I \nwent \nin \nto \nhave \nfun \nand \nride \na \ndifferent \nbike; \nit \nwas \na \nsmall \nseries \nand \nit \nwas \npretty \ncool.” \nRacing \nthe \nAprilia \nagainst \nJohn \nHopkins, \nBen \nhad \nfinshed \nbehind \nJohn \nin \nPortland \nand \nahead \nat \nTexas \nWorld. \nBoth \nriders \nwould \nsoon \njoin \nValvoline \nSuzuki, \nmostly \nriding \nin \ndifferent \nclasses, \nand  \nBen  \nstayed \nwith \nthe  \nteam \nfor \n2000 \nand \n2001. \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \n“Ben was  not  so  focused, but  he had  tons of talent,” recalls Keith Perry. \n“And you  knew that if the  focus came, there would be  no  stopping him. \nRegarding his riding style, Ben  used a lot of elbows and a  lot of up, forward, \nbody lean like he still does. Ben  probably knew and  felt the bike under him \nmore so  than John did.  You  had  that  feeling that  Ben  was  better connected \nto  what the bike was  doing early on.” \n“I just  kind of ease my  way into stuff,” says Spies. “Some guys, they \njust jump in and  rip it. That’s the  way  John [Hopkins] is; he's just a natural \ntalent. I think about everything, and  I think that’s a good trait.” \nBen  \nSpies, \n2009 \nWorld \nSuperbike \nChampion. \n\n262 \nGRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nBoth \nSpies \nand  \nHopkins \nare  \nknown \nfor \nhanging \nwell \noff \nthe  \ninside \nof \nthe \nbike, \nbut \nthat \nwas \nnot \nalways \nthe \ncase. \n“I \ndidn't \nride \nlike \nI \ndo \nnow, \nback \nthen.” \nSpies \nexplains. \n“My \nstyle \nevolved \nin \nthe \nlast \nfour \nyears; \nI \ndon't \nreally \nknow \nwhy \nbut \nit \ndid. \nI \ndon’t \nknow \nwhere \nit \nstarted, \nbut \nI \nthink \nit \nwas \nwhen \nI \nstarted \nhaving \nproblems \nwith \nthe \nfront \nend \non \na \nbike \nand \nI \nwas \nalways \nleery” \nSpies’ \ntrademark \nstyle \nof \nhanging \noff, \ncombined \nwith \nelbows \nout \nand \nforward \nlean, \nearned \nhim \nthe \nnickname \n“Elbowz.” \nRacing in 750  Supersport, the  rookie finished ninth in  points behind \nhis champion teammate. His performances earned him the AMA Horizon \nAward for the newcomer with the best potential. In 2001, the young Texan \ntook his  first  pro  win, a victory in  the  750  Supersport race at  Pikes Peak \nRaceway. The  16-year-old would put together a  fine  season, overcoming \ninjuries to  take second in the  standings, enough to  earn him a step up to \nFormula Xtreme, racing for Attack Suzuki. \n“T had  a  really great teammate in Jason Pridmore, and  he taught me  a \nlot,” Spies recalls. “I think 2002 was  one  of my strongest years of learning. \nI was  seventeen or  eighteen years old,  riding a  200-horsepower Formula \nXtreme bike. The  thing was  a monster and  it taught me a lot, getting on  a \nbike that  fast  and  that big, early on” \nSpies Versus Mladin \nFor  2003, Spies signed with the  strongest team in  AMA road racing, \nAmerican Suzuki/Yoshimura Suzuki. He would remain there for six years, \nenjoying success upon success. \nTom Houseworth would become Spies’ crew chief with the  team. He \nremembers being instantly impressed with the  teenager: “After couple of \nlaps, \nhe \nwas \nvery \nprecise \non \nhis \nfeedback \neven \nat \nhis \nyoung \nage. \nI \ntold \nthem, \n‘We've \ngot \nto \nkeep \nthis \nguy, \nsign \nhim \nup, \nhe’s \ngood? \nIt’s \nkind \nof \nweird, \nbut you just know.” \n“From \n2003 \non,  \nit’s  \nbeen \ngood \never \nsince,” \nsays \nSpies. \n“We \nwon \nfive \nchampionships, \nbetween \nthe \nthree \nin \nSuperbike, \nSuperstock, \nand  \nFormula \nXtreme, \nhad  \nsome \nreally \ngood \nyears \nwith \na \ngreat \nteam, \nand \nlearned \na \nlot” \nSpies’ \nlast \nfour \nyears \nwith \nYoshimura \nSuzuki \nfeatured \nsome \nof \nthe \nmost \nmemorable \nracing \nin \nAMA \nSuperbike \nhistory, \nas  \nthe \nyoung \nTexan \nbattled \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS 263 \nwith his  wily veteran teammate, Australian Mat Mladin. Spies reflects \nupon his former teammate and  rival: \nHe's a  special guy, He’s a  different guy, but  at  the  end  of the  day \ntalent-wise, he’s  a  great talent. Even more so,  he’s  very smart with \nbike setup. Racing him changed a lot  of how I race and how I \ndeal with people, and racing against him I think it  brought my \ntalent out quicker than later. He  had never had anybody beat \nhim on  the  same motorcycle; it was  hard for  him. But  he  stepped \nup  and started training like crazy and stepped up  his  speed. The \nfastest he’s  ever been was when we  raced each other, and  I think \nhe  will admit that. The last three years he’d made a big  step, \nand  he made me  push just as  hard. The  Suzuki is a great motorcycle, \nbut  me  and  him pushing each other is why the  results were the way \nthey were. \n“T know how he can  ride,” Mladin says: \nI've  been around a long time and  I’ve  seen a lot of young kids come \nand  go.  As  far  as  anyone I’ve  ridden against or  raced against, Ben  is \nat  a higher level than any  of those other racers. Of the  four years we \nraced together on  Superbikes, he won three championships and I won \none. I miss the competition with Ben; he is a talented rider. I wouldnt \ngive up  those last  few  years with the  three second places and  my  six \nchampionships for anything. They were the best years. The best riding \nthat  I've  ever done has been in the last couple of years. \nLooking back on  the inter-team rivalry with Mladin at Yoshimura Suzuki, \nSpies sums up the  experience: \nI wouldn't have wanted to  do  it for  my  whole career. Racing against \nhim \nis \npretty \nexhausting \nand \nhard. \nBut, \nI \nwouldn't \ntake \naway \nthose \nthree \nyears \neither. \nThey \nwere \nsome \nof \nthe \nbest \nlearning \nyears. \nWith \nthe \ngreen \nflag, \nit \nwas  \n45 \nminutes \non  \nthe \nedge, \nand \nwhen \nthe \ncheckered \nflag \n\n264 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nflew, \nyou \njust \ntook \na \nbig \nbreath \nthat \nyou  \ndidn’t \ncrash. \nThere \nwas  \nsome \nhard racing going on. \nIn \nthe  \nmidst \nof \nwinning \nhis \nthird \nAMA \nSuperbike \nChampionship \nseason \nin \n2008, \nSpies \nmade \nhis \nMotoGP \ndebut \nin \na \none-off \nride \nfor \nSuzuki \nin \nvariable \nconditions \nat \nDonington \nPark. \nSpies \nwas \nfortunate \nenough \nto \nhave \na \nformer \nworld \nchampion \nthere \nto \nprovide \nsome \nadvice \nand \nmoral \nsupport. \n“Ben \nand \nJ \nare \nstill \npretty \ngood \nfriends,” \nsays \nthe \nKing \nof Donington \nPark, \nKevin Schwantz: \nFor  the  eight years he  spent riding for  Suzuki here in  America, we \nrode bicycles together, and  we  rode motocross bikes together back \nbefore he had  ridden any  real  motocross. Now, anything he does, he \nabsolutely destroys me  at.  It does me  proud to  see  him over there [in \nEurope in World Superbike,] handing those guys their asses regularly, \nand a reflection upon our  program right here. He's  had  a tough guy to \ntry and beat in Mladin. \nSpies, having qualified eighth and finished fourteenth at Donington Park, \nearned two  more wildcard rides for  Suzuki that season. Naturally, these \ncame at the two  American rounds. At  Laguna Seca, Spies finished eighth \ndespite \nmedical \nissues; \nhe \nsurvived \nthe \nwild \nconditions \nof \nIndianapolis, \ncoming home sixth ahead of both of his Suzuki teammates. \nTaking on  the World \nThe \nconventional \nwisdom \nhad \nSpies \nbeing \ngroomed \nfor  \nthe  \nSuzuki \nMotoGP \nteam \nin  \n2009, \nbut  \nthis  \nturned \nout  \nto  \nbe  \nincorrect. \nInstead, \nthe \nTexan \nsurprised \na \nlot \nof \npeople \nby \ntaking \na \nride \nwith \nYamaha \nin \nWorld \nSuperbike \nfor \n2009. \nOne \nmight \nhave \nexpected \nthe \nyoung \nAmerican \nto \nexperience \nsome \nculture \nshock, \ncoming \nto \nEurope \nand \nriding \nfor \nthe \nItalian \nYamaha \nteam, \nespecially \ngiven \nhow \nlong \nhe \nhad \nspent \nat \nYoshimura. \nBut \nhe \nfit \nin \nvery \neasily. \n“It \nis \nvery \ndifferent, \nmore \nrelaxed \nand \nmore \nof \na \nfamily \nenvironment,” \nhe \ntold \nthe \nauthor \nduring \nhis \n2009 \ncampaign. \n“We've \nhad \nour  \nups \nand \ndowns, \nbut \nI’ve \nhad \nthe \nmost \nfun \nracing \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nthat  \nI’ve  \nhad  \nin \na \nlong, \nlong \ntime. \nIt’s \nbrought \nback \nthe  \nfun  \nof \nit. \nRacing \nwith \nMat—it \nwas  \ngreat, \nand  \nnot  \nto \ntake \nanything \naway \nfrom \nthat—but \nit \nwas  \nbusiness; \nit \nwas  \na \njob \nand  \nwe  \nwere \nfighting \nfor \neverything. \nEvery \nday \nit \nwas just \nmentally \nexhausting; \nhere \nit \nis \njust \na \nlittle \nbit \ndifferent.” \nThe fact that Spies immediately established himself as  the  fastest \nrider in  the  series certainly made the  adjustment easier. His  former \ncompetitors in  AMA Superbike were not  surprised. Ben Bostrom, for \nyears America’s shining hope in World Superbike, concurs: “Ben can  win \non  any  bike. It wouldn't matter, he would win. Riding for  any  of those \nteams, he would blow their fenders off.” \nSpies took pole for  round one  at  Phillip Island, but  got shoved off on \nthe first lap. He bounced back to win  race  two, fulfilling the promise shown \nin  qualifying. “It was  a  great surprise for  us,’  said  Yamaha team manager \nMassimo Meregalli. “It was  the first  time for Ben  there and he did a really \ngood job.” Spies had been quick in the preseason testing, but years of experi- \nence have led Massimo to take such things in stride: “Yes, but tests are  tests, \nand  the  racing weekends are  completely different. I had  seen in preseason \ntests that he was  really fast, but until the traffic lights go out...” \nComing straight out of the box with the new 09 Yamaha, it appeared that \nthe  team had  done its homework, and  the  pace of the bike and  rider had \nbeen been a  welcome surprise. “Most don't understand that  we  are  doing \nmost everything by ourselves,’ Merengalli explains. “The bike is new, the \nteam is new, and the riders are  new. ..  unfortunately things can  happen. \nBen  followed this up with pole position and his first World Superbike \ndouble at  Qatar. Moving on  to  Europe, Spies took his third consecutive \npole at  Valencia. After retiring from race one, he  came back to  finish \nsecond behind Noriyuki Haga in race two. More ups  and  downs would \ncome at  Assen and  Monza. At  Assen, Spies took Superpole again, and \nhis  battle with Nori Haga and  Leon Haslam in  race one  may well have \nbeen \nthe \nbest \nmoment \nof \n2009. \n“In \nall \nhonesty, \nI \nhad \nreally \ngood \npace \nthat \nwhole weekend,” Spies recalls: \nBut  I had some weird feelings from the front tire  in the first half of that \nrace; \nI \nwas  \nriding \nit \nas  \nhard \nas  \nI \ncould. \nI \nlet  \n[Haga \nand  \nHaslem] \nby \nand \n265 \n\n266 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nsat \non  \nthe \nback, \nletting \nthem \nset \nthe \npace. \nI \nwent \nto \npass \nHaslam \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nand \ncouldn't \nget \nit \ndone. \nI \ncame \nacross \nthe \nfinish \nline \nand \nit \nwas \nlike \n[three \nlaps] \nto \ngo. \nI \nwas \nlike, \n“S**t! \nI \nhave \nto \npass \nhim \nthis \nlap, \nwherever, \nI've \ngot \nto \ndo \nit” \nI \nwent \nfor \nit, \nI \ngave \nhim \nroom, \nhe \ngave \nme \nroom, \nand \nin \nthose \nthree \ncorners \nwhere \nwe \nwere \nside \nby \nside, \nwe \nonly \nlost \ntwo-tenths \nofa \nsecond. \nThen, \nI \ncaught \nup \nto \nHaga. \nI \ngot \nthe \nbig \nrun \nout \nof \nthat \nfifth- \ngear \ncorner \nand \ngot \nthe \nbig \nslingshot \ndraft \nand \nI \nwas \ngoing—I'm \ngoing \non \nthis \naccess \nroad \nhere \nto \nthe \nright. \nYou \nnever \nmake \na \npass \nthere, \nreally, \nbut \nyou've \ngot \nto \nsurprise \nthem. \nAnd \nHaga \nyou \ncould \ntell \nwasn't \nready \nfor \nit, \nit \nabout \nscared \nhim \noff \nthe \nbike. \nI \nheld \nit \nto \nthe \nend. \nThe  elation of race one  was  matched by the  frustration of throwing the \nbike down the road in race  two. A pattern of  win  or  DNF was  starting to \ndevelop. It would continue at Monza, in most painful fashion. \nSpies’ race one  finish at  Monza could have served as  the  “agony of \ndefeat” clip for any modern version of Wide World of Sports. For the fifth \ntime in five races, he started from pole. “It started out  okay in the  race,” \nhe explains: \nWe  were good. I had  a  go  midway through the  race and  got  a  gap; \neverything was  working fine. I opened up  a  gap, but  on  the  last  lap, \ncoming through the  second Lesmo, it bogged. I could feel  the  bike \nstarting to  run  out  of gas  and  I was  just  thinking, “You've got  to  be \nkidding me,  there’s no  way I’m going to make it! S**t, this is not  good!” \nAt  Ascari, I went in  there and  I could tell  on  the  backshifting that  it \nwas  trying to die, and when I went through the last  left on  the  side  of \nthe  bike, it cut  out. I got  it straight up  and  down again, and  it came \nback on  and  fired it all  the  way down the  backstraight. Then I knew \nas \nsoon \nas \n| \nturned \ninto \nParabolica, \nit \nwas \ndone. \nI \ntried \nto \nchange \nmy \nline. \nI \nwas \ntrying \nto \nkeep \nit \nas \nstraight \nup \nas \npossible \ninstead \nof \nreally \ngoing \nin \nthere \nand \ngetting \nit \non \nits \nside. \nI \nwas \ngoing \nto \ntry \nto \nmake \na \nreal \nbig \narc, \nbut \nas \nsoon \nas \nI \ntipped \nin, \nit \ncut \nout \nand \ndied, \nthere \nwas \nnothing \nleft.  \nI \ngot \nout  \nof \nthe  \nway  \nbest \nI \ncould. \nBut  \nyeah, \nit \nwas  \nreally \nhard \nto \nswallow.” \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nShowing \nimpressive \nmaturity, \nSpies \nbounced \nback \nto \nwin \nrace \ntwo: \nFor race two  we  made some changes, put a rain  map in the bike with a \nlittle less power and better fuel economy. I told [my team] that  I know \nwe  have the  pace to  win; this  weekend we  were the  strongest. I'll sit \nbehind [the  Ducatis] and  then with five  laps left  I'll go.  I got a  good \nstart and  got to  the lead in turn three. I was  going to put together two \nhard laps to separate everybody, so that whoever was  going to go, I'd get \nbehind them and just stay there and  get everybody sorted out a little \nbit.  I came around and  by lap two  I had  one  and a half seconds. With \neight to go I had it up to six seconds and  flipped it to the rain  map... \nabout 2000 rpm lower. \nBen  Spies’ WSB racecraft matched his sheer speed. \nFor years the Yamaha had always been a contender, the eternal brides- \nmaid. “Always close,’ says Meregalli. “What we  realize now is that you \ncan  never give up  until you  win  the  title. Honestly, at  the  beginning of \nthe  Monza weekend I was not expecting this, but Ben said to  me, ‘Don't \nworry. I think the  gap  he showed in the  second race  was  because he was \npissed off”  Wise beyond his years, Spies wasn't showing his hand. \nThe ups and downs continued in round six at Kyalami in South Africa. \nAfter taking pole yet again, Spies finished third in race one, then posted \na  DNF in  race two. Meanwhile, Ducati’s Noriyuki Haga was  taking full \nadvantage of Spies’ misfortunes, racking up a formidable points lead. \nFor round seven, the series moved to Miller Motorsports Park in Utah. \nOn home soil and racing on  a familiar track, Spies shattered the competi- \ntion, taking his  seventh consecutive Superpole and  winning both races \nby significant margins while Haga finished ninth each time. The  result \nbrought Spies to  within 53  points of Haga—still a  huge gap, but  Colin \nEdwards had  been in a  similar situation behind Troy Bayliss in the  2002 \nWorld \nSuperbike \nChampionship. \n“I’ve \nheard \nthis \nstory,’ \nSpies \nsaid \nat \nthe \ntime. “I’m gonna try. I want to be like  Colin.” \n“About \nBen, \nI \ncan  \nonly \nspeak \nvery \nwell; \nMeregalli \nsaid \nat \nthe \ntime. \n“He \nis \nfast, \nand \nhe’s \na \nreally \ngood \nguy.  \nHe \nis \nonly \ntwenty-four \nyears \nold \nbut \ngoes \n207 \n\n268 GRAND PRIX MOTORCYCLE RACERS \nabout \nhis \njob \nlike  \nhe \nwas  \nthirty. \nWe  \nare  \nreally \nsatisfied \nabout \nall \nthat  \nhe \nis \ndoing. \nI \nthink \nwith \nhim, \neverything \nis \npossible.” \nYamaha \nhad  \nnever \nwon \nthe  \nWorld \nSuperbike \nChampionship, \nbut  \nthe \nsynergy \nof \nBen \nSpies, \ncrew \nchief \nTom \nHouseworth, \nMassimo \nMeregalli’s \ndedicated \nteam, \nand \nthe \npotent \nnew \nYamaha \nR1 \nwould \nprove \nto \nbe \nthe \nright \ncombination \nfor \nan \nupset \nover \nthe \nperennial \nfavorite, \nDucati \nCorse. \nThe \nsecond \nhalf \nof \nthe \nseason \nwould \nbe \nan \nemotional \nthrill \nride, \nbut \nBen \nSpies, \nthe \n24-year-old \nrookie, \novercame \nHaga’s \npoints \nlead \nat \nthe \nfinal \nraces \nin \nPortugal \nto \nbe \ncrowned \nWorld \nSuperbike \nchampion. \nHis \nstrike \nrate \nof \n14 \nwins \nin \n28 \nraces \nand \n11 \npoles \nin \n14 \nevents \nis staggering, \nespe- \ncially \nwhen \nyou \nconsider \nthat, \nwith \nthe \nexception \nof \nMiller \nMotorsports \nPark and Donington, he was  racing on  entirely unfamiliar tracks. \nThe Next Big Thing? \nMeanwhile, as  the  2009 season was  winding down, Spies signed with the \nTech 3 Yamaha to give the team an  all-Texan lineup. Spies made his fourth \nMotoGP appearance at  the  2009 season finale at  Valencia. Qualifying \nninth, he finished an  impressive seventh. \nIf the future brings Ben  Spies to the pinnacle of MotoGP glory, he will \nbe  the  latest in  a  long line  of American Grand Prix champions. Wayne \nRainey, for one, likes the  Texan's chances: “I’m thinking Ben  Spies could \nbe the next guy to put America back on  the  map,” Rainey told  the author \nearly in 2008. “He's somebody that’s got the speed to do it.” \nIt  is  a  safe bet  that World Superbike will continue to  provide the \nlaunching point for American careers into Europe, despite the continued \ncynicism of the  world when it comes to  the  United States as  a  training \nground \nfor \nfuture \ntalent. \nSteve \nMcLaughin \ntold \nthe \nauthor \nin \n2009 \nthat \nthe \nEuropean \nattitude \nhasn't \nchanged \nvery \nmuch \nover \nthe \nyears. \n“At \nAssen \nthe \nEuropeans \ncome \nup \nto \nme \nand \nsay, \n‘How \nis \nit \npossible \nthat \nBen \nSpies \ndoes \nso \nwell?’ \nThe \ntruth \nis \nthat \nthey've \nforgotten \nthat \nfive \nof \nthe \nfirst \nsix \nWorld \nSuperbike \nChampions \nwere \nAmericans. \nThe \ntruth \nis \nthat \nwe \nhave \nthe \nability \nto \nturn \nout \ngood \nriders, \nand \nif \nyou \nthink \nwe \ndon't, \nyoure \nstupid.” \nFuture \ngenerations \nof \nAmerican \nracers \nwill \nagain \ndrive \nhome \nthat  point. \n\nTHE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS 269 \nAt the 2008 USGP at  Laguna Seca, the FIM presented tower trophies to the seven \nAmerican Grand Prix world champions.

      "text": "Acknowledgments \nNSPIRATION CAME IN  THE pivotal year of 1967. The  movie Grand \nPrix was  released, and in November I attended my first race, the USAC \nIndycar finale at Riverside, featuring Gurney, Clark, The  Unsers, Surtees, \nAndretti, and Foyt. It was a race  for the ages, in which Dan Gurney took his \nfirst win  in the Indy Eagle, at his home circuit before a wildly celebrating \ncrowd. As  Dan once said  to  me,  “So,  it’s all my  fault.” Yes  .  .  .  and  racing \nbecame my all-consuming passion. \nBy 1969, San  Diegans had  won the  Daytona 200  for  eight of the  previous 15 \nyears. The local “Martys”—Smith, Tripes, and Moates—became the first Americans \nto win the MX United States Grand Prix (125, 250, and 500). Meanwhile in Europe, \nMario Andretti and  Kenny Roberts were 1978 World Champions.

      "text": "Foreword \nUST LIKE ANY GREAT thriller—and, indeed, this story is  a  thriller— \nthe  modern day history of Grand Prix motorcycle racing, and  its  upstart rival \nthe  Superbike class, has  been told  ever since Page One was  written back in  1949 \nwith the running of the first World Championship on  two  wheels. \nAlthough British and Commonwealth riders from Africa and  Australasia \ndominated the  Grand Prix winners’ roster in the  1950s and  1960s, and  Latinos \nand Japanese do  so  today, there was  a  quarter-century of American domina- \ntion from the  mid-1970s onward, when it seemed you  had  to  be a Yank if you \nwanted to stand on  the top step of the podium. Strangely, it was  a bunch of British \nmarketing men who made this  happen, when the  venerable, soon-to-be-history \nBSA/Triumph concern’s publicity crew decided to  try to  grab a slice of stateside \naction by signing up half a dozen U.S. riders to race  their triples in the U.K. against \na team of British riders in the first Transatlantic Match Races over  Easter weekend \nin  1971. Until then, it had  been rare to  see  any  American rider competing in \nEurope, as  there had been no  good reason for U.S.  riders to cross the Atlantic and \nrace  against the locals before this time—and indeed pavement racing was  strictly \nsecond division in the United States compared to traditional dirt-oval action. \nBut  those match races opened the  floodgates, and  when the  series returned \nthe  following year with the  British triples no  longer the  default mount, it was \nan  American rider on  an  American bike who stole the  show. ‘The  late,  great Cal \nRayborn on  the  iron-barrelled XR750 Harley-Davidson V-twin stunned us  Brits \nby winning three of the six races against our  best  riders. In doing so, he kicked the \ndoor open for successive generations of American racers to come and do the same \nto \nother \nEuropeans \non \ntheir \nhome \ntracks, \noften \nsucceeding \nfor \nthe \nfirst \ntime \nat \nthe \nTransatlantic \nMatch \nRaces \nbefore \ngoing \non \nto \nbeat \nthe \nworld, \nnot \njust \nthe \nBrits. \nFrom \nthat \npoint \nup \nuntil \nNicky \nHayden’s \n2006 \nMotoGP \nworld \ntitle, \nthe \nworld \nhas \ngotten \nused \nto \nhearing \n“The \nStar-Spangled \nBanner” \nplayed \nin \nvictory \nlane, \nas \na \nseemingly \nendless \nsuccession \nof \ngreats \nwho \ncut  \ntheir \nracing \nteeth \nanywhere \nfrom \nNew \nJersey \nto  \nTexas \nto  \nCalifornia \nto  \nGeorgia \nhave \npicked \nup \nthe  \nRayborn \nbaton \nand  \nrun  \nwith \nit.  \nNow \nBen  \nSpies \nis \ngetting \nthe  \nneedle \nstuck \nin  \nthe  \ngroove \nagain"

In many cases, they dominated on  bikes that  were very alien to  the \nmachines they grew up racing. American riders have had in many cases to re-learn \nhow to  race aboard a very different motorcycle than they one  that brought them \nthat  far, especially now that  there is no  longer a 250cc Grand Prix starter class at \nthe  American Motorcycle Association (AMA) level. In  many cases, these riders \nhad  to  adapt their dirt-tracking techniques to  create a whole new style of riding \non  European tarmac circuits. Added kudos to them all, from America’s first road \nrace  champion Steve Baker onward, for doing so. \nNorm DeWitt's comprehensive roundup of  a key chapter in road racing history \nis long overdue, and I’m glad he resisted the temptation to  restrict it solely to the \nseven \nAmerican \n500cc/MotoGP \nworld \nchampions. \nQuite \napart \nfrom \nthe \nfact \nthat \nthe \nsix \nWorld \nSuperbike \nchampions \nto \nhail \nfrom \nthe \nUnited \nStates—from \nFred \nMerkel \nonward—all \nhave \na \nfascinating \ntale \nto \ntell, \nto \nleave \nout \nmen \nlike \nGary \nNixon \n(by \nany \nrights, \nthe \nguy \nwho \nshould \nhave \nbeen \nthe \nfirst \nYank \nworld \nchampion) \nand \nPat \nHennen \n(the \nfirst \nto \nwave \nthe \nStars \nand \nStripes \non \nthe \nworld \nstage) \nwould \nhave \ntold \nonly \nhalf \nthe \nstory. \nInstead, \nwhat \nwe \nhave \nhere \nis \nthe \nfull \nstory, \nfrom \nchampions \nto \ncontenders, \ntitle-winners \nto \nnearly \nmen \nand  \ncompliments \nto \nNorm \non producing \nit. \nAlan Cathcart \nWarwick, Great Britain"

Struggling \nagainst both terrible track conditions and Los Angeles’ Ed Lingenfelder on \nhis  mighty White Pet NSU, DeRosier crashed during the  battle. Bicycling \nWorld and Motorcycle Review’s coverage of the race  noted, “Had DeRosier \nworn proper attire in his race against Lingenfelder, he would not  now be \nsuffering from painful injury. Instead of wearing trousers of stout material, \nsuch as  khaki or  duck, DeRosier rode in a suit  of flimsy tights, which gave \nas  little resistance as  no  clothes at all when brought into  the  rough stone \nsurface of The Motor Speedway.’ \nIn  1911, DeRosier led  the  Indian factory team’s assault on  the  soon- \nto-be-legendary Isle of Man TT  race.

The European tradition \ngrew on  asphalt circuits—Grand Prix races that were held on public roads. \nIn  the  United States, motorcycle competition had  its  roots on  dirt, oval, \nand  horse racing tracks, so  it was  small wonder that the  inception of a \nWorld Championship series of Grand Prix races in  1949 was  not  on  the \nradar of America’s top motorcycle racers of the time. In the United States, \nsuccess at  the  highest levels of dirt  track racing led  to  dirt  track sprint \ncars, which eventually led to  Indianapolis car  racing. Asphalt road racing \nwas  limited to just a  few  events, such as  Laconia. As a result, the greatest \nAmerican road racers on  two (or four) wheels—men such as  Daytona 200 \nwinners Joe Leonard, Brad Andres, and Paul Goldsmith—never seriously \nexplored competing in Europe. \nBy the  late 1950s, however, motorsports enthusiasts in  the  United \nStates were taking more of an  interest in the  European racing scene due \nto  the  success of Americans in  Grand Prix automobile road racing. Phil \nHill, Dan  Gurney, Richie Ginther, Harry Schell, and Masten Gregory were \nregularly competing in Formula One by this time, overcoming challenges \nsuch as  different shift patterns on  different cars. (The author once asked \nPhil Hill  how drivers were supposed to  keep track of such variations: “If \nyou wanted to stay alive, you'd remember it. Once, in 1959, youd go all the \nway  across the  gates and  straight back in the  same direction to  go from \nfirst  to second.”) \nThe \nfirst \nFl  \nUnited \nStates \nGrand \nPrix \n(USGP) \nwas \nheld \nat  \nSebring \nin \n1959, \nand \nthe  \nUnited \nStates \nhas  \nhosted \nnumerous \nF1  \nGPs \nsince. \nIn  \n1961, \nHill \nbecame \nthe \nfirst \nAmerican \nracer \nto \nearn \nthe \ntitle \nof \nworld \nchampion \nwhen \nhe \nwon \nthe \nF1 \nWorld \nDrivers’ \nChampionship, \npiloting \nhis \nFerrari \nDino \n156 \nto \ntwo \nvictories \nand \nfive \npole \npositions. \nThe \nend \nresult \nof \nthis \nlate  \n1950s \nroad \nracing \nautomotive \nrenaissance \nwas  \nthe  \nconstruction \nof \nia"

While \nAmerican Grand National riders had to be competitive on  various types of \nroad and  dirt racing machinery, the  British riders (who in  1971 included \nRay Pickrell, Paul Smart, Tony Jeffries, Percy Tait, and  John Cooper) were \nnot  only road racing specialists but had years of experience on  the circuits \nwhere the races would take place. \nDavid Aldana was one of  the  Americans who participated in  the \nTransatlantic event. He describes the challenges the Americans faced: \nRacing with the likes of Barry Sheene, John Cooper, and Mick Grant, \nwe  were racing against the best in the world. In the  U.S., we'd maybe \ndo a  road race every couple of months. The  racetracks were up  and \ndown hills with off-camber corners. You'd come up  to  a  ninety- \ndegree turn, and right in  front of you  was  a  stack of railroad ties \nabout twelve-feet high. If you  didn’t make the corner, you  were dead. \nAnother corner had a brick house for electrical equipment; it was  like \nthe Isle of Man—pretty scary. \nAnother American competitor, Don Emde, recalls that  the  riders had  no \nidea  what they were getting into  in  1971: \nWe \nthought \nit \nwas \njust \nan \nexhibition \nor \na \nphoto \nop, \na \nseeing-the-factory \nsort  \nof \nthing. \nOn  \nthe  \nplane \nride \nover, \nI \nfound \nout  \nthat \nthis  \nwas  \ngoing \nto \nbe \na \nfull-on \nrace \nagainst \nthese \nguys. \nWhen \nwe \ngot \nthere, \nthe \nBritish \npapers \nwere \nall \nfull \nof \nthe \n“Who \nwill \nwin?” \nkind \nof \nstuff. \n. \n. \nit \nwas \nreally \nmore \nlike  \nCuster’s \nlast  \nstand. \nSmart, \nPickrell, \nCooper \n.  \n.  \n.  \nthey \nwere \njust gone.”"

(Grand National Champion Gene Romero did  not  partici- \npate.) In the  end, the  Brits won the  event. The  final score was  183  points \nfor  Britain against 137  points for  the  United States. The  top  individual \nscore came up a tie between Smart and  Pickrell. \nWhile the races may have been forgettable, the riders did create some \nlasting memories. U.S.  Suzuki team manager Merv Wright recalls one  of \nthem: “My most distinct memory of the  match races was  driving down \nthe freeway with David Aldana mooning everyone out the rear  window of \nBarry Sheene’s Rolls-Royce.” \nBarry Sheene served as  England’s one-man welcoming committee. \n“I had  met him the  year before,” says Nixon. “He  was  the  only English \nguy  that came to  our  hotel and  ended up  being friends of ours. He  was \njust a  cool dude, the  only one  of their match race guys to  hang out  with \nus.”  Barry Sheene would go  on  to  play a  recurring role  in  the  story of \nAmericans in GP  racing, helping some along the  way, while challenging \nothers for World Championships. \nAt the end of 1971, BSA/Triumph slashed its racing budget, with the end \nresult being that the Transatlantic Match Races were opened to other manu- \nfacturers. A reluctant Harley-Davidson allowed Cal Rayborn, the two-time \nDaytona 200 winner and America’s top road racer, to compete.

Barry liked to  win  the  races off the  racetrack as  well \nas  on  the racetrack. He  did it by commandeering the best machinery, \nwhich somehow he got away with. Unfortunately for  Pat,  Barry well \nknew that Pat  was one  of the  ones that could beat him on  equal \nmachinery, and like  John Williams [the year before], Barry did every- \nthing he could to make sure that  he got the best machines. If they had \nbeen on  equal machines, not to say Barry wouldn't have won anymore, \nbut some of the results would have been very different. \nIn the end, the  1977 results saw  Sheene repeat as  500cc world champion, \nfollowed by Steve Baker and  Hennen. Pat's disappointment of losing the \ntitle was  softened somewhat by beating Sheene on  his home turf. Pat’s win \nat the season-ending British GP  gave him  two  victories in the  motorcycle \nracing premier class. \nChip Hennen describes the difficulties the team faced that year: \nThe  personnel looking after Barry’s effort operated completely inde- \npendent of the  personnel looking after Pat’s effort.

Of all the riders \nPat  ever competed against—both road racing and  dirt  track racing—I \nthink he enjoyed most competing against Kenny. No matter how fiercely \nthe  two  were competing against each other, he  says he  could always \ncount on  Kenny’s allowing for a margin of error. He was  truly a class act, \nboth on  and off the track. When Kenny joined the GP circuit in 1978, the \nmatch races were really his first opportunity in quite a while to compete \nagainst Pat, and the two  of them had some great head-to-head races. \nTrue to his humble nature, Pat credits the bike for his success: “With Barry \nSheene and  the  RG500, Suzuki won a  couple of World Championships. \nBut  the  RG700 was a rocket ship. It was  ahead of its  time. They almost \nneeded a  whole class just for  them.

I said for him to just give me  my goddamned money, and I'll \njust go home, no  f**king problem. \nThe  second round of the  series, held at Mallory Park, didn’t do much to \nimprove Kenny's attitude toward the Brits: \nWe  got  to  Mallory Park, and  in  the  first  race we  took off.  We  were \non  slicks. About the  second or  third lap,  I was  leading and  it just \nhailed like  you  couldn't believe. The  next lap around, I couldn't see \nthe  racetrack.

I said \n“Ed, if they pull my license because of safety, I'll make far more money \nsuing them than I'll  make racing.” A win  at  the  penultimate race of the \nseason, the  British GP,  followed by a third place in the  finale in France, \nclinched the title. \nThe 1980 season would prove to  be  much more of a struggle, as \nthe \nSuzuki \nhad \nthe \nadvantage \nin \npace \nover \nRoberts’ \nYamaha. \nDespite \nthe \ndisadvantage, \nRoberts \nstill \ndefeated \nFranco \nUncini \nand \nGraziano \nRossi \n(father \nof \nValentino) \non \ntheir \nSuzukis \nin \nthe \nseason \nopener \nat \nMisano. \nAs \nthe \nseason \nunfolded, \nit \nbecame \na \nbattle \nbetween \nRoberts \nand \na \nfleet \nof \nSuzuki-mounted \nchallengers \nthat \nincluded \nfuture \nchampions \nUncini \nand \nMarco \nLucchinellias \nwell \nas \nRandy \nMamola \nand \nTakazumi \nKatayama. \nWins \nin \nSpain \nand \nFrance \ngave \nRoberts \na \ncommanding \nlead \nin \na \nchampionship \nthat \nwould \nrun  \nonly \neight \nrounds \nthat \nyear."

For  1984, his  focus turned to  team ownership, starting \nout  with a  250cce Grand Prix team and  running Wayne Rainey and  Alan \nCarter. Two years later, he moved up to  the premier class, signing Randy \nMamola and Mike Baldwin to ride  for his team. \nMike Baldwin recalls the earliest days of the  500cc Team Roberts: \nThe good thing about [1986] is that they got the bikes early, before the \nseason started. We went to Malaysia and ran  four races down there, in \nthe heat .  .  .  in the sweltering heat.

In  1988, Wayne Rainey returned to Team Roberts, paired \nwith emerging talent Kevin Magee. Roberts explains the keys to the team’s \nsuccess at the time: “We started doing our  own development work on  the \nbikes, and  that  was  what separated us  from the  other Yamahas. I started \nputting together people, and we  started doing it the way I wanted to do it. \nThen we  took over the Marlboro deal.” \nWayne Rainey describes the  advantages of riding for  a  legend and  a \nthree-time world champion: \nI respected what he said.

The  problem was  that I had  Marlboro on  one \nside  yelling and  screaming that it wasn’t good enough, and  on  the \nother side I had Yamaha saving money. I was  like caught in the middle \nand  I couldn't get out.  We  were making the  ignition products at that \ntime.

It got to  the  point where I said, “Look, I \ncan't keep this up.” \nRoberts explains his decision to break away from Yamaha and start his own \nteam with backing from Malaysian motorcycle manufacturer Modenas: \n[I had] two  choices: quit  or  build my own motorcycle. I had a lot  of \npeople depending upon me,  and I leaned toward building my  own \nmotorcycle. The biggest mistake I made was saying that we  were \nduilding a  three[-cylinder engine].

I'd lean, \nrotate, and  see  how soon I could pick it up and how much I picked it \nup, what I had to change to pick the throttle up sooner. That drill that \nI ran,  with my track being dry on  one  end, wet  on  the other .  .  .  it had \nmore impact than anything else  upon my  ability, depth perception, \nthrottle versus lean angle, and changes as  the tires went away. \nIt wasn't long before Freddie had  his  introduction to  the  world of road \nracing. He was  all of 11 years old: \nOne Friday night, I was  racing at  a  flat  track event in  Irving, Texas, \nand  we  heard over the loudspeakers about a road race  that was  going \nto be at Green Valley Raceway. Well, they didn’t have anything for kids \nmy age.  The  smallest class was  the 0-to-250 production class, and the \nonly bike I could kind of fit on  was  this  RD100. Of course I didn’t do \nvery well  running a 100 against 250s, but within a couple of races I got \nan  RD250. They came out  with the TA125 production road race  bike \nlater, so  by the time I was  twelve, I had a proper road racing bike. \nMeanwhile, \nFreddie \nSpencer \nwas  \nalready \nimmersed \nin \nthe \nsport \nof \nmotor- \ncycle \nroad \nracing, \nporing \nover \nthe \nmagazines \nthat \ntold \nof \nthe \nexploits \nof \nhis \nEuropean \nheroes \nand \nthe \nspecifications \nof \ntheir \nfactory \nroad \nracing \nmachines: \n“I \nalready \nfollowed \neverything. \nKent \nAndersson \nwas \nthe \nworld"

All I had to do was  go through the last turn and the \ncheckered flag was  there... \nFreddie Spencer had arrived, but his size  needed to catch up with his \nenormous natural speed and talent. \nOver the  next few  seasons, Freddie rode and raced everything he \ncould get his hands on,  often running in every class at any given event: \nBy 1977, I was  riding an  RD400, a 125 single, and a TZ250. I'd race all \nthose bikes on  the same day. A lot of times [ would go to  a race, and \nit was  just Dad and  I. At  the  WERA national finals at  Mid-Ohio in \nOctober of 1977, I won the  250  race. I was  fifteen and  because I won \nthat race, my dad got me  a TZ750—can you believe that?

When you road \nraced, you rode a maximum size of a 250 against other novices. But I could \nalso  run  Superbike, for whatever reason.” \nRegardless of the  logic (or lack thereof) behind setting 16-year-old \nriders loose on  1,000cc road racing machinery, the Superbike series offered \nSpencer the opportunity to continue his upward career trajectory: \nWhen I raced at  Daytona in  1978, I rode a  1,000cc Suzuki that \nmy  brother and Doug Polen built. Doug Polen was the  mechanic \nat my brother’s Suzuki dealership in Texas. Doug took up racing late; \nI'm  pretty sure [Daytona 1978] was  the  first  time he had  gone to  a \nprofessional race. I can’t remember where I finished, but it wasn’t that \ngood. The  thing wobbled so  bad; it was  unstable. \nThe  following season of 1979 would be a breakout year for Spencer. After \nMike Baldwin smashed his  femur in  a  crash at  Loudon in  June, putting \nhim out  of racing for  a  year, Kawasaki brought Spencer in  as  a  replace- \nment. This was  the  era  of Suzuki domination, with Wes Cooley earning \nSuperbike Championships in  1978 and 1979 on  the  Yoshimura GS1000. \nBut \nthe \n17-year-old \nSpencer \nwould \nmake \nthe \nbest \npossible \nimpression \nin \nhis debut as  a factory rider: \nThe  \ntwo  \nraces \nin  \nJuly \nwere \nSears \nPoint \nand  \nLaguna, \nand  \nthey \nran  \na \nSuperbike \nclass. \nI \nhad \nnever \ntested \non \nthis \nthing; \nI \njust \nshowed \nup \non \nFriday. \nGary \nMathers, \ntheir \nteam \nmanager, \nasked \nme \nto \nfill \nin; \nI \nwas \nonly \nseventeen. \nLuckily, \nI \nwent \nout \nand \nwon \nat \nSears \nPoint, \nand  \nthat \nhad \na \nbig \neffect. \nI \nhad  \nwon \n250  \nraces \nand  \nraced \nthe"

At Daytona, I missed \nout on  the pole by a couple of tenths to Kenny. Kenny fell out with a throttle \ncable problem about ten  or  fifteen laps into  the race, and then I had over a \nminute lead when the bike suffered a crankshaft failure.” \nWhen asked if he  was shocked by Freddie's speed at  Daytona, Erv \nKanemoto recalls, “No, because prior to  that all  indications were that if \neverything ran  to its potential—if the machine was  close—Freddie would \nbe able to  make up the difference.” \nMeanwhile, Gavin Trippe always kept an  open slot  or  two on  the \nTransatlantic Match Races team in case someone had a remarkable perfor- \nmance at the  Daytona 200. Freddie Spencer had passed this audition and \nwas  added to the team. At just 18 years old, the precocious young kid was \ngoing racing against the likes of Barry Sheene and the  rest  of the world’s \ngreatest riders on  road racing courses he had  never seen. \nThe  rest, as  they say,  is history. Freddie recalls that first  experience: \n“When I showed up,  nobody knew who I was. I was  the young American. \nFriday as  we  were coming out  of the  tunnel to  the  racetrack for the  first \nrace [at Brands Hatch], I knew this was  where I wanted to be.

The \ninteresting thing about it  was that the  powerband was supposedly \nbetween 13,600 and 21,500, but the reality was  that it didn’t have much \ntorque. The oval pistons with the eight valves made it similar to a V-8. \nAnother thing was  that the  valve springs were pretty weak because \nof the massive amount of heat the  engine was  generating at  the time. \nTo  get  the  power required, there was  a lot  of friction. 21,500 is not \na  small amount of rpm, and  they didn’t have hydropneumatic valve \noperation then. When I rode the  bike at  Laguna, I geared the  thing \nso  I was  shifting a  lot.  I was  running it between about 18,000 and \n22,000, because that’s really where the  usable power was.

[Before then,] we  had heard the \nrumors that  Honda was  going two-stroke. They brought the  engine \nto American Honda in July of 1981. It only had  three cylinders. Erv’s \nfirst reaction was, “Well, it’s missing a cylinder.” Plus, it was  reed valve \nwhen Yamaha and  Suzuki had  gone to  rotary valves. The  whole idea \nwas  to  make a  bike that  was  lighter and  narrower, but  in  fact  it was \nheavier than the Yamaha or  the Suzuki. That first  race  out,  we  battled \nfor the win  in Buenos Aires but still had some of the overheating issues \nthat we  had experienced in winter testing. \nNevertheless, Spencer managed to  take the three-cylinder NS500 \ntwo-stroke to  third place. Next stop was England for  the  Transatlantic \nMatch Races, but  the  new bikes continued to  struggle with teething \nproblems, and Spencer was forced to  withdraw midway through \nthe series: \nThe  reason we had  to withdraw was  that we  were having some throttle \nsticking problems.

But  Freddie was  quite tough on  the \nmachinery. In some ways, it was  good for Honda because when they had \nthe  problems, they got on  top of them, and  we  knew if it could last  with \nFreddie, it could last with anybody.” \nErv Kanemoto applauds Hondas commitment to  success in  the \n1982 season: \nIt was  their first  venture with a two-stroke Grand Prix machine, and \nhaving been working in  1981 with Barry Sheene and  Yamaha, I felt \nit would be really difficult for the bike to  be up and  running in  such \na short time.

The young American \nalso  started from pole position in  the  final three races of 1982 to  carry \nmomentum into  1983 as  the fastest man in GP  racing. \nTHE EPIC 1983 SEASON \nOver the  winter, Honda continued to  develop the  three-cylinder bike, \nfine-tuning the response of the chassis to fit Spencer’s demands. A critical \npoint for  Spencer was  the  turn-in response of the  motorcycle, the  vital \ningredient to his approach: \nOne  of the things we  really worked on  in the off-season was  the direc- \ntional change. We needed the new  bike to steer a little better. 1 wanted \nto  get  more of a  directional change at  the  first application of lean \nangle. The  reason that is so  important is because the  speed you  carry \nis SO \nfrom the moment you  turn—that first  rotation toward the apex \ncritical. The longer it takes you  to change direction, the more it’s going \nto begin pushing the front. \nHonda \nalso \nworked \non  \nthe  \nengine, \nas  \nSpencer \nexplains: \n“In  \n1983, \nthey \nmade \nit \na \nlittle \nbit \nlighter \nand \ngot \na \nlittle \nmore \nhorsepower \nout  \nof \nit. \nThere \nwere \ntwo \ntimes \nat \nthe \nend \nof \nthe \nraces \nafter \nwe \nstopped \nit \nwouldn't \nstart \nup \nagain \nbecause \nthe \nmain \nbearings \nwere \nlying \nin \nthe \nbottom \nof \nthe \ncases.” \nAll \nthe \noff-season \nwork \nwould \npay \noff \nwhen \nSpencer \nwon \nthe \nfirst \nthree \nGrands \nPrix \nof \nthe \n1983 \nseason. \nThe \nimprovements \nwere \nparticu- \nlarly \nstriking \nat  \nSpa, \nwhere \nFreddie \nwas  \nsix  \nseconds \nper  \nlap \nfaster \nthan"

Spencer \ndescribes the intensity of that  epic season: \nId go out  and turn a quick lap, come in, and that would be it. I'd say,  “I \ncan't go any faster.’ Then Kenny would go quicker. So, I'd go out  and do \nitagain...and again... Then Id go nine-tenths quicker after saying that \nthere was  no  way I could go faster. Every race, every session in 1983 was \nlike that. It's like the Japanese would say, “Are you ready to jump back in \nthe fire?” Chuck Yeager put it perfectly—a great test  pilot survives only \nbecause he could push it past the envelope and reel it back in. \nAs described in the previous chapter, the titanic battle of wills would reach \nits  climax at  the  second-to-last race in  Sweden. Coming in  to  the  race, \nSpencer had a  two-point lead over Roberts. But  Roberts was  on a roll, \nhaving won the  previous three rounds.

Such a clash of titans usually only occurs once \nin a generation. \nLost on  few  in  this, the  greatest rivalry of the  era,  was  the  fact  that \nboth riders were Americans. Roberts’ teammate was  another American, \nup-and-coming rider Eddie Lawson. At the finale at Imola, it was  essential \nthat  Lawson play a role. If Roberts won with Spencer’s Honda in second, \nthe  World Championship belonged to  Spencer. If Roberts and Lawson \ncould manage a  Yamaha 1-2  finish, then the  World Championship \nbelonged to  Kenny Roberts. Imola would favor the  powerful Yamaha \nbecause of  the  track layout, so  the  championship was very much \nstill in  question. However, given the  results at  Sweden, Spencer had \nmore control over his  destiny, as  he  only needed that top-two finish if \nRoberts won. \nSpencer describes the  situation heading into the  season finale: “We \nknew \nImola \nwas \ngoing \nto \nbe \nthe \ntoughest \ntrack \nfor \nus \nbecause \nof \nthe \ntight \nchicanes. \nAs \nsoon \nas \nyou \nwould \nstart \nshifting, \nthe \nYamaha \nwould \njump \nahead. \nBut \nI \nfigured \nout \nin \npractice \nthat \nthere \nwas \none \ncorner \nthat \nI \ncould \ngo \nthrough \nwide \nopen, \nand \nif \nI \nneeded \nto \nmake \na \npass \nI \ncould.” \nThe \nimportance \nof \na  \nWorld \nChampionship \nfor  \nHonda \nwas \nbeyond \ncalculation. \nDespite \nthe  \ncompany’s \nmany \ngreat \nyears \nin  \nthe  \n1960s \nwith \nthe \nincredible \nmulticylinder \nmachines \nof \nthe \nday, \nand \ndespite \nthe \nriding \ntalent \nof  \nMike \nHailwood, \nMV  \nAgusta \nhad \nalways \ncome \nout  \non \ntop. \nHonda"

HRC had  been in existence \nfor  five  years, and  we  talked about that the  night before the  race. I \nunderstood that it was  very important to  [Honda], and  it was  very \nimportant to  me  because it would allow me  to be the  youngest 500 \nworld champion. Mike Hailwood—whom I respect very much—he \nhad  the record [1962 at age 22] and it would give Mr.  Honda his first \n500  championship. \nRoberts’ best hope was to  slow the  pace down to  allow Lawson to  be \na  factor in  the  hunt for  second place. Spencer comments on  Roberts’ \nstrategy: \nWhen he  would get  to  the  chicanes, he  would almost park it.  I \nalmost hit  him a  few  times. He  was trying to  slow the  pace down \nto  let Eddie Lawson and  the  others catch up.

Honda didn’t \nhave a  250  Grand Prix bike at  the  time, and  we  were coming off the \nbike with the  gas  tank on  the  bottom and  the  pipes on  the  top.  I was \nalso developing the  radial tires, as  we  were making the  switch from \nbias-ply tires. For development, we  were taking a light fuel load on  the \n1984 bike and then adding weight to the top of it to simulate what we \nwere trying to  do with the  next-generation bike, and  that  was  tough. \nI was  trying to  develop the 250  and  500  bikes so  that  they had  a very \nsimilar feel.  But  they had different lines that  theyd need to take  in the \ncorners, and theyd have different corner speeds that  I needed to run. \nAs  for  Spencer’s goal of making both handle similarly, he says, “Most of \nthe time they didn’t” \nEven more problematic were the  almost-overlapping session times \nwhen one  class would immediately follow the other: \nAt most tracks, the practices were back to back, so  I'd have to wait  until \nafter I did  both sessions and  sit  down with the  crews and  tell  them \nwhat each bike needed. On  race day, I'd have to  make the  switchover \nbetween the  two  on  my  warmup lap.  Granted, they were both two- \nstrokes, and  they were both Grand Prix bikes, but  there was  such a \nhuge difference in  power delivery. My  1985 bike had  just about 160 \nhorsepower, maybe a little bit more, and weighed under three hundred \npounds. \nMy \n250 \nbike \nthat \nyear, \ndry \nwith \nnothing \nin \nit, \nwas \nunder \n200  pounds. \nKanemoto \nrecalls \nthe  \ndifficulties: \n“If \npeople \nwere \nonly \nable \nto  \nsee  \nwhat \nhe  \nwas  \ngoing \nthrough. \nHed \njust  \nget  \noff \none  \nbike \nfrom \na  \nrace \nand  \nthen"

Also, we  were raising the  rear \nride height and kicking it out  to get it some more trail, which was  the \nopposite of what was  believed up to that time. They had been trying to \nkeep the bikes as  flat as  possible to help stabilize weight forward and \nback. Then the only way you  could make the  things change direction \nwas  to  make the front end  very steep, which made for a very narrow \nforgiveness once you got the thing on  its side. \nAsked if the  1985 V-4  was  more forgiving than the  three-cylinder 1983 \nchampionship bike, Spencer replies, “Oh yeah, because if for  nothing \nelse, we  had figured out  the chassis geometry.

[My wrist] was  never \nthe  same and  it took a lot out  of me  physically, which in turn affects \nyou  mentally and  emotionally in how you  are  able  to  recover from it. \nWhen I started off the  1986 season, I did not  even test. \nDespite the  lingering injury, Spencer started off the  season in  impres- \nsive \nfashion. \nAt \nthe \nseason-opening \nSpanish \nGP \nat \nJarama, \nhe \nrocketed \noff \nfrom \npole \nposition \ninto \nthe \nlead, \nand \nit \nwas \nlooking \nas \nif \nthe \nnew \nGP \nseason \nwould \nbe \nanother \nSpencer \nromp. \n“I \nwas \nleading \nthe \nrace \nby \nabout \nten \nseconds \nwhen \nmy \nright \nhand \njust \nstopped \nworking. \nIt \nwas \nstill \ngoing \nnumb, \nbut \nit \nwas \nworse. \nIt \nliterally \nstopped \nworking,’ \nhe \nsays. \nSpencer, \nunable \nto \noperate \nthe \nfront \nbrake, \nwent \noff \nin \nthe \nhairpin, \nending \nhis \nseason when it had just barely begun. \n79"

He \nretired from GP motorcycle racing soon afterward, eyeing a career change \nthat  other GP world champions, such as  Hailwood and  John Surtees, had \nfound success with: “I was  going to race  cars. I flew to Del Mar to race the \nBarber Saab series. I was  leading until the  yellow flag came out  when I \noverheated the turbocharger and finished third. I also  got a test  with Chip \nGanassi in an  Indy Lights car.” \nUnfortunately, the  Indy car  route did  not  pan out. This stint was \nfollowed by an  unsuccessful comeback attempt for  Marlboro Yamaha \nin  1989. The highlight from that season was  a fifth at  the  Spanish \nGP  in Jerez: \nI was  running with the  lead group at  Australia, but  it went downhill \nfrom there.

After another year away \nfrom riding, Spencer returned to  American racing for  1995, winning the \nAMA Superbike race at  Laguna Seca on  the  new Fast  by Ferracci Ducati \n916. It had been 16 years since his first win in the class. Despite his physical \nissues, Freddie had been a winning presence for a generation. \nFor  Honda's GP  team manager, Gerald Davison, there are  two  greats \nthat  immediately come to mind: \nThere are  the perennial debates about who has been the best bike racer \nat  various times.

However, four podium finishes \nover the course of the  season showed that  Lawson had promise. \nThat promise blossomed in  1984, with Lawson winning the  season \nopener en  route to  the  championship over the  fast  but  erratic Honda \nof  Freddie Spencer. The 1984 title would be  the  first of four for  the \nCalifornian—the best record among all American riders. Eddie Lawson's \n31  Grand Prix wins also  make him  the winningest American GP  rider of \nall time. Add two Daytona 200 victories, a win at the 8 Hours of Suzuka, \nand two wins at  the  multidiscipline Superbikers competition—all of \nwhich had  followed a successful career in flat track racing—and Lawson's \non-track career achievements stand alone. His  consistency may have \nearned him  the nickname of Steady Eddie, but there was  no  venue where \nEddie Lawson could not  win  at the highest level. \n“SO FAR AHEAD OF EVERYBODY” \nEddie Ray Lawson was  born on  March 11,  1958, in  Upland, California. \nComing \nfrom \na \nlong \nline  \nof \nracers, \nyoung \nEddie \nstarted \nriding \nat \nthe  \nage \nof \nseven \non \nhis \nFather’s \nYamaha \n100, \nbefore \nmoving \nto \na \nKawasaki. \nThese \nsmall \nrotary \nvalve \nrockets \nwere \nperhaps \nbest \nknown \nfor \ntheir \nexplosive \nand \ntricky \npowerband, \nnarrow \neven \nfor \na \nbike \nin \nthe \n100cc \nclass. \n‘The \ndifficult- \nto-ride \nbikes \nwere \ngood \ntraining \nmachines \nfor \nany \naspiring \nracer, \nas \nthey \nrequired \nsome \ntalent \nand \ndetermination \nto \nride  \nto \ntheir \npotential."

That was  his  first \ndecent Novice class ride. Eddie was  quiet; he was  very shy. There was \na whole lot of talent when he came up through the ranks. One time at \nan  Ascot National in the  Novice class, Eddie was  racing Mamola and \nRainey, and  Eddie was  falling back. Then on  the  last  lap, he  caught \nback up  like  a  bullet, passed Randy and  won the  race. He  reached \ndown and  shook the  back disc on  the  Bultaco. It was  loose and  kept \nlocking up!

Then I got a tractor and  built the  track. \nThe  interesting thing was  that they were all  racers. The thought \nof  going head-to-head with guys they don't normally get  to  race \nwith—the X factor, the curiosity—they loved the idea, thinking, “That \nguy,  I want to see  if I can  beat his ass.” \nThe made-for-TV extravaganza hada budget that dwarfed the other racing \nevents of the day.

For television rating \nof motorsports, the Indianapolis 500 was the most-watched American motor- \nsports event, with 10.8 million households tuning in to the 1979 race.

We  started with a new bike in  1981, \nthe  physical bike itself was  a  new machine, and  we  didn't use  any  of \nthe stuff that  they had run  in  1980. So, we  built the new bike, went to \nDaytona, and got our  ass  kicked by Honda. To make a long story short, \nwe  just didn't have enough power at  the  first  couple of races. Pretty \nmuch what we had been using was  what Japan had sent. We made some \nchanges to  the  engine and  found some power. I remember having to \nport a  cylinder head in a closet at  Atlanta... in  the  distributorship \nthere.

Superbike racing was  the kind of platform that  allowed the \ntruly gifted to stand out  from the merely talented. \nThe  results for  Kawasaki were to  improve in  1981, as  Lawson not \nonly had the  ability to  develop the  machine but  had the  formidable \ntalents of Rob Muzzy focused on  the  search for  more power and  speed. \nIn  yet  another season-long title battle with both Spencer and Cooley, \nit all  came down to  the  final race.

The  press had  made it out  to  be kind of \nnasty to ride  and  all that, but it wasn’t. It was  a good bike.” \nRainey and  Schwantz traded victories in  the  four midseason races, \nwhile Lawson picked up three second-place finishes as well as a third.

His  seventh place in  the  standings was his  worst \nresult by far. In hindsight, his move back to Yamaha looked to have been a \nmistake. Kanemoto felt Lawson could have won a fifth title if he had stayed \nat Honda in  1990: \nOnce we  got the new  bike, I thought it was  really too  bad  [that he had \nleft], with all the  work Eddie did. Due to  Eddie’s input, most of the \nthings we  were looking for, and the things Eddie was  looking for, were \nbuilt into  the  following year’s bike. Trying to  get  all  of Eddie’s ideas \ninto  place with the  machine, it was  virtually impossible to  do  it in  a \nshort time. It’s  too  bad; the  following year it would have been a real \nadvantage for  him.

I had to  move John [Kocinski] up,  because he was world 250 \nGP  champion, so  I moved him up  into Eddie’s spot. Cagiva needed \nsomebody like  Eddie worse than Yamaha did. We  helped with the \ndevelopment of the  Cagiva. Nobody knows it, but  we  gave them a \nYamaha for a week—one of my race  bikes, the Grand Prix bike, the one \nthat Wayne rode. We pushed it into their factory, and I left a mechanic \nthere. They dynod it and tore  it apart, measured it all, and looked at it. \nI was  trying to help Cagiva because it was  to Yamaha's advantage that \nCagiva was  in  Grand Prix too;  there weren't a hell  of a lot of people \nin Grand Prix  at that  time. I asked Yamaha if they would mind if we \nwere to help Cagiva, and they said, “Okay.” So we  gave them a bike for \na week. That’s how they got their start; that’s what really started it all. \nWhen John went over to them, it was  good. The bike was  good. \nMotoGP \nrace \ndirector \nPaul \nButler, \nformerly \nwith \nthe  \nRoberts \nteam, \nconfirms \nthe  \nstory: \n“It \nwas  \na \ntime, \nnot  \ndissimilar \nto  \n[today], \nin \nthat  \nthey \nwanted \ncompetition. \nYamaha \nhas \nalways \nhad  \nan  \nopen \nmind; \nthey \nwanted \nto \nencourage \ncompetition, \nthey \nwanted \nto \nhelp. \nThey \nhad \nsympathy \nand \nadmiration \nfor \nwhat \nClaudio \nCastiglioni \nwas \ntrying \nto \ndo.’ \nGiven \nthe  \namount \nof \nmoney \nthat  \nteams \nspent \neach \nyear \nto  \ngain \nthe \nsmallest \nof \nadvantages, \nsuch \na \nmove \nwas  \nan  \nincredible \ngesture \non  \nYamaha's"

Lawson would be the  key \nto  Cagiva’s plans—the Italians were counting on  his  experience to  fill  in \nthe gaps. The Italians didn’t take full advantage of the opportunity, though, \nas  Eddie explains: “I was there when it  [the GP  Yamaha] arrived [at the \ngarage]. We  looked at  every single thing. The  geometry was  really close \nbecause we  had all of [Yamaha's] numbers, but their engine was  incredibly \nheavy, and they didn’t build a Yamaha.” \nThe  1991 season began miserably, at least by Lawson's lofty standards. \nBut  after finishing fifth or  sixth in  the  first four races, the  four-time \nchampion had his breakout at Cagiva’s home race at Misano, taking a third \nplace.

We \ncalled it Checkered Flag Blues, because it would never see the checkered \nflag, because it would throw a rod.  I tried different style rods, I tried \ndifferent clearances, I had a handmade rod made out of Kryptonite... \nit went about twelve laps. \nWayne remembers the challenges of being the only rider struggling with a \nSuzuki in a flat track world dominated by other brands: “The thing would \nrev  so  high that you  couldn't shift it; the  transmission wouldn't let you \nshift. I was  getting good at catching seizures. We  would take it apart and \nsee  signs where the pistons were starting to crack before they failed. I was \nracing with Eddie Lawson, Mike Tidwell, and  Mike Minnig, and  they all \nrode Kawasakis and Yamahas.” \nThis experience would come in  handy years later when Wayne was \nriding the  temperamental 500cc GP  bikes that required keeping a  finger \nover the clutch lever as  a survival mechanism. \nSandy \nRainey \nsums \nup \nthat  \nparticular \nera  \nfor \nTeam \nRainey: \n“As \nEddie \n[Lawson] \nsaid, \n‘We \nused \nto \nbe \nreally \nscared \nof \nyou \nguys \nwhen \nyou  \nshowed \nup, \nbut \nthen \nwe \nlearned \nthat \nwe \nonly \nneeded \nto \nbe \nscared \nearly, \nbecause \nlater \non \nwe \ndidn’t \nhave \nto \nworry \nabout \nyou. \n” \nTaking, \nas \nalways, \nthe \nroad \nless \ntraveled, \nthe \nnext  \nwindmill \nthe \nRaineys \nchose \nto  \ntilt  \nat  \nwas  \nHonda’s \nfirst \ncompetition \ntwo-stroke \nracer, \nthe  \nnew \n125cc \nElsinore. \nWayne \nexplains: \n“I \nwas  \nthe \nonly \nguy \non  \na \nHonda \nand  \nwas \n109"

That was  factory to  us. \nWayne recalls this first big break: “Shell Thuet and John Reed saw me  and \nsaid they would give me a short track bike if 'd come race Ascot.

We  weren't \nracing for the money; it’s just what we  did. You didn't race  to get rich” \nFor  1980, Rainey was  to  get his  next big opportunity, and  it came at \nthe expense of Eddie Lawson. Lawson was  going to be racing the new  250 \npiston-port Kawasaki MX engine in flat track racing in an aftermarket chassis \nby Viper. However, Lawson dislocated his hip and was  unable to ride. \nWayne explains the situation: “They asked [Eddie] if he knew anybody \nwho could ride this bike in the short track nationals, and Eddie mentioned \nme.  I won the consolation race  the first time out on  this thing, and it really \nexcited Kawasaki. I started racing all over  the Midwest.

Rainey explains: “We came to \nDaytona—a couple of the  guys came over from Europe [Sito Pons and \nMartin Wimmer] to run  it as  a tune-up race—and we  blew their doors off \nwith \nthis \n250 \nYamaha. \nAfter \nthat, \nwe \nwent \nto \nKyalami, \nSouth \nAfrica, \nfor \nthe \nfirst \nrace. \nThe \nonly \nthing \nI \nknew \nabout \nGP \nracing \nwas \nlooking \nat \nthe \ntrack \nmaps that  Kenny gave me  to see  which way to go.” \nRainey \nrecalls \nthat  \nthe \nlow-budget \nteam \nlacked \neven \nthe  \nspare \nwheels \non  which to  mount a  set  of rain tires: \nKenny \ntold \nme  \nto  \ngo  \nout  \non  \nslicks. \nBarry \nSheene \ncame \nby \nand  \nsaid, \nWhat \nare  \nyou \ndoing \ngoing \nout  \nthere \non  \nslicks? \nIt’s \nraining.’ \nIn \npractice,"

Rainey won the following two  rounds, but \nDoohan took second both times. Doohan broke through with victories in \nthe  following two  races at Jerez and  Misano—the title  was  starting to tip \ntoward the  Australian. Schwantz and Doohan traded the  next two wins, \nwith Rainey runner-up each time. As the season passed the halfway mark, \nthe  defending champion went on a tear, winning four of the  next seven \nraces to seal his second straight title. Unfortunately, he broke his leg during \nthe last event of the season in Malyasia. The injuries sustained in the crash \nwould add to the challenge of defending his title the following season. \nFor 1992, Rainey tried to  return to  testing too  early and  crashed, \nbreaking bones in his hand. His inability to develop the Yamaha in the off- \nseason left him at a serious disadvantage to Doohan and the new  big-bang \nHonda. \nDuring \nthe \nearly \npart \nof \nthe \nseason, \nthe \nchampionship \nwas \nsimply \nno \ncontest: \nDoohan \nwon \nthe \nfirst \nfour \nraces, \nfollowed \nby \nseconds \nat \nMugello \nand \nCatalunya. \nDespite \nhis \ndisadvantage \nin \nequipment, \nRainey \nkept \nhis \nhead \ndown \nand \nrecorded \nthree \nsecond-place \nfinishes \nand \none \nwin \nfrom those first six races. \nHowever, \nthings \ngot \nworse \nfor \nthe \ndefending \nchampion \nat \nthe \nGerman \nGP  \nat  \nthe  \nHockenheimring: \nRainey \ncrashed, \ninjuring \nhis  \nback \nand \nbreaking \nboth \nhis \nhand \nand \nhis \nfoot. \nAdding \ninsult \nto \ninjury \nwas \nthe \nfact  \nthat \nDoohan \nwon \nthe  \nrace, \nand  \nthe  \ntitle \nappeared \nto  \nbe \na  \nforegone \n123"

After a  year \nunder the  guidance of  Stuart Shenton, the  Suzuki team had brought \npredictability and consistency to Rainey’s greatest rival. Finishes of 1-3-2- \n1-1-2-1-3-2 to  start the  season were decidedly unlike Schwantz, leading \none  to think that  perhaps the  “win or  crash” label may have had  as  much \nto do with the previous development program as  it did with the rider. The \nchallenge to  Rainey’s supremacy was  on,  as  Schwantz took a significant \npoints advantage going into Donington Park. \nIn  \nqualifying, \nit  \nall  \nwent \nwrong \nfor  \nWayne \nRainey: \n“I  \ncrashed \nand \nfractured \nthe \nvertebrae \nin \nmy \nback. \nI \nwas \nhurting \nso \nbad, \nI \ndidn’t \nknow \nwhere \nI \nwas \ngoing \nto \nfinish, \nor \neven \nif \nI \ncould \nfinish. \nDoohan \ntook \nout \n[Alex] \nBarros \nand \nSchwantz, \nand \nI \nfigured \nthat \nsince \nKevin \nwas \nout \nthat \nI \ncould \njust \ncruise \naround \nand \nget \nsecond, \nso \nthat’s \nwhat \nI \ndid” \nDespite \nthe  \nback \ninjury, \nRainey \nfollowed \nup  \nDonington \nwith \na  \nwin \nat \nBrno \n(Czech \nRepublic), \nretaking \nthe \npoints \nlead \nin \nthe \nprocess. \nThe \nchances \nfor \na \nfourth \nstraight \nchampionship \nlooked \npromising \nheading \ninto \nthree \nof  \nhis  \nfavorite \ncircuits: \nMisano, \nLaguna \nSeca, \nand \nJarama."

The high point of the \nseason came when the  Italian took his  and  the  team’s first premier class \nvictory at the final race of the year at Eastern Creek, Australia. Capirossi \nrecalls that joyous moment: “That moment was  great for me  and also espe- \ncially for Wayne because it was  really his first big win  as  a team manager. I \nhave a beautiful picture in my home. I am  in the arms of Wayne.” \nIt was  only two  seasons later, at the  end  of 1998, that  Rainey decided \nthat  20 years of rigorous traveling in pursuit of racing glory was  enough. \nHe moved on  from GP  racing, turning his attention to his family. \nWayne Rainey remains a  legend, one  of America’s greatest racers in \nany  form of motorsport, a  fact  demonstrated by his  induction into the \nAMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in  1999 and the  FIM’s naming him a \nGrand Prix Legend the  following year.

Rainey recalls: “Sometimes things happen \nearly in  one’s profession or  career that  you  don't really know what it did \nuntil it is all done, like the  Russians beating the Americans up into  space. \nIf that  hadn't happened, then America wouldn't have been so  determined \nto get to the moon.

His  win \nin  Japan was followed by a fifth, two  DNFs, and a fourth place before \nhe  broke through for  a  second win  at  the  Nurburgring (a victory made \nall the  sweeter by the  fact  that it was  taken at  the  expense of a  despon- \ndent \nRainey). \nWith \njust \none \npodium \nand \nfour \nDNFs \nacross \nthe \nfollowing \neight \nraces, \nSchwantz \nwas \nleft \nwell \nbehind \nin \nthe \nchampionship \nchase; \nhe \nfinished eighth in points. \nBut  \nany \nanalysis \nof \nKevin \nSchwantz’s \nfirst  \nGP  \nseason \nmust \ninclude \nthe \nfact \nthat \nSuzuki \nwas \njust \nmaking \nits \nreturn \nto \nGP \nracing \nafter \na \nhiatus \nof \nseveral \nyears. \nThe \nfledgling \nteam \nhad \nno \nGP \nknowledge \non \nwhich \nto \ndevelop \nits \nbike, \nand \nit \nshowed. \nThe \nmanufacturer \ndelivered \na  \nmuch \nbetter \nmachine \nfor  \n1989, \nbut \nSchwantz \nhimself \nstill \nrequired \nsome \ndevelopment. \nSuffice \nit \nto \nsay, \nthe \nyoung \nTexan \nhad \nnot  \nquite \ngrasped \nthe \nconcept \nof \n“race \ncraft:” \n141"

Lawson's injury at round two  at Laguna Seca meant \nthe  title  fight would be  more or  less  a  two-man race, and  Schwantz duly \nraised his game when the championship arrived in Europe. The Texan took \nthird at  Jerez before finishing second at  Misano, followed by wins at  the \nNurburgring and the Salzburgring. The Rainey-Schwantz finish in the next \nGP at Rijeka was  offset by a Schwantz-Rainey finish at Assen. Rainey would \nmatch the Texan’s wins at Le Mans and Donington with his own  victories at \nSpa and Brno. The difference was  in the consistency. Across the first nine GPs \nof the season, Rainey’s worst finish was  second. Those results, coupled with \nfive wins, were enough to trump Schwantz’: five victories by 67 points. \nOnce again, the 1991 season began at Suzuka with what Kevin considers \nhis greatest race: \nWe  \nhad  \nbeen \nhorrible \nall  \nwinter \nin  \ntesting. \nThe  \nfirst  \nrace  \nof \nthe  \nyear \nwas \nin \nJapan, \nand \neverybody \nwas \nthere: \nLawson, \nDoohan, \nGardner, \nKocinski, \nMagee, \nNiall \nMackenzie, \nand \na \nhandful \nof \nJapanese \nwildcard \nguys. \nI \ngot \na \ngood \nstart \nand \ngot \nto \nthe \nfront, \nbut \nbefore \nI \nknew \nit \nI \nwas \nthe \nlength \nof \nthe \nfront \nstraightaway \nbehind. \nThat \nwas \nmy \nbest \nrace; \nthe \nbike \nwasn't \ngreat. \nIt \nwas \nreally \ngood \nto \nstart \nwith \nbut \nstarted \npushing \nthe  \nfront \nlike  \na \ntruck, \nand  \nI \nfound \na \nway \nto \nride  \naround \nthe \nproblems \n143"

We  didn't \nkeep good enough notes, so  we  didn’t have much to  fall  back upon. \nIt was  always, “Well, I don’t know what the  f**k  we  do  now, let’s  try \nthis.

You need a  thrust bearing in  there as  well, rather than just \nbolting it up  and  shoving washers in  it.

He  had a lot  of experience and had \nridden a lot of bikes even at that  early stage, having won on  all sorts \nof things. Doug was  able to  confirm a lot  of stuff for  us,  to  back us \nup when decisions were made and  parts were tried. He  was a  good \nguy to  have on  the  other side of  the  garage, someone we  could \nwork with and  get  stuff done. But  sometimes I think you can  get \ntoo  deep into the  motorcycle, with too  much of that stuff playing \non  your mind. There is  a happy medium. Kevin and  Doug are  very \ndifferent characters. Maybe getting too  deep into the  motorcycle, \nfocusing on  too  many things instead of  just riding it,  can  be  a \nhandicap. What is good for a test  rider maybe isn’t so  good for a racer; \nmaybe what you  don’t know and  what you  don't want to  know ain't \nhurting you. \nIn  the  case of Lucky Strike Suzuki, the  combination clicked. “Chandler \nwas  a  hands-on guy, and  FAST; says Schwantz’s mechanic at  the  time, \nHamish Jamieson. “He was a strong teammate, quite often beating Kevin \nin  races.

As  in the  Schwantz years, the  great \nresults mixed with a thirteenth in Spain, twenty-second in  South Africa, \nand  a  DNF in  France. There was  no  way  of telling where Roberts might \nfinish on  any given weekend. \nRoberts remembers vividly the  trials and  tribulations of that up-and- \ndown season: \nIn Spain, on  the  first  lap, my teammate [Nobu] Aoki ran  into  the  back \nof me,  knocked me  off the  track, and  I was  dead last. I got back up to \nseventh or eighth, but a rock had gotten into  the airbox, and  I ended up \nfinishing on  three cylinders. In South Africa, we had a shock overheat. In \nFrance, we  took a front tire and mounted it on  a narrower rim.  I pushed \nthe front on  lap one, the  rear  stepped out,  and  I high-sided; it was  a big \nhigh-side. From then on,  we  were just  trying to  achieve second in the \nchampionship, and we  achieved that. I told myself, “I’m  not  falling down \nagain. I am  not  going to win  the World Championship falling down like \nthis.

Roberts’ title quest was  aided by the fact \nthat  the  season had  seen seven different winners in the first  nine races— \nRoberts’ three wins made him  the only repeat winner. \nRoberts understood that 2000 was going to  be  his  best chance to \nfollow in  his  father’s footsteps as  world champion. He  says, “We knew \nthat Valentino was  strong, and  anybody who could get it together on  a \nHonda would be strong. It was  our  time and we  had  to take  this champi- \nonship; otherwise it was  not  going to be ours, and Honda would have had \na ten-plus year winning streak.

It \nwas  my childhood dream to be able  to win  it in the  500  class, during the \nera  when the  bikes were extremely difficult to  ride. It was  everything I \nwanted. The  power-to-weight ratio of those bikes and  the  precision you \nhad  to  have—there was  nothing even close. One tiny little mistake on  a \n500  and  you  fell  down. From a rider’s standpoint, the  [four-stroke 990s \nthat  made up the  MotoGP class from 2002 through 2006] were probably \nthe most fun.  But  for very precise riding, there was  nothing like  a 500  on \n17-inch tires. There was  nothing even close. \nSete Gibernau, who joined Suzuki in  2001 for  that final year of the \n500cc class, agrees. “The 500s were something special. You  really needed \nto \nunderstand \nthe \nbike; \nyou \nreally \nhad \nto \nadapt \nyourself \nto \nwin \nwith \na \n500. \nIf you  didn't, you  would never win.” \nHARD LANDING \nUnfortunately, \nthe \n2001 \nseason \nwould \nbe \na \ndisappointing \none  \nfor \nRoberts \nand  \nGibernau. \nAny \nhopes \nthat \nKenny \nJr. \nmight \nbe  \nable \nto  \nfollow \nin  \nhis \nfather’s \nfootsteps \nas  \na \nrepeat \nchampion \nwere \nsoon \ndashed \nby \nthe \nmight \nof"

Five DNFs would \ncontribute to  a miserable eleventh-place finish in the  standings, with his \nteammate Gibernau in ninth. The  season's highlight was  Gibernau’s win \nand Roberts’ third place in  the  wet  at  Valencia.

It was just \nridiculous—no breeze, no  time to  rest  on  this  track; it was  just sick. I \njust wanted that  race done. Chris [Vermeulen, Roberts’ replacement \nat  Suzuki] passed me  going into the  last  turn of the  first  lap, and  I \nremember thinking, “If you want to lead, dude, go ahead, because it’s \nway too  f**king hot  to  be  fighting for  the  lead on  the  first  lap.” He \ntook off and  atomized the  fuel  on  the  Suzuki about three-quarters \nof the way  through, so  we  passed him.

Kurtis \nwas  unable to achieve anything better than his older brother in the way of \nresults—the highlight of his 2007 season was  a twelfth at the Sachsenring, \nfollowed by DNFs in  four of the  final eight GPs. Unable to  secure suffi- \ncient sponsorship, Team KR  closed its  doors before the  start of  the \n2008 season. \nKenny Roberts Jr.,  for  one, was  not  a  fan  of the  800cc bikes and  the \nsports heavy reliance on  electronics. And he will  tell  you  so  in  the  blunt \nmanner made famous by his father. “That's what MotoGP is like  now. You \nride  out  of your mind and  out  of your bike's ability to finish fourteenth. If \nyou  don't have the  best electronics package or  the  best engine mapping, \nthat’s where you  are  at.  It’s not  a riding style that  makes sense. It’s a riding \nstyle that’s all about corner speed.” \nSete Gibernau, who returned to  the  sport briefly in  2009, has  similar \nopinions about the  sport’s current fascination with high-tech: \nWith the  800s, I'm  just  trying to  get  them to... think [laughs].

That was  his whole focus, \nand  that was  his  everything. There was no,  ‘I’ve got  to  hurry and go  to \ndinner, or  things like that.” \nThis grit and determination are  driven by an  intense competitiveness \nthat  belies Hayden's easy smile and  charm. “He hates to  lose more than \nanybody I’ve ever known,’ says  his older brother, Tommy. These qualities \ncarried Nicky Hayden from the  small town of Owensboro, Kentucky, \nto  the  world stage of MotoGP, where the  riding skills range between \ngifted and  surreal.

I said, “I think you're about three or  four \nyears late.” They looked at me  like  I was  crazy. \nNicky’s development was  surely accelerated by the fact that  he had  to try \nto keep up with Tommy, who was  three years his senior. The older brother \nrecalls the many hours they spent racing on  their backyard track: \nThat’s where we  really started riding; we  still ride there a lot to this day. \nWe've had a lot of good races there, had a lot of fun, and learned a lot. \nLooking at  the  videos from back then, not  much has  changed really \nfrom fifteen years ago.

It was more, “Let's see  what this  Superbike thing is all  about, \nget one  under my butt and  see.” In the other classes, he was  definitely \nriding fiery. But  Honda's thinking was, “Let’s throw one  more class at \nhim.’ So  he  was  riding three classes on  three different motorcycles. \nI think that  was  very difficult. \nEven as  a teenager, Nicky put his signature riding style on  full display. His \nskill at  backing the  bike into corners was a result of his  years of racing \non  dirt  ovals. “He's definitely a  rear-steerer, no  question about it;  says \nLudington. “But that  was  how you  had  to  steer them [in those days], as \nyou didnt have traction control. If you wanted to  finish the  corner— \nparticularly on  a Honda in that day and  age—you had  to  rear  steer it, as \nthe bikes weren't known for their brilliant cornering capabilities.” \n“Nicky likes to  slide the  bike around,’ says John Hopkins. “He  does \nthat more than any of the other riders.” \nAs if graduating from high school and racing in three different classes \nwasnt enough for  Nicky, in  1999 he  also competed in  Grand National \nevents (winning a half-mile dirt  track race and  taking dirt  track racing's \nRookie of the  Year award) and was named AMA Athlete of the  Year.

The 23-year-old managed to escape the off-season \nhousecleaning (unlike Barros, who was replaced by Max Biaggi), but he \nknew that  he needed to  show marked improvement in  2005 in  order to \nkeep his factory Honda ride. \nHayden \nrecalls \nthat \nthe  \nseason \ndid  \nnot  \nstart \non  \na  \npromising \nnote: \n“In \nthe  \nfirst \nrace \nat  \nJerez, \nI \ncrashed \nout  \nwhen \nI \nwas \nrunning \nthird \nwith \na  \nfew \nlaps \nto \ngo.” \nThe \nseason \nwould \nturn \nout  \nto \nbe \na \nchampionship \nbattle \nbetween \nRossi \nand  \nGibernau. \nBut  \nHayden \nshowed \nsteady \nimprovement \nas  \nthe \nyear \nwent \non.  \n“We \nkind \nof \nhad \na \nslow \nstart \ngoing, \nbut  \nI \nhad  \nbasically \na \nwhole \nnew \nteam. \nAbout \nmidseason, \nabout \nthe \ntime \nwe \ngot \nto \nAssen \nand \njust \nbefore \nLaguna, things started to come together”"

Hayden’s new teammate would start \nout  the season by throwing down the gauntlet for team supremacy with a \nsecond-place finish at the  Spanish Grand Prix at  Jerez. Three races later, \nthe ambitious Spaniard snatched his maiden MotoGP win with a stunning \nperformance at  the  Chinese Grand Prix at  Shanghai. It was clear that \nHayden was matched up against his strongest teammate since Rossi. And \nwith Yamaha's superstar struggling with some uncharacteristic DNFs to \nstart the  season, it began to  look like  Hayden's biggest rival for  the  title \nmight be coming from across his own garage. However, the now-seasoned \nHayden was  up to the task, scoring seven podiums in the  first  eight races \nto  take a  42-point lead over Pedrosa. “In  racing you need to  be  good, \nbut  you need a  bit  of luck too,” Hayden says. “And that year—early in \nthe  season especially—it seemed like  we  were always in  the  right place \nat the right time and  took advantage of every opportunity.” \nThat eighth race of  the season, the  Dutch TT  at  Assen, would be one \nof \nthe \ndefining \nmoments \nof \nHayden's \n2006 \ncampaign. \nThe \ncontest \nwould \ncome \ndown \nto \nan \nepic \nlast-lap \nbattle \nbetween \nHayden \nand \nfellow \nAmerican \nColin \nEdwards. \nIn \none \nof \nthe \nwildest \nconclusions \nto \na \nrace \nin \nyears, \nthe \ntwo \nclashed \non \nthe \nfinal \nchicane: \nWhen \nthe \ndust \ncleared, \nonly \none \nman \nwas \nleft \non \nthe \ntrack—Nicky \nHayden. \n“That \nwas \nmy \none \nand \nonly \nwin \noutside \nof \nhome \nsoil,” \nhe \nrecalls. \nThose \nearly-season \npoints \nwould \nprove \ncrucial \nas \nthe  \nseason \nwore \non,  \nbecause \nRossi \nand \nYamaha \nwere \nfinding \nthe \nmagic \nonce \nagain."

Meanwhile, Rossi struggled through the \nweekend, qualifying tenth. In  the  brutal heat described so  vividly by \nRoberts Jr. in the previous chapter, Hayden made a strong start, launching \nstraight into  third; he then proceeded to work his way up into  the lead by \nmid-race on  his way to a win  over teammate Pedrosa. Meanwhile, a huge \nroar came up  through the  crowd as  smoke was  seen pouring from the \nRossi Yamaha with only a few laps remaining, the DNF a fitting result for \na difficult weekend. \nThe 25  points earned for  the  victory allowed Hayden and Honda \nto  go  into the  summer break with a  big points lead.

But  at  least a \npair of miserable finishes by Pedrosa had  knocked the  Spaniard down to \nfifth  place, 34 points behind Hayden and  making his title  chances remote \nat best. Yet, despite the pressure coming from all sides, all Hayden needed \nto  do  was  finish strong: A pair of good finishes would likely earn him \nthe  title. But  then it all  came undone in  the  most unimaginable way in \nEstoril, Portugal. \nFor the previous two seasons, Honda had lost the World Championship \nto  Rossi and  Yamaha.

He  qualified fourth, just one  half-second off the  pace of pole-sitter \nValentino Rossi. It was  a  stellar performance, especially considering the \nfact that  Hayden was  still  hobbling around the pits on  crutches. \nIt was  intriguing to watch Nicky back the  Honda into  the  turns, with \nhis tail out, employing the flat track style from his 990cc days. In this more \nadvanced era  of electronic engine management systems, it was  clear that \na rider still  had  the  ability to  adjust the  bike to  suit  his  individual riding \nstyle. “You can adjust your engine management to  adjust however much \nengine braking that  you  want,’ says John Hopkins. “But nobody else  is \ndoing that; nobody else  is sliding around that  much.” \nItalian \nAndrea \nDovizioso, \nwho \nrode \nfor  \nthe \nJiR \nTeam \nScot \nHonda \nsatellite \nteam \nin \n2008 \nand  \nwent \non  \nto  \nreplace \nHayden \nat \nRepsol \nHonda \nin \n2009, compares his riding style to Nicky's: \nThere \nis \na \nvery \nbig \ndifference. \nHe \ncomes \nfrom \nSuperbike, \nI \nthink, \nand \nhis \nstyle \nis \ndirty \non \nthe \nentry \nand \nthe \nexit. \nWith \nthe \n250, \nyou \ncannot \nride \ndirty; \nalso \nwithout \nengine \nbraking, \nyou \ncannot \nslide \non \nthe \nengine. \n[The \nEuropean] \nstyle \nis \nthat \nyou  \ndon't \nslide, \nand  \nI \nthink \n[that \nstyle \nfits]"

But  that’s part of it, and  it’s  the  same for  everyone. Nick \nrealizes that if you  want to  race Grand Prix you  race 800s, and  he's \ntrying to  make it happen. \nThe  first motorcycle races at  Indianapolis Motor Speedway in  1909 had \nbeen an  unmitigated disaster, the abysmal track conditions causing nearly \nall  the  riders to  refuse to  take part.

There were plenty of rumors and lots of speculation about \nwhere the American was  going to wind up in 2009, including hints that he \nwould switch to  the  World Superbike series. But  the  majority of rumors \nlinked Hayden to  Ducati, and  soon after the  Indy GP,  the announcement \nwas  made that  Nicky Hayden would join the  Italian team as  teammate to \nCasey Stoner. \nThe  Ducati ride  was  a huge gamble. On  the one  hand, the  Desmodici \nwas  clearly one  of the  fastest bikes of the  800cc era;  Stoner had  demon- \nstrated that by running away with the title  in 2007. But on  the other hand, \nonly Stoner seemed capable of taming the  beast. Loris Capirossi had \nmanaged to show occasional flashes of brilliance on  the bike in 2007, but \nnot  enough to keep his ride  in 2008. Marco Melandri, Capirossi’s replace- \nment at Ducati, was  completely confounded by the  bike. He  finished the \n2008 season 17th in points, 15 places behind Stoner. \nHayden was  not  oblivious to the struggles of his predecessors: “I knew \nthat  was  a risk  I was  taking when I signed the  deal. I felt like  it was  a risk \nworth taking. The  bike has  potential if you  can  find it.  I realized it was \na  risky move, but  I felt  like  if I ever wanted to  win races and  be  world \nchampion again, I had  to be willing to  take that  risk.” \nNo \ndoubt \nbuoyed \nby \nhopes \nfor \nthe \nfuture, \nHayden \nmade \na \nstrong \nfinish \nto \n2008, \nclosing \nout \nhis \nRepsol \nHonda \ncareer \nwith \nfive \ntop-five \nfinishes, \nincluding \na \nthird \nplace \nin \nAustralia. \nIn \nso \ndoing, \nhe \nmoved \nahead \nof \nEdwards \nin \nthe \npoints \nto take sixth \nin \nthe championship. \nHaving \nstarted \nhis  \nMotoGP \ncareer \nas  \nteammate \nto  \nValentino \nRossi, \nHayden \nwas  \nno  \nstranger \nto  \nsharing \na  \ngarage \nwith \nan  \nintimidating \nworld"

There is no question of them working hard, and that means \na lot to Nick to keep him motivated. He's trying hard, giving his best every \nlap. Usually that prevails. They are making huge steps, but it hasn't been an \novernight thing. It’s  a competitive series. \nBy the  time the  circus reached Circuit Catalunya in  June, Nicky was \nstarting to  turn things around. After a  great deal of effort and  extensive \nmodifications to  the  machine and electronics package, he  finished a \nfighting 10th in the  race. This was  his best result of the year, giving him \nsome momentum going forward to two  of his favorite venues, Assen and \nLaguna Seca. \nThe  upward swing continued at Assen, with Hayden finishing eighth. \nReturning home to  Laguna, Nicky recovered from a  lowside crash in \npractice \nto \ntake \na \nseason-best \nfifth \nin \nthe \nrace. \nAlthough \npleased \nwith \nthe \nimprovement, \nHayden \nmade \nit \nclear \nthat \nhe \nwas \nnot \nsatisfied: \n“There \nis \nstill \na \nbig \ngap \nbetween \nme \nand \nthe \nfront. \nI \nknow \nthat. \nI've \ngot \nhigher \nexpectations \nthan \nthis; \nI’m \nnot \nthrilled \nabout \nan \neighth \nplace \nor \na \nfifth- \nplace \nresult. \nI \nknow \nI \nam \ncapable \nof \nmore \nand \nthe \nbike \ncan \ndo \nmore, \nas \ncan \nthe \nteam. \nBut \nit \nfeels \ngood \nto \nfinally \nhave \nsome \nmomentum \nand \nto \nhave \nthe \nteam \nstart \nto \nunderstand \nme \nbetter. \nI \nreally \nhope \nI’m \non \nmy \nway; \nI’m \na \nmomentum \nguy \nand \nI \nneeded \nsome \ndecent \nresults.’ \n19]"

It was  amazing, a  cheap \nway to get into  racing, and the bikes were reliable and fast. I remember \ngetting third at Laguna that year behind Roberts and Baker, who were \nprobably on  OW-31s. \nThat \nchampionship \nseason \nincluded \nBaldwin's \nfirst \nwin  \nin  \nthe  \nFormula \nOne \nclass \nat \nSears \nPoint. \nHe \nrecalls \nthat \nmemorable \nevent: \nAt \nSears \nPoint, \nI \nwas  \nbehind \nSkip \nAksland \ncoming \ndown \nthe \ncarousel, \nand  \nhe  \ngot  \nsideways \nand  \ngot  \nhigh-sided \noff \nthe  \nbike. \nHe  \nhad  \nsuch \na \ntight \ngrip \non \nthe \nthrottle \nthat \nit \ncame \noff \nthe \nbar, \nand \nall \nfour \ncarbs \nwere \nattached \nto \nthe \nthrottle \nand \ncame \noff \nthe \nbike. \nAll \nof \nthis \nstuff \nwas \ngoing \ndown \nthe \ntrack \nlike \nfootballs \nleft \nand \nright. \nI \nhit \none \nof \nthe \n197"

His  debut was \nmemorable, but  not  for good reasons: “Kawasaki had  been trying to  get \nme  to ride  it in Formula One, but  I said  no  way to a four-stroke; it had  to \nbe a two-stroke.

Randy struck first, winning the  season opener \nat  the  Salzburgring in  Austria. After Roberts won the  next two races, \nLucchinelli posted his  first  win. Mamola answered with another victory \nof his own at Opatija, Yugoslavia. But Mamola’s championship hopes soon \nwithered under Lucchinelli’s onslaught. The  Italian won four of the  next \nfive  races on  his  way to  the  title; Mamola ended the  season in  second \nplace once again, 11 points behind the leader. It was  a disappointing result, \nbut Randy was  still just 21  years old,  and  most observers felt  it was  just a \nmatter of time before he broke through. \nYet  1982 belonged to Franco Uncini (Mamola finished sixth), and  1983 \nwas the  epic battle between Roberts and Spencer (Mamola took third). \nThe following years brought a  switch to  Honda.

I won races on  it, whether it was  in the rain \nor  in  the  dry, but  I just  didn’t get  along with it.  It always felt  like  it \nhad a really big rear  and a really narrow front. On  the  other hand, \nthe  four-cylinder felt  completely the  opposite; it had  a  much more \nstable front end.

His  first season \nwith the  team brought seconds at  Imola, Yugoslavia, Assen, and  France, \nalong with a win  at the  Belgian GP  at Spa. However, the  entire rest  of the \nseason was  won by either Wayne Gardner or  Eddie Lawson, and  Mamola \nhad  to  settle for third behind the  dominant pair. More importantly, that \nwas also the  year that Randy became involved with the  global charity \nprogram Save the  Children.

Mamola finished the season with a \ncareer worst 12th place in the standings. There was  one highlight, however: \na sole podium at one  of his favorite tracks, Spa-Francorchamps, following \nhome Gardner and  Lawson. He  also managed a  decent finish at  Rijeka, \nYugoslavia, taking fourth. \nThe  struggles of  1988 would seem easy compared to  the  disaster of \n1989. A seventh place at  Rijeka would be his  best result on  his way  to  a \ndismal 18th place in  the  standings.

He hit him  right in the jaw.” \nShobert continues the story: \nSo [had the opportunity to do the road racing because I got suspended \nfor nine races. When I came back from that, I was  way down in points. \nThe  only way to pick up some extra points would be to do some road \nraces. It turned out  Honda had an  extra Superbike with an  850 engine \nthat  they couldn't run  in the Superbike class. Honda asked if I wanted \nto  run  the  bike so  I could get some extra points. I said, “Sure, I'll try \nsome road races.” What did  I have to  lose? It was  the  Formula One \nclass where the  guys were running 500s, and I won Mid-Ohio in \nthe rain. \nIt would be difficult to  overestimate what a  remarkable achievement this \nwas. Racing an  850cc Superbike he  had never ridden before, in  his  first \nrace on  pavement, in  the rain, Shobert won. “It wasn’t nothin’ new  to me, \nsliding around corners,” he says, nonchalantly. “Of course, I was  riding a \nfour-stroke and  90 percent of the field was  riding two-strokes.” \nBubba Shobert had claimed his first road racing win, and the flat track \nsuperstar now had  a new frontier to  conquer.

Being a  close friend, he always \ngave me  lots of insights that they don't give to other riders these days.’ \nThe  25-year-old Texan would make his  international debut that year \nin the Transatlantic Match Races. It was  a brief appearance: “I was  on  the \nteam, but I crashed in the first  race.” \nThe epic Rainey-Schwantz duel that made up the  1987 AMA Superbike \nseason has  been covered earlier in  the  book. But  it should be noted that \nShobert was  the only other rider to win  an  AMA Superbike race  that year, \nthe  round at  Laguna Seca. On  the  dirt  track side, Shobert made it three \nGrand National Championships in a row. \nWith Schwantz and Rainey moving on  to the World Championship for \n1988, Shobert'’s key rival for the AMA Superbike title would be newcomer \nDoug Polen on  the  Yoshimura Suzuki. Shobert describes the  season \nopener at  Daytona: “I  took off on  the  warmup lap and  halfway around, \nmy bike quit in the  infield.

In fact, every race  that  season (with the exception \nof Daytona, where Schwantz had  won) would be won by either Shobert \nor  Polen. The  duel between the  two  Texans included plenty of drama. \nShobert explains what happened at Mid-Ohio: \nSunday morning in practice, I got off the bike and  demolished it; the \nframe was  wrecked. They had a rule that you couldn’ use a spare bike, \nand  I had  a spare bike but we  couldn't use  it. The  AMA watched my \nmechanics disassemble my  spare bike down to  parts and  put it back \ntogether. It was  the  only way I could use  it.  I was  following Polen on \nthe  last  lap,  and  when he  came around a corner, a  lapper took him \noff the  track. So we  won that  race, and that  was a big one. \nIn the  end, Shobert managed to  squeak by with the  title  by a  mere four \npoints over Polen, a victory that helped to soften the blow of losing out  on \nthe Grand National title. \nMeanwhile, Shobert made his World Championship debut that season \nin a one-off ride in the 250cc class at Laguna Seca. “I qualified like sixteenth \nand  led the  first  lap.” Shobert recalls. “I ended up  in fifth.” It was  a  stag- \ngering \nGP \ndebut \nfor \nsomebody \nriding \nunfamiliar \nmachinery, \nsuggesting \nthat \nShobert \nwas \nready \nto \nfollow \nin \nthe \nfootsteps \nof \nthe \nmany \nAmericans \nwho had found Grand Prix success. \nWhat Might Have Been \nFor \n1989, \nhe \nsigned \nfor \nHonda \nto \nrace \nin \n500cc \nGrand \nPrix. \n“I \ndidn’t \nwant \nto  \ncontinue \nracing \nover \nhere,’ \nShobert \nexplains. \n“And \nthat  \nwas  \nthe  \nyear \n213"

I kind of got hooked and started racing \nwhen I was  five  on  a Honda Trail 50.” \nHe  would quickly rise  through the  ranks up  to  the  Grand National \nChampionship series: “I won my  first  National on  an  Illinois short track \nand  missed being the youngest rider ever to win  by about a week.’ Doug \nwas  on a vertical career path, and in 1983, at just 18 years of age, he capped \noff \nhis  \nfirst  \nfull  \nprofessional \nracing \nseason \nwith \nthe  \nAMA \nRookie \nof \nthe \nYear award. \nRoad Racer \n“At \nthat \ntime, \nI \nwasn’t \neven \nlooking \nat \nthe \nroad \nrace \nstuff,’ \nChandler \nexplains. \n“I \nwanted \nto \nbe \nGrand \nNational \nChampion. \nThe \nfollowing \nyear, \nwe \ngot \npicked"

In flat  track, we  had  Harley dominating with Honda \ntrying to get in there; they were the only two. At road races there were \na lot more, so  I thought this was  something I could try, with what was \ngoing on  over in Europe with World Championships. \nChandler would spend the 1984 through 1988 seasons competing in both flat \ntrack and road racing. Among the highlights of those years were five Grand \nNational wins in 1986 and  1987; he would finish third in the standings both \nyears. In  1988, he took his  first  road racing win, in the  Pro-Twins class at \nMid-Ohio. The  feat  earned him a  spot in AMA history as  the  fourth and \nmost recent rider to  achieve the  AMA Grand Slam (in  1989), the  others \nbeing Dick Mann, Kenny Roberts, and Bubba Shobert. \nAfter finishing the  1988 AMA Superbike season third in points behind \nShobert and Polen, Chandler decided to shift his emphasis from dirt track \nto road racing. He says, “1989 was  the first year that  I put road racing over \nflat track. Kawasaki was  going to come out  with a new 750  Superbike, and \nRob  Muzzy was  going to do a team. So we  did a deal.” \n“We \nhad  \ndone \na  \nreal  \nminor \nlittle \nthing \nwith \nKawasaki \nin  \n1988. \nMuzzy \nexplains. \n“It  \nwas  \na  \n500cc \nsingle \ndirt  \ntrack \nbike \nthat  \nRicky \nGraham \nrode \nat \nDaytona \nand \nthe \nshort \ntrack, \nand  \na \n750  \nthat  \nwas  \nbased \non  \nthe \nwater-cooled \nNinja. \nThey \ncame \nout  \nwith \na \nnew  \nbike, \nso  \nin \n1989 \nwe  \ntook \nthat \nnew  \nbike \nand \nhired \nChandler” \n“The \n1989 \nseason \nstarted \noff \na  \nlittle \nrough,” \nChandler \nrecalls. \n“It \nwas \na \nnew  \nbike, \nnew  \nteam. \nBut  \nwe  \nfinished \nstrong \nand  \nwon \nthe \nlast \ntwo  \nraces"

As  chronicled in  the  Schwantz chapter, \nChandler was  able to make a big contribution to the team, especially when \nit came to  developing the  bike. “I thought it was  a  pretty good bike,” he \nsays of the RGV500. “Those bikes were either the best bikes you  ever rode \nor  the  worst, and  it really depended on  how you  had  the  bike set  up  for \nyourself as  a rider. There wasn't any in-between. You  were good or  bad.” \nChandler credits his  good friend Wayne Rainey with teaching him \nabout the sport's technical side: \nData acquisition was  just starting to  come on  board. I would get on \nthe  computer with Wayne and  just look at  our  traces—front suspen- \nsion, rear suspension. To  me,  I never felt  like  I was  the  fastest guy \nout  there.

And Chandler had  played a  major role  in  developing the  bike \nthat Schwantz rode to  the  1993 World Championship. Sadly, Chandler \nwould not  reap the  rewards of his development work. Instead, he moved \non  to Cagiva for 1993: \nThat was  a  tough decision. It was one  of those things. In  the  GPs, \nyou  had  riders willing to  go  over there for  basically no  pay, just to \nget the opportunity to  ride. You  are  going over there and  are  making \nNO  money, putting yourself at  risk  of getting hurt. Kevin was  their \ntop guy,  and  they had  no  more money for anybody else.

One thing \nthat  impressed me  is that  Hopkins was  so  focused; he could truly dial \neverything out  and  really focus on  the  bike, the  track, and  the  race. \nJohn Ulrich was a friend of the  MotoGP team owner that Hopkins \nwent to  [Peter Clifford], and  he asked about young kids coming up. \nUlrich told him, “Hey, I’ve got one  for you now.’ Connections and luck \nwith the timing played a huge role  for both of those guys. \nHopkins’ final AMA race  was  memorable and helped serve as  his spring- \nboard \nonto \nthe \nworld \nstage. \n“The \nFormula \nXtreme \ntitle \nwas \nup \nfor \ngrabs,” \nKeith Perry recalls: \nIn  \nthe  \nrace, \na  \nbolt  \nbroke \non  \nabout \nlap \nthree, \nand  \nJohn \nlost  \nmaybe \na \nsecond \nand \na \nhalf \nfor \na \nlap \nor \ntwo, \nbefore \nhe \nlearned \nhow \nto \nride \nthe \nthing \nwith \nthe \ntop \ntriple \ntree \nnot \neven \nconnected \nto \nthe \nsteering \nstem. \nThere \nwas  \na  \n30mm \ngap  \nbetween \nthe  \nsteering \nstem \nand  \nthe  \ntop  \ntriple"

The bikes are  built completely around these tiny \nguys.

Between that, and  with the  electronics, there is no  movement \non  the  machine; they've taken a hell  of a  lot of  the fun  out  of riding \nthe bikes. I think every rider on  the  MotoGP grid would agree that \nWorld Superbike would be more fun  from the rider’s point of view. \nUnfortunately, 2009 would be another tough year. A shattering accident at \nAssen in his second event with the team left Hopkins with a dislocated hip. \nHe  returned a  few  months later to  race at  Donington, where he  finished \na fighting eighth. But  a few weeks later, he was  run  over in  a crash at  the \nNurburgring, suffering a brain injury that  was  at first  undiagnosed.

His \nfamily would eventually settle in Texas, and Doug would be one  of several \nriders from the Lone Star State to take the racing world by storm in the late \n1980s and  early 1990s. In  1987, he would compete full-time in the AMA \nSuperbike class and  finish an  impressive fourth in points behind Rainey, \nSchwantz, and Shobert. He would also win the 600  Supersport title on  the \nstrength of eight victories out  of nine races. \nFor  1988, Polen switched to  Suzuki. He  would be the  busiest guy  in \nthe  pit lane that season, riding in  600  Supersport, 750  Supersport, and \nSuperbike. In  the  top  class, he  would fall  short in  a  season-long battle \nwith fellow Texan Bubba Shobert.

Their most memorable confrontation came at \nDaytona in 1992. For 200  miles, the pair battled on  the track and in the pits \nin a race of speed and strategy. Russell knew he had a top speed advantage \nover Polen, but he never showed his hand until he made a surprise move \nto  slingshot past Polen on  the  run  to  the  finish. Polen was  denied the \nDaytona win  he coveted, and  Ducati has yet to win  the  Daytona 200. \nFor 1993, Polen narrowed his  focus to  the  AMA Superbike series. \nLarry Ferracci recalls the  Texan's AMA championship season: “When he \ngot on  the bike, he got it done. He was  at a career point where everything \njelled for him; he had  total focus, everything was  racing. Hed had  such a \nrun  with the  World Championships, he was  relaxed and  focused.” Polen \nwon six  of the  first  eight races on  his  way  to joining Fred Merkel as  the \nwinner of both AMA Superbike and World Superbike championships. \nPolen returned to the world stage in  1994, that time riding on  Honda's \nRC45. It was  not  to  be  a  successful move, and  Polen finished the  season \nwithout a  win but  pulled out  an  impressive fourth in  points. Doug \nreturned to  race  in America and eventually moved on  to success in World \nEndurance racing, becoming the  World Endurance Champion in  1997 at \nthe age of 37.  Doug Polen continues to race. He is a regular in the MotoST \nseries \nand \noccasionally \nmakes \nforays \ninto \nAMA \nSuperbike. \nIn \n2009, \nthe \n48-year-old finished 13th at Road America in the Superbike class. \nSCOTT RUSSELL \nRaymond \nScott \nRussell \nwas  \nborn \nin  \nEast \nPoint, \nGeorgia, \non  \nOctober \n28, \n1964. \nHe \nstarted \nfrom \nhumble \nbeginnings. \nAfter \nhigh \nschool, \nhe \nworked \nlong \nhours \nina \ntrash \nbag \nassembly \nplant. \nIn \n1985, \nRussell \nattended \nDaytona \nBike \nWeek \nas \na \nspectator. \nThere \nhe \nwatched \nFreddie \nSpencer \ndominate \nthe \nweek \nas \nnobody \nhas \nbefore \nor \nsince, \nsweeping \nSuperbike, \n250 \nGP, \nand \n237"

In  1992, Russell won the Daytona 200, \nconsidered by many to be the greatest 200  ever. \nRussell’s crew chief, Rob Muzzy, recalls the  race: “We knew through \ntire  testing and practice that if we  were within drafting distance on \nthe  last lap, we  could pass him. But  we  didn't want [Polen] to  know that. \nSo, the entire weekend, if Scott was  near Doug, he would never pass him \non  the straightaway.” It turned out  that Polen had been holding something \nin reserve as  well, as  Russell explains: “I was  just sitting on  him, thinking \nI've got this in the bag, waiting for the race  to be over. As it turned out,  on \nthe  last lap coming through the  chicane, he came out  of there a lot faster \nthan he had the whole race.

John had a little flaw in  his \nmakeup on corner speed, and he couldn't overcome that. He was always \nrushing, and  Wayne never had that. John, in another era,  would have \nbeen a 500cc world champion, but  not  against Rainey. You're talking \nabout fractions of an  inch. He wasn’t going to beat Wayne. \nKocinski moved on  to Suzuki for  1993, but in 250cc, not the premier class. \nIf the 25-year-old was  expecting a more benevolent scenario at Suzuki, \nhe was  disappointed, as  he would soon draw the ire of the team’s top-class \nsuperstar, Kevin Schwantz: \nHe  |Kocinski] was  a lot like Cadalora [known as The Enigma]. If he had \neverything right between his ears, you would struggle to see  which way \nhe went. Knock on  wood, it didn’t happen very often. He  was  one  of \nthose guys who was  pretty erratic; hed win  one  race, then wouldn't be \nin the top six  the  next three races. I made the mistake that  I thought I \ncould be John’s teammate for 1993, and they put him on  the Suzuki 250. \nWe were on  the same team, but he wasn't riding the 500.  Once I got to \nknow a little bit more about him  from what he did, how he tested, and \nwhat he was  like  from a behind-the-scenes viewpoint, I couldn't stand \nhim.

It all worked out  good, for three years.” \nThere was never any  doubt who was  the  number one  rider on  the \nteam, a fact that  Edwards accepted in his typical amiable fashion: “I knew \nmy place in the team. I knew where the  money was  spent, and  mine was \npurely a supporting role. But I still was  riding my ass  off; I was  still trying \nto  win  every race. But  yeah, if Valentino was  near, Id give him another \ninch or  two  [laughs]. It was  good, he was  great, and  I enjoyed it.” \nThe admiration is mutual, as  Rossi explains: \nAh! Racing with Colin was always fun  and we  are  great, great \nfriends. He  could always make me  laugh and  we  had some good \nparties! We  would talk a  lot  together about the  setting, tires, and \nthings, and we  always tried to help each other. My favorite memory is \nmaybe Laguna 2005, both [of our  Yamahas painted] in yellow for the \nanniversary, and Colin passes me  into  the corkscrew. On the final lap, \nI was  close enough to try, but then I thought of two  yellow bikes in the \ndirt  and  thought “better not!” Colin was  very determined! \nRossi was referring to  the  USGP at  Laguna Seca, where Yamaha had \npainted \nthe \nfactory \nbikes \nin \nthe \nyellow \nand \nblack \nbumblebee \npaint \nscheme \nas \na \ntribute \nto \nthe \n1970s \nU.S. \nteam \nand \nKenny \nRoberts. \nEdwards \nwould \nfinish \nsecond \nin \nthe \nrace, \nbehind \nHayden \nand \nin \nfront \nof \nRossi. \nThe \nTexan \nwould \nend \nup \nwith \nthree \npodiums \non \nthe \nseason—not \nthe \nresults \nhe \nhad \nhoped \nfor. \nBut \nhis \nfourth-place \nfinish \nin \nthe \nstandings \nis \nstill \nhis \nbest \nthrough the 2009 season. \n208"

For  Edwards, \n2007 went much like  the  previous two  seasons, with flashes of brilliance \nand speed but only a pair of podiums and another midpack championship \nfinish, that time in ninth. \nEdwards prefers the 800s over the 990s: \nI think the  800s more suit  my  style to  be honest. I’ve  always been a \nfront-end guy,  kind of a  250-style, sweeping style.

However, his  experience did  not  include dirt ovals or \nmotocross: “I rode dirt  bikes, but  I didn’t race them.

Even more so,  he’s  very smart with \nbike setup. Racing him changed a lot  of how I race and how I \ndeal with people, and racing against him I think it  brought my \ntalent out quicker than later. He  had never had anybody beat \nhim on  the  same motorcycle; it was  hard for  him. But  he  stepped \nup  and started training like crazy and stepped up  his  speed. The \nfastest he’s  ever been was when we  raced each other, and  I think \nhe  will admit that. The last three years he’d made a big  step, \nand  he made me  push just as  hard.

      "text": "THE WORLD SUPERBIKE CHAMPIONS \nShowing \nimpressive \nmaturity, \nSpies \nbounced \nback \nto \nwin \nrace \ntwo: \nFor race two  we  made some changes, put a rain  map in the bike with a \nlittle less power and better fuel economy. I told [my team] that  I know \nwe  have the  pace to  win; this  weekend we  were the  strongest. I'll sit \nbehind [the  Ducatis] and  then with five  laps left  I'll go.  I got a  good \nstart and  got to  the lead in turn three. I was  going to put together two \nhard laps to separate everybody, so that whoever was  going to go, I'd get \nbehind them and just stay there and  get everybody sorted out a little \nbit.  I came around and  by lap two  I had  one  and a half seconds. With \neight to go I had it up to six seconds and  flipped it to the rain  map... \nabout 2000 rpm lower. \nBen  Spies’ WSB racecraft matched his sheer speed. \nFor years the Yamaha had always been a contender, the eternal brides- \nmaid. “Always close,’ says Meregalli. “What we  realize now is that you \ncan  never give up  until you  win  the  title. Honestly, at  the  beginning of \nthe  Monza weekend I was not expecting this, but Ben said to  me, ‘Don't \nworry. I think the  gap  he showed in the  second race  was  because he was \npissed off”  Wise beyond his years, Spies wasn't showing his hand. \nThe ups and downs continued in round six at Kyalami in South Africa. \nAfter taking pole yet again, Spies finished third in race one, then posted \na  DNF in  race two. Meanwhile, Ducati’s Noriyuki Haga was  taking full \nadvantage of Spies’ misfortunes, racking up a formidable points lead. \nFor round seven, the series moved to Miller Motorsports Park in Utah. \nOn home soil and racing on  a familiar track, Spies shattered the competi- \ntion, taking his  seventh consecutive Superpole and  winning both races \nby significant margins while Haga finished ninth each time. The  result \nbrought Spies to  within 53  points of Haga—still a  huge gap, but  Colin \nEdwards had  been in a  similar situation behind Troy Bayliss in the  2002 \nWorld \nSuperbike \nChampionship. \n“I’ve \nheard \nthis \nstory,’ \nSpies \nsaid \nat \nthe \ntime. “I’m gonna try. I want to be like  Colin.” \n“About \nBen, \nI \ncan  \nonly \nspeak \nvery \nwell; \nMeregalli \nsaid \nat \nthe \ntime. \n“He \nis \nfast, \nand \nhe’s \na \nreally \ngood \nguy.  \nHe \nis \nonly \ntwenty-four \nyears \nold \nbut \ngoes \n207"

Spies made his fourth \nMotoGP appearance at  the  2009 season finale at  Valencia. Qualifying \nninth, he finished an  impressive seventh. \nIf the future brings Ben  Spies to the pinnacle of MotoGP glory, he will \nbe  the  latest in  a  long line  of American Grand Prix champions. Wayne \nRainey, for one, likes the  Texan's chances: “I’m thinking Ben  Spies could \nbe the next guy to put America back on  the  map,” Rainey told  the author \nearly in 2008. “He's somebody that’s got the speed to do it.” \nIt  is  a  safe bet  that World Superbike will continue to  provide the \nlaunching point for American careers into Europe, despite the continued \ncynicism of the  world when it comes to  the  United States as  a  training \nground \nfor \nfuture \ntalent. \nSteve \nMcLaughin \ntold \nthe \nauthor \nin \n2009 \nthat \nthe \nEuropean \nattitude \nhasn't \nchanged \nvery \nmuch \nover \nthe \nyears. \n“At \nAssen \nthe \nEuropeans \ncome \nup \nto \nme \nand \nsay, \n‘How \nis \nit \npossible \nthat \nBen \nSpies \ndoes \nso \nwell?’ \nThe \ntruth \nis \nthat \nthey've \nforgotten \nthat \nfive \nof \nthe \nfirst \nsix \nWorld \nSuperbike \nChampions \nwere \nAmericans. \nThe \ntruth \nis \nthat \nwe \nhave \nthe \nability \nto \nturn \nout \ngood \nriders, \nand \nif \nyou \nthink \nwe \ndon't, \nyoure \nstupid.” \nFuture \ngenerations \nof \nAmerican \nracers \nwill \nagain \ndrive \nhome \nthat  point."
