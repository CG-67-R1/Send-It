It  is  an  event  that  places  a  \nsmall island, situated in the heart of the Irish Sea, firmly on the world map. \nThe  Isle  of  Man  is  thirteen  and  a  half  miles  wide  and  32.5  miles  long,  \nhome to a population of approximately 80,000 people and is situated at the \nvery  heart  of  the  British  Isles,  but  despite  its  size  and  location  the  island  \nmaintains a distinctive and diverse sense of identity. It has its own unique \nsystem  of  government,  the  more  than  1000  years  old  Tynwald  assembly.  \nThere is a well-developed and internationally renowned heritage industry, \nan  established  film  industry  and,  of  course,  an  abundance  of  outstanding  \nnatural  beauty.  However,  if  you  were  to  ask  any  Briton,  European  or  \nindeed any world citizen if they know the location of the Isle of Man, you \nmight receive the reply “is that the home of the TT races?” or be met with \nquizzical   expressions.   This   might   be   an   exaggerated   claim,   but,   \nnonetheless,  over  the  past  100  years  or  so  the  Tourist  Trophy  (TT)  \nmotorcycle races, held annually on the Isle of Man, have helped this small \nisland stand out on the world map.  \nThe start of the summer on the Isle of Man is signaled by the roaring of \nthousands  of  motorcycles  disembarking  at  Douglas  harbour  from  one  of  \nthe  ferries  that  serve  the  island.  Coming  to  the  island  via  Liverpool  and  \nHeysham, motorcyclists travel from all corners of the world to make what \ncould be described as a pilgrimage to what they regard as one of the most \noutstanding  events  on  the  motorcycling  calendar.  Interest  in  participation  \nin  the  event  is  massive.  By  way  of  illustration,  in  1994  there  were  620  \nentries  in  eight  events  involving  572  competitors,  from  20  countries  \nranging  from  the  USA  to  New  Zealand.  Racers  completed  4,137  laps,  \ntotaling 156,089 miles in practicing and racing.\n1\n In 2007 the TT celebrated \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n  TT  media  pack  issued  by  the  Isle  of  Man  Department  of  Tourism  in  1995,  as  \ncited  in  R.  Faragher,  ‘Cultural  History:  Motor  Sport’  in  J.  Belchem  (ed.)  A  New  \nHistory of the Isle of Man Volume V: The Modern Period 1830-1999, (Liverpool, \nLiverpool University Press, 2000), pp.410-14. \n\nIntroduction \n \n2\nits  centenary  and  the  popularity  of  the  event  was  unabated,  with  an  \nestimated   60,000   people   visiting   the   Isle   of   Man   during   TT   week,   \ngenerating  revenue  of  £48,000,000.  As  the  Guardian stated  in  2005:  \n“every year 40,000 leather clad bikers make their pilgrimage to what they \ndescribe as the best festival of their sport. It is about celebrating fraternity \nand a way of life.”\n2\n \nThe Isle of Man TT course is composed of 37 and three quarter miles \nof  public  roads,  stretching  across  much  of  the  northern  half  of  the  island  \nand  passing  through  the  island’s  two  largest  towns,  Douglas  and  Ramsey  \nand  through  small,  sleepy  villages  like  Glen  Vine  and  Kirk  Michael.  The  \ncourse  has  long,  fast  straights  and  sharp  bends  flanked  by  stonewalls  or,  \non the mountain section, by sheer drops. The stern test of riding skill and \nsharpness  of  reflex  has,  to  date,  taken  the  lives  of  240  riders.  At  points  \naround  the  course  are  memorials  to  riders  who  have  made  their  name  at  \nthe  TT:  Birkin’s  bends,  Handley’s  corner,  and,  the  Guthrie  memorial.\n3\n \nThese  are  continued  reminders  of  the  immense  challenge  posed  by  the  \ncourse.  In  one  lap  the  competitors  will  pass  through  areas  of  outstanding  \nnatural  beauty,  past  sites  of  historic  interest  and  within  touching  distance  \nof  residents’  doorsteps  at  speeds  of  up  to  180  miles  per  hour,  in  front  of  \nspectators lining the hedgerows to witness the event. It is an event that like \nno  other,  places  the  modern  firmly  alongside  the  traditional.  The  riders’  \nultimate goal is to make it to the end of this historic course. At the time of \nwriting,   the   current   lap   speed   record   held   by   Morecambe’s   John   \nMcGuiness stands at 131.617 miles per hour (mph).  \nIt  might  be  considered  odd  that,  in  the  modern  day,  such  an  event  is  \npermitted  to  take  place.  But,  there  has  never  been  any  organised  protest  \nagainst the continuation of the TT races on the Isle of Man; or none that I \nhave  uncovered  during  the  course  of  my  research.  This  is  despite  the  \ninconvenience  caused  by  road  closures,  the  fatalities  in  the  event  and  the  \nracing  of  motorcycles  at  high  speeds  around  the  island’s  roads.  Another,  \nsimilar motorcycle race does take place in Northern Ireland but on a much \nsmaller  scale.  Similarly,  Formula  One  cars  also  race  annually  around  the  \nstreets of Monaco, and in France public roads are also closed for the Tour \nDe France Bicycle race. No event, however, is quite the same as the Isle of \nMan TT. The event presents an obvious inconvenience to Manx residents, \nbut  also  the  location  of  the  TT,  on  an  island  in  the  Irish  Sea,  remains  an  \ninconvenience for competitors and overseas spectators alike. Yet motorcycle \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n2\n Guardian, 4 June 2005. \n3\n  A  further,  and  more  extensive  discussion  of  memorialisation  at  the  TT  can  be  \nfound in: ‘The Island of Blood’: death and commemoration at the Isle of Man TT \nRaces, World Archaeology, Volume 4, Issue 2, 2012. \n\nThe Isle of Man Tourist Trophy Races \n \n3\nmanufacturers, motorcyclists and fans still travel to the Isle of Man every \nyear to compete in the event, watch the races and participate in the festival \nthat surrounds the TT. This is partly the result of the spectacle provided by \nthe  races,  but  also  perhaps  because  ordinary  riders,  not  competitors  as  \nsuch,  are  able  to  test  themselves  against  the  course  on  what  has  become  \npopularly  known  as  “Mad  Sunday”.  “Tomorrow  they  will  open  up  their  \nthrottles  and  ride  the  circuit  themselves  on  a  day  called  Mad  Sunday”,  \nobserved the Guardian, and “they do it in the full knowledge that it can be \ncarnage, with riders falling off all over the course.”\n4\n \nMoreover,  and  somewhat  remarkably,  the  TT  also  continues  despite  \nthe   deaths   and   injuries   caused   not   only   to   competitors   but   also   to   \nspectators  and  those  policing  the  course.  This  has  not  deterred  fans  from  \nturning   up   or   motorcycle   racers   from   entering   the   TT,   which   is   \nunsurprising when it is considered that one report from the 1970s claimed \nthat “all the competitors ... were fascinated by the race.” One rider declared \nthat the TT was “the finest road race in the world unconditionally”, whilst \na Yorkshire rider suggested more crudely that he rode in the race “because \nI’m  a  bloody  twat,  that’s  why.  It’s  self-inflicted  pissin’  torture.”\n5\n The \ndanger  inherent  in  the  event  appears  to  secure  the  TT’s  place  as  the  best  \nmotorcycle  race  in  the  world.  The  TT,  of  course,  still  draws  criticism.  A  \n2003 article in Sports Illustrated questioned the purpose of the event when \nit  asked  “is  there  a  sporting  event  more  perilous  than  the  Tourist  Trophy  \nraces in the Isle of Man?” It was vigorously stated, “this festival of speed \nis  how  boosters  on  this  tiny  Irish  Sea  island  bill  its  mad  scramble  of  \nmopeds,  motorcycles  and  motor  scooters.  Dead  is  how  participants  often  \nwind  up.”\n6\n  Yet  despite  the  dangers  presented  by  the  course  and  the  \ncriticism  of  the  event,  the  TT  still  continues  today.  In  a  2013  article  the  \nIndependent described this as a race that “defies the nanny state.”\n7\n \nJeffrey  Hill,  in  his  wide-ranging  work  Sport,  Leisure  and  Culture  in  \nTwentieth  Century  Britain  suggests  that  sport  may  be  regarded  as  a  \nprocess  “shaped”  by  economic,  political,  demographic  or  intellectual  \nforces.  Hill  suggests  that  this  helps  to  “understand  how  the  process  of  \nmodernization   affected   sport,   but   it   stops   short   of   affording   any   \nautonomous  agency  to  sport  itself.  The  history  of  sport  becomes  a  \n‘window’ through which to study developments in other areas of society.”\n8\n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n4\n Guardian, 4 June 2005. \n5\n R.

Over the course of this book we will see \na  change  from  a  small-scale  “domestic”  event  into  an  internationally  \nknown  competition.  This  analysis  is  based  around  the  discussion  of  the  \ngrowth of political support for the TT on the Isle of Man; the evaluation of \nthe  economic  commitment  to  the  TT  by  the  Manx  and  motorcycle  \nmanufacturers; and, it will show that as a result of the growing economic \nand political commitment the TT has become ingrained in constructions of \na Manx identity over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.  \nThe themes of politics and economics are easily understood. Under the \nbroader heading of politics falls an examination of how the TT races were \nestablished  and  sustained  on  the  Isle  of  Man  alongside  changes  to  the  \nstructure  and  practice  of  government  on  the  island.  The  economic,  or  \ncapitalist theme explores the way that the TT races were exploited by the \nManx government in advertising the island and further the way the TT was \nan  event  used  by  motorcycle  manufacturers  in  selling  their  products.  The  \nmost  contestable  of  these  themes  is  that  of  national  identity.  National  \nidentity  is  a  term  that  is  necessarily  multi-dimensional.  Any  definition  of  \nnational identity might encompass such aspects as a common language, a \ncommon political structure, a shared history and a common culture. These \nare all factors present on the Isle of Man. It is the plurality of identity that \nwill  be  explored  throughout  this  book.  It  will  ask  whether  the  different  \ningredients  employed  in  the  construction  of  Manx  identity  throughout  the  \ntwentieth  century,  which  included  the  TT  races,  clashed  as  might  be  \nexpected, or if they existed harmoniously alongside each other. Together, \nthe  themes  of  politics,  economics  and  national  identity  begin  to  answer  \nhow and why the TT has been sustained over the past 100 years or so. \nIt is, however, difficult to judge how far the TT races have become part \nof  an  insular  Manx  identity  and  just  how  far  the  Manx  people  associate  \nthemselves with motorcycle racing. That is to say that the Manx people are \naware that this event takes place every year and they attach themselves to \n\nThe Isle of Man Tourist Trophy Races \n \n5\nthe  opportunities  presented  by  the  event.\n9\n  For  example,  as  a  result  of  the  \nTT  taking  place  on  the  island,  residents  will  set  up  campsites  away  from  \nthe course where spectators and competitors can rest; they even open their \nhomes  to  these  visitors.  They  attach  themselves  to  the  opportunity  for  \nprosperity  that  is  presented  every  year.  Faragher  comments  that  the  races  \nare  “a  salient  part  of  Manx  consciousness.”\n10\n  The  TT  races  are  not  \nconsciously flagged in the Manx press, and they are not constantly flagged \nin  the  Isle  of  Man.  The  subconscious  reminding,  and  the  reason  that  the  \nManx  people  readily  accept  the  disruption  caused  by  the  TT  races  each  \nyear,  is  because  they  are  continually  reminded  that  the  event  will  take  \nplace  annually  as  the  public  roads  on  the  island  form  part  of  the  race  \ncourse; the grandstand is a reminder which is present all year round; and, \nthere  are  countless  reminders  around  the  course.  So  commonplace  are  \nthese symbols and so familiar are the TT races to the Manx, that it was not \nuntil  I  left  the  Isle  of  Man  that  I  realised  the  importance  and  indeed  the  \nenormity of the event.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n9\n  In  his  work  Banal  Nationalism,  Michael  Billig  suggests  that  nationalism  in  not  \nmerely  an  intense  political  spectacle,  but  is  omnipresent  and  commonplace  and  \nthere  are  certain  ‘flags’,  which  subconsciously  assert  a  national  identity.  The  \nmetonymic  image  of  banal  nationalism  is  not  the  flag  being  waved  with  fervent  \npassion;  it  is  the  flag  hanging  outside  the  public  building.  See,  M.  Billig,  Banal \nNationalism, (London, Sage Publications, 1995).  \n10\n Faragher, ‘Cultural History: Motorcycle Road Racing’, p. 410.  \n\n\n\nPART I \n 1904-1914 \n \n \n \nWhatever  the  Gordon  Bennett  Cup  did,  or  did  not,  achieve,  it  certainly  \nintroduced  motor  racing  to  the  Isle  of  Man.  Indirectly  it  also  introduced  \nmotorcycle  racing,  for  the  Act  passed  through  the  House  of  Keys,  the  \nIsland’s  Parliament,  in  1904  to  authorize  the  British  eliminating  trials  \nprovided a precedent for the whole succession of motorcycling events held \nthere since” \n—Lord Montagu of Beaulieu \n \nLord Raglan had prosecuted me; Lord Raglan had presided over the Court \nwhich  sentenced  me  to  prison;  Lord  Raglan  alone  was  now  capable,  \naccording to the Home Secretary of giving me my release. The Lord High \nExecutioner  in  the  ‘Mikado’  was  a  novice  in  authority  and  official  status  \ncompared with the Lieutenant Governor. He was Caesar in the Isle of Man. \n—Samuel Norris, Manx Movements and Memories \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCHAPTER ONE \nO\nN THE STARTING LINE: \nT\nHE ORIGINS OF THE TT RACES \n \n \n \nWhen the first motorcycle Tourist Trophy (TT) race took place on the \nIsle  of  Man  in  the  summer  of  1907,  motor  racing  was  still  relatively  new  \nto the island.\n1\n Despite this, it has been claimed that the island’s reputation \nas a venue for such events had already begun to spread worldwide. Robert \nKelly   suggests,   somewhat   spuriously,   that   the   motor-mad   Emir   of   \nAfghanistan  believed  “that  the  Isle  of  Man  [was]  such  a  splendid  place”  \nand  asked  “would  the  British  consider  an  exchange  –  his  kingdom  and  \nwives  for  the  Isle  of  Man.”\n2\n  The  Isle  of  Man  was  not  the  UK’s  to  \nexchange, but this was a nice  sentiment.  Even  in  the  modern  day  the  Isle  \nof Man is an odd location for a motor race. It must be considered an even \nstranger  location  at  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century.  In  1904  the  \nisland was not easy to access and it was costly to travel to; it is, after all, \nseparated from mainland Britain by the often-hostile Irish Sea. There were \nother  more  accessible  locations  that  might  have  been  used  for  motor  \nracing. If the automobile club had in mind hills and twisting roads for the \nearly  reliability  trials  then  they  might  have  made  use  of  the  roads  in  the  \nChilterns, in North Wales or in the Lake District. \nThere was, however, no chance of a motorcar race being held on public \nroads  in  England,  or  Britain  at  this  time.  This  was  due  to  restrictive  \nlegislation and the negative opinion of some MPs towards the motorcar in \nthe  pre-war  period.  Historically,  motorcars  and  motorcycles  had  been  \n“vociferously  opposed  by  the  carriage-owning  classes  and  the  many  \nrailway directors in Parliament.”\n3\n UK legislation reflected this. In 1865 the \n“Red  Flag”  Act  had  restricted  cars  to  four  miles  per  hour  (mph)  in  the  \ncountryside  and  two  mph  in  urban  areas.  Moreover,  legislation  also  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n  ‘Tourist’  in  Tourist  Trophy,  should  be  taken  to  mean  the  everyday  motorcyclist  \nwho  did  not  use  their  motorcycle  for  racing  but  for  making  trips  for  pleasure  or  \ncommuting to work. \n2\n R. Kelly, TT Pioneers, (Douglas, The Manx Experience, 1996), p.91. \n3\n H. Perkin, Age of the Automobile, (London, Quartet Books, 1976), p.35. \n\nOn the Starting Line: The Origins of the TT Races \n9\nrequired automobiles to have three attendants, including one to carry a red \nflag  sixty  yards  in  front  of  the  vehicle.  Even  more  restrictive  were  rules  \nthat prohibited the sounding of a whistle by the driver of a motor vehicle \nand those allowing any person on horseback or in a horse-drawn carriage \nto   demand   that   the   motorcar   be   stopped   while   they   passed.   Local   \nauthorities  could  even  regulate  the  time  at  which  motorcars  could  pass  \nthrough towns and villages. Motorcar drivers were permitted few liberties, \nand it has been suggested that the development of the motorcar in Britain \ncame  to  a  halt  as  a  result  of  such  restrictive  legislation.\n4\n However, \nlegislation was amended in 1878 making it possible for local authorities to \nrepeal  red  flag  restrictions,  but  they  were  not  repealed  all  together.  The  \nmost significant breakthrough came in 1896 when the Locomotives on the \nHighway  Act  raised  the  permissible  maximum  speed  limit  to  fourteen  \nmph.  This  legislation  and  the  improvement  in  conditions  for  motorists  \nwere  celebrated  on  “emancipation”  day,  14  November  1896,  with  a  \ndemonstration run of motorcars between London and Brighton. But, racing \non public roads was still prohibited, and although further legislation – the \nMotor   Car   Act   1903   –   raised   the   speed   limit   to   twenty   mph,   the   \nprohibition of racing on public roads was not repealed.\n5\n  \nEarly   motorcars   were   very   much   the   preserve   of   the   wealthy   \nenthusiast,  as  the  first  motorcars  were  costly  to  purchase  and  to  run.  Sir  \nRobert  Ensor  has  suggested  that  at  this  time  “only  rich  men  could  afford  \nthem;  and  as  they  dashed  along  the  narrow  untarred  carriage  ways,  \nfrightening  the  passer  by  on  their  approach  and  drenching  him  in  dust  as  \nthe  receded,  they  seemed  visible  symbols  of  the  selfishness  of  arrogant  \nwealth.”\n6\n  This  negativity  towards  motorcars  was  also  demonstrated  in  a  \nHouse of Commons debate over the speed of such vehicles, in June 1903. \nCathcart  Wason,  MP  for  Orkney  and  Shetland,  was  typical  of  the  voice  \nthat  spoke  out  in  opposition  to  motorcars.  In  his  opinion  “a  few  people  \n[claimed] the right to drive the public off the roads. Harmless men, women \nand  children,  dogs  and  cattle,  have  all  got  to  fly  for  their  lives  at  the  \nbidding  of  these  slaughtering,  stinking  engines  of  iniquity.”\n7\n Although \nWason’s  opinion  was  based  in  his  experiences  outside  Shetland  and  \nOrkney, and he admitted there was not a single car in his constituency, he \nassured MPs that irritation had begun to occur in the countryside because \ncars  were  beginning  to  monopolise  public  roads.  Wason  believed  that  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n4\n Perkin, Age of the Automobile, p. 35. \n5\n S.

Motor  racing  was  \nbecoming  increasingly  popular  on  the  continent  at  the  beginning  of  the  \ntwentieth  century  and  a  number  of  races  were  held  on  the  European  \nmainland,  such  as  the  International  Gordon  Bennett  Race  between  1900  \nand  1905  and  town-to-town  races  such  as  the  much-maligned  1903  Paris  \nto Madrid race. American newspaperman Gordon Bennett had established \nthe  International  Gordon  Bennett  Race  in  1900.\n9\n  As  a  result  of  British  \nsuccess in the 1902 International Gordon Bennett race, the 1903 event was \nto  be  held  in  England.  As  there  was  no  chance  of  a  race  in  England  \nbecause of legal restrictions, the 1903 Gordon Bennett race was staged in \nIreland  in  July  of  that  year.  A  lack  of  success  for  the  British  team  in  this  \nevent led to the first motorcar race being held on the Isle of Man under the \nprovisions of the Highways (Light Locomotives) Act 1904 – a trial for the \n1904 Gordon Bennett Race. What took place in Ireland in 1903, therefore, \nset the precedent for later events in the Isle of Man.  \nThe Irish Precedent  \nWhen  the  English  driver  Selwyn  F.  Edge  had  won  the  1902  Gordon  \nBennett  race  held  in  France,  he  had  given  the  Automobile  Club  of  Great  \nBritain and Ireland a difficult decision to make. After exploring a number \nof  different  possibilities,  their  eyes  inevitably  fell  on  Ireland.  Why  did  a  \nmotor race on public roads take place in Ireland in 1903, when legislation \nprohibited  such  events  in  Britain?  The  answer  seems  to  be  fairly  simple:  \nIreland was far enough on the periphery for this not to be a problem.  \nIn contrast to the opinions of the majority who believed that motorcars \nwere  an  outrage,  the  Automobile  Club  believed  that  the  Gordon  Bennett  \nCup and motorcar racing generally were beneficial to the development of \nthe  motorcar.  It  was  the  opinion  of  the  Automobile  Club  that  prolonged  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n8\n Parliamentary Debates (Commons), 11 June 1903, (4\nth\n Series), Vol. 123, col 699. \n9\n The Gordon Bennett Cup had been designed by American newspaperman James \nGordon Bennett who had come to Paris to found the continental edition of the New \nYork  Herald.  He  was  keen  on  sport  and  became  a  founder  member  of  the  French  \nAutomobile   Club.   The   Gordon   Bennett   Race   was   proposed   in   1900   as   a   \n‘regularised  international  motor  race  to  evidence  the  advance  of  the  nations  in  \nmotor car construction’, as quoted in Holliday, Racing Round the Island, p. 11.  \n\nOn the Starting Line: The Origins of the TT Races \n11\nraces  on  public  roads  had  led  to  great  improvements  in  motorcar  design  \nand  construction.\n10\n It was also believed that the Gordon Bennett Cup was \nto motor racing what the America Cup was to yachting: an opportunity for \nnations to pit themselves against each other in competition and at the same \ntime  test  new  technology.\n11\n  Evidence  for  this,  argued  the  Automobile  \nClub, was provided by the French supremacy in the motorcar industry that, \nit  was  claimed,  was  the  result  of  the  French  authorities  providing  their  \nmanufacturers  with  the  chance  to  test  cars  at  high  speeds  along  public  \nroads. The French motor industry was far ahead of the British. In 1898, for \nexample, the French had produced 1,850 vehicles and exported seven per \ncent of these to Britain. By 1904 Britain was selling two cars per month in \nFrance  and  importing  400  in  return.\n12\n  A  Gordon  Bennett  Cup  race  in  the  \nUK  would  add  impetus  to  the  British  motor  car  industry,  suggested  the  \nAutomobile  Club,  and  would  further  educate  the  public  in  the  value  of  \nthese vehicles. \nFurther  to  this,  the  relationship  between  motor  car  racing  and  the  \nmanufacture of vehicles for domestic use was also highlighted in a letter to \nThe Times by Scott Montagu who argued that the modern racing machine \nhad no purpose and “the rules of motor racing ought now to be altered, not \nonly in the interests of the public and the competitors, but for the eventual \nadvantage  of  manufacturers  as  well.”\n13\n O’Connell  in The  Car  in  British  \nSociety,   suggests   that   in   order   to   redress   this   balance,   the   British   \nmanufacturers  had  to  demonstrate  the  benefits  of  the  motor  car  to  the  \npublic, convincing them that it would carry them securely from A to B; it \nwas  for  this  reason  that  part  of  the  marketing  of  the  motor  car  revolved  \naround  road  races  and  reliability  trials.\n14\n  If  the  Gordon  Bennett  race  were  \ntransferred  to  France,  as  would  be  the  case  if  a  suitable  venue  were  not  \nfound  in  Britain,  a  valuable  opportunity  to  improve  the  manufacture  of  \nBritish  motorcars  would  be  lost  and  the  technological  gap  between  the  \nBritish and the French would widen. Members of the political elite, whose \nnegative opinion was discussed earlier, would need to be convinced. \nThe Automobile Club had then settled on the idea of racing in Ireland, \nbut  it  was  still  necessary  to  first  pass  legislation  that  would  permit  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n10\n Petition  for  Racing  to  be  held  in  Ireland  1903,  (Churchill  College  Archives,  \nCambridge). \n11\n Petition for Racing to be held in Ireland 1903. \n12\n K.

In  January  1903  the  Autocar \ncarried  a  message  in  its  editorial  advocating  this.  If  legislation  were  not  \npassed the race in Ireland would: “not only be illegal, but, further to that, \nwould almost be certain to be stopped at an early stage, and this would be \ngrossly  unfair  to  the  competitors  and  especially  to  those  who  came  from  \nabroad. If the race cannot legally and openly be held, it will not take place \nin  this  country  [Ireland].”\n15\n  Members  of  the  motoring  community  thus  \nrealised  the  need  for  legislation.  Contrary  to  this,  however,  one  Irish  \ncolumnist believed that “the English [were] far too law-abiding altogether, \nwe are prepared to hold the race, official approval or not!”\n16\n Additionally \nthere was also a feeling that such legislation would bring a sense of unity \nto  the  Irish.  Commenting  on  the  passing  of  legislation  to  permit  the  race,  \nthe ultra-Orange publication Northern Whig reported, “we see a wonderful \nblending  of  the  Orange  and  Green.  There  is  about  this  a  matter  of  \nunanimity  of  which  some  people  considered  Irishmen  to  be  incapable.”\n17\n \nIrish  MPs  such  as  Sir  Edward  Carson,  leader  of  the  Irish  Unionists,  and  \nJohn  Redmond,  leader  of  the  Irish  Nationalist  Party  would  support  this  \nlegislation.  They  were  fiercely  divided  politically,  but  were  brought  \ntogether by the promise of motor racing in Ireland.  \nThe Light Locomotives (Ireland) Bill was given its first reading in the \nHouse of Commons on 20 February 1903, received its second reading on \n26  February  and  was  considered  in  committee  and  given  its  third  reading  \nand passed on 2 March. Nothing was said against the passage of the bill.\n18\n \nThe  bill  was  passed  onto  the  Lords  and  received  its  first  reading  on  3  \nMarch,  the  second  reading  on  16  March  and  was  passed  on  24  March.\n19\n \nOnce  again  nothing  was  said  in  protest.  Despite  minimal  debate  over  the  \nlegislation  the  notion,  or  at  least  promise,  of  unity  was  expressed.  In  the  \nHouse of Lords Earl Spencer found it “gratifying and a new sensation ... \nto  find  a  Bill  dealing  with  Ireland  on  which  all  sides,  both  in  the  other  \nHouse and in this are united.”\n20\n His opinion was echoed in the Commons \nby  Saunderson,  MP  for  Armagh  North,  who  asked  “is  his  Majesty’s  \nGovernment  aware  that  this  is  a  rare  occasion  on  which  the  whole  of  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n15\n Autocar, 4 January 1903. \n16\n   As   quoted   in   B.

Taking  this  fact  into  consideration,  will  his  \nMajesty’s  Government  give  a  favourable  reply?”\n21\n  This  was  a  comment  \nthat  was  met  by  laughter  in  the  House,  suggesting  that  the  question  of  \nholding  a  motor  race  in  Ireland  was  viewed  as  a  light-hearted  matter.  \nWhyndham,  Chief  Secretary  for  Ireland,  was  confident  that  legislation  \nwould  be  passed  and  did  “not  like  to  contemplate  the  possibility  of  other  \nmembers  of  the  Commons  opposing  this  measure”  and  believed  further  \nthat  “no  one  can  be  opposed  to  it.”\n22\n  Politicians  at  Westminster  then  \npraised the unity inspired by the proposal of a motor race in Ireland; they \nwere not, it seems, put off by the danger and inconvenience posed by such \nan  event.  There  was  no  intention  of  passing  legislation  to  allow  motor  \nracing  in  England  (or  in  Scotland  or  Wales)  but  it  was  accepted  without  \ndemur  as  fair  to  allow  motor  racing  to  take  place  in  Ireland.  The  Light  \nLocomotives  (Ireland)  Act  received  the  Royal  Assent  on  27  March  1903,  \nhaving  had  its  first  reading  in  the  Commons  only  a  month  earlier,  on  20  \nFebruary.\n23\n \nIt  was  not  left  up  to  MPs  alone  to  put  forward  the  benefits  of  a  motor  \nrace  in  Ireland.  Whilst  legislation  was  being  debated  at  Westminster  the  \nAutomobile Club embarked on a direct mail campaign, designed to foster \nsupport  for  a  motor  race  in  Ireland.  Letters  were  sent  mostly  to  members  \nof  the  Irish  elite,  but  were  also  sent  to  some  who  it  was  believed  would  \nbenefit  from  the  staging  of  a  motor  race  in  Ireland,  for  example,  railway  \ncompanies and hoteliers. All in all, letters were sent to 102 Irish MPs, 300 \nnewspapers,  34  chairmen  of  county  and  district  councils,  34  county  \nsecretaries,   26   mayors,   90   Irish   peers,   41   railway   companies,   460   \nhoteliers, 13 parish priests and to the Bishop of Kildare and Leiglin.\n24\n The \nletter stressed the benefits that the Gordon Bennett race would supposedly \nbring locally and suggested that the event would benefit the Irish economy \nto  the  tune  of  £20,000.  It  is  unclear  how  this  figure  was  reached,  but  it  \nwould  have  included  revenue  generated  by  visitors  who  would  travel  to  \nIreland  exclusively  for  the  race.  This  was,  after  all,  an  international  \ncompetition.  The  letters  also  promised  that  rigorous  safety  measures  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n21\n Parliamentary Debates (Commons), 23 Feb. 1903, (4\nth\n Series), Vol. 118, col. 510. \n22\n Parliamentary Debates (Commons), 23 Feb. 1903, (4\nth\n Series), Vol. 118, col. 511. \n23\n  Montagu  states  in  The  Gordon  Bennett  Races  that  the  bill  passed  through  in  \nrecord time ‘receiving the Royal Assent on 27 March 1903, a bare seven days after \nit  first  reading  in  the  Commons’  (p.65).

The  Bishop  of  Kildare  and  Leighlin  it  was  suggested  had  \ndeclared  himself  to  be  an  ardent  advocate  of  the  race.\n26\n County  councils, \nwho would be responsible for making necessary arrangements for the race \nin  Ireland,  unanimously  approved  the  plans  especially  after  they  learned  \nthat  they  would  not  foot  the  bill  for  preliminary  road  repairs.\n27\n The  race \nthen   was   an   attractive   proposition.   Potentially   roadways   could   be   \napproved  at  no  cost  to  the  local  council.  Although  a  softening  up  process  \nwas taking place, it must be remembered that legislation was being passed \nby  Westminster,  not  by  an  Irish  parliament  and  it  was  the  Irish  periphery  \nthat was being softened up. It may have been considered insensitive for the \nAutomobile  Club  to  see  legislation  passed  and  then  simply  turn  up  and  \nrace. Although this would not be impossible, the Automobile Club wanted \nto be seen to do the right thing in terms of gauging public opinion.  \nLegislation had been passed, and, selectively, public opinion seemed to \nbe in favour of the event. However, there still existed the need to construct \na  course.  Before  deciding  to  hold  the  event  in  Ireland,  the  Automobile  \nClub  had  pursued  various  other  ideas  in  their  ambition  to  hold  races  on  \nhome soil. These included the construction of a course over the flat land of \nLincolnshire,  building  a  course  in  Surrey  and  even  the  suggestion  of  \nholding  the  race  in  Scotland,  as  was  proposed  by  the  Edinburgh  Evening  \nDispatch.\n28\n Richard  Mecredy,  proprietor  of  the  Motor  News  magazine,  \nwas  asked  if  he  could  suggest  a  suitable  course,  after  which  it  was  \nproposed  that  the  Irish  race  be  held  over  closed  public  roads.\n29\n  It  was  on  \nMecredy’s  instigation  that  a  reconnaissance  party  from  the  Automobile  \nClub was sent to Ireland in November 1902 and inspected the areas to the \nSouth  and  West  of  Dublin.  One  racing  enthusiast  has  gone  as  far  as  to  \nsuggest  that  this  reconnaissance  party  displayed  “a  rare  unity  of  Saxon  \nenergy   and   Celtic   ardour   as   English   and   Irish   officials   inspected   \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n25\n Montagu and Sedgwick, The Gordon Bennett Races, p. 63. \n26\n Montagu and Sedgwick, The Gordon Bennett Races, p. 63. \n27\n  Members  of  the  Lords  believed  this  to  be  the  case.

This  area  was  well  served  by  railways  \nand  roads  out  of  Dublin,  reducing  the  problem  of  transporting  spectators,  \ncompetitors and racing machines. The area was also thinly populated, with \nthe  exception  of  the  main  towns  –  Carlow,  Kildare  and  Athy  –  which  \nmeant  that  the  number  of  controls,  and  subsequently  costs,  could  be  kept  \nto a minimum, showing that those in charge of organizing the race realised \nthe  inconvenience  that  would  be  caused  to  the  public  by  the  necessary  \nroad closures.  \nEverything  appeared  to  be  going  along  smoothly,  but  the  Automobile  \nClub  de  France  (ACF)  was  not  enthusiastic  about  the  idea  of  a  closed  \ncourse race. They disliked the shortness of the proposed course and hoped \nthat legislation would not be passed to allow the race to go ahead. It was in \nthe interest of the French to not see racing go ahead, as the race would be \nheld  in  France.  However,  this  sentiment  was  not  shared  by  Le  France  \nAutomobile  who  attempted  to  placate  the  ACF,  reminding  them  that  they  \nhad   been   losers   in   1902   and   “a   little   indulgence   would   not   be   \nmisplaced.”\n31\n The Automobile Club was quick to respond to this, arguing \nthat  the  French  were  scared  of  British  ascendency  in  world  matters  or  at  \nleast in the French-dominated automobile industry. Dublin’s Evening Mail \nalso spoke out against the opinion of the ACF remarking that “we are not \naware  that  they  do  things  better  in  France  -  witness  the  Paris-Madrid  \nmotor race disaster.”\n32\n A more positive opinion was offered by one of the \ncompetitors, the American Percy Owen. He commented that “we couldn’t \nhave  better  roads.  They  are  marvelous,  nothing  in  America  can  compare,  \nand they are as good as any in France, though not so wide.”\n33\n  \nThe organisers then faced one further problem: the Paris-Madrid motor \nrace  held  in  May  1903.  A  large  number  of  fatalities  in  the  race  had  seen  \nthe event ended at Bordeaux. There were now doubts over the safety of the \nIrish  race.  The  attitude  of  MPs  at  the  time,  as  we  have  seen  above,  was  \nthat  motorcars  were  unsafe  and  motorcar  races  were  unnecessary.  This  \ntown-to-town  race  did  little  to  prove  the  safety  of  motor  racing  and  did  \nlittle to quell the debate against the motorcar. In fact, English writer S.C.H \nDavies was compelled to comment that “for a while it seemed as thought \n[sic]  racing  might  be  stopped  for  good  and  all,  and  that  made  one  sick  at  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n30\n Lynch, The Triumph of the Red Devil, p. 37.  \n31\n Montagu and Sedgwick, The Gordon Bennett Races, p. 60. \n32\n Evening Mail as quoted in Lynch, Triumph of the Red Devil, p. 46. \n33\n Lynch, Triumph of the Red Devil, p. 37. \n\nChapter One \n16\nheart.”\n34\n The Times reported that “an examination of yesterday’s incidents \nseems to prove pretty conclusively that it is well nigh impossible to escape \nserious   accidents   in   such   races   on   the   public   roads   under   existing   \nconditions.”\n35\n Concerns over the events of the Paris-Madrid race were also \nraised  in  the  House  of  Commons,  and  worries  were  expressed  over  the  \nsafety of the proposed Irish race. It was emphasised, by its supporters that \nthe  race  would  be  held  under  entirely  different  circumstances  and  that  \nvigorous  safety  measures  would  be  put  in  place  by  members  of  the  Irish  \nconstabulary  and  the  military,  supplemented  by  stewards  supplied  by  the  \nAutomobile club.  \nThe  Paris-Madrid  race  did  not  deter  the  members  of  the  motoring  \ncommunity from showing their support for racing. The Times published a \nletter  from  John  Scott  Montagu  who  argued  that  fatalities  that  had  \noccurred  in  the  Paris-Madrid  race  had  no  bearing  on  the  future  of  motor  \ncar racing, or indeed a proposed Gordon Bennett race in Ireland. The two \nraces, he claimed, would be entirely different and he argued that negative \nopinion  caused  by  the  events  in  France  was  entirely  unreasonable.  In  his  \nopinion  motor  racing  was  no  more  dangerous  than  other  sports:  “every  \nyear  people  are  killed  and  injured  in  the  following  sports:-  football,  at  \ncricket  (a  few),  steeplechasing,  polo,  hunting,  shooting,  yachting:  and  yet  \nno one clamours for the abolition of these contests.”\n36\n For Montagu, motor \nracing  was  just  another  sport,  not  matter  how  dangerous  it  was.  In  short  \nthe  Paris-Madrid  race  had  done  little  to  reduce  the  enthusiasm  for  motor  \nracing  among  the  elite.  Despite  the  reaction  in  England  to  the  events  on  \nthe Paris-Madrid race, the Irish Gordon Bennett race was still scheduled to \ngo ahead.  \nThe  race  took  place  at  the  beginning  of  July  1903.  On  the  day  before  \nthe race The  Times reported that there was a good deal of support for the \nrace  in  Ireland,  stating  that  “the  hotels  here  [Naas]  and  in  all  the  other  \ntowns  on  the  route  are  packed  to  overflowing  and  the  sides  of  the  course  \nwere lined this evening with thousands of tents ... It is quite certain that a \nreally  enormous  crowd  of  spectators  from  all  nations  will  witness  the  \nGordon  Bennett  race  tomorrow.”\n37\n  The  so-called  “Red  Devil”  Camille  \nJenatzy  won  the  race  and  his  victory  was  reported  alongside  the  “bad-\nluck” experienced by English drivers. The Irish Times, however, reported \nthat  “there  is  no  parallel  in  Irish  history  for  the  scenes  which  were  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n34\n As quoted in B.

It might \nbe  assumed  that  the  lack  of  achievement  by  British  drivers,  coupled  with  \nthe  tardiness  of  members  of  the  Automobile  Club  in  seeking  to  have  \nlegislation  renewed  after  the  1903  race,  as  suggested  by  The  Times, \ncontributed  to  trials  for  the  1904  Gordon  Bennett  race  not  being  held  in  \nIreland.\n39\n \nIn  1904  the  Automobile  Club  were  therefore  faced  with  a  problem:  \nwhere  to  hold  trials  for  the  1904  Gordon  Bennett  Race  if  not  in  Ireland.  \nThis race was to be held in Germany and was billed as a race that \n \nwith   its   accompanying   automobile   amenities   has   drawn   the   nations   \ntogether  on  a  common  sporting  ground  as  no  other  pastime,  industry  or  \ninterest  has  ever  before  ...in  effect  such  an  international  camaraderie  of  \nsport is an unsigned treaty of peace and good fellowship.\n40\n  \n \nThe   German   Gordon   Bennett   race   was   advertised   as   an   extremely   \nimportant sporting event, in fact an event that could be likened, in regard \nto the latter description, with the Olympic Games, which had been revived \nin their modern form in 1896. The British participants were determined to \nbe  successful  and  keen  to  make  up  for  their  lack  of  achievement  in  the  \n1903 Gordon Bennett Race. A British team could not be selected using the \nsame illegal and rushed trials such as those held on the London to Oxford \nroad before the 1903 race, and since other competing nations were holding \ntheir own trials, it was important that the British team did the same.\n 41\n The \nAutomobile  Club  had  only  the  possibility  of  racing  in  Ireland  under  \nlegislation passed in 1903. However, in May 1904 The Times commented \nthat “it was thought that there would hardly be time to renew or extend the \nAct passed last year [1903] permitting racing in Ireland.”\n42\n This meant that \nthe  obvious  solution  -  to  hold  trials  in  Ireland  -  did  not  happen.  But,  the  \nunobvious,  racing  in  the  Isle  of  Man,  did  happen  with  Irish  legislation  \nsetting a precedent for Manx legislation.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n38\n Irish Times, 1 July 1903, p. 7. \n39\n The Times, 10 May 1904, p. 13. \n40\n  From  Julian  Orde’s  copy  of  the  book  Offizieller  Gordon  Bennett  Führer  1904,  \npublished to mark the occasion of the Gordon Bennett race in Germany 1904. \n41\n Kelly, TT Pioneers, p. 15. \n42\n The Times, 10 May 1904, p. 13.  \n\nChapter One \n18\nStructure and Practice of Government on the Isle of Man \nIn 1904 the Manx government consisted of the lieutenant governor, the \nLegislative  Council  and  the  House  of  Keys  and  the  two  chambers  met  in  \nTynwald Court, a practice maintained throughout the period of this study. \nBoards  of  Tynwald  consisting  of  Members  of  the  Legislative  Council  \n(MLC)  and  Members  of  the  House  of  Keys  (MHK)  directed  other  \nadministrative duties.  \nLord Raglan was appointed to the post of  lieutenant governor in 1902, \nand would enjoy considerable personal authority during his time in office \n(1902-1919).  He  had  the  power  to  summon  and  adjourn  the  Manx  \nparliament  and  veto  expenditure.  He  was  also  president  of  the  Local  \nGovernment  Board  and  head  of  the  police.  In  fact,  such  was  the  power  \nmaintained   by   Raglan   between   1902   and   1919   that   Hall   Caine,   a   \nprominent  figure  on  the  island,  was  compelled  to  compare  him  with  the  \nTsar  of  Russia,  and  Spencer  Leigh  Hughes  commented  in  Reynolds \nNewspaper  in  1911  that  “Raglan  has  more  power  than  the  Kaiser.”\n43\n \nSamuel   Norris,   a   prominent   reformist,   suggested   that   the   lieutenant   \ngovernor  was  “his  own  Prime  Minister,  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  and  \nHome  Secretary.”\n44\n  The  British  Crown  appointed  the  lieutenant  governor  \nand only the British Crown could remove him from the position.  \nYet,  despite  his  considerable  power  over  Manx  affairs,  Raglan  was  \ndescribed    in    his    obituary    in    the    Manx    Quarterly    as    intensely    \ncompanionable,  and  it  was  claimed  that  no  one  could  deliver  speeches  \nmore gracefully, wittily and pithily.\n45\n This would indeed be evident in his \nadvocacy  of  motor  races  on  the  island.  Even  Samuel  Norris,  one  of  \nRaglan’s sternest critics and founder of the Manx National Reform League \nin  1903,  conceded  that  no  charitable  event  lacked  his  presence  or  that  of  \nhis  wife.\n46\n  Deemster  Callow,  a  member  of  the  Legislative  Council  and  \nthus  by  association  a  supporter  of  Raglan,  also  wrote  that  Raglan  “knew  \nthe Island intimately from the Point of Ayre to the Calf [of Man]; he took \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n43\n Reynolds Newspaper, Feb. 1911 as cited in J.

Kermode argues, “Raglan interpreted his \nrole  firmly  in  the  colonial  tradition.  He  believed  in  the  superiority  of  the  \ncolonial  administration  and  had  a  jaundiced  view  of  the  ability  of  the  \nelected  members  of  the  Keys.”\n48\n  What  the  passing  of  legislation  in  1904  \nsuggests, however, is that Raglan was closely in touch with the Manx elite, \nrepresented especially in his Legislative Council. He knew little and cared \nless about the Manx people as a whole. \nDespite  the  considerable  personal  authority  enjoyed  by  the  lieutenant  \ngovernor, it must be remembered that he had to receive the consent of the \nLegislative  Council  and  the  House  of  Keys  before  legislation  could  be  \npassed  on  the  island.  In  1904,  when  legislation  for  motor  racing  was  \nintroduced  into  the  Legislative  Council,  the  Council  consisted  of  eight  \nmembers  who  were  appointed  for  life  by  the  lieutenant  governor.  These  \nwere  the  bishop,  the  archdeacon,  the  vicar  general,  the  clerk  of  the  rolls,  \ntwo deemsters (judges), the attorney general and the receiver general. The \nlieutenant  governor  presided  over  the  Council.  It  has  been  suggested  that  \nthe  Legislative  Council  therefore  offered  a  “formidable  obstacle  to  any  \nnotion  of  reform”  that  might  have  been  proposed  by  members  of  the  \nKeys.\n49\n  Reformists  on  the  island  were  suspicious  of  the  power  of  the  \nLegislative  Council,  and  believed  that  Westminster  saw  it  as  a  vehicle  \nthrough  which  to  manipulate  Manx  affairs.  It  was  also  believed  that  \nmeetings  of  legislative  councillors  to  discuss  proposed  legislation  were  \noften  unofficially  held  in  private,  with  the  lieutenant  governor  acting  as  \nchairman  and  exercising  the  casting  vote.  If  this  were  the  case,  the  \nlieutenant  governor  would  have  had  the  chance  to  acquaint  the  Council  \nwith  proposed  legislation  before  formal  debate  and  thereby  avoid  any  \npossible  dispute  between  himself  and  the  Legislative  Council.\n50\n This \ndemonstrates   the   authority   maintained   by   Raglan   over   the   Manx   \nlegislature  and  also  helps  explain  how  legislation  for  road  racing  was  so  \nswiftly passed in 1904 and 1905, as we will see later.  \nThe  House  of  Keys  had  become  an  elected  House  as  a  result  of  the  \nHouse  of  Keys  Election  Act  1866,  and  was  composed  of  the  elected  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n47\n Manx Quarterly, 7 (1922), p. 45. \n48\n D.G.

Again this is demonstrated in the passage \nof legislation for motor racing in 1904 and 1905.  \nThe  two  chambers  of  the  Manx  parliament  sat  together  in  Tynwald  \nCourt. The lieutenant governor could not vote in Tynwald, but he was able \nto  address  the  meeting.  In  order  for  bills  to  be  passed,  they  had  to  be  \nratified  by  both  the  Legislative  Council  and  the  Keys,  with  each  body  \nvoting separately. However, a disparity existed in this arrangement due to \nthe fact that the Legislative Council could vote if three of its members and \nthe lieutenant governor were present. The Keys could only reject or pass a \nbill if thirteen of its members were for or against the proposal. This meant \nthat  only  three  members  of  the  Legislative  Council  could  defeat  a  bill.  \nTherefore, the lieutenant governor and the Legislative Council maintained \na large amount of power.\n52\n  \nThe   administration   of   the   island   was,   however,   delegated   to   \nrepresentatives of Tynwald by the Tynwald’s board system, although these \nboards  of  Tynwald  were  still  answerable  to  the  lieutenant  governor.  This  \nsystem of administration established itself between 1872 and 1894. Before \nthen only the Highway Board had existed (established 1836) and this was \nthe   only   example   of   Tynwald   members   being   involved   in   the   \nadministration  of  the  island.  The  period  between  1872  and  1894  saw  the  \nestablishment  of  eight  bodies,  which  involved  both  MLCs  and  MHKs  in  \nthe   administration   of   the   island.   These   boards   were   the   Harbour   \nCommissioners,  Board  of  Education,  Highways  Board,  Board  of  Fishery  \nConservators, the Asylum Board, Fisheries Committee, Local Government \nBoard,  and  an  Advertising  Committee,  which  would  later  become  the  \nBoard  of  Advertising,  a  state-funded  body  to  advertise  the  island  and  \npromote  it  as  a  tourist  destination.\n53\n  MLCs  chaired  all  but  one  of  these  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n51\n For further discussion of this Act see D.

MHKs  gained  little  control  over  boards  of  Tynwald  until  after  \nWorld War One.\n54\n  \n1904: Gordon Bennett Trials in the Isle of Man \nAs we saw earlier, after rejecting Ireland as a venue for their trials, the \nAutomobile  Club’s  glances  had  turned  towards  the  Isle  of  Man.  Julian  \nOrde, the secretary of the Automobile Club was sent to the Isle of Man to \nexplore  the  possibility  of  racing  there.\n55\n  Lord  Raglan,  Orde’s  cousin,  was  \nthe  island’s  lieutenant  governor.  This,  however,  was  only  one  powerful  \ningredient  in  the  mix.  Tynwald,  the  island’s  parliament,  was  able  to  pass  \nlegislation  legalising  the  closing  of  public  roads  without  reference  to  \nWhitehall  or  Westminster  and,  as  we  have  seen  above,  the  lieutenant  \ngovernor  exerted  considerable  power  over  the  legislative  process.  Raglan  \nwas also a member of the Automobile Club.\n56\n  \nIn February 1904 and before the legislative process began, Orde visited \nthe  island  to  assess  the  potential  for  racing  there.  After  Orde’s  successful  \nvisit  -  he  had  been  accompanied  around  the  island  by  Raglan  to  plan  a  \ncourse  -  it  was  left  to  the  Manx  government  to  pass  the  necessary  \nlegislation. Closer examination of the legislative process demonstrates that \nthe   legislation   was   imposed   on   both   the   Manx   legislature   and   the   \nislanders.  There  was  no  “softening  up”  process  as  had  taken  place  in  \nIreland,  or  any  poll  of  residents’  opinions.  On  15  March  1904,  the  \nHighway  (Light  Locomotives)  Bill  was  introduced  into  the  Legislative  \nCouncil by Raglan. He had drawn the bill  up  along  the  lines  of  the  Light  \nLocomotives  (Ireland)  Act  1903.

The  obituary  went  on  to  state  that  ‘by  promoting  numerous  practical  trials  \nand  races,  [he]  took  a  leading  part  in  the  modern  development  of  motoring’.  The \nTimes, 19 June 1929. \n56\n  This  was  noted  as  significant  by  E.  H.  Stenning  in  his  discussion  of  the  origins  \nof the TT in the 1962 TT programme. \n\nChapter One \n22\nKeys  and  Legislative  Council,  instructed  the  secretary  of  the  board  to  \nwrite  to  Ireland’s  Local  Government  Board  to  request  a  copy  of  the  \nregulations  and  orders  in  connection  with  the  1903  race.\n57\n The passing of \nthis piece of radical legislation broke records. It received its three readings \nin  the  Legislative  Council  on  the  morning  of  15  March  and  was  received  \nby  the  House  of  Keys  later  that  afternoon.  It  passed  through  its  three  \nreadings in the Keys that day. It was then signed in Tynwald the following \nmorning.\n58\n  \nThe debate, or lack of debate, surrounding the bill has been overlooked \nin literature concerning the history of TT races, and may have been taken \nas  a  sign  of  enthusiasm,  from  both  members  of  the  Manx  legislature  and  \nthe  islanders  themselves,  for  the  holding  of  a  motor  race  on  the  island.  \nRaglan  was  evidently  determined  that  this  legislation  would  pass,  and  he  \nmade  his  views  on  the  matter  clear  in  the  Legislative  Council.  Raglan  \nanticipated  little  difficulty  in  passing  the  bill  through  its  stages.\n59\n He \nargued that regulations were required to guarantee the safety of both those \ninvolved  in  motor  races  and  the  spectators.  Although  it  was  doubtful  that  \nthe  Gordon  Bennett  trials  would  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  tourist  \nindustry, Raglan claimed that benefits would accrue if the trials were held \non the Isle of Man. He even suggested that there was considerable public \nopinion  in  favour  of  the  trials  taking  place  on  the  Isle  of  Man;  this  \nsuggestion  is  somewhat  spurious.  It  is  unclear  where  this  public  support  \nfor  the  trials  came  from.  Raglan  had  toured  the  island  with  Orde  in  \nFebruary  1904,  but  it  is  unlikely  that  he  managed  to  gain  a  great  deal  of  \npublic support at this time, or even sought it. It could well be argued that \nRaglan’s confidence arose not from the support of the Manx people but as \nthe  result  of  the  Legislative  Council  being  filled  entirely  with  Crown  \nappointees  on  whose  support  he  could  rely.  This  then  is  also  an  issue  of  \nclass. Members of the Manx elite, who were inclined to support Raglan on \nall  matters,  were  imposing  the  races  on  the  Manx  people.  At  this  stage  \nlegislation   for   motor   racing   on   the   Isle   of   Man   was   a   Raglan-led   \nimposition. \nSubsequent  debate  after  the  introduction  of  the  bill  in  the  Legislative  \nCouncil  was  minimal.  There  was  not  even  a  printed  text  of  the  bill  to  \nexamine and what debate there was hinged on two main issues: the safety \nof  the  races  and  the  cost  of  the  races.  Whilst  the  safety  of  the  trials  was  \nconsidered  and  the  period  set  aside  for  racing  fixed  at  three  days  for  this  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n57\n Highway Board Minutes, March 1904, p. 196. \n58\n See Highway (Light Locomotives) Act 1904, Statutes of the Isle of Man, Vol. 7, \n(Victoria Press, Douglas), pp. 468-469.

Hereafter Debates.  \n\nOn the Starting Line: The Origins of the TT Races \n23\nreason,  the  cost  of  the  trials  was  discussed  more  extensively.  It  was  felt  \nthat ample funds must be made available for meeting the costs of policing \nthe  event.\n60\n  The  Irish  authorities  -  county  councils  -  had  been  wary  of  \nfooting  the  bill  for  racing  in  1903  and,  so  it  seems,  was  the  Manx  \nLegislative  Council  in  1904.  The  Council  suggested  that  funds  for  racing  \nmight come from the organisers of the event, in this case the Automobile \nClub and maybe even from interest groups such as the Isle of Man Steam \nPacket  Company  and  hoteliers.  As  a  result  of  this  the  1904  legislation  \nmade it clear that “applicants” were to pay for the costs incurred by racing \non the island.\n61\n  \nThe  bill,  still  only  in  draft  and  not  yet  returned  from  the  printers,  was  \npassed  to  the  Keys  in  the  afternoon  and  rather  more  of  a  debate  ensued.  \nEven  so,  most  disquiet  in  the  Keys  concerned  the  speed  with  which  the  \nlegislation  was  being  passed  and  not  the  proposal  itself.  After  the  Keys  \nhad  been  asked  to  offer  an  opinion  on  a  bill  which  had  not  yet  been  \nreceived from the printers, W. T. Crennell, MHK for the rural constituency \nof Kirk Michael commented that the Bill, which was rapidly being passed \nthrough  the  necessary  channels,  was  not  a  matter  of  “such  extreme  \nurgency...that  we  should  in  the  face  of  all  precedent  read  the  Bill  first,  \nsecond and third times – because that is what is intended – a Bill we have \nnever  seen,  it  is  really  making  ourselves  a  laughing  stock”  [Emphasis  \nadded].\n62\n  Raglan  had  expected  that  there  would  be  little  difficulty  in  \npassing  the  bill  and  that  the  Legislative  Council  and  Keys  would  swiftly  \npush the legislation through. This anticipated speed in the legislature was \nthe Keys’ main objection. Raglan’s expectations highlight his authoritarian \ninterpretation  of  his  role,  believing  that  the  usual  legislative  procedures  \ncould be by-passed to make motor racing a reality. Some members of the \nKeys,  however,  would  not  accept  this  without  some  squeaks  of  protest,  \nand this was fair since the bill had not been seen in its entirety, or even in \nits printed form, and yet members of the Keys were expected to subscribe \nto it.  \nThe fact that the two opposing opinions on the merits of the bill from \nCrennell and Radcliffe, were offered by members whose sheadings would \nbe affected differently by the races, is also noticeable. Crennell’s sheading, \nKirk  Michael,  was  on  the  intended  route  of  the  course  and  therefore  the  \ntrials were likely to cause disruption to his constituents. However, the race \nwould largely bypass Radcliffe’s constituency, the sheading of Ayre and it \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n60\n Debates, Vol. 21, 15 Mar. 1904, pp. 400-403. \n61\n Highway (Light Locomotives) Act 1904, Statutes, Vol. 7, pp. 468-469. \n62\n Debates, Vol. 21, 15 Mar. 1904, p. 453. \n\nChapter One \n24\nwould, therefore, be easier for Radcliffe to ignore the disruptive effects of \nholding a motor race on the island, as he would be distanced from the race. \nIt can also be argued that MHKs would have little idea of the nature of the \nactivity they were being asked to sanction, and therefore of the benefits it \nmight  generate.  Unsurprisingly,  Crennell’s  objections  were  not  given  any  \nsupport by other members of the Keys. Members of the Keys showed their \nweakness  in  the  face  of  the  lieutenant  governor.  The  demands  of  the  \nopposition  in  the  Keys  fell  on  deaf  ears,  and  in  sum,  and  due  to  Raglan’s  \nattitude, the debate was lost before it had begun.  \nThe  lack  of  debate  or  serious  engagement  with  the  bill  made  it  clear  \nthat the idea of motor racing - or at least the idea of passing legislation for \nmotor  racing  at  such  a  fast  pace  -  was  not  seriously  opposed  by  the  \nrepresentatives  of  the  Manx  people.  The  unprinted  bill  was  passed  by  a  \nLegislative  Council  and  a  House  of  Keys  that  usually  did  the  lieutenant  \ngovernor’s  bidding.  Between  them,  they  had  only  ventured  to  express  \nconcern  about  the  speed  of  the  legislation  and  the  safety  and  cost  of  the  \ntrials. This was also the only time that unprinted legislation was passed by \nTynwald, demonstrating the way in which Raglan exercised his power, the \nwillingness  of  the  Legislative  Council  to  do  what  Raglan  suggested,  and  \nthe weakness of the Keys in the face of the lieutenant governor. After this \nminimal debate, the legislation was signed in Tynwald the next morning.  \nThe  Highway  (Light  Locomotives)  Act  1904  allowed  the  Highway  \nBoard to close public roads for the purpose of racing, from “time to time.” \nHowever,  this  excluded  Sundays  (for  religious  reasons)  and  racing  could  \nonly take place for three days in the year. The Act also allowed for a £20 \nfine to be imposed on anyone in breach of the rules of the law. These were \nrules that were put in place to reduce speed in populated areas and protect \nspectators. The legislation was to expire on 31 December 1904.\n63\n It is fair \nto conclude that no one involved with the legislation or the trials expected \nthis  to  be  more  than  a  one-off,  a  point  that  could  partly  explain  Raglan’s  \nconfidence in the bill being successful and the apparent submission of the \nLegislative  Council  and  the  Keys  when  asked  to  pass  a  piece  of  unseen  \nlegislation.  This  also  helps  account  for  no  discussion  on  the  possible  \neconomic  benefits  of  the  Gordon  Bennett  trials  to  the  island.  Fittingly,  in  \norder  to  pass  the  Act  officially,  a  special  ceremony  was  held  at  Tynwald  \non   5   May   1904,   once   again   showing   that   Raglan   was   prepared   to   \ncompromise Manx political procedures. The Act was passed not on 5 July, \nthe  Manx  national  day,  when  it  was  usual  for  new  Manx  laws  to  be  \npromulgated.  This  was  because  of  the  need  to  hold  trials  before  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n63\n Highway (Light Locomotives) Act 1904, Statutes, Vol. 7, pp. 468-469. \n\nOn the Starting Line: The Origins of the TT Races \n25\nGordon  Bennett  race.  It  was  reported  in  the  Manx  press  that  a  special  \nconvoy   of   motorcars   was   arranged   to   carry   members   of   the   Manx   \nlegislature  to  Tynwald  Hill.\n  64\n  This  was  arranged  by  Julian  Orde,  and  \nmight  be  seen  as  a  final  move  to  seal  the  “deal”  between  Raglan,  elite  \nmembers of the Manx legislature, and the Automobile Club.  \nThere  has  been  a  large  amount  of  comment  on  the  origins  of  the  TT.  \nFor  example,  Robert  Kelly  argues  that  “the  start  of  motorsport  in  the  Isle  \nof  Man  was  a  mixture  of  farce  and  melodrama”,\n65\n  and  this  further  \nexamination  of  the  origins  of  the  races  would  appear  to  substantiate  this,  \nwith  legislation  being  imposed  by  the  lieutenant  governor.  Kermode,  on  \nthe other hand, suggests that there is  a  link  between  the  Highways  (Light  \nLocomotives)  Act  passed  by  Tynwald  in  1904  and  tourism,  stating  that  \n“tourism   which   benefited   from   much   of   the   general   enabling   and   \nregulatory   activity   was   also   the   focus   of   specific   legislation.   The   \nHighways  (Light  Locomotives)  Act  1904  provided  for  the  Island’s  first  \nmotor racing on public roads.”\n66\n That the TT was originally established as \na boost to the island’s tourist industry is an opinion also expressed in much \nof  the  enthusiasts’  literature,  alongside  the  suggestion  that  motor  racing  \nwas  widely  welcomed  by  islanders.  Further  to  this,  enthusiasts’  literature  \nalso  suggests  that  Raglan  was  a  motoring  enthusiast  himself  and  that  he  \nmight  have  spotted  the  potential  of  the  Manx  road  system  for  road  \nracing.\n67\n   It   is   also   argued,   insubstantially   with   little   evidence,   that   \nenthusiasm  for  racing  permeated  through  all  strata  of  Manx  society  and  \nthat some Manx people wanted to offer the motor industry a home and the \nAutomobile   Club   of   Great   Britain   and   Ireland   a   place   to   hold   an   \neliminating  trial,  for  the  1904  Gordon  Bennett  race.\n68\n This  is  barely \nbelievable,  as  is  the  contrary  claim  that  Orde  instead  faced  the  task  of  \nawakening this “Rip van Winkle Island” and stimulating interest in motor \nracing.\n69\n  \nLegislation   passed   in   1904   was   only   designed   to   last   until   31   \nDecember that year, and Manx politicians expected no obvious effects on \nthe  tourist  trade.  This  legislation  was  not  aimed  at  boosting  the  tourist  \ntrade, but rather pandered to a wealthy elite. It was imposed on the Manx \npeople  and,  therefore,  there  was  no  need  to  create  an  interest  in  motor  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n64\n Mona’s Herald, 19 March 1904. \n65\n Kelly, TT Pioneers, p. 39. \n66\n Kermode, Offshore Island Politics, p. 71. \n67\n  P.

One motor sport historian \nclaims that at the time of Orde’s visit there were only two motor vehicles \non  the  island.\n70\n  If  so,  the  Isle  of  Man  would  hardly  be  the  home  of  \nenthusiasts  urging  this  race  upon  the  Manx.  Roads  would  have  to  be  \nclosed and the routine of some Manx people would be disrupted. If racing \ntook  place  in  the  autumn,  the  work  of  farmers  would  be  disrupted.  \nHarvesting  crops  would  have  been  a  much  more  difficult  task  if  roads  \nwere  closed  and  motorcars  were  racing  along  them.  Closing  public  roads  \nfor   motorcar   races   was   an   unprecedented   inconvenience,   yet   an   \ninconvenience Raglan believed would be tolerated by the Manx people. \nIn 1904 then, in order to allow motoring enthusiasts, all of whom were \nmembers of the elite from mainland Britain, to race on the Isle of Man, the \nLegislative  Council  and  to  some  extent  the  House  of  Keys,  driven  on  by  \nRaglan, were prepared to suspend domestic motoring rules and regulations \nfor  three  days  of  the  year,  albeit  for  one  year  only.  They  were  also  \nprepared  to  speed  up  necessary  legislative  procedures.  As  a  consequence  \nof this, what should have taken weeks to be read and considered in a first, \na  second  and  third  reading  was  crammed  into  just  one  day.  This  also  \nresulted  in  very  little  debate  being  produced  in  each  chamber,  which  is  \nreflected  in  the  trivial  number  of  pages  dedicated  to  the  subject  in  the  \nprinted  debates,  the  House  of  Keys  Journal  and  the  Legislative  Council  \nMinutes.\n71\n  It  is  no  wonder  that  Crennell  believed  that  the  Keys  were  \nmaking  a  laughing  stock  of  themselves.  True,  prohibiting  racing  on  a  \nSunday  protected  the  interests  of  the  religious  community  on  the  island.  \nKeeping  racing  to  three  days  a  year  protected  the  interests  of  the  rural  \ncommunity.  Insisting  that  the  organisers  of  the  race  cover  the  expense  of  \nsuch an event protected the Manx from having to use their own money to \npay  for  the  enthusiasm  of  a  few  members  of  the  British  elite.  That,  \nhowever, was all about which the legislators chose to show concern. \n1905: The Motorcycle TT precedent \nThe Highways (Light Locomotive) Act expired on 31 December 1904, \nand  it  was  therefore  necessary  to  consider  new  legislation  when  in  1905  \nthe Automobile Club approached the island for the purpose of racing once \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n70\n Holliday, Racing Round the Island, p. 14. This point is also supported by Manx \nregistration  and  licensing  records.

The Manx authorities were therefore given an early \nopportunity to stop all further motor racing on the Isle of Man, but this did \nnot  happen.  Indeed  the  opportunity  to  prevent  a  repeat  of  the  trials  was  \ngiven little consideration by Raglan, the Legislative Council or the House \nof  Keys.  In  1905  Raglan  did  not  have  to  rely  on  Irish  legislation  to  \nconvince the Council and the Keys to hold racing on the island once again; \nthere  was  now  Manx  legislation  from  1904  that  could  be  renewed.  Those  \nsanctioning  motor  racing  on  the  island  would  also  have  a  clearer  idea  of  \nthe type of activity they were allowing.  \nIn  early  1905  legislation  was  once  again  introduced  in  the  Legislative  \nCouncil by Raglan. This new bill closely followed the 1904 Act, but with \na  couple  of  significant  amendments.  The  Act  did  not  specify  an  expiry  \ndate,  as  was  the  case  in  1904,  but  did  include  a  clause  which  stated  that  \n“the  powers  of  the  [Highway]  Board  shall  not  be  exercised  after  the  \nexpiration  of  one  year  from  the  promulgation  of  this  Act,  unless  the  \nTynwald  court  shall,  by  resolution,  expressly  authorize  [sic]  the  exercise  \nof  the  same.”\n72\n  This  clause  meant  legislation  had  to  be  annually  renewed  \nby Tynwald, giving them power to refuse permission for motor racing on \nthe island if they so wished. Moreover, the three days previously allowed \nfor  motor  racing  were  replaced  by  six,  authorising  three  days  to  be  set  \naside  in  May  and  three  days  in  September  for  motor  racing.\n73\n The \nHighways  (Motor  Car)  Bill  unsurprisingly  again  produced  very  little  \ncomment  in  the  Legislative  Council  and  this  lack  of  questioning  is  again  \nreflected in the limited account in the printed debates.\n74\n \nHowever, in contrast to this and unlike the rushed debate in 1904, the \nKeys  in  1905  were  at  least  given  more  time  to  consider  the  bill,  though  \ndiscussion  was  once  again  limited.  Issues  raised  in  this  debate  indicated  \nsome  antagonism  between  farming  and  the  visiting  industry,  or  between  \nurban  and  rural  interests.  Racing,  if  it  were  to  take  place  in  September,  \nwould   cause   some   disruption   to   the   farming   community,   and   this   \nimmediately caused disquiet amongst the rural section of the Keys. E. M. \nGawne  (Rushen)  voiced  his  concerns,  arguing:  “we  are  not  going  to  let  \npeople  say  that  the  visiting  industry  is  the  paramount  industry,  and  that  \nalone is to be studied. I maintain that farming is the chief industry we have \non  the  Island.”\n75\n  At  the  heart  of  this  matter  was  the  concern,  albeit  \nmisplaced,  that  agriculture  was  suffering  as  a  result  of  investment  in  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n72\n See Highways (Motor Car) Act 1905, Statutes, Vol. 7, pp. 569-571. \n73\n Highways (Motor Car) Act 1905, Statutes, Vol. 7, pp. 569-571. \n74\n Debates, Vol. 22, 1905, p. 545. \n75\n Debates, Vol. 22, 1905, p. 501. \n\nChapter One \n28\ndevelopment  of  the  tourist  industry.  Rural  MHKs  were  eager  to  see  that  \nthe interests of the farming community were not compromised.  \nWhilst  Gawne  believed  that  motor  racing  would  be  detrimental  to  the  \nrural  Manx,  Joseph  Qualtrough  (Rushen)  on  the  other  hand  urged  the  \nHouse  to  take  a  wider  view.  He  claimed  that  racing  would  cause  little  \ndisruption to the public and he went on to state that he believed that where \nracing  was  concerned  the  welfare  of  the  Manx  would  come  first  and  the  \nwelfare of the visitors second.\n76\n It is difficult to believe that this would be \nthe  case,  as  motor  racing  was  once  again  being  imposed  on  the  Manx  \npeople.  Qualtrough  then  offered  very  ambivalent  support  for  the  races  \nstating that:  \n \nI am not at all favourable to the Motor Car Bill; I have no great sympathy \ntowards it. I don’t know really whether if I was put to the test of my own \nfeelings I would vote for it at all. But I believe it will advertise the Isle of \nMan, and if that is so, I believe every member should consider whether we \ncannot secure that benefit, and for that purpose the Bill has my sympathy, \nand for that only.\n77\n \n \nQualtrough believed the races could publicise the island, but at this point it \nwould  have  been  more  a  case  of  publicity  being  the  good  word  of  mouth  \nof those who attended the motor races. It can certainly be argued that there \nwould be much immediate monetary benefit to the Manx economy.  \nDespite  Qualtrough’s  comments  and  despite  legislation  being  made  \npermanent  in  1905,  there  was  still  very  little  indication  that  the  races  \nwould  have  a  big  impact  in  the  future.  Furthermore,  the  1905  legislation  \nhad again been imposed on the Manx. The passage of the legislation again \nshows the power wielded by Raglan, who was once more pandering to the \nwishes  of  members  of  the  British  elite.  There  were  minor  differences  in  \n1905,  which  included  the  fact  that  more  time  was  taken  to  consider  the  \nlegislation, but no opportunity was given to rehearse objections and it was \nstill  inevitable  that  this  new  legislation  would  be  passed.  Once  again,  in  \n1905,  motor  racing  was  imposed  on  the  island.  With  legislation  being  \nmade  permanent,  the  Automobile  Club  now  arguably  had  a  racetrack  on  \nthe Isle of Man.  \nIn  1907  the  first  motorcycle  TT  race  was  held  on  the  Isle  of  Man,  \norganised  by  the  Auto  Cycle  Union  (ACU).  Both  the  Highways  (Light  \nLocomotive)  Act  1904  and  the  Highways  (Motor  Car)  Act  had  provided  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n76\n Debates, Vol. 22, 1905, p. 501. \n77\n Debates, Vol. 22, 1905, pp. 506 -507. \n\nOn the Starting Line: The Origins of the TT Races \n29\nfor “races with light locomotives”\n78\n and also that “public roads within this \nisland may be used for races with motor cars.”\n79\n This therefore enabled the \nfirst  motorcycle  TT  race  to  be  held  on  the  Isle  of  Man  over  a  newly  \ndesigned course, in the west of the island, with apparently no change being \nmade  to  the  legislation.  The  ease  with  which  the  motorcycle  TT  was  \nestablished  suggests  a  further  imposition,  and  no  discussion  over  the  \nholding  of  this  motorcycle  race  has  been  found  in  the  printed  debates.  \nHowever,  minute  books  recording  meetings  of  the  Isle  of  Man  Highway  \nBoard  reveal  that  the  ACU  did  write  to  the  Highway  Board  to  apply  for  \npermission to hold a motorcycle race on 28 May 1907. This letter was read \nin a meeting on 15 May, with the Highway Board granting permission for \nthis race.\n80\n \nThe  origins  of  the  motorcycle  TT  races  are  a  matter  of  some  debate  \nbetween  motor  sport  enthusiasts,  although  it  is  usually  accepted  that  they  \nare   as   follows.   In   1906   the   Auto   Cycle   Club   (ACC)   came   to   the   \nconclusion   that   to   encourage   the   development   of   motorcycles   the   \nmotorcycle  industry  needed  a  similar  race  to  the  motorcar  TT  races  \nestablished  in  1905.  By  1907,  Julian  Orde,  secretary  of  the  Automobile  \nClub,  who  had  been  instrumental  in  bringing  motor  racing  to  the  island,  \nhelped  to  arrange  this  and  persuaded  Raglan  to  designate  for  racing  an  \neighteen-mile  circuit  in  the  west  of  the  island.\n81\n  This  is  one  shortened  \nversion  of  events.  Another  suggests  that  the  TT  races  were  the  brainchild  \nof  the  editor  of  the  Motor  Cycle  magazine  and  that  the  concept  was  first  \nproposed  at  the  annual  ACC  dinner  on  17  January  1907.  The  reason  for  \nthis  proposal  had  much  to  do  with  disenchantment  with  the  International  \nCup race for motorcycles that had been held in Europe since 1904. There \nis little primary material available from which to ascertain a real version of \nevents.  However,  it  might  be  argued  that  Orde  had  a  hand  in  the  \nestablishment   of   this   race,   given   his   involvement   in   1904   and   his   \nrelationship with Raglan. It also cannot be stated with certainty that these \nraces were an imposition as had been the case with motor car races, but the \nlittle  evidence  found  might  suggest  that  this  is  likely.  The  origins  of  the  \nmotorcycle TT therefore lie firmly in the origins of motorcar racing on the \nIsle of Man.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n78\n Highway (Light Locomotives) Act 1904, Statutes pp. 468-469. \n79\n Highways (Motor Car) Act 1905, Statutes, vol.

Legislation was renewed annually by \nTynwald,  in  conjunction  with  the  lieutenant  governor,  and  permission  \ngranted  to  the  RAC  and  indeed  the  ACU  to  organise  motor  car  and  \nmotorcycle  races  to  take  place  on  the  Isle  of  Man.\n82\n  However,  a  boycott  \nled  by  motorcycle  manufacturers  in  1912  threatened  the  continuation  of  \nthe  motorcycle  TT  and  caused  Tynwald  to  reassess  the  importance  of  \nstaging the event on the Isle of Man.  \nIn January 1912 the vicar general, a member of the Legislative Council \nand chairman of the Highway Board, put forward a resolution in Tynwald \nto permit the extension of the 1905 legislation for a further year. It will be \nrecalled  that  this  annual  renewal  of  legislation  by  Tynwald  had  been  a  \nstipulation of the 1905 legislation, thus allowing motorcycle races to take \nplace  annually  up  to  1912.\n83\n  After  the  vicar  general  had  put  forward  the  \nresolution  and  in  the  same  sitting  of  Tynwald,  Raglan  introduced  a  letter  \nhe  had  received  from  the  Manufacturers’  Union.\n84\n Deemster  Moore  read \nthe  letter  to  members  of  Tynwald,  making  them  aware  of  the  attitude  of  \nthe  Manufacturers’  Union  towards  the  TT  and  the  Union’s  proposal  to  \nboycott the event. It was pointed out that in the opinion of members of the \nManufacturers’  Union,  it  was  “contrary  to  public  interests  that  such  road  \nraces should be held in future.”\n85\n This conclusion had been reached for the \nfollowing reasons: \n \n1.

The  public  require  [sic]  no  further  demonstration  of  the  extraordinary  \nspeed at which the modern motor bicycle may be driven. \n3. If the utmost speed of which the motor-cycle is capable is required to be \ndemonstrated,  it  can  be  done  without  undue  risk,  and  without  any  public  \ninconvenience,  on  an  enclosed  and  specially  constructed  track,  such  as  \nexists at Brooklands. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n82\n  The  Automobile  received  Royal  patronage  in  1908  and  thus  changed  its  title  to  \nthe  Royal  Automobile  Club  (RAC).  The  Auto  Cycle  Club  (ACC)  also  renamed  \nitself the Auto Cycle Union (ACU) in the same year. \n83\n Debates, Vol., 23 Jan. 1912, pp. 186-196. \n84\n This was the British Cycle and Motor Cycle Manufacturers’ and Traders’ Union, \nwhich will be referred to as the Manufacturers’ Union throughout. \n85\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 186. \n\nOn the Starting Line: The Origins of the TT Races \n31\n4.  It  is  contrary  to  public  prejudice  to  associate  the  word  “tourist”  with  a  \nspeed of nearly 60 miles an hour. \n5. Young and heedless men in all parts of the country, hearing of the speed \nattained  under  special  circumstances  in  the  Isle  of  Man,  are  tempted  to  \nemulate that speed on ordinary roads, with the result that all other users of \nthe highroads suffer considerably.\n86\n  \n \nThe reasons why this letter was sent to Raglan are unclear. What is clear, \nhowever,  is  that  the  Manufacturers’  Union  was  becoming  unsure  that  the  \nmotorcycle   TT   races   served   any   purpose   to   manufacturers.   The   \nManufacturers’ Union had presented Tynwald with an opportunity to stop \nthe TT at this early stage. \nMembers  of  the  Manx  legislature  did  not  share  the  opinions  of  the  \nManufacturers’   Union.   Instead   they   were   actually   keen   to   see   the   \ncontinuation  of  the  TT  on  the  island.  Kerruish,  MHK  for  South  Douglas,  \nsuggested  that  the  Union’s  letter  should  be  ignored,  stating  that  “I  have  \nsome experience of that Society, and I know what it is, and I think we may \ndisregard  it  absolutely.”\n87\n  Quite  what  this  comment  referred  to  is  unclear.  \nIn  further  discussion  of  the  resolution  MHKs  and  MLCs  voiced  both  \nsupport  and  objections  towards  the  continuation  of  the  TT  on  the  island,  \nsuggesting that a more open debate was permitted, but also that members \nof Tynwald on the whole were by then accepting the lieutenant governor’s \nimposition.  \nThe vicar general had earlier made his support clear when introducing \nthe  resolution.  He  pointed  out  that,  “the  [Highway]  Board  recognise  that  \nthere  is  a  considerable  body  of  opinion  throughout  the  Island  probably  \nagainst  holding  these  competitions”  but  this  was  not  important  as  “on  the  \nother hand, they [the Highway Board] are fully aware that there is a strong \nbody of opinion in favour of these races, and they also recognise that these \ncompetitions  are  of  very  great  benefit  to  the  people  of  the  Island  in  one  \nway or other.”\n88\n The vicar general was confident that, in asking for the TT \nto  be  continued  on  the  island  and  in  asking  that  roads  be  closed  at  some  \ninconvenience  to  some  islanders,  he  still  had  the  support  of  at  least  the  \nmajority of the island’s residents.  \nThe  attorney  general  and  Deemster  Moore,  both  members  of  the  \nLegislative  Council,  and  Crennell  and  Clucas  from  the  House  of  Keys,  \nraised  objections  to  the  continuation  of  the  TT.  The  attorney  general  did  \nnot  support  the  TT  because  he  believed  the  Isle  of  Man  was  being  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n86\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 186. \n87\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 190. \n88\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 187. \n\nChapter One \n32\nexploited as a result of the refusal of the British government to permit road \nracing  in  England.  The  organisers  of  these  races  had  taken  advantage  of  \nthe  island’s  constitutional  position.  He  also  believed  that  a  great  deal  of  \ninconvenience  was  caused  by  the  holding  of  the  TT  on  the  island.  His  \nobjections  were  that  the  debate,  which  in  his  opinion  had  sunk  to  the  \n“most  sordid  level  possible  to  imagine”,  took  into  account  the  financial  \ngain   that   could   be   made   from   the   races   but   did   not   consider   the   \ninconvenience  the  races  caused  to  the  island’s  residents.  He  also  argued  \nthat “it is not a matter of right or wrong, or consideration for the comfort \nof the people of the Island, but a mere matter of getting a little money. It is \nthe principle that supports Monte Carlo, because it pays all the rates at the \nexpense  of  vice.”\n89\n  We  can  clearly  see  that,  in  the  mind  of  the  attorney  \ngeneral at least, the Isle of Man was gaining a reputation for doing things \ndifferently, for seeking to be distinctive. By staging the TT the Manx held \nan  event  that  would  not  be  permitted  elsewhere.  The  attorney  general,  \nhowever, was not prepared to support the TT simply because of the belief \nthat the event might advertise the island.  \nMHKs  Crennell  and  Clucas  had  their  own  reasons  for  not  supporting  \nthe  continuation  of  the  TT.  Crennell  was  confused  by  the  actions  of  the  \nHighway  Board,  stating  that  “one  thing  which  [he  had]  not  been  able  to  \nunderstand is the mysterious way in which the Highway Board moves, in \nthat  it  allows,  and  did  allow  last  year,  a  race  for  motor  cycles  but  \nprohibited  a  race  for  motor  cars.”\n90\n  Crennell  went  on  to  argue  that,  in  his  \nopinion,  and  as  far  as  residents  along  the  road  were  concerned,  “the  \nmotorcyclist  [was]  infinitely  more  objectionable  than  the  motor  car-ist  \n[sic],  and  so  far  as  experience  in  this  Island  goes  for  anything,  racing  by  \nmotor cycle seems to be more dangerous than racing by motor car.”\n91\n The \nHighway  Board,  it  might  be  suggested,  were  pursuing  an  agenda  that  \nwould see motorcycle racing maintained on the island. The Board did not \nhave  the  support  of  all  MHKs,  and  this  was  not  forthcoming  because  \nmotor races on the island were deemed to be an inconvenience to some.  \nIn  1912  there  was  a  more  open  and  transparent  debate  over  the  future  \nof  the  TT,  and  we  can  see  much  greater  discussion  over  the  future  of  \nracing on the Isle of Man than had been the case in 1904, 1905 and 1907. \nThere  was  active  support  for  the  continuation  of  the  TT  by  members  of  \nTynwald,  although  objections  were  put  forward  most  notably  by  the  \nattorney  general,  a  member  of  the  Legislative  Council.

Such  objections  were  not  persuasive  \nenough  when  a  vote  was  taken  on  the  question  of  the  TT’s  future.  The  \nresolution for legislation to be renewed for a further year, had not received \nunanimous  support  in  Tynwald,  but  it  was  only  the  attorney  general  and  \nDeemster  Moore  from  the  Legislative  Council  who  objected,  and  the  \nKeys’ majority when a vote was taken at the end of the debate was secured \nby fourteen votes to two, with Clucas, representative of the rural sheading \nof  Rushen,  and  Crennell,  representative  for  Ramsey,  objecting.\n92\n We  can \nsee  that  MLCs  and  MHKs  in  1912  were  largely  supportive  of  what  had  \nbeen  imposed  in  1904.  Support  for  the  races  was  voiced  strongly  by  \nKerruish,  MHK  for  South  Douglas,  and  his  advocacy  offers  the  first  hint  \nof  a  division  between  rural  and  urban  interests  in  the  TT  in  Tynwald.  \nMajority  endorsement  on  this  occasion  does  not  imply  that  the  TT  had  \nbecome  firmly  accepted  politically  although,  as  we  shall  see  in  the  next  \nchapter,  some  members  were  beginning  to  stress  the  economic  benefits  \nthat the Isle of Man might derive from a continuation of the sport. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n92\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 196.  \n\nCHAPTER TWO \nP\nICKING UP SPEED: \nE\nCONOMICS AND IDENTITY  \n \n \n \nAt  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century  tourism  was  beginning  to  \nestablish itself as the island’s largest source of income. From around 1896 \nthe Manx economy entered a period of specialisation, a phase that saw the \ngrowing  dependence  of  the  Manx  economy  on  tourism  as  a  result  of  the  \ndecline  of  primary  and  secondary  industries  such  as  mining,  manufacturing  \nand fishing. For example, in 1826 the Manx fishing fleet had consisted of \n250  boats  and  employed  2,500  men.\n1\n  However,  during  the  mid-1880s  the  \nfishing  industry  entered  a  period  of  steady  decline  and,  Kinvig  states,  by  \n1911  the  number  employed  in  the  fishing  industry  had  fallen  to  1000,  \nalthough statistics taken from the 1901 and 1911 censuses show that there \nwere only 864 and 525 people employed in this industry respectively (see \ntable  2-1).  Indeed,  Kinvig  also  notes  that  in  1914  the  Manx  fishing  fleet  \nwas made up of only 57 boats.\n2\n There was, then, a considerable decline in \nthe island’s fishing industry.  \nThis  decline  was  joined  by  the  decline  of  numbers  employed  in  \nmining,  an  industry  that  had  been  prosperous  during  the  mid-nineteenth  \ncentury.  During  the  1870s  and  1880s  Laxey  mines  recorded  their  highest  \nproduction  figures  for  lead,  zinc  and  silver.  The  value  of  the  ore  shipped  \nfrom  Laxey  in  this  period  has  been  estimated  as  £90,915,  and  the  annual  \nvalue  of  production  in  the  Foxdale  mines  was  £40,000.\n3\n  It  has  also  been  \nestimated  that  the  mining  industry  as  a  whole,  between  1855  and  1880,  \nemployed   almost   1000   men.\n4\n   These   levels   of   prosperity   were   not   \nmaintained. The Foxdale mines closed in 1911 by which date Laxey mines \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n R.H.

Census \ndata also shows that the number of people employed in mining or related \nindustries was also declining. In 1901 a total of 769 people were employed \nin  this  sector  of  the  economy,  but  this  number  had  fallen  to  522  in  1911.  \nBy  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century  mining  no  longer  employed  a  \nsignificant number of the island’s workforce (see table 2-1).  \nThe development of the island’s tourist industry was facilitated by the \nfinancial  reforms  of  1866,  under  the  Customs,  Harbours  and  Public  \nPurposes Act passed on the instigation of Lieutenant Governor Loch. This \nallowed  for  government  investment  in  harbour  works  and  the  opening  up  \nof  the  island  to  larger  numbers  of  tourists  from  the  north  of  England.\n6\n In \ncontrast  to  the  fortunes  of  other  industries  on  the  Isle  of  Man,  tourism  \nunderwent  a  rapid  expansion  during  the  period  between  1900  and  1914,  \nand  the  Isle  of  Man  became  a  popular  tourist  destination,  alongside  the  \ndevelopment  of  English  seaside  resorts  such  as  Blackpool.\n7\n The  boarding \nhouses in Douglas are described by Walton as being noted for “informality \nand  easy  mixing,  [...]  the  impressive  boarding  houses  along  the  Loch  \npromenade  took  in  between  50  –  100  visitors  at  a  time”,  which  was  in  \nsharp   contrast   to   “the   usual   middle   class   concern   for   privacy   and   \nexclusiveness.”\n8\n Indeed, such was this growth of tourism during the latter \npart  of  the  nineteenth  century  that  the  Commission  on  Local  Industry,  \nreporting in 1900, concluded that the visiting industry had grown so much \nthat it was becoming increasingly difficult to employ those involved in the \nindustry during the off-season.\n9\n This report also noted, “owing to the great \ndemand  for  labour  with  the  successful  visiting  industry,  the  extension  of  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n5\n J.W.

Total  visitor  \nnumbers  show  that  in  1900  the  island  received  351,238  visitors,  which  \nincreased  to  a  record  number  of  634,512  in  1913,  the  highest  recorded  \ntotal  between  1900  and  1960.  Between  1900  and  1914  tourist  figures  did  \nnot  fall  below  350,000.\n11\n  Census  data  also  demonstrates  the  development  \nof  this  industry,  showing  a  rise  in  those  employed  in  occupations  loosely  \ntermed under the heading food, tobacco, drink and lodging, from 2,729 in \n1901  to  3,801  in  1911  (see  table  2-1).\n12\n  This  is  a  rise  of  1000  people  \nproviding  such  services  on  the  Isle  of  Man  during  a  period  when  visitor  \nfigures were steadily rising suggesting that during the pre-war period, the \nisland’s economy was becoming concentrated on tourism. Also interesting \nto note is that in the printed record of visitor figures for the period 1887 – \n2003,  the  years  1904,  1905  and  1907  are  pointed  out  as  significant  dates,  \nbecause  of  the  establishment  and  holding  of  motor  races  on  the  island.  \nHowever,  the  statistics  show  that  visitor  figures  were  already  increasing  \nafter 1900, regardless of motor races, and so the motor races held in these \nyears had little role in boosting tourist figures, although the origins of the \nTT have been closely associated, by some scholars, with the development \nof the island’s tourist industry.\n13\n \nManx Economic Interests \nThe lack of debate around the passage of legislation in 1904 and 1905 \nmeant  that  very  few  capitalist  interests  in  holding  motor  races  on  the  \nisland   were   recognised   by   members   of   Tynwald.   It   must   also   be   \nremembered  that  legislation  passed  in  1904  was  only  valid  until  31  \nDecember  that  year.  Few  if  any  economic  benefits  would  be  had  from,  \nholding  motor  races  on  the  Isle  of  Man  in  one  year,  and  it  is  not  \nunreasonable to expect these not to be considered by members of Tynwald. \nIt should therefore be asked whether or not, in 1904 and 1905 members  \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n10\n Commission on Local Industries, 26 March 1900. \n11\n Isle  of  Man  Summer  Passenger  Arrivals  1887  –  Present,  (Douglas,  Economic  \nAffairs Division; Isle of Man Government, 2007).  \n12\n Census  1901:  Islands  in  the  British  Seas:  Isle  of  Man,  Jersey,  Guernsey  and  \nAdjacent  Islands,  (London,  H.M.S.O,  1903);  Census  1911:  Islands  in  the  British  \nSeas:  Isle  of  Man,  Jersey,  Guernsey  and  Adjacent  Islands,  (London,  H.M.S.O,  \n1913).  \n13\n Kermode, Offshore Island Politics, p. 71.  \n\nPicking Up Speed: Economics and Identity \n37\nTable 2-1: Occupations of males and females (10 years +) 1901-1911 \n \n \nSource: Isle of Man Census Data 1901 and 1911 \n\nChapter Two \n38\nof  Tynwald  identified  any  economic  value  to  the  island  in  motor  racing,  \nand further whether these interests developed up to 1914.  \nAs discussed above, the Highways (Light Locomotives) Act 1904 was \npassed  in  one  day,  and  with  little  debate  in  the  Legislative  Council  or  \nHouse of Keys. Legislation was imposed on the Manx legislature, and the \nspeed  with  which  the  legislation  was  passed  and  the  lack  of  open  debate  \nmake it clear that there was little time to consider the contribution, if any, \nthe   event   might   make   to   the   Manx   economy.   In   1904   Radcliffe,   \nrepresentative  for  Ayre  did  claim  that  the  bill  was  a  matter  of  great  \nimportance  to  the  island  believing  that  it  would  be  “a  means  of  bringing  \nover  a  class  of  visitor  that  will  be  of  very  great  benefit.”\n14\n  This  is  not,  \nhowever,  a  statement  from  which  we  can  deduce  that  Radcliffe  was  \nencouraging  the  use  of  motor  sport  in  publicising  the  island.  Equally  it  \ncannot be argued that, in 1904, there was any belief amongst members of \nTynwald  that  such  an  event  would  help  attract  visitors  to  the  island.  This  \nmotor race was only a trial for the Gordon Bennett Race. It was therefore \nnot  an  international  race  such  as  had  been  held  in  Ireland  in  1903.  It  \nshould also be noted that this was an opinion voiced only by one member \nof  the  Keys.  It  provides  little  evidence  that  the  passing  of  legislation  and  \nthe  holding  of  a  motor  race  on  the  island  were  geared  towards  the  \ndevelopment  of  the  tourist  trade,  as  suggested  by  Kermode  who  claims  \nthat the 1904 legislation facilitated the development of the island’s tourist \nindustry,\n15\n  and  by  Kelly  who  argues  that  the  Manx  government  had  \napproached the 1904 trials with “an eagerness for new tourist business but \nan uncertainty over what to expect.”\n16\n \nThere  was  more  open  debate  over  the  passing  of  legislation  in  1905,  \nand  this  allowed  MLCs  and  MHKs  to  voice  their  opinions.  It  must  be  \nremembered, however, that motor racing had only once taken place on the \nIsle  of  Man  before  the  suggestion  that  further  legislation  be  passed  in  \n1905.  Gawne  (Rushen)  had  expressed  concerns  over  the  impact  of  motor  \nraces  on  rural  communities,  especially  since  they  were  to  be  held  in  \nSeptember  in  1905.  As  already  reported,  Gawne  had  argued,  “we  are  not  \ngoing to let people say that the visiting industry is the paramount industry, \nand that alone is to be studied. I maintain that farming is the chief industry \nwe have on the Island.”\n17\n Contrary to Gawne’s opinion, Qualtrough urged \nthe  House  to  take  a  wider  view,  pointing  out  that  whilst  he  was  not  \nfavourable  to  the  Motor  Car  Bill,  he  believed  that  it  “would  advertise  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n14\n Debates, Vol. 21 15 March 1904, p. 453. \n15\n Kermode, Offshore Island Politics, p. 71.  \n16\n Kelly, TT Pioneers, p. 39. \n17\n Debates, Vol. 22, 1905, p. 501. \n\nPicking Up Speed: Economics and Identity \n39\nIsle  of  Man,  and  if  that  is  so,  I  believe  every  member  should  consider  \nwhether we can secure that benefit.”\n18\n  \nBoth  Qualtrough  and  Gawne’s  opinions  echoed  the  conflicting  views  \nof  the  Commission  on  Local  Industry’s  enquiry,  which  had  reported  in  \n1900. The report stressed that the tourist industry had reached such a point \nthat  the  demand  for  labour  in  connection  with  this  industry  made  it  \ndifficult to obtain labour in other areas of the economy. The Commission \nalso judged that there was no way in which the mass of unskilled workers \nthat  faced  unemployment  at  the  end  of  the  tourist  season  could  be  \nemployed  in  the  winter.\n19\n  The  tourist  industry  was  indeed  becoming  the  \nchief  industry  on  the  island,  but  this  was  not  necessarily  a  welcome  \ndevelopment.  Statistics  in  the  1901  and  1911  censuses  show  that  there  \nwere almost twice the number of people employed in “food, tobacco, drink \nand lodging” than in the fishing industry (see table 2-1). It might therefore \nbe argued that motor racing may have been geared towards the enrichment \nof this industry, but very little was said so positively in the debate.  \nThe Highways (Motor Car) Act 1905 was renewed each year with the \nconsent  of  Tynwald  and  the  lieutenant  governor,  and  allowed  motor  car  \nraces,  and  after  1907  motorcycle  races,  to  take  place  on  the  Isle  of  Man  \neach year. As there was little debate over the renewal of legislation and the \ncontinuation of motor racing on the Isle of Man, it is difficult to trace how \nfar members of Tynwald discerned an economic value in the continuation \nof these events. It can, however, be noted that there was no effort made on \nbehalf of the Manx government to advertise the TT alongside the island’s \nother  attractions  during  this  period.  This  was  a  step  that  would  not  be  \ntaken  until  1922.\n20\n  In  1912,  however,  the  Manx  legislature  was  faced  by  \nthe  possible  termination  of  the  motorcycle  TT,  and  there  was  an  open  \ndebate to consider this matter in Tynwald. On this occasion members were \nquick  to  point  out  the  economic  benefits  of  continuing  to  hold  the  \nmotorcycle TT on the island, which by then had still only been running for \nfive years. \nSurprisingly,  when  the  origins  of  motor  racing  on  the  Isle  of  Man  are  \nconsidered,  it  was  not  just  members  of  the  Legislative  Council  who  \noffered their support for the TT in 1912. The majority of MHKs present in \nthe debate also supported the continuation of the event. In 1910, Kerruish \n(South  Douglas)  put  forward  a  proposal  in  Tynwald,  without  the  consent  \nof  the  lieutenant  governor  that  the  Board  of  Advertising’s  budget  should  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n18\n Debates, Vol., 22, 1905, p. 501. \n19\n Commission on Local Industries Report, 26 March 1900. \n20\n Pre-war Board of Advertising Minute Books makes no reference to the TT races.  \n\nChapter Two \n40\nbe  raised  from  £750  to  £1,750  per  year,  showing  his  keenness  to  see  the  \nisland  well-advertised.\n21\n  Now,  in  1912,  he  stated  that  “I  think  that  the  \nwhole  Court  will  agree  that,  from  a  financial  point  of  view,  and  from  an  \nadvertising point of view, nothing better has happened to the Isle of Man \nthan  these  motor  and  cycle  races  which  his  Excellency  was  fortunate  to  \nsecure  for  us  in  the  first  instance.”\n22\n  Kerruish  was  here  offering  a  \nretrospective  endorsement  of  what  Raglan  had  imposed  in  1904.  He  \nclaimed that the event brought a large amount of revenue to the island. He \nadmitted that: \n \nIt is impossible to say with any exactness how many people were brought \n[to the island], but it is easy to get the minimum computation. There were \n150 competitors at least; each of those competitors involved a party of six, \nwhich  makes  900  people  directly  interested  in  the  races.  They  were  here  \nfor  six  weeks,  but  putting  them  down  at  10  –  12  days,  each  one  of  them  \nwould spend 15s or £1 a day. There you have £10,000 spent in the Isle of \nMan.  Now,  put  that  alongside  of  what  you,  farmers,  get  extra  for  a  calf  \nfrom a premium bull, and where are you? [Laughter].\n23\n \n \nKerruish’s  comment,  which  was  met  with  light-hearted  agreement  in  \nTynwald,  shows  an  early  division  between  rural  and  urban  interests  in  \nTynwald.  It  was  implied  that  more  money  could  be  made  from  holding  \nmotor  racing  events  on  the  island  than  could  be  made  from  farming.  \nKerruish viewed the £10,000 spent by those who came to the island to take \npart in the TT as a good enough reason for the races to continue. This was \nnot as large a sum as would be generated by the races in future years, but \nthe  money  would  be  spent  in  Douglas  and  it  is  therefore  reasonable  to  \nassume  that  it  would  largely  benefit  Kerruish’s  constituents.  The  TT  was  \nthen, in Kerruish’s opinion, far more profitable than agriculture. Kerruish \nwas not alone by 1912 in stressing the potential economic value of the TT \nfor the Isle of Man. The vicar general, for example, argued that: \n \nI  do  not  say  that  they  [the  TT  races]  do  not  cause  some  noise  and  \ndiscomfort;  but,  speaking  from  a  financial  point  of  view,  there  can  be  no  \ndoubt that benefit is derived from the large number of persons coming over \nhere and from the money expended in connection with this competition.\n24\n  \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n21\n Kermode, Offshore Island Politics, p. 71.  \n22\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 January 1912, p. 189. \n23\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 January 1912, p. 189. \n24\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 187. \n\nPicking Up Speed: Economics and Identity \n41\nEven though the TT races were still a small affair, it was being claimed \nthat  the  economic  benefits  to  be  had  from  the  TT  outweighed  the  \ndiscomfort  caused  to  residents.  We  might  also  suggest  that  the  money  \nspent  in  connection  with  the  competition  would  mostly  be  retained  by  \nbusinesses  located  in  Douglas  the  island’s  largest  town  (Fig.  2-1).  This  \nlocalised  advantage  was  certainly  picked  up  on  by  some  critics.  Clucas  \nopposed the TT’s continuation, and his objections were based partly on the \nexploitation of the Isle of Man by the ACU and the Automobile Club, but \nalso  because  he  reckoned  the  races  benefited  only  Douglas,  and  no  other  \nareas of the island: \n \nI never could see why this Island should be made the playground of these \npeople,  either  the  Automobile  Society  or  the  Auto  Cycle  Society,  or  that  \nmanufacturers  or  traders  should  use  it  as  a  ground  for  testing  their  \nmachines.  The  hon.  member  for  South  Douglas  states  that  a  great  deal  of  \nmoney is spent on the Island as a result of this race. I have no doubt that as \nfar as that applies to Douglas, it is right; but of the other parts of the Island \neven  this  cannot  be  said  in  their  favour  and  people  along  the  route  of  the  \nrace have to suffer the inconvenience.\n25\n  \n \nNevertheless,  the  TT  was  supported  because,  in  the  view  of  most  \nmembers  of  Tynwald,  they  were  profitable  for  the  island  and  therefore  \nnecessary. In the words of the Vicar General, “we [the Manx] live entirely \nby  our  attractions,  and  by  obtaining  whatever  prominence  we  can  get  for  \nthe  attractions  that  we  have  to  offer.  We  are  really  an  entertaining  place,  \nand  we  depend  for  our  livelihood  on  our  power  to  attract  visitors.”\n26\n \nKerruish  had  relayed  on  a  rumour  that  the  French  were  keen  to  run  the  \nevent and that the corporation of Dieppe was even prepared to subsidise a \nTT race to the amount of £4,000. He argued that “I do not know how far \nthat  this  statement  is  true,  but  at  any  rate  they  [the  French]  are  extremely  \nanxious to take our leavings, if we are saucy enough to reject this event.”\n27\n \nAccordingly,  Tynwald  endorsed  the  holding  of  the  TT  races  again  in  the  \nsummer of 1912.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n25\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 192. \n26\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 194.  \n27\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 192. \n\n42\nFig. 2-1: Pop\nu\n \nSource: Cen\ns\nand Adjacent \n \nTotal Populat\nMa\nMotorca\n1914.

The \n1905  International  Cup  Race  at  Dourdon  was  won  by  the  Austrian  rider  \nWondrick,  and  this  gave  Austria  the  right  to  stage  the  1906  race.  The  \nproblem  faced  by  the  Auto  Cycle  Club  (ACC)  in  Britain  was  finding  a  \nvenue  to  hold  trials  for  this  forthcoming  race;  the  Automobile  Club  had  \nfaced  a  similar  problem  for  motor  races  in  1904.\n29\n  These  trials  could  not  \nbe held alongside the motor car Tourist Trophy race, as had been the case \nin  1905,  because  the  car  races  were  not  due  to  be  held  until  September  \n1906 and trials earlier in this year were needed. The ACC did not have the \nfunds  to  organise  its  own  race  on  the  Isle  of  Man,  a  possible  location  \nbecause  of  the  legislation  that  had  been  passed  in  1904  and  1905.  Their  \nproblem was solved by the Hon Arthur Stanley, the Club’s president, who \narranged  for  a  short  speed  course  to  be  laid  out  in  the  grounds  of  \nKnowsley  Hall.  The  team  was  selected  at  these  trials,  and  travelled  to  \nAustria,  but  it  enjoyed  little  success.  The  Austrian  course  was  poor  and  \ncomplaints  were  made  that  the  Austrian  riders  had  received  unauthorised  \noutside assistance. Subsequently, “just as the Gordon Bennett Trophy had \ndone,   the   International   Cup   disappeared   into   limbo.”\n30\n The   Gordon \nBennett motorcar races had given way to the Tourist Trophy car races in \n1905 and, as we have seen, in 1907 the International Cup was replaced by \nthe  motorcycle  Tourist  Trophy  (TT)  race,  held  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  The  \ninterest   of   manufacturers   in   organising   this   race   now   needs   to   be   \nexplained.  \nThe   dissatisfaction   with   the   International   Cup   and   the   desire   of   \nmotorcycle  enthusiasts  to  hold  a  race  of  their  own  led  Freddie  Straight,  \nsecretary  of  the  ACC,  and  the  Marquis  de  Mouzilly  St.  Mars,  who  \nprovided a trophy for the event, to work hard to organise the first TT race \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n28\n  Such  advertisements  can  be  found  in  The  Times  from  the  beginning  of  the  \nmotorcar Tourist Trophy in 1905 up to 1914.

At  this  time  the  membership  of  the  ACC  \nnumbered 350 and the annual subscription was £1. It was hoped then that \nthe  entry  fees  for  the  TT  along  with  donations  would  cover  the  cost  of  \nrunning  it.  The  rules  for  the  races  caused  several  arguments  between  \norganisers  and  competitors,  but  they  were  all  concerned  with  improving  \nthe  motorcycle  as  a  mode  of  transport.  Questions  were  asked  about  such  \nmatters  as  the  length  of  the  course,  engine  capacities,  weight  limits  and  \neven  the  size  of  mudguards.  Eventually  it  was  agreed  that  the  deciding  \nfactor  in  the  race  would  be  fuel  consumption;  a  far  cry  from  the  modern  \nrace  which  focuses  on  speed.  An  agreement  was  reached  which  divided  \nthe  race  into  two  classes;  the  first  for  single-cylinder  machines  and  the  \nsecond  for  multi-cylinder  machine.  It  was  also  decided  that  the  prize  for  \nthis  event  would  be  £25  for  each  of  the  winners  and  £15  and  £10  for  the  \nrunners up. \nOn  this  basis  the  motorcycle  TT  took  place  each  year  between  1907  \nand  1911,  and  attracted  teams  put  together  by  prominent  manufacturers.  \nJudging only from the list of prize winners, many of the famous (and some \nless   famous)   motorcycle   manufacturers   shared   the   honours:   Norton,   \nMatchless,  Triumph  and  Indian  taking  most  spots,  but  also  making  their  \nmark were Vindec, Rex, D.O.T, B.A.T, F.N, Humber and Forward. Riders \nhad successfully navigated a twisting and hilly course of over 150 miles in \nraces  lasting  initially  over  five  hours  and  at  average  speeds  which  over  a  \nmere  five  years  considerably  increased.\n31\n In  1911, The  Motor  Cycle \nconfirmed  the  purpose  of  the  races  when  it  argued  that  “it  is  generally  \nconceded   that   the   TT   racer   of   today   possesses   features   which   are   \nembodied  eventually  in  the  flexible  roadster  of  a  year  or  two  later...That  \nbeing  the  case,  there  is,  of  course,  more  raison  d’etre  for  the  race  than  \nappears  at  first  sight.”  It  was  also  claimed  “what  has  placed  the  British  \nmotor  industry  in  its  premier  position  is  nothing  more  or  less  than  first-\nclass reliable workmanship, assisted by competitions such as the TT races, \nthe 1,000 miles trials, and other events.”\n32\n \nHowever,  in  August  1911,  at  a  meeting  of  the  motorcycle  section  of  \nthe  Manufacturers’  Union,  a  proposal  was  put  forward  that  motorcycle  \nmanufacturers should boycott the TT, despite the existence of a report that \nadmitted  that  the  1911  TT  had  been  well  organised  and  that  invaluable  \nassistance had been given to the organisers by local residents, “cheerfully \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n31\n  It  has  to  be  conceded  that  the  list  on  results  does  not  indicate  whether  the  \nwinning  machines  were  entered  by  private  owners  or  manufacturers:  either  was  \nallowed.  \n32\n Motor Cycle, 7 September 1911, p.922. \n\nPicking Up Speed: Economics and Identity \n45\nand   conscientiously.”\n33\n   There   were   a   number   of   reasons   for   this   \ndissatisfaction, which were discussed by the Manufacturers’ Union and in \nthe  motorcycle  press.  First,  the  TT  did  not  continue  to  serve  its  intended  \npurpose  that,  as  we  have  seen  earlier,  was  to  improve  the  design  of  the  \nmotorcycle.  The  report  of  the  Manufacturers’  Union  on  the  1911  TT,  \nstated  that  this  had  been  run  as  a  race  which  from  a  mechanical  point  of  \nview   was   in   fact   not   a   race   that   sought   to   improve   the   “touring”   \nmotorcycle  but  a  “race  to  destruction”,  which  demonstrated  the  weakest  \npart of a machine “under extravagant conditions, not met by any tourist.”\n34\n \nIndeed,  an  article  in  The  Motor  Cycle  reported  that  “the  members  of  the  \nManufacturers’  Union  who  are  prepared  to  abstain  are  not  antagonistic  \ntowards racing, but they are of the opinion that the conditions of the Isle of \nMan  races  are  not  conducive  to  the  best  results,  i.e.,  the  perfection  of  a  \ntourist  mount”,  and  for  this  reason  it  was  declared  that  the  title  ‘tourist  \ntrophy’  was  a  “farcical  misnomer.”\n35\n  Evidently,  the  consequences  of  \nfailure  for  the  many  outweighed  the  virtues  of  success  for  the  few.  \nDissatisfaction  with  a  race  preoccupied  with  speed  was  also  expressed  in  \nthe letter sent by manufacturers to Raglan in 1912 (see above), which had \nregretted the emphasis that was placed on speed and which concluded that \nthe  TT  was  a  bad  influence  on  young  consumers.  It  was  also  pointed  out  \nthat motorcycle manufacturers were not getting as much publicity from the \nevent  as  they  might  have  hoped  for:  “The  average  newspaper  report”  it  \nwas  stated  was  “most  inadequate,  frequently  inaccurate  and  particularly  \nuninteresting’. Usually two lines is sufficient to report the race but a whole \ncolumn is devoted to hair-breadth scrapes and fatal accidents.”\n36\n  \nSecond, there was also some indication in the motorcycle press that the \ncosts  involved  in  preparing  for  the  TT  were  also  becoming  prohibitive.  \nThe  cost  of  travelling  to  the  island  was  considerable  in  comparison  to  \ncompeting   at   a   track   such   as   Brooklands.   These   expenses   included   \ntransporting and housing teams in boarding houses on the island during the \none  or  two  weeks  of  racing  and  shipping  motorcycles,  spare  parts,  tools  \nand  other  “impedimentia”  [sic]  across  the  water.  If  the  race  were  to  be  \nheld at Brooklands, expenditure would be less, even if the teams had to set \nup their base there for a week or so.\n37\n Furthermore, it was not just the cost \nthat was prohibitive but also the opportunities for debauchery presented in \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n33\n Report  of  the  Secretary  of  Motor  Cycle  Section  of  Manufacturers’  Union,  \nMinutes Book 1909-1912.  \n34\n Report of the Secretary of Motor Cycle Section of Manufacturers’ Union.  \n35\n Motor Cycle, 19 Oct. 1911, p. 1132.  \n36\n Report of the Secretary of Motor Cycle Section of Manufacturers’ Union. \n37\n Motor Cycle, 7 Sept. 1911, p. 922.  \n\nChapter Two \n46\nDouglas.  It  was  reported  in  The  Motor  Cycle  that  the  Manufacturers’  \nUnion believed that “the general holiday surroundings at a sea-side resort \nlike Douglas are not conducive to that thorough training and self-restraint \nwhich a severe contest like the TT race imposes on those who take part in \nit.”\n38\n  It  was  argued  that,  whilst  no  one  could  object  to  a  little  harmless  \namusement  during  TT  week,  some  forms  of  amusement  did  not  promote  \nthe health and sobriety of the competitors. It was felt therefore that a few \nriders  who  could  not  resist  temptation  “instead  of  coming  to  the  starting  \npost with clear heads and strong nerves, are physically unfit to take part in \nany    strenuous    form    of    competition.”\n39\n Tension    existed   between \nmanufacturers who saw the TT as a test bed for their machines and those, \nthe  riders,  who  liked  to  enjoy  their  stay  on  the  island.  Here  then  was  a  \nboycott,  which  threatened  the  continuation  of  the  TT,  even  though,  as  we  \nhave seen, the Manx legislature endorsed its continuation. \nThis state of affairs was not maintained for long. Early in 1912, on the \ninstigation  of  a  representative  from  Triumph,  the  manufacturers  who  had  \nsigned the original bond were released from it.\n40\n However, manufacturers \nwere  not  released  from  the  bond  early  enough  to  participate  in  the  1912  \nTT.  It  is  clear  from  the  discussion  above  that  motorcycle  manufacturers  \nviewed the TT as a test bed for their machines. Evidently they would not \ncommit  themselves  to  the  event  when  speed  was  the  only  issue  to  be  \ntested.  The  1912  boycott,  however,  was  only  a  minor  disagreement  with  \nthe purpose of the race. Manufacturers returned in 1913 and 1914 to race \non  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  there  was  the  presence  of  Indian,  Sunbeam,  AJS  \nand Royal Enfield. Clearly the commercial benefits associated with the TT \nwere too good to reject. \nWe  can  also  see  that  motorcycle  manufacturers  were  keen  to  stage  a  \nrace in which the design and reliability of the motorcycle would be tested, \nand the motorcycle press, motorcycle manufacturers and the Manufacturers’ \nUnion  also  believed  that  this  was  the  purpose  of  the  TT  race.  By  1912,  \nhowever,  it  was  believed  that  the  TT  had  become  a  test  of  speed.  The  \nmanufacturers’  boycott  of  the  TT  in  1912  highlights  their  reluctance  to  \naccept the TT as a test bed merely for speed. However, the entry of teams \nby several manufacturers in 1913 and 1914 suggest that they were finding \nthe TT irresistible as a showcase for their machines.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n38\n Motor Cycle, 26 Oct. 1911, p.1132.  \n39\n Motor Cycle, 26 Oct. 1911, p.1132.  \n40\n  Meeting  of  Motor  Cycle  Section,  Feb.  21  1921,  Manufacturers’  Union  Minute  \nBook 1909-1912. \n\nPicking Up Speed: Economics and Identity \n47\nManx identity and the TT \nIt  will  be  suggested  later  that  two  rival  place-myths  emerged  on  the  \nIsle of Man, as the TT became a distinctive ingredient in Manx identity.\n41\n \nHowever, as the TT remained a small affair during the pre-war years, the \nevent did not yet come to form part of the island’s place-myth, or feature \nsignificantly  in  the  way  the  island  was  represented  culturally  by  people  \noutside  or  inside  the  Isle  of  Man.\n42\n  The  discussion  here  will  draw  on  the  \nkey  components  of  Manx  identity  during  this  period,  drawing  most  \nsignificantly  on  the  concept  of  “consumed”  national  identity,  that  is  the  \n“consumption” rather than the “embodiment” of sport in national identity, \nlooking most specifically on incidents that took place in 1908 and 1912.\n43\n \nIt  will  be  shown  first  that,  up  to  a  point,  the  island’s  Celtic  and  Norse  \nculture was most celebrated during this period, but also that motor racing \non the island was defended by some Manx spokespersons because holding \nsuch   events   highlighted   the   island’s   independence   from   the   UK.   \nParadoxically, motor racing was opposed for precisely the same reason. In \neither case motor racing was not judged as a sporting event or even as an \neconomic  opportunity  but  as  indicative,  one  way  or  another,  of  Manx  \ndistinctiveness  and  separation  from  the  UK.  It  will  also  be  shown  that  by  \n1914  only  in  the  motorcycle  press,  and,  to  a  lesser  extent  in  some  of  the  \nnational UK press was the Isle of Man recognised as being peculiarly the \nhome of motor races.  \nFirst  of  all,  it  must  be  pointed  out  that  motor  racing  historians  have  \ncasually assumed that holding competitive motorcycle races on the Isle of \nMan from 1907 was not a problem for the Manx people. They were, it is \nsaid,  “starting  to  get  used  to  the  idea  of  their  homeland  becoming  the  \nworld  centre  for  motor  sport”,  presumably  because  motorcar  races  had  \nbeen held on the island since 1904. Apparently “road closures, barricades, \nambulance  stations  and  marshals  were  considered  the  norm,  not  in  the  \nleast inconvenient and a small price to pay, particularly if it meant putting \nthe Island on the map for the, by now, improving visitor arrivals.”\n44\n There \nis,  however,  no  robust  evidence  to  support  such  claims,  though  it  is  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n41\n  John  Urry  puts  forward  the  idea  that  tourist  destinations  are  marketed  in  a  \nparticular  way.  See  J.  Urry,  Consuming  Places,  (London,  Routledge,  1995);  J.  \nUrry, The Tourist Gaze, (London, Sage, 2002).  \n42\n See Urry, Consuming Places; Urry, Tourist Gaze.  \n43\n  This  concept  is  discussed  in  J.  Tuck,  ‘Making  Sense  of  Emerald  Commotion:  \nRugby Union, National Identity and Ireland’, Identities: Global Studies in Culture \nand Power, 10, (2003), pp. 495-515.  \n44\n Beighton and Douglas, “You Couldn’t do it Now”, p. 34. \n\nChapter Two \n48\nplausible  that  repetition  and  experience  did  make  vested  interests  in  the  \nIsle  of  Man  more  welcoming  and  the  body  of  the  Manx  public  more  \ntolerant  of  an  event  that  had  been  imposed  on  them.  However,  when  we  \nlook  more  closely  at  the  way  the  island’s  Board  of  Advertising  marketed  \nthe Isle of Man and at the Celtic renaissance that took place on the island \nduring  the  pre-war  years,  it  become  less  credible  that  the  Manx  people  \n“welcomed”  the  TT  races,  despite  the  island’s  growing  association  with  \nmass tourism.\n45\n  \nThe  1898  Isle  of  Man  Official  Guide  introduced  the  island  in  the  \nfollowing way. It stated that: \n \nThe beauty-loving Italians of the South have a proverb – ‘See Naples, and \ndie’  ...  It  is  the  Manxman,  who,  beyond  question,  dwells  in  one  of  the  \nloveliest lands on the earth’s wide surface. He, too, can boast of a country \nwhose scenery is so uniquely beautiful, so diversified in aspect, so rich in \nhistorical  associations  and  in  the  memories  of  a  greater  past,  that  we  can  \nsympathise  with  the  patriotic  Italian,  and  echo  his  proud  boast  –  ‘See  \nManxland, or you have missed one of the brightest spots on earth’\n46\n \n \nWe can immediately see here the construction of the Isle of Man as a place \nthat  had  great  natural  beauty  and  a  distinctive  history,  and  these  were  \npromoted  as  reasons  to  visit  the  island.  This  construction  was  maintained  \nin a 1902 Board of Advertising lecture entitled “Picturesque Mona.” In the \nbooklet  that  accompanied  this  lecture  it  was  stated,  “Of  all  places  in  the  \nUnited  Kingdom  there  is  none  more  adapted  for  the  enjoyment  of  a  \nSummer  Holiday  than  this  picturesque  Island.  Here  every  taste  may  be  \ngratified.”  It  went  on  to  describe  further  the  natural  attractions  of  the  \nisland,   pointing   out   that   “the   Artist   will   find,   in   its   well-rounded   \nmountains, its rolling landscape and charming glens, ample inspiration for \nhis  pencil.”  The  naturalist  and  botanist,  it  was  noted,  would  find  ample  \nscope for their studies, the geologist would find a wide range of interesting \nfeatures, and the archaeologist could take pleasure in the island’s druidical \ncircles and runic remains. The Island was also “unrivalled for yachting and \nrowing;  river,  bay  and  deep  sea  fishing;  bathing,  coaching,  cycling,  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n45\n  Further  comment  on  the  reaction  of  some  in  the  island  to  the  development  of  \nmass   tourism   can   be   found   in   J.   Belchem,   ‘“The   Playground   of   Northern   \nEngland”:  The  Isle  of  Man,  Manxness  and  the  Northern  Working  Class’,  in  N.  \nKirk  (ed.),  Northern  Identities:  Historical  Interpretations  of  ‘The  North’  and  \n‘Northernness’, (Aldershot, Ashgate, 2000), pp. 71 – 86.  \n46\n Isle of Man Official Guide 1898, issued by the Board of Advertising.  \n\nPicking Up Speed: Economics and Identity \n49\ngolfing,  cricketing  and  mountaineering.”\n47\n  We  can  see  a  construction  of  \nthe  Isle  of  Man,  before  motor  racing  was  introduced  that  focuses  on  \nhistory  and  natural  beauty.  Indeed,  this  remained  unchanged  even  after  \n1904. Official guides published annually during the pre-war years always \nfocused on the more traditional aspects of the island, with no reference at \nall to motor racing or specifically to the TT in the pre-war decade.\n48\n \nThe  pre-war  years  also  saw  the  first  phase  of  the  Manx  renaissance.  \n(The second and third phases took place during the inter-war and post-war \nperiods).\n49\n Efforts were made to revive the Manx language and other more \n“traditional”  aspects  of  Manx  culture.  This  was  partly  a  reaction  to  the  \nisland’s development as a working-class tourist destination, and partly as a \nresult  of  the  Manx  elite’s  desire  to  engage  in  the  wider  Celtic  revival  \ntaking  place  in  the  late  nineteenth  century.\n50\n  This  “renaissance”  might  \nhave  attracted  a  better  class  of  visitor  by  bringing  the  more  traditional  \nattractions  of  the  island  to  the  forefront,  ahead  of  the  dancing  halls  and  \ndrinking  establishments  frequented  by  the  working-class  tourist.  This  \nwould  have  defined  the  island’s  difference  to  resorts  such  as  Blackpool  \nand  Morecambe,  which  could  not  boast  of  a  Celtic  and  Norse  past.\n51\n As \nBelchem puts it: \n \nWithout    abandoning    ‘high’    and    polite    cosmopolitan    norms,    the    \ngentlemanly  antiquarians  of  the  ‘Manx  renaissance’  of  the  late  nineteenth  \nand    early    twentieth    centuries    girded    themselves    against    cultural    \nanglicanisation  through  assertion  of  ethnic  Celticism,  a  project  which  \ntended to downgrade Norse contributions to the island’s past.\n52\n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n47\n  ‘“Picturesque  Mona”:  Some  Beauty  Spots  on  the  Isle  of  Man’,  (Isle  of  Man  \nBoard of Advertising, 1902), p.3-4.  \n48\n See Isle of Man Official Guides 1900 – 1914.  \n49\n These phases are pointed to in G.

One way in which these gentlemanly antiquarians, such as \nA.W.  Moore,  protected  themselves  against  “anglicanisation”  was  through  \nthe   establishment   of   the   Manx   Language   Society,   Yn   Cheshaght   \nGailckagh (YCG).\n53\n Broderick suggests that the establishment of the Manx \nLanguage  Society,  with  A.W.  Moore  as  its  chairman,  marked  the  first  \nphase  in  the  revival  of  the  Manx  language.\n54\n  The  establishment  of  this  \nsociety was influenced by the wider Celtic revival emanating from Ireland \nin the late nineteenth century. The aims of YCG were to preserve Manx as \nthe  national  language  of  the  Isle  of  Man  and  to  study  existing  Gaelic  \nliterature and cultivate modern Manx literature. YCG also sought to have \nManx taught in schools, to promote Manx music and songs and to collect \nrelevant  oral  literature  from  the  Manx  people.  The Isle  of  Man  Examiner \nalso  promoted  the  Manx  language,  printing  a  column  in  Manx  and  \nincluding  material  on  Manx  folklore.\n55\n  However,  there  was  a  gradual  \ndecline in enthusiasm for the Manx language, epitomised by the folding of \nthe  journal  Mannin  in  1917,  which  had  been  published  by  YCG  since  \n1913,  after  the  death  of  its  editor  Sophia  Morrison.\n56\n This  journal  had \nincluded  reports  of  the  Manx  language  society,  and  articles  commenting  \non Manx culture and traditions.  \nYCG  in  seeking  to  revive  the  Manx  language  failed  to  recognise  the  \nfact  that  the  majority  of  the  island’s  population  had  abandoned  the  Manx  \nlanguage in favour of English in order to grasp the economic opportunities \npresented  by  tourism.\n57\n  Indeed,  census  data  supports  this.  From  this  we  \ncan see that of a total population of 51,409 (over the age of three years) in \n1901 only 59 spoke Manx only, 4,598 Manx and English, and 46,699 only \nEnglish.  In  Douglas,  the  island’s  largest  urban  area,  there  were  17,068  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n53\n  A.W.  Moore  (1853  -  1909)  was  an  historian  and  Manx  scholar.  He  published  a  \nlarge  amount  of  work  concerning  the  history,  culture  and  traditions  of  the  Isle  of  \nMan,  including  his  two  volumes  work  A  History  of  the  Isle  of  Man.

There was no equivalent of the Gaelic \nAthletic  Association,  which  had  been  established  in  Ireland  in  1884  by  \nMichael  Cusack  who  was  convinced  that  the  spread  of  English  sport  in  \nIreland  was  damaging  national  morale.\n62\n  Even  A.W.  Moore  admitted  in  \nThe Folk-Lore of the Isle of Man that “there is nothing peculiar about the \noutdoor  games  of  either  young  or  grown-up  Manxmen  and  Manxwomen,  \nand  they  are,  therefore,  of  little  interest  from  the  Folk-Lorist’s  point  of  \nview.”\n63\n  There  was  no  folk  dancing  on  the  island  either.\n64\n  It  might  have  \nbeen expected that, alongside the revival of the Manx language, there was \nthe revival or establishment of other societies, but that did not happen.\n65\n  \nDespite  the  rather  gloomy  picture  that  has  been  painted  above,  there  \nwere  ingredients  that  made  the  Isle  of  Man  distinctive.  It  had  its  own  \nhistory  and  the  importance  of  this  was  exemplified  in  the  work  of  A.W.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n58\n Census  1901:  Islands  of  the  British  Isles:  Isle  of  Man,  Jersey,  Guernsey  and  \nAdjacent Islands, (London, H.M.S.O, 1903).  \n59\n Census 1921: Isle of Man, (London, H.M.S.O, 1924).  \n60\n  I.

Carmichael (eds.), Language and Nationalism in Europe, (Oxford, \nOxford  University  Press,  2000).  Contrary  to  this,  however,  Ernest  Renan  argues  \nthat  language  is  one  aspect  that  does  not  define  a  nation,  citing  the  example  of  \nSwitzerland’s multi-lingual society, E. Renan, ‘What is a nation?’, in H.K. Bhabha \n(ed.), Nation and Narration, (London, Routledge, 1990). \n\nChapter Two \n52\nMoore.\n66\n  The  island  was  also  full  of  natural beauty and natural history as \nwas noted in the Isle of Man Guidebooks and advertising for the island. Of \ncourse there was also a distinctive Manx polity. The Isle of Man was home \nto and indeed very proud of Tynwald its Norse Parliament, which had met \ncontinuously  for  over  900  years  by  now.  The  Tynwald  ceremony  was  \ncarried  out  annually  on  5  July,  where  new  legislation  was  read  to  the  \nManx  people.  These  elements  provided  the  ingredients  by  which  identity  \nwas  constructed  during  the  pre-war  years,  and  it  was  the  Tynwald  \nparliament  that  made  the  Isle  of  Man  especially  distinctive,  and  this  \nlegislative  independence  was  very  important,  as  episodes  in  1908  and  \n1912 reveal. \nThe “Isle of Manslaughter” \nIn 1908 the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) promoted a motor car race \nwhere speed was most important and fuel consumption did not matter. The \n1908 TT race for motorcars, which became known as the “four-inch race” \nas  a  result  of  cars  with  more  powerful  four-inch  cylinder  engines  being  \nraced,  was  scheduled  to  take  place  in  September  1908.  However,  on  12  \nAugust  1908,  Motoring  Illustrated  reported  that  racing  at  the  Brooklands  \nracetrack in Surrey had been marred by fatalities and also on the same day \nat the Dieppe circuit in France. This had a bearing on the TT race that, in \nthe   opinion   of   Motoring   Illustrated,   “could   not   be   passed   over   in   \nsilence.”\n67\n  The  race  at  Brooklands  had  also  seen  the  5.8  litre  Napier,  \n“Little  Dorrit”,  achieve  speeds  of  up  to  83  mph.  As  the  1908  race  was  to  \nbe  run  without  any  limitations  being  put  on  motor  cars,  save  those  on  \ncylinder dimensions, the “four inch race” would be all about speed, rather \nthan  reliability  or  fuel  consumption  as  had  been  the  case  in  the  past.  As  \nthis  was  the  case,  it  was  estimated  that  speeds  of  over  60  mph  had  to  be  \nachieved to even contemplate winning. Nor could it be claimed that what \nwas  being  raced  were  models  subsequently  to  be  commercially  available.  \nMotoring  Illustrated  believed  that  the  organisers  of  the  event,  the  RAC,  \nhad   to   take   responsibility   for   anything   that   might   happen   to   the   \ncompetitors   or   the   spectators.\n68\n   This   provided   the   background   for   \ndemands, made by The Times for racing to be stopped on the Isle of Man. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n66\n  See  A.W.

The \nTimes felt  that  a  motor  race  in  which  cars  could  attain  speeds  of  80  mph  \nwas of considerable danger. However, it was acknowledged that there was \nno easy way to bring about its cancellation.\n69\n First, the UK authorities did \nnot constitutionally have the power to prohibit the race in the Isle of Man \nsince the island was not part of the UK. The Times suggested that even if \nthey did have the power they would not exercise it. The Home Office was \nunlikely to get involved in an event that took place on the Isle of Man, and \nwas the enthusiasm of a wealthy sporting elite. Moreover, the programme \nof  racing  had  already  been  arranged  with  the  sanction  of  the  island’s  \nlieutenant  governor  and  the  Isle  of  Man  Highway  Board.  The  Times \nindicated that these authorities would have a natural reluctance to reverse \ntheir  decisions.  Furthermore,  The  Times  believed  that  the  races  had  \nregrettably  come  to  be  supported  by  at  least  some  of  the  Manx  people.  \nAfter  all  “catering  for  strangers  is  one  of  the  most  important  of  Manx  \nindustries and the inhabitants rely largely upon the harvest they reap from \nthe  summer  visitors.”\n70\n  The  Steam  Packet  Company  benefited  from  \ntransporting people to the races; hotels and boarding houses put them up. \nThe Times estimated the amount of money spent in the island as a result of \nthe  races  was  £5000.  “The  question  arises  what  reason  is  there  for  \nsummarily  putting  an  end  to  an  event  from  which  the  people  derive  so  \nmuch pleasure and profit?”\n71\n The answer was that despite the profits made \nfrom the races by the Isle of Man, if indeed this was the case, the four-inch \nrace was not aimed at the development of the motor car, but rather at a few \nmembers  of  an  elite  group  getting  around  the  Isle  of  Man  as  fast  as  they  \ncould putting themselves and others at risk. \nInterestingly The  Times  also  insisted  that  motor  racing  was  becoming  \nembedded  in  a  Manx  sense-of-self.  It  was reported  that  the  view  of  the  \nManx people towards the cancellation of the race would be one of “almost \nuniversal opposition ... A few carping critics here and there may be found \nto  raise  objections  to  the  races  but  by  the  vast  majority  of  the  Manx  \npopulation  the  races  are  looked  forward  to  with  the  greatest  interest.”\n72\n \nEvidently The  Times  believed  that  most  of  the  Manx  wished  to  see  the  \nraces go ahead, yet there is little evidence to suggest that the Manx people \nwere   strongly   in   favour   of   motor   racing.   Certainly   the   possible   \ncancellation  of  the  four-inch  race  was  rarely  mentioned  in  Tynwald  or  in  \nthe  Manx  press.  However,  two  letters  were  published  in  The  Isle  of  Man  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n69\n The Times, 24 August 1908, p. 9. \n70\n The Times, 22 August 1908, p. 9. \n71\n The Times, 24 August 1908, p. 6. \n72\n The Times, 24 August 1908, p. 6. \n\nChapter Two \n54\nWeekly Times, which indicated some support for motor races on the island. \nBoth were attributed to “a dweller beside the motor track.” The first letter \nstated the absurdity of cancelling the races in 1908: \n \nThe idea of stopping the motor race is too absurd to be given consideration \nfor a moment. The whole island is on the lookout for them, on the Qui Vive \nas  some  would  say  ...  I  am  totally  against  pandering  to  England.  The  \nservile  following  of  precedents,  a  failure  of  the  present  day,  making  what  \nHorace calls a servile pecus – a servile horde following England in place of \nleading  her,  as  well  I  know  to  have  been  the  case  in  by-gone  days,  and  a  \ngreater mistake was never made, proved by the fact that when in the Island \ncosts  of  living  and  other  things  differed,  retired  officers  and  their  families  \ncame to live there; but ... when the tendency is to make all as much alike \nas  possible  none  will  come.  ...Vindicate  your  home  rule!  Stop  following  \nEnglishmen and have your motor races and any others you like!\n73\n  \n \nThe second letter commented on the issue of safety surrounding the four-\ninch race. Once again support for the races was offered, but in rather more \nmacabre terms: \n \nThe English papers seem to lay great stress upon the dangers of the motor \nraces.  If  men  avoided  all  danger,  they  would  never  go  to  battle,  or  ride  a  \nhunt  or  a  race  or  go  out  to  sea  on  a  rough  day  or  go  up  in  a  balloon.  The  \npoint is to keep the public out of danger and if that is properly done, no one \nshould  mind  if  the  races  only  get  some  spills  as  men  do  in  the  hunting  \nfields or the race field. Should most unfortunately death befall, man is but \nmortal: and how often in the train on shore or the ship in the sea does death \ntake place suddenly and unexpectedly. Still people go in them.\n74\n \n \nFrom  these  letters  it  is  apparent  that  the  continuation  of  the  race  was  \nimportant  to  some  of  those  living  on  the  island.  The  first  highlights  the  \nsense  that  the  presence  of  this  motor  race  on  the  island  made  the  Isle  of  \nMan  unique.  Moreover,  because  the  races  aggravated  the  English,  this  \nalone seemed justification enough for them to go ahead. Even the potential \nfor fatalities, the subject of the second letter, as a result of increased speed, \nhad little effect on the desire of some of the Manx to see motor racing take \nplace  on  the  island  once  again  in  1908.  It  is  therefore  possible  to  argue  \nfrom  this  evidence  that  what  had  been  imposed  by  Raglan  in  1904  was  \nnow  being  accepted  by  some  of  the  islanders.  Indeed,  this  can  be  taken  \nfurther  to  suggest  that  already  some  of  the  Manx  were  defending  their \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n73\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 12 September 1908, p. 4. \n74\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 12 September 1908, p. 4. \n\nPicking Up Speed: Economics and Identity \n55\nraces  as  part  of  their  independent  identity.  It  seems  that  in  this  instance  \n“Home Rule” might be taken to mean anything including motor racing that \nmight irritate the English.  \nThis was, however, far from an acceptance of motor racing as such by \nthe Manx people, rather it was a further insistence on difference from the \nUK.  The  events  of  1908  show  more  than  the  fact  that  the  TT  had  been  \ngiven  the  new  dimension  of  speed.  They  also  show  that  only  four  years  \nafter  racing  had  been  imposed  on  the  island,  the  Isle  of  Man  was  slowly  \nbecoming  associated,  externally,  with  motor  racing.  While  the  Manx  \npublic  or  even  the  Manx  authorities  were  not  yet  consciously  promoting  \nmotor racing as part of their identity, it may be argued that the two letters \npublished  in  The  Weekly  Times  show  that  a  minority  of  the  Manx  were  \nbeginning to defend the races, as a distinguishing feature of Manx identity \nand the product of its separate history.  \nWhen  the  Manx  legislature  sought  to  defend  the  continuation  of  the  \nevent in 1912, issues of independence and identity were again raised. Even \nthe attorney general, who objected to the TT in 1912, accepted that the TT \nattracted   some   local   support   because   it   made   the   island   distinctive.   \nHowever, his opposition was similarly based on the notion that the Isle of \nMan  was  independent  and  special.  The  TT  was  “so  objectionable,  so  \ndangerous,  not  only  to  the  people  who  engage  in  it  but  to  the  public,  and  \nso  disturbing  to  the  reasonable  comfort  of  the  people,  that  the  British  \nParliament will not listen to it, and the only chance is to come to the Isle of \nMan,  the  opinion  formed  of  us  being  ‘Oh,  you  will  get  anything  there  as  \nlong  as  it  advertises  the  Island’.”\n75\n  This  was  an  objection  not  merely  to  \nmotorcycle racing on the Isle of Man but to the implicit degradation of the \nManx   implied   in   tolerating   an   intrusion   from   outside   that   was   not   \nacceptable  on  the  mainland.  He  did  not  defend  the  motorcycle  TT  as  a  \ndistinguishing Manx event to be defended against external critics.  \nAs  we  have  seen,  although  manufacturers  boycotted  the  1912  TT  it  \nwas  decided  by  the  ACU  to  hold  the  races  subject  to  them  being  given  \npermission  by  the  island  authorities.  The  Motor  Cycle  felt  little  reason  to  \ndoubt that this permission would be granted “as the hospitable little island \nis  only  too  glad  to  welcome  the  ACU  and  the  attendant  crowd  of  \nmotorcyclists which follows”,\n76\n once again highlighting, as The Times had \nin  1908,  the  TT’s  growing  association  with  the  tourist  industry.  Further  \nindication  of  the  island’s  external  association  with  motorcycle  racing  is  \ngiven in the following statement printed in The Motor Cycle: \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n75\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, pp. 193-194.  \n76\n Motor Cycle, 9 November 1911, p. 1165. \n\nChapter Two \n56\nThe Union would not be fulfilling its duty if it allowed such a magnificent \nevent  as  the  Tourist  Trophy  to  sink  into  oblivion.  This  event,  which  is  \nlooked   forward   to   with   the   greatest   interest   by   practically   every   \nmotorcyclist in the United Kingdom and the British dominions beyond the \nseas, is the only road race we are allowed to have. It is a test for man and \nmachine  which  can  be  obtained  in  no  other  way,  and  beside  it  a  long-\ndistance race on Brooklands is dreary, tame and boresome to a degree.\n77\n \n \nClearly,  this  “magnificent  event”  was  beginning  to  have  a  bearing  on  \nthe  way  outsiders,  especially  motorcycle  enthusiasts,  viewed  the  Isle  of  \nMan. This was not as yet an internally projected viewpoint; Manx opinion \non  the  TT  as  an  expression  of  their  community  remained  ambivalent.  \nCertainly  the  Manx  authorities  were  not  yet  promoting  the  island  as  the  \nhome of motorcycle racing, although this was the way that motor cycling \nenthusiasts viewed the Isle of Man. What this does show is that what had \nbeen  imposed  in  1904  had  now  become  an  externally  recognised  part  of  \nManx identity, in the motorcycling community at least.  \nConclusion to Part One \nIn  1907  an  arrangement  of  “Mylecharaine”,  the  most  popular  and  \nversatile of Manx songs, was adopted as the Manx National Anthem – “O \nland  of  our  birth,  O  gem  of  God’s  earth,  O  Island  so  strong  and  so  fair;  \nBuilt as firm as Barrule, thy throne of Home Rule.”\n78\n The line “thy throne \nof  Home  Rule”  may  be  seen  as  a  reference  to  the  desire  of  reformists  to  \nmaintain   their   independence   from   the   UK   parliament.   Those   Manx   \nscholars  involved  with  the  Manx  renaissance  during  the  early  twentieth  \ncentury  sought  to  highlight  the  island’s  distinctiveness  by  promoting  its  \ntraditional  Gaelic  language  and  culture.  Yet  it  was  Tynwald,  the  Manx  \nlegislature  and  the  focal  point  of  the  island’s  Norse  identity,  which  met  \nevery  year  on  5  July  to  promulgate  Manx  laws  in  a  perpetuation  of  an  \nancient  Norse  ceremony  that  with  very  little  effort  brought  the  island’s  \nseparateness  to  the  foreground  by  passing  legislation  for  motor  racing  on  \nthe island, in one day, in 1904. This decision would, unintentionally affect \nconstructions   of   Manx   identity   during   the   following   century   more   \nstrongly, it might be argued, than language or culture. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n77\n Motor Cycle, 9 November 1911, p. 1165. \n78\n  F.

Although  a  couple  of  objections  were  raised  to  the  \npassage  of  legislation  in  both  1904  and  1905,  members  of  the  Legislative  \nCouncil and the Keys chose to do little to stop the legislation being passed. \nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  A.W.  Moore,  who  was  involved  in  the  Manx  \nrenaissance  and  who  actively  sought  to  promote  the  island’s  history  and  \nfolklore, was speaker of the House of Keys (1898 – 1909), and yet even he \ndid  little  to  obstruct  motor  racing  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  Moreover,  by  1912  \nthere  were  members  of  Tynwald  who  were  prepared  to  support  the  \ncontinuation of the TT and this support was offered for economic reasons; \nit  was  their  belief  that  the  TT  would  bring  prosperity  to  the  island.  This  \nsupport  was  not  unanimous  and  there  were  dissenting  voices,  and  these  \nwere  not  confined  to  the  Keys  but  were  also  heard  in  the  Legislative  \nCouncil. Nevertheless, politically, between 1904 and 1914, at least on the \nquestion of the TT races, what had begun as an imposition was gradually \nbecoming subject to a more open debate in Tynwald. But these issues were \nset-aside during World War One. In 1914 the ACU wrote to the Highway \nBoard “as a consequence of the war the committee had decided not to hold \nthe proposed Cycle Cup races on 24 September.”\n79\n It remained to be seen \nwhether,  why  and  with  what  effects  the  TT  races  were  resumed  after  the  \nwar.\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n79\n Highway Board Minutes, 23 September 1914. \n\n\n\nPART II \nB\nETWEEN THE WARS,  \n1919-1939 \n \n \n \nWe  do  not  know  any  ground  on  which  the  public  can  be  deprived  of  the  \nuse  of  the  highway  for  such  a  purpose  [motor-cycle  racing]  in  any  part  of  \nthe country – the Isle of Man has put itself in this respect beyond the pale \nof civilisation. \n—Solicitors’ Journal, 12 July 1924 \n \nThese  races  are  a  splendid  advertisement  for  the  Island  and  no  better  \nadvertisement  could  be  had.  I  am  quite  in  favour  of  it,  and  wish  it  every  \nsuccess. \n—Manx Debates, November 1921 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCHAPTER THREE \nT\nHE ACCELERATION OF DOMESTIC SUPPORT \n \n \n \nThe TT races took place during the summer of 1914, but the outbreak \nof World War One later that year inevitably disrupted the continuation of \nthe event, and there was no TT between 1915 and 1919. This gap in racing \nmight have led to the end of the races if there had been no political support \nfor  their  resumption  after  World  War  One  or  if  there  had  been  doubts  \nabout   the   potential   economic   value   of   the   races   for   motorcycle   \nmanufacturers and the Manx economy, even if the TT had not yet become \nan  ingredient  of  Manx  identity. Although there were a number of reasons \nwhy the TT might not have been held again on the Isle of Man after World \nWar  One  –inconvenience  to  the  Manx,  the  expense  and  questionable  \nbenefits  to  manufacturers  –  there  was  a  body  of  people,  both  in  the  \nmotorcycling  community  and  on  the  Isle  of  Man,  who  wished  to  see  the  \nTT  resumed.  This  chapter  will  ask  how  politically  the  races  came  to  be  \nrestarted  in  1920  and  how  they  were  sustained  until  1939.  Were  they  \npolitically imposed as had been the case in 1904 or were they the result of \na  greater  political  consensus  in  their  favour?  Was  increased  political  \ndebate  the  product  of  a  consensual  political  commitment  and  was  the  \ndefence   of   the   TT   by   members   of   the   Manx   legislature   a   further   \ndemonstration of their importance politically? Here focus is placed on the \nmechanics  of  political  decision-making  in  support  of  resumption  and  \ncontinuation of the TT.  \nStructure and Practice of Government \nFirst,  it  must  be  asked  whether  the  revival  of  the  TT  races  and  their  \nsubsequent development were due to a further authoritarian imposition or \nif they reflected a greater degree of political support by other elements of \nthe  Manx  government  –  the  lieutenant  governor,  Legislative  Council  and  \nthe   House   of   Keys   working   together   and   collectively   agreeing   on   \nresumption   and   continuation.   The   changing   practice   of   the   Manx   \nlegislature is one factor that substantiates the argument that the revival of \n\nThe Acceleration of Domestic Support \n61\nthe  TT  in  1920  and  its  subsequent  continuation  were  largely  due  to  a  \npolitical consensus in favour rather than being yet again an imposition.  \nThe  resignation  of  Lieutenant  Governor  Raglan  in  1919  “came  as  a  \nthunderbolt  to  his  immediate friends and caused consternation to some of \nhis associates in the Legislature”, but in other quarters it gave “the liveliest \nsatisfaction,  and  raised  hopes  of  progress  which  had  long  smouldered  in  \nthe  political  and  public  life  of  the  Island.”\n1\n  Samuel  Norris,  a  prominent  \nradical, was quick thereafter to seize the opportunity to press for reform.\n2\n \nIn  a  letter  to  the  home  secretary,  Edward  Shortt,  Norris  expressed  “the  \nfervent hope that [the next lieutenant-governor] will be appointed only for \na  term  of  years,  as  unanimously  recommended  by  the  Home  Office  \nDepartmental Committee in 1911.”\n3\n Norris went on to ask that \n \nthe occupant, during his Governorship, may revert to the high traditions of \nthe  British  Civil  Service  as  shown  by  Governors  Loch,  Walpole  and  \nRidgeway; and that he may be instructed to associate the representatives of \nthe people of the Island in his Government, and carry out, forthwith, those \nconstitutional,  judicial and  social  reforms,  so  long  promised  to  the  people  \nof the Island and so long postponed. \n4\n \n \nRaglan was replaced by Major-General Sir William Fry and would stay in \nthe post until 1926. The home secretary reportedly told Fry that “the state \nof  affairs  in  the  Island  was  not  satisfactory;  and  he  expected  the  new  \nGovernor   to   take   early   steps   to   bring   about   a   greater   measure   of   \ncontentment.”\n5\n  \nThis  greater  measure  of  contentment  was  to  be  brought  about  by  the  \nimplementation  of  reforms  recommended  by  the  MacDonnell  Committee  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n S.

No  National  Archive  records  \nhave been found for the appointment of Fry.  \n\nChapter Three \n62\nin their 1911 report.\n6\n Raglan was judged by many reformers to be the main \nobstacle   to   change,   and   it   was   his   obduracy   that   had   caused   a   \nconstitutional crisis in 1911.\n7\n Thus, the period before World War One had \nbeen marked by agitation for constitutional, fiscal and social reform in the \nIsle  of  Man.  Raglan  had  defined  his  role  in  the  colonial  tradition,  but  the  \nlieutenant  governors  of  the  inter-war  period  were  by  comparison  “liberal  \nin  outlook,  sympathetic  to  the  interests  of  the  Island  and  more  willing  to  \nbe  advised  by  the  elected  representatives  of  the  Manx  people.”\n8\n After  the \nreplacement  of  Raglan  by  Sir  William  Fry,  constitutional  change  looked  \nmore likely to take place. It has been further suggested that in this period \n“a  new  Lieutenant-Governor,  a  reform-minded  House  of  Keys  and  a  \nreconstituted  Legislative  Council  co-operated  to  deliver  a  package  of  \nsocial and economic reforms that were to transform the role of the state in \nManx  society.”\n9\n  It  is  not  the  transformation  of  the  role  of  the  state  that  is  \nimportant here, but the suggestion that the new lieutenant governors were, \nunlike Raglan, sympathetic to and willing to co-operate with the different \nsections of the legislature. \nThe  formal  structure  of  the  Manx  legislature  remained  the  same  –  \nlieutenant  governor,  Legislative  Council,  House  of  Keys  and  Tynwald  –  \nbut  from  1919  the  practice  of  government  changed.\n10\n The  lieutenant \ngovernor was now only to be appointed for a fixed term of seven years, as \nrecommended  by  the  MacDonnell  Committee.  He  remained  head  of  the  \nexecutive,   but   further   changes   between   the   wars   required   more   \ncooperation  between  the  elements  of  the  constitution.  For  example,  Fry  \nsupported  the  passage  through  the  Legislative  Council  of  the  Isle  of  Man  \nJudicature  (Amendment)  Act  1921.  This  removed  him  from  the  High  \nCourt  of  Justice,  thus  creating  an  independent  judiciary  and  limiting  the  \nlieutenant governor’s power – a step that would have been out of character \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n6\n Report of the Departmental Committee on the Constitution of the Isle of Man, 31 \nAugust 1911, (H.M.S.O., 1911). \n7\n J.

In  1927,  Hill  even  invited  the  Keys  to  form  a  consultative  \ncommittee.  This  was  an  unofficial  committee  of  five  members,  which  he  \nwould consult on matters relating to the governing of the island. This went \nsome  way  to  reducing  demands  from  the  House  of  Keys  for  an  official  \nexecutive council to advise the lieutenant governor. Hill’s opinion was that \nthe  reliance  merely  on  “irregular  and  informal  consultations”  which  had  \nbeen the case previously, had left “a good deal to be desired.”\n11\n  \nThe Legislative Council was also reformed according to the suggestions \nof  the  MacDonnell  Committee.  This  meant  that  the  Council  would  come  \nto  be  composed  of  ten  members,  with  the  lieutenant  governor  continuing  \nto preside. Members would include two deemsters, the bishop, the attorney \ngeneral  and  two  nominees  of  the  lieutenant  governor.  However,  four  \nmembers were to be elected by the House of Keys from the membership of \nthe  House.  These  reforms  meant  that  the  archdeacon,  the  vicar  general  –  \nwho had previously supported the continuation of the TT in 1912 – one of \nthe deemsters and the receiver general, would lose their seats. This meant \na reduction in the members appointed ex officio by the lieutenant governor \nand,  therefore,  of  potential  support  for  Hill,  or  any  future  lieutenant  \ngovernor. \nOn  meeting  the  House  of  Keys  in  1919,  Deemster  Moore  commented  \nthat this was the fifth cohort of members whom he had welcomed into the \nHouse  of  Keys,  and  he  “remembered  no  House  in  which  he  had  seen  so  \nmany  new  faces.”\n12\n  Indeed,  the  1919  election,  and  the  four  by-elections  \nheld  as  a  result  of  the  election  of  the  four  members  of  the  Keys  to  the  \nLegislative  Council,  produced  a  radically  changed  membership  in  the  \nHouse of Keys. Of the 24 members, there was a new speaker, fifteen new \nmembers  and  a  further  six  members  who  had  served  only  one  term.  \nFredrick Clucas, who was elected to the position of Speaker of the House \nof  Keys  (he  held  this  position  between  1919  and  1937),  Samuel  Norris,  \nnewly elected to the Keys, and Richard Cain had all been associated with \nthe  Manx  reform  movement  since  1903.  Such  a  composition  of  the  Keys  \nwould  make  it  less  likely  that  the  new  lieutenant  governor  could  merely  \nimpose  motor  racing  on  the  island  like  his  predecessor.  Subsequent  \nelections  to  the  Keys  in  1924,  1929  and  1934  saw  little  change  in  the  \nKeys’ membership.  \nTynwald’s board system also developed during this period. During the \npre-war  years  it  was  primarily  members  of  the  Legislative  Council  who  \nacted  as  chairs  of  boards,  thus  limiting  the  opportunities  for  members  of  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n11\n Kermode, Offshore Island Politics, p. 88.  \n12\n Norris, Manx Memories and Movements, p. 338. \n\nChapter Three \n64\nthe House of Keys to participate in the administration of the island.\n13\n The \nboards  operated  alongside  other  committees  and  commissions  that  were  \nappointed  by  the  lieutenant  governor  or  Tynwald.  During  the  inter-war  \nperiod,  the  number  of  boards  increased  from  eight  to  thirteen,  and  the  \npractice  was  that  each  member  of  Tynwald  would  serve  on  two  and  \nsometimes  on  as  many  as  four  boards.  MHKs  also  took  on  greater  \nresponsibility  for  providing  chairs  for  these  boards.  Deemsters  were  also  \nno  longer  involved  with  the  work  of  the  boards,  further  reducing  the  \ninfluence  of  the  lieutenant  governor’s  appointees  in  this  system.  The  \nHighway  Board  chose  W.C.  Southward  (South  Douglas),  an  elected  \nmember  of  the  Legislative  Council,  to  act  as  chairman  throughout  the  \ninter-war period, and he would offer strong support for the continuation of \nthe TT races. \nWe can see therefore that although the lieutenant governor retained his \nexecutive authority, where the day-to-day administration of the island was \nconcerned   greater   co-operation   was   required   between   himself   and   \nmembers of Tynwald. Also, a newly elected House of Keys and reformed \nLegislative  Council  that  now  included  elected  members,  meant  the  need  \nfor   greater   co-operation   between   the   lieutenant   governor   and   these   \nlegislative  bodies.  Therefore  there  would  be  a  much-reduced  chance  of  a  \nfurther imposition of motor racing by the lieutenant governor after World \nWar  One.  Indeed,  the  political  decisions  taken  by  the  Manx  in  respect  of  \nthe   TT   during   the   inter-war   period   would   require   a   much   greater   \nconsensus of opinion. An important part in these developments, however, \nwas  that  there  was  no  Raglan.  Although  his  imposition  had  given  the  \nManx  the  TT  races,  it  was  left  to  a  new  generation  of  politicians  in  the  \nKeys and the Legislative Council to decide on the TT’s future.  \n1920 – 1922: Revival of the TT \nThe 1905 Highways (Motor Car) Act had stipulated that the Highway \nBoard had the authority to close public roads for races by both motorcars \nand  motorcycles  on  the  application  of  any  person  or  club.  The  Act  had  \nalso made these powers exercisable only for one year, unless renewed by a \nresolution  in  Tynwald.  During  the  pre-war  period  the  ACU  had  applied  \neach year to the Highway Board for permission to hold the TT and in each \ncase  this  permission  had  been  granted  by  the  lieutenant  governor  and  in  \neffect  with  the  automatic  approval  of  Tynwald.\n14\n  Similarly,  after  a  brief  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n13\n Kermode, Offshore Island Politics, pp. 56-57.  \n14\n See Highway Board Minutes for Pre-War Period.  \n\nThe Acceleration of Domestic Support \n65\ndiscussion  in  Tynwald  in  May  and  December  1920,  the  provisions  of  the  \n1905 Act were again extended to allow the first inter-war TT races to take \nplace.  However,  on  this  occasion  the  views  of  the  elected  representatives  \nwere heard, but those present raised little objection.  \nIn  supporting  the  resolution  for  the  1920  TT,  Drinkwater,  who  had  \npreviously  been  an  MHK  but  by  1920  was  an  appointed  member  of  the  \nLegislative  Council,  argued,  “a  certain  amount  of  inconvenience  will  be  \ncaused  by  the  closing  of  the  roads,  but  the  Manx  people  are  sufficiently  \ngood  natured  enough  to  waive  any  trouble  of  that  sort.”\n15\n Callister,  MHK \nfor   the   rural   sheading   of   Glenfaba,   supported   Drinkwater,   arguing,   \n“considerable inconvenience is caused to the country people; but we are a \nlong  suffering  people  and  we  will  put  up  with  the  inconvenience.”\n16\n The \nopinions of these two members of Tynwald suggest that the revival of the \nTT races was more important than the inconvenience that would be caused \nto  some  Manx  people,  especially  in  rural  areas,  by  the  closing  of  public  \nroads  for  motorcycle  racing,  and  this  inconvenience  was  not  regarded  as  \nsignificant.  It  also  shows  that  debate  and  formal  approval  by  Tynwald  \nalong  with  greater  articulation  of  opinion,  and  not  just  by  the  will  of  the  \nlieutenant governor, now characterised the decision-making process where \nthe TT was concerned.  \nIn  November  1921,  W.C.  Southward,  in  his  role  as  chairman  of  the  \nHighway  Board,  introduced  a  resolution  into  Tynwald  that  would  again  \nextend the powers of the Highway Board for a further year, allowing it to \nclose roads for motorcycle racing, and for permission to be granted to the \nACU  and  RAC  for  motor  car  and  motorcycle  races  to  be  held  in  1922.  \nHowever, in proposing this resolution Southward pointed out that the 1905 \nlegislation had expired on 5 July 1921, and therefore a new bill had to be \nsubmitted to the legislature “at an early date, provided the Court approves \nof this resolution”, again demonstrating the need for consensus.\n17\n Callister, \na  member  of  the  Highway  Board,  who  in  1920  had  pointed  out  the  \ninconvenience  of  the  TT  to  the  Manx  people,  summed  up  his  feelings  on  \nthe matter further in this debate. His point of view was that: \n \nPersonally  I  would  say,  ‘No’.  But  I  am  not  going  to  vote  against  the  \nresolution,  although  I  know  right  well  that  more  people  are  dead  against  \nhaving  them  here  than  the  Court  is  aware  of.  It  is  all  very  well  for  the  \ntowns  to  demand  this,  because  they  benefit  by  it,  but  there  is  another  side  \nto  be  considered.  There  are  people  living  all  along  these  roads  who  are  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n15\n Debates, Vol. 37, 11 May 1920, p. 622. \n16\n Debates, Vol. 37, 11 May 1920, p. 622. \n17\n Debates, Vol. 39, 1 Nov. 1921, p. 37. \n\nChapter Three \n66\nroused  at  four  o’clock  in  the  morning  for  four  or  five  weeks  on  end  –  \nworking  people,  who  are  right  up  against  the  road  ...  However,  if  the  \nmajority of the people want it, I am not going to vote against it.\n18\n \n \nCallister’s  attitude  reflects  the  stance  that  would  be  taken  by  other  \nmembers of Tynwald in respect of the TT during the inter-war period. He \nrecognised  that  the  island’s  towns,  especially  Douglas,  would  principally  \nbenefit  from  the  TT  and  that  those  living  in  rural  areas  or  on  the  circuit  \nwould suffer some inconvenience. The majority of the visitors for the TT, \nand indeed the TT riders and others associated with the races, would stay \nin  hotels  and  boarding  houses  in  Douglas.  Those  living  on  the  TT  course  \nwould  not  be  able  to  carry  out  their  usual  business  when  the  roads  were  \nclosed, and would, allegedly, be woken early in the morning by practising \nmotorcycles.  However,  rather  than  vote  against  holding  further  races  on  \nthe  island,  Callister  argued  that  if  the  majority  of  people  –  or  at  least  the  \nmajority  of  Tynwald  –  wanted  these  races,  he  would  not  vote  against  \nthem.  The  point  must  also  be  made  that  Callister  was  able  to  express  his  \nopinion  on  the  TT  and  could  choose  not  to  endorse  its  taking  place.  \nHowever,  what  can  be  seen  is  that  even  those  who  objected  to  the  event  \nendorsed its continuation. \nThe resolution to extend the powers of the Highway Board was further \ndiscussed in Tynwald on 8 November 1921. Cain proposed an amendment \nto   the   original   resolution.   This   proposal   would   lift   the   restrictions   \npreventing  racing  motorcycles  from  going  on  the  roads  on  a  Sunday,  \npresumably  for  the  purposes  of  further  practices.  At  this  time  roads  were  \nnot  closed  for  practices  to  take  place.  Cain,  in  proposing  the  amendment,  \nstated: \n \nI don’t want to raise anything of a controversial nature in this motion, but I \nwant  it  to  be  understood  by  the  court  that  unless  it  is  carried,  there  is  a  \npossibility  that  the  ACU  will  not  come  to  the  Island  and  the  race  will  not  \ntake place.\n19\n \n \nThe  point  was  also  made  that  the  ACU  were  looking  for  alternative  \nlocations to hold the TT, which in the minds of some members of Tynwald \nposed  a  serious  threat  to  the  continuation  of  the  TT  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  \nThe question of moving the event was indeed occasionally discussed in the \nmotorcycle  press  during  the  1920s,  citing  the  expense  of  travelling  to  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n18\n Debates, Vol. 39, 1 Nov. 1921, p. 43. \n19\n Debates, Vol. 39, 8 Nov. 1921, p. 104. \n\nThe Acceleration of Domestic Support \n67\nIsle of Man and the inconvenience of its location.\n20\n Cain went on to point \nout  that  “unless  they  [the  ACU]  know  that  these  restrictions  are  to  be  \nremoved, they may go down to Belgium, where the authorities are ready to \nwelcome  them,  and  are  doing  all  they  can  to  induce  them  to  come.”\n21\n \nAlthough  it  is  unclear  how  likely  it  was  that  the  races  might  move  away  \nfrom  the  island,  the  fear  that  the  Isle  of  Man  might  lose  the  TT  was  \nenough for some members of Tynwald to speak in favour of sustaining the \nevent. Cain believed that the lifting of restrictions would help to continue \nto attract the ACU. He argued that “we, as representatives of the people of \nthe  Island,  should  not  do  anything  which  will,  next  year,  prevent  people  \ncoming  to  this  Island.”\n22\n  Clearly,  the  resumption  of  the  TT  after  World  \nWar One was not an imposition by the lieutenant governor but was urged, \nor  at  least  endorsed,  by  members  of  Tynwald,  and  ostensibly  in  the  \ninterests of the Manx public.  \nOf course, concerns were raised about the lifting of Sunday restrictions, \nbut   openly   by   elected   members,   which   is   again   indicative   of   the   \ntransparency  of  the  process.  Closing  roads  on  Sunday  to  ordinary  traffic  \nwhile allowing racing motorcycles to practise on the course would have an \nimpact   domestically.   It   had   been   suggested   by   one   MHK   that   a   \ncompromise  might  be  reached  if  the  roads  were  to  be  closed  to  all  other  \ntraffic  before  nine  o’clock  and  opened  afterwards.  However,  closing  the  \nroads  to  domestic  vehicles  would  be  a  great  inconvenience,  and  Norris  \n(North Douglas) asked “how can people get to the other side of the Island \nif they cannot cross the course?”\n23\n Norris was referring to the fact that the \nTT course covered much of the island. Callister had earlier commented, “I \nthink we ought to have a little consideration for the people who live along \nthe course.”\n24\n However, Alfred Teare (South Douglas) argued that keeping \nrestrictions in place would help increase safety around the course. Voicing \nhis experience of the races, he stated that:  \n \nI  was  at  Kirk  Michael  on  the  Sunday  of  the  year  before  restrictions  were  \nimposed, and a most dangerous state of affairs existed, as racing machines \nwent  around  dangerous  corners,  where  there  were  a  number  of  children  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n20\n  Such  reports  can  be  found  in  issues  of  Motor  Cycle  and  Motor  Cycling  during  \nthe inter-war years, with the impression being that there was some desire to see the \nTT moved to England. This, however, was unlikely to happen, as will be discussed \nlater. \n21\n Debates, Vol. 39, 8 Nov. 1921, p. 104. \n22\n Debates, Vol. 39, 8 Nov. 1921, p. 104.  \n23\n Debates, Vol. 39, 8 Nov. 1921, p. 104. \n24\n Debates, Vol. 39, 8 Nov. 1921, p. 104.  \n\nChapter Three \n68\nabout, at a speed that was to the peril of life and limb. The present motion, \nhowever, deals with this difficulty because it provides that no racing car or \nmachine be on the road.\n25\n \n \nDespite  the  concerns  of  some  MHKs,  the  amendment,  which  would  \nhave  lifted  the  restrictions  placed  on  motorcycles  on  a  Sunday,  was  not  \nincluded  in  the  final  Act  in  1922,  being  lost  by  six  votes  to  twelve  in  the  \nKeys.  Only  the  receiver  general  and  W.C.  Southward  voted  for  it  in  the  \nLegislative  Council.  What  is  striking  here  is  that  the  objections  were  to  \nclosing  the  roads  for  practising  on  a  Sunday,  and  not  to  racing  as  such.  \nThe open debate still concluded by endorsing the continuation of the main \nevent, the TT races. \nAfter   the   resolution   was   passed   in   November   and   Tynwald   had   \ndemonstrated their support for the continuation of the TT, it was necessary \nto  pass  new  legislation  to  extend  the  1905  law.  The  Highways  (Closing  \nOrder)  Bill  was  introduced  into  the  Legislative  Council  by  the  attorney  \ngeneral  on  12  January  1922.  It  was  subsequently  read  three  times  and  \npassed  in  the  Council,  with  little  further  discussion.\n26\n  The  bill  was  then  \npassed to the House of Keys and was given its first reading on 17 January. \nWhen the bill was read for the second time on 24 January, Gill, MHK for \nMiddle, the constituency surrounding Douglas, explained that the bill was \nnecessary  for  motor  races  to  take  place  on  the  island  in  the  summer  of  \n1922, and for any races that were “likely” to occur in the future. He went \nfurther  to  argue  that  “it  is  not  a  very  contentious  Bill,  and  I  hope  it  will  \npass  without  discussion.  It  is  necessary  that  it  should  be  done  quickly.”\n27\n \nThe  matter  was  urgent  because  it  would  take  two  months  for  the  bill  to  \nreceive  the  royal  assent  and  the  TT  was  to  be  held  in  four  months’  time.  \nThe  resolution  in  favour  of  the  bill  was  seconded  by  Alfred  Teare  (the  \nSouth Douglas MHK) and no further objections were raised nor were any \nfurther expressions of support voiced, and  the  bill  was  passed  and  signed  \nin  Tynwald  on  7  March  1922.\n28\n  Here  too  we  can  see  that  the  opportunity  \nfor Tynwald to object and block the legislation necessary to sustain the TT \nraces was constitutionally open to members, but they opted not to protest \nbut, rather, willingly to support the legislation.  \nThere  was  a  further  sign  in  the  passage  of  the  Highways  (Closing  \nOrder) Act 1922 that the TT races were no longer an intrusion imposed by \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n25\n Debates, Vol. 39, 8 Nov. 1921, p. 105. \n26\n Debates, Vol. 39, 13 Jan. 1922, pp. 329 and 335. \n27\n Debates, Vol. 39, 24 Jan. 1922, p. 381.  \n28\n See also House of Keys Journal, Vol. 14 1920 – 1922, which states that this bill \nwas carried in the Keys and notes no opposition.  \n\nThe Acceleration of Domestic Support \n69\nthe  lieutenant  governor.\n29\n  Section  Two  of  the  1905  law  was  amended  so  \nthat the words “acting with the Governor” were removed from the original \nclause,  which  had  stated  “‘the  board’  shall  mean  the  Highway  Board  \nacting  with  the  Governor.”\n30\n  Instead,  it  was  left  to  the  Highway  Board  \nalone, with the approval of Tynwald, to take responsibility for the closing \nof roads and the suspension of highways legislation to allow road races to \ntake  place  on  the  island.  Moreover,  this  Act  was  renewed  annually  \nthereafter  with  the  approval  of  Tynwald,  with  minimal  debate,  thus  \nallowing  the  TT  to  continue.  However,  in  1927  a  motorcyclist  was  killed  \nwhen practising on open roads. This was another occasion when a political \nbrake might have been applied and the TT races ended. \n1928: Responses to a Fatality \nThe  original  legislation  for  road  racing  on  the  island  had  made  no  \nprovision  for  the  closing  of  roads  for  practising,  and  as  we  have  seen  a  \nproposal  to  introduce  such  a  condition  had  been  rejected  in  1921.  The  \ndeath  of  Archie  Birkin  in  1927,  after  swerving  to  avoid  a  fish  cart  on  a  \npractice ride, therefore was unsettling.\n31\n However, it prompted a call not to \nterminate  the  TT  but  only  for  legislation  to  protect  both  Manx  residents  \nand  motorcyclists  by  further  road  closures.  The  Highways  Amendment  \nBill was introduced into the Legislative Council by the lieutenant governor \non  14  February  1928,  before  being  introduced  into  and  passed  in  the  \nHouse of Keys in March and finally passed in Tynwald on 24 April. This \nlegalised  the  closing  of  roads  not  just  for  racing  but  also  for  practising  \nbefore the main event took place.  \nWhen the attorney general introduced the first reading of the bill in the \nLegislative Council, he was obviously not seeking to deter racing or even \nto make racing more difficult for riders. Rather, his intention was to make \nracing   safer   by   imposing   more   restrictions   on   the   Manx   people.   \nRemarkably, and indicative of the political support which by 1928 the TT \nraces had attracted in the Isle of Man, no opposition in either section of the \nManx  legislature  was  expressed  to  continuing  the  race  after  the  fatality.  \nInstead  further  road  closures  were  accepted  to  provide  more  security  for  \nriders  whilst  practising.  The  attorney  general  argued  that  “if  we  invite  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n29\n Statutes of the Isle of Man, Vol. XI 1921 – 1924, hereafter Statutes.  \n30\n See Highways (Motor Car) Act 1905, in Statutes, Vol. VII 1896 – 1905. \n31\n J. Curwen Clague, ‘What the Island Does’, in G.S. Davison (ed.), The TT Races: \nBehind  the  Scenes,  (W.W.  Curtis  Ltd.,  Coventry,  1949),  p.  100.  Curwen  Clague  \nwas  a  journalist  for  the  Isle  of  Man  Examiner.  Also  mentioned  in  a  news  story  in  \n2007, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6670313.stm], accessed 1 June 2007].  \n\nChapter Three \n70\nthem  [the  ACU/  TT  racers]  to  come  to  the  Island  for  these  races,  we  \nshould  make  it  safe  for  them  to  practise,  and  not  let  them  run  the  risk  of  \nmeeting  a  fish  cart  on  the  road  with  the  risk  of  injury  and  death.”\n32\n This \nopinion  was  shared  by  Daniel  Teare,  whose  constituency,  Ayre,  was  on  \nthe route but well away from Douglas. When introducing the bill into the \nKeys for its second reading, he argued that: \n \nI think we ought to make the roads safe, if possible, for these cyclists, that \nis, if we are going to retain the motor cycle races. If the motor cycle races \nare of any use to the Island, I think it is our duty to see these men take no \nunnecessary risks. We know that last year a regrettable accident took place, \nand I think it is our duty to see that the roads during practice time are kept \nfree from traffic.\n33\n \n \nDaniel  Teare  and  the  attorney  general  were  aware  of  the  importance  of  \nimproving  safety  if  the  Manx  were  to  continue  hosting  motorcycle  races  \non  the  island,  and  to  do  this  it  was  becoming  increasingly  necessary  to  \nclose roads for practising. Evidently both the attorney general and Daniel \nTeare  wanted  to  see  the  TT  take  place  and  this  proposal  would  make  the  \nstaging  of  the  event  on  the  island  more  attractive  to  the  ACU.  Moreover,  \nwhilst  the  attorney  general  had  little  to  lose  by  supporting  the  races  –  he  \nwas  an  appointed  member  of  the  Legislative  Council  –  Teare  represented  \nthe  rural  sheading  of  Ayre  and  was  elected  to  the  Keys,  and  yet  he  \nendorsed  a  proposal  that  had  the  potential  to  add  to  the  inconvenience  \ncaused by the TT to his constituents.  \nWithin this debate there is no indication at all that Birkin’s death might \nbe  a  reason  to  stop  the  TT  races.  The  focus  was  entirely  placed  on  \nprotecting  the  TT  and  continuing  to  attract  the  ACU  to  the  Isle  of  Man.  \nHowever,   support   for   the   bill   was   not   unanimous.   It   was   largely   \nrepresentatives of rural sheadings who voiced objections. Shimmin, MHK \nfor Peel, disagreed with the stance taken by many MLCs and MHKs. His \nobjection was that: \n \nI  think  there  is  a  great  deal  too  much  time  spent  by  grown  up  people  \nplaying with adult mechanical toys; and a great many young men spending \ntheir  time  riding  to  nowhere  and  back  simply  for  the  fun  of  riding,  and  I  \nthink they could be much better employed.\n34\n \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n32\n Debates, Vol. 45, 14 Feb. 1928, p. 455. \n33\n Debates, Vol. 45, 6 March 1928, p. 617. \n34\n Debates, Vol. 45, 6 March 1928, p. 619.  \n\nThe Acceleration of Domestic Support \n71\nShimmin did not participate in the collective endorsement of the races by \nmembers  of  Tynwald,  and  his  objections  were  pretty  much  a  call  for  the  \nTT  to  be  stopped.  He  might  even  have  been  expressing  the  resentment  of  \nPeel’s  constituents  towards  the  continuation  of  the  TT.  However,  other  \nobjections  to  this  bill  did  not  call  for  the  races  to  be  stopped,  but  rather  \npointed out the considerable inconvenience caused to the rural community \nby the running of the event. Whilst Gill (Middle) argued that as a result of \nBirkin’s  death  the  legislative  changes  were  worth  making  and  that  there  \nwas  “nothing  outrageous  in  it  at  all”,\n35\n  other  MHKs  pointed  out  that  the  \nclosing of roads in the early morning would interfere with the delivery of \nthe milk from farms to towns and with traffic to and from the fishing port \nof Peel in the west of the island. This was a point conceded even by Daniel \nTeare (Ayre) in the House of Keys. Pointing out the potential for factions \nto form between members representing rural and urban constituencies, he \nargued that “there is a certain amount of opposition to closing the roads in \nthe morning, especially by farmers, also by a few men whose business it is \nto  go  to  Peel  to  buy  fish.”\n36\n  Southward,  who  was  keen  on  the  races,  even  \nargued that closing roads for practising would make it an offence to carry \nout  one’s  business.  This  opinion  was  shared  by  J.D.  Clucas,  previously  \nMHK  for  largely  rural  Rushen  but  by  now  a  member  of  the  Legislative  \nCouncil.  He  argued  that  “it  will  be  a  great  inconvenience  to  the  users  of  \nthe  roads  who  wish  to  come  in  from  [Kirk]  Michael  for  the  early  \nmarket.”\n37\n Kirk Michael was in a rural area, and the TT course ran through \nthe centre of the village, thus causing inconvenience.  \nSupport for the continuation of the TT was articulated most strongly in \nterms of the benefits to Douglas. Those supporting the bill emphasised the \nfact that inconvenience caused to the rural community was a small price to \npay  if  Douglas,  the  island’s  largest  town,  benefited  from  the  continuation  \nof  the  TT.  This  attitude  was,  surprisingly,  articulated  even  by  W.C.  \nClucas, representative for rural Glenfaba, who pointed out that: \n \nIt  must  be  remembered  that  Douglas  reaps  nearly  all  the  benefit  [of  the  \nTT]. Seven o’clock in the morning is the time the fish market starts at Peel. \nMany buyers come in from the country, and it means they will have to go \nin many hours earlier or later. It will affect Peel more than any other town; \nstill, if it is going to benefit Douglas and the Island, we are not going to be \nagainst it.

I  think,  however,  we  should  protect  those  who  have  to  make  a  \nlivelihood  by  getting  produce  to  Douglas.”\n39\n  There  was  recognition  of  \ninterests  outside  Douglas,  but  there  was  no  suggestion  of  how  these  \ninterests could be protected. \nUltimately,  it  seems  that  objectors  conceded  to  the  “greater  good”,  \nwhich were not Manx economic interests as such, but rather the economic \ninterests   of   Douglas.   However,   in   order   for   the   TT   to   continue   a   \ncompromise had to be reached. Daniel Teare had indeed suggested that “I \nthink  if  we  are  to  retain  these  races  we  ought  to  make  a  little  bit  of  \nsacrifice.”\n40\n In Teare’s mind, the TT, which was becoming an international \nevent, came before some local business interests. Closing public roads and \nincreasing  safety  primarily  for  the  racers  and  secondarily  the  residents  \nwould  mean  a  compromise  had  to  be  made  between  urban  and  rural  \ninterest groups, but this was a compromise that was not taken. Instead the \ninterests  of  the  ACU,  who  wanted  to  hold  the  TT  on  the  island,  and  the  \ninterests  of  urban  areas,  more  explicitly  Douglas,  were  protected.  For  \nexample,  Moore,  a  tenant  farmer,  made  objections.  He  pointed  out  the  \ndifficulties that would be incurred by further road closures; he had spoken \nto  residents  who  had  voiced  their  opinions.  His  attitude  towards  the  TT  \nwas that: \n \nPersonally,  I  do  not  object  to  the  races  at  all,  but,  as  I  said,  I  have  met  \nseveral  people  who  complain.  A  man  said,  ‘I  pay  my  licence  to  go  on  the  \nhigh road, and I have a right at all times of the year to go on the roads, and \nyou  have  no  legal  right  to  stop  me’.  That  is  just  one  instance.  It  is  not  in  \nmy own constituency. I have met people from Ramsey and Douglas, whose \nbusiness  takes  them  from  Peel  to  Ramsey.  They  say  ‘We  are  being  \ntyrannised  in  the  Isle  of  Man’.  There  are  three  whole  weeks  that  people  \ncannot go on with their ordinary businesses.\n41\n  \n \nThe simplest way to solve this problem was to end the TT races. However, \nthe continuing support for the TT by members of the Legislative Council, \nand  indeed  of  the  House  of  Keys,  made  this  politically  impossible.

It  shows  that  members  of  both  the  Legislative  \nCouncil and the House of Keys were prepared to support the continuation \nof  the  TT  and  wished  to  continue  to  attract  the  ACU  to  the  island.  The  \ndebate also shows that the further endorsement of the TT in 1928 was not \nthe result of a further imposition of legislation by the lieutenant governor. \nWhat was happening was the imposition of legislation by Tynwald on the \nManx  people.  The  move  was  supported,  surprisingly,  not  just  by  the  \nrepresentatives   of   Douglas,   but   also   by   representatives   of   rural   \nconstituencies,  with  varying  degrees  of  reluctance,  because  the  TT  was  \njudged to be good for Douglas and that seemed to be enough. \n1929-1937: Financial Endorsement \nIn 1926 Fry was replaced by Sir Claude Hill as the island’s lieutenant \ngovernor.  It  was  following  Hill’s  initiative  in  1929  that  the  first  financial  \ncontribution was made by the Manx legislature to the ACU for the purpose \nof maintaining the TT races. It has been suggested that Hill’s awareness of \nthe importance of the tourist industry to the island and his enthusiasm for \nthe  TT  led  to  the  proposal.  The  ACU  welcomed  this  grant,  and  looking  \nback  in  1945  the  secretary  of  the  ACU,  T.W.  Loughborough,  concluded  \nthat   there   was   “no   better   man   for   the   future   of   the   TT   races.”\n42\n \nLoughborough  believed  that  Hill  had  realised  that  TT  entrants  would  not  \ncontinue  to  support  the  races  unless  there  were  substantial  rewards  on  \noffer,  and  that  it  was  as  much  in  the  interests  of  the  Isle  of  Man  as  the  \nACU that the TT should continue. In 1949 a Manx journalist, commenting \non  Hill’s  initiative,  pointed  out  that  “whilst  at  the  time  there  was  no  real  \nfear   that   the   T.T.   would   be   taken   from   the   Island,   this   [financial   \ncontribution] was a method of ensuring the continuation of the meeting on \nits  ‘native  soil’.”\n43\n  Hill’s  initiative  would  have  been unlikely in 1921, but \nfinancial  support  for  the  TT  was  more  likely  in  1928,  with  the  event  by  \nnow  receiving  greater  support  politically.  It  was  approved  by  the  Manx  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n42\n T. W. Loughborough, ‘Organisation of the TT Races: From 1912-1939, in G.S. \nDavison (ed.), The TT Races, p.12. Loughborough was secretary of the ACU from \n1912-1945.  \n43\n Curwen Clague, ‘What the Island Does’, in Davison (ed.), The TT Races, p. 103.  \n\nThe Acceleration of Domestic Support \n75\nlegislature  in  1929,  and  the  first  grant  was  provided  in  time  for  the  1930  \nTT.  \nAt  a  sitting  of  Tynwald  Court  in  October  1929,  presided  over  by  the  \nSpeaker  of  the  House  of  Keys,  G.F.  Clucas,  the  suspension  of  Tynwald’s  \nstanding orders was suggested so that Hill’s proposal could be considered \nfor  the  provision  of  a  grant  to  assist  the  ACU  in  holding  the  TT  races  on  \nthe  Isle  of  Man.  A  letter  from  the  lieutenant  governor  contained  in  the  \nHouse  of  Keys  Journal  suggests  that  this  resolution  had  actually  been  \nagreed  upon  before  it  entered  Tynwald.  The  letter  asked  members  of  the  \nKeys and the Legislative Council to meet Hill in private “to consider what \nsteps  (if  any)  should  be  taken  to  ensure  the  continuance  of  the  Tourist  \nTrophy  Races  in  the  Island.”\n44\n  This  was  a  sign  that  Hill  believed  that  the  \nTT  was  a  valuable  asset  for  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  the  response  to  his  \ninitiative  shows  that  others  agreed.  The  standing  orders  were  suspended  \nand  a  resolution  in  favour  was  carried  unanimously  in  Tynwald.  The  \nSpeaker  of  the  House  of  Keys  introduced  the  resolution  in  what  was  \ndescribed  as  an  “exhaustive  way”,  and  Corrin  (Rushen)  seconded  the  \nresolution.  These  were  the  only  two  members  of  the  House  who  voiced  \ntheir  opinions,  suggesting  that  by  this  point  there  was  a  ready  acceptance  \nby  members  of  the  Manx  legislature  that  the  TT  would  and  should  \ncontinue.  If  there  had  been  any  objections  to  the  resolution,  they  would  \nseem  to  have  been  dealt  with  privately.  The  resolution,  which  fell  under  \nthe title “help for the races”, read:  \n \nThe Manx Legislature is desirous of contributing its aid, however small, to \nthe cause of international good-will and the spirit of mutual understanding \nand  the  will  to  peace  and  believing  that  International  sports  contests  are  a  \nfactor  in  the  furtherance  of  such  causes.  Resolved  –  that  in  the  estimates  \nfor  the  financial  years  1930  –  31,  provision  should  be  made  for  the  \nexpenditure  of  a  sum  of  £5,000  from  the  general  revenue  to  enable  (1)  a  \ngrant  of  £1,500  to  be  paid  to  the  Auto-Cycle  Union  for  the  provision  of  \ncash prizes to successful competitors in the Tourist Trophy races to be held \nin  the  Isle  of  Man  in  June,  1930,  and  (2)  a  grant  of  £3,500  to  enable  the  \nAuto-Cycle  Union  so  to  reduce  the  expenses  of  competitors  from  the  \nBritish  Empire  overseas  and  from  foreign  countries  that  such  competitors  \ncan   enter   for   the   1930   Tourist   Trophy   on   more   equal   terms   with   \ncompetitors from the British Isles.\n45\n  \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n44\n This letter was contained in the House of Keys Journal (Vol. 15 1922-1929). \n45\n Debates, Vol. 46, 4 October 1929, p. 1202; Tynwald Court Journal 1929 -1934 \nalso shows that there was no opposition to the bill. \n\nChapter Three \n76\nIn proposing this resolution in Tynwald the Speaker had put forward a \nvery grandiose claim. Indeed with the TT becoming a more internationally \nknown  event,  its  role  in  promoting  international  goodwill  might  appear  \njustifiable.  As  a  new  Keys  was  going  to  be  elected,  the  Speaker  believed  \nthat  “it  would  be  a  fine  thing  ...  if  we  should  end  our  career  on  a  large  \nnote  like  this.”\n46\n  Whilst  there  was  no  explicit  reference  to  the  proposal  \nbeing  Hill’s  initiative,  there  is  no  other  place  this  proposal  could  have  \ncome  from,  especially  given  the  evidence  of  the  prior  private  meeting  \nbetween  the  lieutenant  governor  and  members  of  the  legislature.  In  \nproposing  the  resolution  the  Speaker  made  reference  to  the  gratitude  of  \nTynwald to the lieutenant governor for showing that “you were very much \nalive  to  our  interests,  and  in  passing  this  vote,  we  shall  show  that  even  if  \nwere  are  moribund,  there  is  still  some  life  left  in  us.”\n47\n Corrin,  in \nseconding  the  motion,  went  on  to  suggest  that  “he  is  a  brave  man  who  \nfeels in a sportive mood at the point of death, and I think that the House of \nKeys  is  to  be  complimented  on  being  in  a  sportive  mood  at  the  time  of  \ndissolution.”\n48\n  This  was  once  again  a  moment  where  the  Keys  had  the  \npower   to   reject   supportive   legislation   for   the   TT   and   obstruct   the   \ndevelopment and the continuation of the event. However, members chose \nto  follow  the  lead  of  the  Speaker,  and  endorsed  the  proposal  before  their  \nmembership  of  the  House  ended.  Evidently,  the  House  of  Keys  had  \nbecome  comfortable  politically  with  the  TT  and  by  1929  viewed  it  as  \nsomething that was worthy of political support by Manx taxpayers.  \nThe  TT  was  politically  endorsed  and  continuation  not  threatened  \nduring the early 1930s. Members of Tynwald voted annually to renew the \ngrant,  and  so  the  Manx  government  continued  to  provide  the  ACU  with  \nfinancial support for the TT. True, some of this grant was later redirected \nto  motorcar  races.  Even  so,  throughout  the  1930s  the  Manx  government  \nmaintained a financial interest in the TT races. Members of Tynwald, with \nlittle   debate,   voted   for   financial   help   for   the   TT   and   indeed   the   \ncontinuation of the TT and other motor races on the Isle of Man annually.  \nHowever, objections to financial assistance for motor racing on the Isle \nof  Man  were  raised  in  1937,  but  these  were  not  challenges  to  the  \ncontinuation of motorcycle racing on the island as such, but to the way the \ngrant  was  distributed.  The  attorney  general  put  forward  a  resolution  in  \nTynwald  for  the  continuation  of  the  £5,000  grant  but  only  £3,500  would  \ngo  to  the  ACU.\n49\n  The  £5,000  would  cover  the  cost  of  all  races  on  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n46\n Debates, Vol. 46, 4 October 1929, p. 1203. \n47\n Debates, Vol. 46, 4 October 1929, p. 1203. \n48\n Debates, Vol. 46, 4 October 1929, p. 1202. \n49\n Debates, Vol. 54, 6 July 1937, p. 424. \n\nThe Acceleration of Domestic Support \n77\nisland  in  1937.  These  included  the  TT  races,  the  Manx  Grand  Prix  \nmotorcycle  races  –  which  had  taken  place  since  1923  -  and  car  races  \ntaking  place  in  Douglas,  as  well  as  a  pedal  cycle  race  around  the  TT  \ncourse  and  an  aeroplane  race.  Although  the  attorney  general  saw  this  as  \nthe “customary appropriation of £5,000”, he also made the suggestion that \na committee be appointed to assist the government treasurer in the proper \nallocation of the grant, and this proposal was adopted. This committee was \nthe Tynwald Motor Races Committee.\n50\n  \nObjections  raised  in  this  discussion  were  not  towards  the  provision  of  \nthe  grant  and  so  not  towards  the  continuation  of  the  TT.  Questions  were  \nraised, rather, concerning the division of the grant between different races \non  the  Isle  of  Man,  since  many  believed  that  the  TT  was  the  most  \nimportant motor sport event on the island. Alfred Teare asked: \n \nDoes  this  mean  the  Court  commits  itself  to  motor  car  racing  next  year?  I  \ndon’t feel disposed to do that. I consider the experience we have had in the \npast of the races is that they are not fulfilling expectations from the point of \nview of the publicity value or encouraging visitors to our shores during the \nperiod of the races. Regarding the experience of the motor-cycle races, we \nknow from our experience that they are an attraction to the young men of \nthe   country   who   can   afford   a   motor-cycle.   They   come   to   see   the   \nperformance  of  the  various  machines  here,  and  upon  the  result  choose  the  \nparticular  type  of  machine  they  are  going  to  purchase  to  tour  the  country.  \nIn regard to the motor car races, I consider nothing of that kind enters into \nit at all.\n51\n \n \nThe  Manx,  or  members  of  Tynwald,  wanted  especially  the  TT  races  to  \ncontinue  to  be  held  on  the  Isle  of  Man  and  for  this  reason  they  were  \nwilling  to  make  a  monetary  contribution  to  the  ACU.  This  grant  was  \nbelieved to be reasonable because it would allow the TT races to continue \non the Isle of Man, sustaining a unique attraction and, as will be discussed \nbelow,  putting  extra  money  into  the  Manx  economy.  This  would  not  be  \ndone  by  the  promotion  of  motorcar  races,  which  were  considered  a  much  \nsmaller affair.  \nIn  the  opinion  of  the  Motor  Races  Committee,  which  had  been  \nappointed after the 1937 TT, the contribution made to the ACU was fully \njustified  as  it  went  towards  maintaining  the  TT  races  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  \nThe  committee’s  report  concluded  that  “we  regard  the  Races  as  of  great  \nvalue to the Island in the early part of the season, and we recommend that \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n50\n Debates, Vol. 54, 6 July 1937, p. 425. \n51\n Debates, Vol. 54, 6 July 1937, p. 425. \n\nChapter Three \n78\nthe expenditure of £3,500 which has now been paid for some years should \nbe  continued.”  It  stated  further  that  “bearing  in  mind  the  undoubted  \npublicity which results from the TT Races and the expense involved by the \nAuto  Cycle  Union  in  carrying  them  out,  it  would  seem  that  this  is  not  an  \nunreasonable figure.”\n52\n It is clear that the members of Tynwald who made \nup the committee believed that the TT was an asset to the Isle of Man, and \nthat they wanted to see the races continue.  \nThe  committee’s  report  stressed  the  economic  benefits  of  holding  the  \nraces  on  the  island,  and  by  allowing  the  continuation  of  the  grant  to  the  \nACU the Tynwald Motor Races Committee argued that this money would \nbe easily recouped. Alfred Teare, as we have seen a strong supporter of the \nTT,  had  pointed  mostly  to  the  economic  benefits  to  be  derived  from  the  \nmotorcycle TT in Tynwald when the committee, of which he was a member, \nwas  appointed.\n53\n  The  silence  of  other  members  of  Tynwald  suggests  an  \nagreement  with  the  conclusions  of  the  report.  In  1938,  a  resolution  was  \npassed once again to give the grant to the ACU, once more indicating that \nthe benefits of continuing to hold the TT on the Isle of Man were realised \nin  Tynwald.  When  proposing  the  continuation  of  this  grant,  Deemster  \nCowley  felt  “sure  that  members  will  recognise  the  enormous  publicity  \nvalue of the races to the Island and I have confidence in asking Tynwald to \ncontinue  similar  grants  next  year.”\n54\n  The  TT  races  thus  continued  to  be  \nsupported both politically and financially, and by the end of the inter-war \nperiod  there  was  little  doubt  about  their  continuation.  It  is  the  belief,  \nshared    by    members    of    Tynwald,    that    the    TT    would    publicise    \nadvantageously   the   Isle   of   Man   and   the   growing   commitment   of   \nmotorcycle manufacturers to the event, which will be discussed in the next \nchapter. \n  \n \n \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n52\n Report of the Committee of Tynwald Appointed to Examine the Whole Question \nof Motor Car and Other Races, (Douglas, Norris Modern Press, 1937), pp. 4-5. \n53\n Debates, Vol. 54, 6 July 1937, p. 424.  \n54\n Debates, Vol. 55, 6 July 1938, p. 693. \n\nCHAPTER FOUR \nM\nOVING THROUGH THE GEARS: \nC\nAPITALIST INTERESTS IN THE TT \n \n \n \nDuring  the  inter-war  period  the  TT  developed  as  part  of  the  way  the  \nManx  authorities  marketed,  or  branded,  the  island.  In  the  years  before  \nWorld  War  One  there  was  an  increasing  reorientation  of  the  Manx  \neconomy,  which  had  been  the  direct  result  of  the  growth  of  the  island’s  \ntourist industry. This trend continued through the inter-war period, and we \ncan  see  the  further  decline  of  fishing,  mining,  agriculture  and  other  \nmanufacturing  industries  as  measured  by  occupation  (see  table  4-1).\n1\n The \ndecline  of  the  island’s  primary  and  secondary  industries  was  marked  in  \n1929  by  the  complete  closure  of  the  Laxey  mines,  which  had  once  been  \nthe  leading  extractors  of  zinc  and  lead  ore  in  the  British  Isles.\n2\n Also,  by \n1931 the number of fishermen on the island had fallen from 410 recorded \nin  the  1921  census  to  186  as  recorded  in  the  1931  census.\n3\n Winterbottom \nnotes  that  by  1937  there  were  only  47  fishing  boats  on  the  Isle  of  Man  \ncrewed  by  128  men  and  boys,  and  further  that  80  per  cent  of  the  herring  \nfor  sale  on  the  island  in  1937  was  caught  by  boats  registered  elsewhere.\n4\n \nThis was a decline of 75 per cent from the 864 fishermen recorded in the \n1901  census.\n5\n  Numbers  employed  in  the  fishing  and  mining  industries  \nduring  the  inter-war  years  were  therefore  much  reduced  and  there  was  \neven  a  discernible  decline  in  the  numbers  engaged  in  agriculture.  The  \ndecline of primary and secondary industries on the island meant there was \na growing reliance on tourism \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n Birch, The   Isle   of   Man:   A   Study   in   Economic   Geography,   (Cambridge,   \nCambridge University Press, 1964).  \n2\n D.

This was the lowest recorded number during the \ninter-war  period.\n6\n  However,  the  inter-war  period  saw  the  widening  of  the  \nLoch  Promenade  Douglas,  which  began  in  1929  and  took  six  years  to  \ncomplete,\n7\n  and  also  the  building  of  the  King  Edward  VIII  Pier  in  1936.  \nOther improvements included the building of cinemas, such as The Picture \nHouse  (1921),  the  Royal  and  Regal  cinemas  and  the  2000-seat  Crescent  \n“Super” Cinema (1930). Facilities in boarding houses were also improved \nby  the  installation  of  electric  light,  hot  and  cold  running  water,  and  more  \ncomfortable  furnishings.\n8\n  This  was  in  contrast  to  the  poor  facilities  \navailable  before  World  War  One.\n9\n  However,  staying  in  Douglas  was  still  \nseen to be expensive, the cost varying from between five shillings to seven \nor  eight  shillings  a  day.\n10\n  In  comparison  to  the  “better  end\"  of  Blackpool  \nwhich cost between seven and ten shillings per day, the cost on the Isle of \nMan was nevertheless reasonable.\n11\n The TT should therefore be seen in the \ncontext of this development of tourism.  \nManx Economic Interests in the TT  \nDuring the inter-war period members of Tynwald began to share in the \nbelief  that  the  TT  might  play  a  part  in  publicising  the  Isle  of  Man.  \nMoreover, unlike in the pre-war years, the Manx legislature was prepared \nto  pay  to  advertise  the  TT  races  as  one  of  the  island’s  attractions.  \nBeckerson  notes:  “by  the  1920s  the  races  were  an  established  part  of  the  \nseason and proved ever more successful in attracting June crowds at a time \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n6\n Isle  of  Man  Summer  Passenger  Arrivals  1887  –  Present,  (Douglas,  Economic  \nAffairs Division; Isle of Man Government, 2007).  \n7\n  G.N.

The \nIsle of Man Weekly Times argued in May 1922 that: \n \nSome  idea  of  the  publicity  which  these  races  give  the  Island  can  be  \ngathered  from  the  fact  that  the  two  trade  motor  papers  “Motor-cycle”  and  \n“Motor  Cycling”  have  directed  this  week  practically  their  entire  issue  to  \nthe Isle of Man. In the “Daily Mail” last night there was a full column on \nthe  races,  an  invaluable  advertisement  ...  On  Monday,  some  30  to  40  \nrepresentatives  of  the  greatest  papers  in  the  country  are  coming  to  this  \nIsland. There is absolutely nothing to compare with the motor races as an \nadvertisement.\n [Emphasis added].\n14\n \n \nThe date of this comment is significant. In May 1922 there had only been \none  TT  event  after  World  War  One,  and  we  cannot  say  that  there  was  an  \ninevitability  that  the  TT  would  continue  at  this  point.  The  Isle  of  Man  \nWeekly Times was clearly of the opinion that the TT races could become a \ngood  source  of  revenue  for  the  island.  The  newspaper  believed  that  \nmention  of  the  TT  in  the  English  press  was  publicity  enough.  The  races  \nhad begun to attract people from across the world even by the early 1920s, \nand this would mean more money for the Manx economy. \nThe  statement  above,  however,  was  just  one  opinion  from  the  Manx  \npress. The view of some members of Tynwald was also that the TT would \nhelp  publicise  the  island,  and  therefore  help  the  island’s  tourist  trade  \nrecover  after  World  War  One.  Before  the  outbreak  of  World  War  One  \nthere  had  been  minimal  recognition  of  the  publicity  value  of  the  TT  by  \nmembers of Tynwald, although in 1912 this issue was touched upon. After \nWorld War One, possibly because the Manx government was keen to see \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n12\n J.

This was an important argument in favour of the restart of the TT. \nDuring   the   discussion   concerning   the   extension   of   the   highways   \nlegislation,  Southward,  when  asked  if  the  races  should  be  restarted  in  \n1920, answered: “I do not think that it is necessary to labour this question, \nas I think that it is the wish of the people in the Isle of Man in general, and \nof the people in towns in particular, [that] permission should be granted to \nhold  the  races.”  We  might  assume  that  Southward  is  here  referring  to  the  \nfinancial  benefits  that  some  of  the  islanders  could  gain  from  the  TT,  \nespecially those living in Douglas and running businesses.  \nSouthward went on to make two further points. First, he believed that \nthe TT could be used to advertise the Isle of Man. The event had proven to \nattract  visitors.  The  result  of  this  publicity,  argued  Southward,  would  be  \nextra revenue for the Manx economy.\n15\n He went on to claim “the last cycle \nraces were the means of bringing a large number of people to the Island”, \npossibly  referring  to  the  last  pre-war  races  and  that  “the  Island  largely  \nbenefits  by  these  people.”\n16\n  In  particular  he  believed  that  the  holding  of  \nthe  TT  benefited  those  involved  with  tourism,  especially  boarding  house  \nkeepers.\n17\n  Southward’s  claim  was  fairly  obvious.  It  is  clear  that  boarding  \nhouse keepers and hoteliers would benefit from the continuation of the TT. \nThose involved with the event and those just watching the TT would need \nsomewhere to stay on the island. The 1921 census recorded that 1,313 out \nof a total of 1,897 lodging and boarding house keepers, approximately 75 \nper cent, were employed in Douglas (see table 4-1), since this was where \nvisitors disembarked from the ferry, there was the potential for Douglas to \nprofit considerably from the continuation of the TT.  \nHowever,  despite  there  being  a  large  amount  of  support  for  the  TT  in  \nTynwald, not all members shared Southward’s opinion that the event was \nan  obvious  boost  to  the  island’s  economy  and  a  viable  means  of  re-\nestablishing  the  island’s  tourist  trade,  or  even  as  a  way  of  extending  the  \nisland’s  tourist  season  into  June.  Callister,  who  earlier  in  the  discussion  \nhad commented on the inconvenience caused by the TT, was “not convinced \nthat the granting of these facilities to this particular club [the ACU] [was] of  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n15\n Debates, Vol. 38, 4 May 1920, p. 581. \n16\n Debates, Vol. 38, 21 Dec. 1920, p. 239. \n17\n Debates, Vol. 38, 21 Dec. 1920, p. 239. \n\nMoving through the Gears: Capitalist Interests in the TT \n83\nTable  4-1:  Occupations  of  males  and  females  in  the  Isle  of  Man  by  \narea, 1921 \n \n Isle of Man Douglas Ramsey Peel \nOccupation \nMales \nFemales \nMales \nFemales \nMales \nFemales \nMales \nFemales \nFishing           410        1        53        1        87        0        159        0        \nAgricultural \nOccupations \n3387     268     202      10       38       1       32        1     \nPersonal \nService \n865      5049      576      2821      56      426      21      172      \nLodging and \nBoarding \nHouse \nKeepers \n187       1710       147       1166       9       115       2        66       \nInn, Hotel \nKeepers, \nPublicans, \nBeer Sellers \n170      141      93       67       13       21       5         4      \nSource: Census 1921: Report on Isle of Man \n \ngreat  benefit  to  the  Island.”\n18\n  He  argued  “the  competitions  do  not  bring  a  \ngreat  number  of  people.

The  \nBoard’s  promotion  of  the  event  was  instigated  after  a  meeting  with  a  \ndeputation from the Manx Motor Cycle Club in January 1922. This was a \ndemonstration  of  a  smaller  group  with  interest  in  the  TT  putting  forward  \nan  agenda  for  the  Board  of  Advertising.  The  deputation  pointed  out  the  \nneed  for  more  advertising  of  the  TT  in  the  mainland  press,  as,  in  their  \nopinion, the TT was growing in popularity and therefore had the potential \nto advertise the island; or at least the TT should be advertised as one of the \nisland’s  diverse  attractions.\n22\n  The  Board  promised  consideration  of  this  \nmatter  and,  after  deliberation,  made  the  decision  to  print  and  distribute  \n10,000  leaflets  advertising  the  TT,  and  they  also  invited  cinema  firms  to  \nthe  Isle  of  Man  to  film  the  races.  The  Board  of  Advertising  continued  to  \npromote  the  TT  during  the  1920s  on  their  posters  and  in  promotional  \nliterature  as  one  of  the  island’s  most  important  attractions,  alongside  the  \nTynwald  ceremony  and  the  Highland  games.  For  example  in  a  1934  \nadvertisement  promoting  the  “Isle  of  Man  for  Happy  Holidays”,  motor  \nsports,   the   “unique   open   air   parliament”   and   highland   games   were   \nconsidered  equally  good  reasons  to  visit  the  island.  This  meant  that  by  \n1928  when  the  future  of  the  TT  was  re-considered,  the  Manx  legislature  \nand  certainly  the  Board  of  Advertising  had  made  a  commitment  to  the  \npromotion of the TT races.  \nThe inter-war period also saw legislation passed that changed the way \nthe TT was organised and in doing so supported the event’s continuation. \nIn  1927  Birkin’s  death  did  not  put  an  end  to  the  TT,  but  rather  instigated  \nthe   closing   of   roads   for   practising,   which   would   cause   further   \ninconvenience  to  island  residents;  an  inconvenience  that  was  on  balance  \nsupported  by  the  Manx  legislature  because  of  the  publicity  value  of  the  \nTT.  As  already  noted,  Daniel  Teare  (Ayre)  supported  this  legislation  \nbecause  the  TT  races  “[were]  established  in  the  Island,  and  we  look  on  \nthem  as  the  event  of  the  summer  season.”\n23\n  He  acknowledged  “I  know  \nvery  well  that  there  are  hardships,  but  if  we  work  for  the  common  good  \nand   put   up   with   these   grievances,   we   shall   bring   the   Island   to   \nprosperity.”\n24\n Johnson (North Douglas), naturally speaking for the island’s \npremier  town,  believed  that  the  races  were  “of  great  benefit  to  the  Island  \nas a visiting resort, and I should have thought that they were, at the most, \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n21\n Board of Advertising Minute Books, 1921-1937. \n22\n Board of Advertising Minute Books, 9 Oct. 1922.  \n23\n Debates, Vol. 45, March 1928, p. 618. \n24\n Debates, Vol. 45, March 1928, p. 622. \n\nChapter Four \n86\nonly  a  trifling  inconvenience  to  the  people  in  the  country  districts.”\n25\n We \ncan  see  once  again  the  sectional  divisions,  a  divide  between  rural  and  \nurban  interests  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  However,  suggestions  were  made  that  \nthe whole island would come to prosperity if the TT were continued, and \nindeed in an island that was geographically small the economic impact of \nthe  TT  might  be  felt  across  the  Isle  of  Man.  However,  Douglas,  and  the  \nbusinesses  situated  there  were  bound  to  benefit  in  particular  from  the  \ncontinuation  of  the  TT.  Once  again  we  can  see  a  disregard  of  the  \ndisruption caused to those living in rural areas, because the continuation of \nthe TT would allow Douglas in particular to prosper.  \nThese  were  not  the  only  voices  noting  the  publicity  value  of  the  TT.  \nCurphey  argued  that  the  event  was  “making  the  Island  known  throughout  \nthe season” and further “what you find [is] the Isle of Man brought before \nthe  public  through  the  races,  and  that  is  all  to  our  good.  It  is  an  \nadvertisement,  and  it  is  a  good  thing  to  have  them  here.”\n26\n Despite  the \ndangers of the TT, emphasised by Birkin’s death, this MHK saw the races \nas a good thing because they publicised the island and put money into the \nManx  economy,  or  at  least  into  the  economy  of  Douglas.  Curphey  only  \nsaw  the  benefits  to  be  had  from  publicity.  The  increasing  danger  of  the  \nraces,  and  the  adverse  press  comment  that  might  result  from  further  \ncasualties in the TT, were not pointed out.  \nIt  is  clear  that  members  of  Tynwald  supported  the  TT  because  they  \nbelieved  it  publicised  the  island  in  a  positive  way.  As  noted  above,  \nTynwald in 1929 passed a resolution to allow a grant of £5,000 to be made \nto the ACU, increasing the attractiveness of staging the TT on the island. \nThis  grant  would  come  out  of  the  island’s  general  revenue.\n27\n Annual \ngovernment  expenditure  in  the  financial  year  ending  31  March  1930  \ntotalled £430,451 and on 31 March 1931 totalled £463,082.\n28\n Thus, £5,000 \nequalled approximately one per cent of the total expenditure of the island; \na  small  amount  given  the  estimated  number  of  people  visiting  the  Isle  of  \nMan   and   spending   money   there.   Government   expenditure   naturally   \nincluded large amounts spent on highways and education, each averaging \napproximately £60,000 between 1926 and 1937. However, we can also see \nthat  the  government  granted  £7,000  for  the  purpose  of  advertising  the  \nisland, £6,000 for legislative expenses and £4,000 for the improvement of \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n25\n Debates, Vol. 45, March 1928, p. 620. \n26\n Debates, Vol. 45, March 1928, p. 620. \n27\n Accounts of Government Treasurer, 1926 - 1940 (Douglas, Isle of Man). \n28\n  Central  Government  Expenditure,  table  included  in  Kermode,  p.  125,  see  also  \nAccounts of Government Treasurer.  \n\nMoving through the Gears: Capitalist Interests in the TT \n87\nharbours (see table 4-3), and therefore the £5,000 grant to the ACU, a non-\nManx organisation, after 1930, was not inconsiderable. \n \nTable 4-3: Selected items of government expenditure 1926 – 1937. \n \nYear 1926 (£) 1929 (£) 1931 (£) 1934 (£) 1937 (£) \nLegislature \n6,075         5,924         5,663         5,032           5,292         \nHarbours \n3,677         5,467         12,800         12,644          9,558         \nPublic \nEducation \n54,       005       56,963       52,830       54,958         59,400       \nBoard of \nAdvertising \n7,000         7,000         7,000         7,000          10,000         \nHighway \nBoard \n54,646       58,906       52,709       47,000        50,       750       \nTT Races \n-                 -                 5,000                 5,000                 5,000                 \nSource: Accounts of Government Treasurer, 1926 – 1940, (Douglas, Isle of Man). \n \nThe  Speaker  of  the  House  of  Keys,  when  proposing  this  annual  grant  \nin 1929 reiterated the belief that the TT races would bring revenue into the \nManx economy. He argued “these races have been held for many years in \nthe Isle of Man. They have been a source of great interest and amusement \nto  our  visitors,  and  we  must  be  quite  frank  and  say  that  they  are  a  \npecuniary benefit to the Island.”\n29\n  \nWe  should  therefore  look  upon  this  grant  of  £5,000  to  the  ACU  for  \nencouragement of the TT’s continuation as a reasonable amount to secure \nadditional  publicity  for  the  Isle  of  Man,  especially  when  the  number  of  \npeople  visiting  the  island  is  taken  into  consideration.  In  1928,  550,472  \npeople  visited  the  Isle  of  Man  and  in  1929,  555,211.  More  specifically,  \nvisitor arrivals for May 1928 were 28,569 whereas June’s number totalled \n82,598.\n30\n The  Isle  of  Man  Examiner,  on  8  June  1928,  reported  the  arrival  \nof  between  15,000  and  16,000  people  between  the  Saturday  and  Monday  \npreceding Senior TT race and also anticipated the arrival of 11,000 people \nfor  the  Senior  TT  taking  place  on  9  June.\n31\n  If  there  were  between  20,000  \nand 30,000 people in the Isle of Man during race week, and this might be \nconsidered  a  conservative  estimate,  and  each  visitor  spent  five  pounds  \nduring their stay on the island, between £100,000 and £150,000 would be \nbrought into the Manx economy. Despite the fact that money from visitors \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n29\n Debates, Vol. 45, 4 Oct. 1929, p. 1203. \n30\n Isle of Man Examiner, 25 Oct. 1929.  \n31\n Isle of Man Examiner, 8 June 1928.  \n\nChapter Four \n88\nwould not go directly to the government, but would enter local businesses, \nan  investment  of  £5,000  by  the  government  for  a  return  of  £100,000  to  \n£150,000  to  the  economy  would  be  good  for  the  island.  It  might  also  be  \nsuggested  that  some  of  this  income  might  be  top-sliced  by  taxation  to  \ncover  the  cost  of  the  Highway  Board’s  expenditure  on  improving  the  \nisland’s  roads  and  even  the  budget  of  the  Board  of  Advertising,  both  \nbodies involved in the organisation and promotion of the TT. We can see \ntherefore that members of Tynwald wanted to see the TT continue because \nit had the potential to publicise the island alongside other events that took \nplace in the Isle of Man and boost the economy and government revenue.  \nFurther  to  this,  it  was  not  only  the  Manx  government  that  was  \ncommitted  financially  to  the  continuation  of  the  TT  during  the  inter-war  \nyears.  1929  also  saw  the  first  financial  contribution  made  to  the  ACU  by  \nthe Isle of Man Steam Packet Company.\n32\n The decision to make an annual \ncontribution was made on 22 May 1929, and continued for the rest of the \ninter-war  period.  The  company  gave  £100  to  the  ACU  towards  expenses  \nincurred  in  running  the  TT  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  By  giving  financial  \nassistance  to  the  ACU,  and  indeed  in  liaising  with  the  Isle  of  Man  \nHighway Board and the ACU over the dates of each TT race so that extra \nsailings  could  be  provided,  the  Steam  Packet  were  furthering  their  own  \ninterests by assisting the continuation of the TT. Clearly the belief existed \nthat  the  TT  attracted  visitors  to  the  island,  and  the  Isle  of  Man  Steam  \nPacket  provided  the  only  service  by  which  to  get  a  motorcycle  to  the  \nisland.  This  was  in  evidence  in  an  entry  in  the  minute  book  for  1933,  \nwhich, commenting on the decrease of 6,714 visitors to the island between \n29 April and 14 June 1933 stated, “this deficiency would be considerably \nreduced  when  arrivals  for  this  year’s  Senior  T.T.  Motor  Cycle  Races  are  \nascertained.”\n33\n \nThe  Manx  economy  was  becoming  increasingly  reliant  on  the  tourist  \nindustry  as  its  main  source  of  income.  It  has  been  shown  that  during  the  \ninter-war  period  there  was  a  decline  in  the  traditional  primary  and  \nsecondary  industries  of  fishing,  farming  and  manufacturing,  and  that  \ntourist  figures  remained  steadily  around  500,000.  Second,  it  has  been  \nshown that members of Tynwald believed strongly that the TT races were \nan  asset  that  could  be  used  to  advertise  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  hence  their  \nsupport for the legislation authorising and assisting the TT races. Last, we \ncan  once  again  see  some  evidence  of  a  division  between  rural  and  urban  \ninterests  in  the  TT.  References  have  been  made  to  the  appeal  of  the  TT  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n32\n Isle of Man Steam Packet Minute Book, 1 Jan. 1926-1 Dec. 1932 \n33\n Isle of Man Steam Packet Minutes Book, 5 Jan. 1933-19 April 1937.  \n\nMoving through the Gears: Capitalist Interests in the TT \n89\nespecially  for  those  working  in  Douglas,  where  the  largest  number  of  \nboarding   houses,   hotels,   inns   and   the   largest   section   of   the   Manx   \npopulation were situated.  \nNot  surprisingly,  some  hoteliers  and  boarding  house  keepers  used  the  \nTT  to  advertise  their  businesses,  particularly  those  sited  close  to  the  TT  \ncourse. For example, an advertisement for the Manningham Private Hotel \nin  the  island’s  1934  official  guide  used  a  photograph  of  hotel  staff  and  \nguests  lined  up  outside  the  premises,  alongside  two  motorcycles  and  a  \nnumber  of  trophies.\n34\n  Indeed,  writing  in  1949,  and  covering  the  inter-war  \nperiod, Manx journalist Curwen Clague noted that “as the years have gone \nby,  many  hotels  and  [boarding]  houses  have  become  the  recognised  H.Q.  \nof  certain  teams  and  personalities;  there  is  the  group  whose  hostess  is  \n‘Kanie’  of  Falcon  Cliff  and  latterly  Howstrake  fame;  the  Pevril  houses  \nRace H.Q of the A.C.U. and the staff of The T.T. Special; ‘Dickie’ Davies \nand  others  are  always  to  be  found  at  the  Sefton;  the  B.B.C.  are  not  far  \naway at the Falcon.”\n35\n However, the TT would not continue and the event \nwould   provide   no   publicity   for   the   Isle   of   Man   unless   motorcycle   \nmanufacturers continued to compete in the TT. \nThe British Motorcycle Industry \nIt  must  now  be  considered  why  motorcycle  manufacturers  wanted  to  \ncome   back   to   the   Isle   of   Man   and   race   on   a   circuit,   which   was   \ninconveniently  located  and  not  designed  for  racing.  Three  areas  will  be  \nexplored.  First,  the  growing  popularity  of  the  motorcycle  with  consumers  \nwill be discussed. Second, the role that manufacturers and the motorcycle \npress claimed the TT might and eventually did play in the development of \nmotorcycles,  which  even  so  between  the  wars  and  in  comparison  to  the  \nmotorcar  remained  “technologically  stagnant  and  continued  to  demand  \nmore  of  their  riders.”\n36\n  This  involves  examining  what  they  said  about  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n34\n  It  has  not  been  possible  to  examine  closely  the  profits  which  boarding  house  \nkeepers  and  hoteliers  on  the  Isle  of  Man  could  expect  to  make  from  the  TT,  \nbecause  little  material  exists  to  do  this.  There  is  no  comparable  work  to  that  of  \nWalton’s Blackpool Landlady, which examines the social history of Blackpool and \nits  development  as  a  seaside  resort.  Beckerson’s  Holiday  Isle:  The  Golden  Age  of  \nthe  Manx  Boarding  House  from  the  1870s  to  the  1970s  is  based  largely  on  \ninterviews  with  boarding  house  keepers  and  hoteliers  situated  on  the  island  and  \nprovides no information on incomes and makes scant mention of the TT race. \n35\n Curwen Clague, ‘What the Island Does’, p. 107.  \n36\n  S.

Third,   the   \nadvertisements produced by motorcycle and other manufacturers - of spark \nplugs, brakes, tyres, and magnetos – will be examined, to see if success or \neven mere participation in the TT was used to promote their products. \nThe  end  of  war  did  not  signify  an  immediate  revival  of  the  TT.  \nAlthough   it   might   be   expected   that   members   of   the   motorcycling   \ncommunity would be keen to bring back the TT as soon as possible, it was \nnot viable to hold an event in 1919. Despite this The Motor Cycle that year \neagerly anticipated the revival of the TT, feeling that World War One had \nspeeded  up  the  development  of  the  motorcycle  and  that  “most  engine  \ndesigners  will  have  learnt  more  during  that  time  than  any  other  before.”  \nFurther  it  argued:  “the  next  TT  race  [was]  likely  to  surpass  all  others  on  \nthe  point  of  interest.”\n 37\n  However,  the  decision  to  revive  the  races  did  not  \nlie wholly in the sanctioning of the races by Manx politicians, or with the \nreaders of The Motor Cycle; there was also the question of manufacturers \ngetting back on track.\n38\n The Motor Cycle realised this fact, stating “though \nwe  know  readers  would  like  to  see  a  race  in  1919  –  we  recognise  that  in  \nview  of  the  exceptional  circumstances  which  prevail  at  the  present  time,  \nthe financial decision must rest with the trade.”\n39\n It was argued further that \n“the  sporting  motorcyclist  would  doubtless  vote  unanimously  for  the  \nresumption of the races next summer – but it is improbable that the trade \nwould   be   able   to   direct   energies   to   racing   and   satisfy   numerous   \ncustomers.”\n40\n  This  comment  suggests  that  at  this  time  satisfying  the  \nmarket  demand  for  motorcycles  came  before  the  luxury  of  motorcycle  \nracing.  However,  motorcycle  racing  would  not  remain  on  the  sidelines.  \nWhilst there was no TT in 1919 and the 1920 TT received minimal entries, \nby 1921 manufacturers were once again entering teams into the TT. \nThe popularity of the motorcycle increased greatly during the inter-war \nyears. Stevenson argues that for better off young men sports cars were an \nattractive form of transportation, but further down the social scale: \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n37\n Motor Cycle, 3 April 1919.  \n38\n  Two  magazines  dominated  the  popular  motorcycle  press  market  between  the  \nwars, Motor Cycling and The Motor Cycle. These journals had a close relationship \nwith  the  motorcycle  industry,  and  it  was  not  uncommon  for  their  editors  to  be  \ninvited  to  important  British  Cycle  and  Motor  Cycle  Manufacturers’  and  Traders’  \nUnion meetings, and it was not unusual for members of the industry to move into \nthe  press  or  back  again.  For  example,  Graham  Walker  was  an  executive  with  \nRudge-Whitworth Motorcycle Company before becoming editor of Motor Cycling. \nSee Koerner, ‘The British Motor-cycle Industry’, p. 60.  \n39\n Motor Cycle, 20 Feb. 1919. \n40\n Motor Cycle, 20 Feb. 1919.  \n\nMoving through the Gears: Capitalist Interests in the TT \n91\nmotor-cycles  offered  a  cheaper  alternative,  both  for  travel  to  and  from  \nwork  and  for  leisure.  The  Great  War  had  expanded  production  of  motor-\ncycles  and  greatly  increased  knowledge  of  them,  particularly  amongst  \nservicemen. In 1920 there were more motor-cycles than cars, and numbers \nreached a peak in 1930.\n41\n \n \nAlthough  numbers  of  registered  motorcycles  decreased  after  1930,  there  \nwas  still  a  substantial  number  in  Britain.  Perkin  also  describes  the  same  \ntrend  in  the  popularity  of  the  motorcycle,  with  statistics  showing  that  \n“between  1919  and  1939  the  number  of  motor  vehicles  on  the  roads  \nincreased  nearly  ten-fold,  from  330,518  to  3,148,600.  Cars  increased  \nnearly  twentyfold  from  109,715  to  2,034,000.  The  rest  were  made  up  \nchiefly by motor-cycles, which rose from about a quarter of a million to a \npeak of nearly three quarters of a million in 1930 and then fell back to half \na  million.”\n42\n  During  the  inter-war  years  the  British  motorcycle  gained  \nsupremacy in world markets. The Daily Telegraph stated in 1927 “on the \nContinent ... everywhere the British motor-cycle is upon the roads, and the \nforeigner  willingly  concedes  its  superiority.  In  design,  lightness  and  \nefficiency it beats everything.”\n43\n The dominance of the British motorcycle \nindustry   is   backed   up   by   export   figures,   which   show   that   530,000   \nmotorcycles   were   exported   worldwide   between   1924   and   1940,   in   \ncomparison  to  just  169,000  exported  by  the  USA,  its  closest  competitor  \nover  the  same  period.  During  the  1920s  and  1930s  British  motorcycle  \nmanufacturers were market leaders.\n44\n \nMoreover  in  1928  The  Daily  Mail  suggested  that  the  TT  had  made  a  \nlarge  contribution  to  the  success  of  the  British  motorcycle  industry:  “the  \nBritish  manufacturer  is  maintaining,  indeed  increasing,  the  ascendancy  \nwhich  he  has  secured  in  this  type  of  vehicle”,  and  this  was  the  result  of  \n“such tests as those provided by the annual Tourist Trophy races.”\n45\n Motor \nCycling  admitted  in  1930  that  British  supremacy  in  the  motorcycle  \nindustry was being challenged by foreign machines, but insisted that at the \nTT races British motorcycles could not be beaten: \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n41\n J.

Koerner also provides production and export \nfigures in ‘The British Motor-cycle Industry During the 1930s’.  \n45\n Daily Mail, 5 June 1928.  \n\nChapter Four \n92\nAt present that supremacy is being seriously challenged by more than one \nContinental  country,  but  overseas  manufacturers  have  yet  to  prove,  with  \none or two exceptions, that their machines are a match for our own on the \nIsle  of  Man.  The  eyes  of  the  whole  motorcycling  world  are  fixed  upon  \nthese  races  each  year,  and  so  long  as  British  machines  continue  to  win  \nthem  it  would  be  definitely  bad  business  policy  to  discontinue  [the  TT  \nraces].\n46\n \n \nA 1934 issue of Motor Cycling suggested that there were a number of \nways  that  this  supremacy  could  be  measured.  First,  British  motorcycle  \ncompanies   were   producing   more   than   anyone   else;   second,   British   \nmotorcycles were superior in design and workmanship; and, third, British \nproducts were winning race after race on both home and foreign tracks.\n47\n \nConsiderable success was enjoyed in the TT in the case of manufacturers \nsuch  as  Norton.  Race  results  show  Norton  achieved  a  large  number  of  \nvictories  in  the  TT  especially  during  the  late  1920s  and  early  1930s.\n48\n As \nthe  1930s  progressed,  British  motorcycles  would  face  competition  from  \nforeign machines such as BMW and Moto Guzzi, and so entry into the TT \nraces would become more important to the British motorcycle industry in \nmaintaining its superiority.\n49\n  \nThe  Isle  of  Man  was  still  an  inconvenient  location  for  a  motorcycle  \nrace,  despite  the  development  of  an  infrastructure  which  supported  its  \ntourist  industry  and  thus  saw  improved  transport  links,  and  despite  the  \npolitical  and  financial  support  offered  for  the  continuation  of  the  TT  by  \nTynwald  and  indeed  such  organisations  as  the  Isle  of  Man  Steam  Packet  \nCompany. In 1924, the problems faced by manufacturers as a result of the \ninconvenience   of   the   island’s   location   were   addressed   in   a   private   \nmembers’  bill  in  Westminster,  proposing  the  legalisation  of  road  races  in  \nEngland. This was presented in the House of Commons on 6 March 1924 \nwhen Colonel Moore-Brabazon put forward the Motor Cycle Races Bill.\n50\n \nMoore-Brabazon was a keen aviator, one time mechanic for C.S.

It was noted by \nBrabazon   when   proposing   the   bill’s   second   reading,   that   British   \nmotorcycles were superior to those of any other country, but also that the \nmotorcycle  industry  suffered  because  “the  great  races,  which  are  such  an  \nenormous  advertisement  to  [the]  industry,  must  be  held  outside  this  \ncountry  instead  of  in  it.”\n53\n  In  an  article  in  The  Motor  Cycle  in  1925,  \nMoore-Brabazon expressed confidence that the bill would be passed, even \nclaiming on the inevitability of its passage through Westminster.\n54\n \nHowever,  the  majority  inside  or  outside  Westminster  did  not  share  \nBrabazon’s  views,  and  this  was  demonstrated  in  a  lack  of  support  for  the  \nlegislation,  and  indeed  the  progress  of  the  bill  cannot  be  further  traced  \nthrough  the  printed  debates.  An  article  in  the  Solicitors’  Journal  in  1924  \npointed  out  that  the  Manx  authorities  were  ignoring  UK  legislation  by  \nholding motorcycle races on public roads. It even claimed that a bill before \nparliament  to  legalise  the  use  of  public  roads  for  motorcycling  was  “very  \nmuch as if some member introduced a Bill to legalise homicide and theft. \nWe  do  not  know  any  ground  on  which  the  public  can  be  deprived  of  the  \nuse of the highway for such a purpose in any part of the country – the Isle \nof Man has put itself in this respect outside the pale of civilisation.” This \narticle commented further that if there were to be any change in the law it \nshould  be  in  the  direction  of  the  strict  enforcement  of  the  present  very  \nliberal speed limit, which then stood at twenty miles per hour.\n55\n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n51\n   Kenneth   Rose,   ‘Brabazon,   John   Theodore   Cuthbert   Moore-,   first   Baron   \nBrabazon  of  Tara  (1884–1964)’,  rev.,  Oxford  Dictionary  of  National  Biography, \nOxford   University   Press,   2004   [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32018,   \naccessed 15 Oct. 2008].  \n52\n  Adrian  Smith,  ‘Iliffe,  Edward  Mauger,  first  Baron  Iliffe  (1877–1960)’,  Oxford \nDictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, \nMay   2007   [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34091,   accessed,   15   Oct.   \n2008]. \n53\n Hansard Debates Commons, Volume 171, 1 April 1924, Col. 2119 – 2120. \n54\n Motor Cycle, 15 Jan. 1925, p. 77.  \n55\n ‘The Motor Peril and Nuisance’, Solicitors’ Journal, 68 (1924), 766 – 7, see also \n‘The Motor Peril’, Solicitors’ Journal, 67, (1923), p. 872. \n\nChapter Four \n94\nA  Ministry  of  Transport  memorandum,  written  as  a  comment  on  the  \nbill,  was  of  a  similar  opinion.  It  suggested,  rather  obviously,  that  the  bill  \nhad probably been influenced by the legislation passed on the Isle of Man \nin 1904. It was also asserted, incorrectly, that the Manx had established the \nTT  for  the  purpose  of  prolonging  the  holiday  season.  Further  and  rather  \nignorant criticism of the Manx followed: \n \nRoads were made for getting from one place to another and not for racing, \nand considerations which may have weight in the Isle of Man have none in \nthis  country.  The  Island  is  a  pleasure  resort  and  the  principal  use  of  the  \nroads  is  to  accommodate  the  visiting  traffic.  Roads  in  England  are  in  \ncontinuous  use  by  commercial  and  private  traffic  and  it  is  difficult  to  \nimagine  any  roads  near  populous  centres  where  great  inconvenience  and  \ndanger  would  not  be  caused  by  persons  practising  for  races,  let  alone  by  \nthe races themselves.\n56\n \n \nManx  legislation  definitely  did  not  set  a  precedent  for  legislation  in  \nWestminster.    In    the    opinion    of    the    Ministry    of    Transport,    the    \ninconvenience caused by the TT to islanders was unimportant as they were \nused  to  their  roads  being  used  primarily  by  visitors.  It  would  therefore  \nmatter  little  if  these  roads  were  closed  for  the  purpose  of  motorcycle  \nracing. It was more important to prevent racing on public roads in England \nthan it was to stop such an event taking place on the Isle of Man. With the \nbill receiving little support, the proposal that motor races could take place \non public roads in England remained wildly optimistic. \nThe  greatest  benefit  of  a  race  in  England  would  be  the  reduction  in  \ncosts  to  the  motorcycle  manufacturer.  The  fact  that  the  TT  continued  to  \ntake place on the Isle of Man meant that these costs were large. The Motor \nCycle   in   1929   reckoned   it   “cannot   be   estimated,   but   is   always   \nenormous.”\n57\n   Manufacturers   had   to   get   their   motorcycles   from   the   \nMidlands, where the majority of the motorcycle industry was based, to the \nIsle  of  Man.  There  was  the  cost  of  transport  to  the  island,  which  would  \ninvolve   the   carriage   of   motorcycles,   spare   parts   and   personnel   plus   \naccommodation  costs  on  the  Isle  of  Man  for  riders,  mechanics  and  other  \nteam  members.  There  was  also  the  cost  of  preparing  a  motorcycle,  or  \nmotorcycles, for the TT and the cost of employing a rider, or riders, to take \nthe  motorcycle(s)  successfully  around  the  TT  course.  An  article  in  The \nMotor Cycle in 1924 suggested that a manufacturer might invest a sum of \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n56\n  Home  Office  File  HO45/17413,  Motor,  Motor  Cycle  and  Cycle  race  on  Public  \nRoads and Foreshores March 1924 – October 1929, TNA.  \n57\n Motor Cycle, 27 June 1929, p. 1042. \n\nMoving through the Gears: Capitalist Interests in the TT \n95\n£20,000  in  putting  together  a  team  for  the  TT,  a  race  which,  it  was  \nestimated,  might  be  watched  by  approximately  100,000  spectators  but  of  \nwhom  only  900  were  motorcycle  owners.  However,  if  this  TT  were  held  \non  “home  soil”  the  initial  cost  would  be  reduced,  and  an  estimated  \n250,000 spectators, of whom 20,000 would be motorcyclists, would watch \nthe  event.\n58\n  This  would  be  the  result  of  the  races  not  being  held  in  an  \nisolated area – the Isle of Man. Certainly, the figures might be spurious but \nthe argument was plausible. Racing on a circuit in England, maybe in the \nMidlands, would significantly reduce costs of transport and lodgings, and \npotentially  increase  publicity  for  manufacturers.  After  all,  the  TT  was  an  \nevent  geared  towards  the  production  of  the  most  reliable  motorcycle,  but  \nthey also provided publicity.  \nThere  was  also  the  growing  feeling  that  the  TT  was  beginning  to  lose  \nits  original  raison  d’etre,  which  had  been  to  assist  in  the  development  of  \nproduction  line  motorcycles  of  the  kind  sold  to  ordinary  customers.  This  \ncan be seen in the rules laid down for the 1907 TT races (see above). The \nTT was becoming a contest between highly skilled riders, riding specially \nprepared  motorcycles.  It  was  therefore  less  a  test  bed  for  the  “everyday”  \nmachine, the kind of motorcycle that might be ridden to and from work or \nfor  trips  from  urban  areas  into  the  countryside  where  speed  was  not  such  \nan  important  concern.  The  Motor  Cycle  reported  on  the  TT  races  in  1924  \nthat \n \nThis summer the Triumph and Sunbeam factories were represented by only \nsingle  private  entries.  The  Rudge,  Indian  and  Matchless  machines  –  all  \nfamous winners of the past – were completely absent. Scotts only sent two \nmachines,  one  of  them  privately  owned.  On  the  home  going  boats  the  \nremark,  ‘We  shall  never  compete  again!’  is  a  hardy  annual,  and  need  not  \nbe  taken  too  seriously;  but  it  acquires  fresh  significance  when  so  many  \nfirms  already  stand  aloof,  and  it  was  heard  this  year  with  more  frequency  \nand emphasis than usual.\n59\n  \n \nThat  these  manufacturers  stayed  away  from  the  TT  suggests  that  they  \nbelieved that it had little purpose. The TT was becoming more and more a \nrace  in  which  specialist  bikes  and  highly  skilled  riders  competed  against  \neach other and so the technical benefits to be had were said to be limited. \nThere  were  also  some  humorous  representations  of  the  TT’s  failings.  For  \ninstance,  cartoons  in  The  Motor  Cycle  and  Motor  Cycling  identified  the  \nwide range of specialist motorcycles that were entered into the races, and \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n58\n Motor Cycle, 17 July 1924, p. 82.  \n59\n Motor Cycle, 17 July 1924, p. 82. \n\nChapter Four \n96\nsuggested  that  the  races  should  be  changed  to  suit  the  demands  of  the  \ntourist and so brought back in line with the original rules, by bringing in a \nfuel  stop  and  a  lunch  break.  New  ways  to  make  the  TT  more  interesting  \nnow  that  speed  had  acquired  importance  were  also  proposed  including,  \ninterestingly,  making  competitors  wear  their  national  costume.  These  \nillustrations are intended to be comic, but yet they comment amply on the \nsituation.  \nSo,  the  TT  was  seen  by  some  to  have  become  a  test  of  speed,  which  \nwould  require  specially  designed  machines.  In  the  late  1920s  Edward  \nTurner, chief designer and general manager of Triumph, had this to say: \n \nI am often asked, why Triumph don’t [sic] show interest in the T.T. races. \nThe  answer  is  that  racing  is  no  longer  an  attractive  proposition  for  \nmanufacturers. In 1926 or 1927 the position was different, because at least \n60  per  cent  of  a  racing  machine  was  then  based  on  the  standard  model.  \nToday,  racing  machines  are  special  from  wheel  to  wheel,  and  there  is  \nnothing  that  can  be  translated  into  production.  I  don’t  say  that  the  T.T.  \nshould be abolished, just that there should be stock-machine races, and for \nour  part  we  should  be  prepared  to  support  such  events.  I  believe  other  \nmakers would do so, too.\n60\n \n \nEvidently,  the  chief  designer  at  Triumph  believed  that  the  races  were  not  \nadvantageous to the company because they did not set out to improve the \nproduction motorcycle; they only served to make manufacturers produce a \nspecially  built  motorcycle  for  racing  on  the  island.  BSA  also  proved  that  \nattendance at the TT was not necessary to improve the production of their \nmotorcycles.  BSA  “had  made  two  attempts  to  take  part  in  major  speed  \nevents; in the TT races of 1913 and 1921. In the former, a team of six 500s \nwas entered, with only a single finisher in 7\nth\n place”, and further that “the \n1921  attempt  was  a  total  and  most  spectacular  disaster”\n61\n BSA  did  not \nenter  the  TT  races  again  until  after  World  War  Two.  Despite  this  lack  of  \nsuccess, however, BSA was the market leader during the 1920s, producing \n12,000  to  18,000  machines  per  year  for  much  of  the  decade,  which  \nequated  to  20  –  25  per  cent  of  the  total  output  of  the  British  motorcycle  \nindustry.\n62\n \nWe  can  see  then  that  it  was  not  entirely  necessary  for  a  motorcycle  \nmanufacturer  to  enter  the  TT  races,  as  has  been  shown  in  the  opinion  of  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n60\n  H.

The cost of entering the TT \nwas also large, and while attempts were made to try and reduce this, there \nwas  little  or  even  no  chance  that  a  motorcycle  race  would  be  held  on  \npublic  roads  in  England.  This  meant  that  if  manufacturers  wanted  to  test  \ntheir  machines  against  those  produced  by  other  manufacturers,  the  best  \nand indeed only place to do so was on the Isle of Man.  \nThe  legislation  proposed  by  Moore-Brabazon  failed,  and  so  there  was  \nno chance of a motorcycle road race, taking place in England. This meant \nthat despite the obvious disadvantages of racing on the Isle of Man, most \nmanufacturers  were  tempted  still  to  participate.  Evidently  there  were  \nadvantages to be had from competing on the island. The location of the TT \ncourse  might  have  been  inconvenient,  but  the  course,  tried  and  tested  in  \nthe past, provided a unique examination of a motorcycle’s reliability, with \nhills, tight corners and long straights testing its all-round performance. The \ntourist, most manufacturers argued, wanted a motorcycle that was reliable \nand  easily  maintained.  The  TT  races  were  the  ultimate  test  of  reliability.  \nAn anonymous article in The Evening News in 1922 argued that there were \ncertain areas of motorcycle design that were exposed by races such as the \nTT:  \n \nThe hidden weakness in the gearbox, the latent fault in lubrication – these \nand  a  thousand  other  faults  are  infallibly  brought  to  light  by  the  test  of  \nsuch  races  as  the  Tourist  Trophy  and  the  annual  500  mile  event  at  \nBrooklands. It is to these that we owe the efficiency and reliability of our \nmedium-powered  motor-cycle,  attributes  now  so  well  known  that  the  \ntransfer  of  a  classic  British  maker  is  as  much  respected  in  the  farthest  \ncorner of the world as the hall mark on gold.\n63\n \n \nIt  was  also  acknowledged  that  specific  advances  in  the  development  of  \nmotorcycle engineering also resulted from entry into the TT. An article in \nMotor Cycling in 1930, reported Rudge’s TT success, using a new engine \ndesign  that  consisted  of  a  “semi-spherical  combustion  chamber  and  four  \nvalves,  all  mutually  inclined  with  the  sparking  plug  in  the  middle.”  This  \nengine had been specifically tested in the TT, and whilst the difficulties in \ndesigning  such  an  engine  had  deterred  other  manufacturers,  “the  Rudge  \ndesigners   have   produced   a   TT   machine   with   this   seemingly   ideal   \narrangement  and,  what  is  more,  it  has  proved  itself  good  enough  to  take  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n63\n Evening  News,  17  June  1922.

In  a  meeting  of  the  Competitions  Committee  of  the  \nManufacturers’ Union in 1922, it was decided that teams competing in the \nTT  should  specify  to  the  ACU  at  the  beginning  of  a  race  the  type  of  fuel  \nand oil used by their motorcycles, and that the ACU should be responsible \nfor publishing this information afterwards. It was believed that “the public \nshould  be  acquainted  with  such  details.”\n65\n  This  shows  recognition  of  the  \npower  of  the  races  to  influence  the  buying  public,  assuming  that  the  fuel  \nand oil used were commercially available. The question of the type of fuel \nto be used in the TT was again raised in 1926 in a further meeting between \nthe Competitions Committee of the ACU and the Manufacturers’ Union. A \npress release concerning the rules for the 1926 TT races stated that:  \n \nThe Competition Committee of the ACU and the British Cycle and Motor-\ncycle Manufacturers’ and Traders’ Union Ltd., met at the R.A.C, London, \nto-day  to  discuss  the  question  of  the  fuels  which  should  be  used  by  \ncompetitors   in   the   Tourist   Trophy   Races   this   year.   The   Motorcycle   \nManufacturers   asked   that   no   fuel   should   be   used   which   is   not   \ncommercially   obtainable,   their   opinion   being   that   the   use   of   non-\ncommercial  fuels  in  the  Races  conveys  impressions  to  the  public  that  the  \nmachines used bear no resemblance to those supplied to the public, and are \nnot obtainable, even in a modified form for touring purposes. \n \nWhilst  the  Auto  Cycle  Union  is  firmly  convinced  that  no  restrictions  \nshould be embodied in the regulations which would deprive the T.T. Races \nof  their  value  as  a  testing  ground,  not  only  for  the  machines  themselves,  \nbut  for  every  accessory  used  in  connection  with  them,  the  arguments  \nadvanced by the manufacturers in regard to the use of commercial fuels in \nthis  year’s  Races  were  of  such  value  to  the  riding  public  that  the  Auto  \nCycle  Union  decided  to  accede  to  the  Manufacturers’  request.  For  1926,  \ntherefore,  no  fuels  other  than  those  which  are  at  present  commonly  \ncommercially obtainable will be permitted.\n66\n \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n64\n Motor Cycling, 25 June 1930, pp. 227-228.  \n65\n  Competitions  Committee  Meeting,  15  December  1922,  Manufacturers’  Union  \nminutes 1922 – 1924, p. 646, MRC, MSS.204/1/1/5. \n66\n Communication issued to press after conference between Manufacturers’ Union \nand  ACU,  22  Jan.  1926,  Manufacturer’s  Union  minutes  1924  –  1926,  p.  920,  \nMRC, MSS.204/1/1/6. \n\nMoving through the Gears: Capitalist Interests in the TT \n99\nThe  most  significant  parts  of  this  statement  are  the  emphases  that  were  \nplaced  on  commercially  obtainable  fuel  and  that  the  TT  was  used  as  a  \ntesting   ground   for   motorcycle   accessories   as   well   as   the   machines   \nthemselves.  From  this  it  is  clear  that  the  Manufacturers’  Union  and  the  \nACU  were  keen  to  see  the  TT  reflect  the  products  available  for  the  \nconsumer, if not now then later. The commitment of these organisations to \nsee  the  TT  serve  the  purpose  of  improving  design  was  therefore  another  \nreason  why  many  manufacturers  entered  the  TT,  because  they  had  the  \nencouragement of their governing bodies.  \nThere were also financial incentives. In 1930, when the first grant was \nprovided  to  the  ACU,  the  reasons  for  which  were  discussed  earlier,  the  \nManx government provided a further reason for manufacturers to continue \ncoming  to  the  Isle  of  Man.  It  was  decided,  in  an  agreement  between  the  \nACU and the Manufacturers’ Union that the initial grant of £5,000 would \nbe  used  for  prize  money  and  to  assist  foreign  competitors  to  participate.  \n£1,000  was  set  aside  to  encourage  international  entries  of  six  to  eight  \ncompetitors  from  Canada,  New  Zealand,  Australia  and  South  Africa.  A  \nfurther   £1,500   was   set   aside   to   secure   first-class   riders   from   other   \nContinental  countries.  This  would  increase  the  international  nature  of  the  \nTT.  The  remaining  £2,500  was  allocated  to  a  prize  fund  for  winning  \nmanufacturers,  which  would  include  rewards  for  up  to  sixth  position  in  \neach race: a further incentive to race on the Isle of Man.\n67\n \nThis grant was redistributed in 1932 with the purpose of giving greater \nincentives to manufacturers to enter the TT, “for it was recognised that the \nmanufacturers’  support  of  the  event  was  imperative  to  the  Island.”\n68\n The \ngrant was redistributed so that teams entered by British manufacturers, not \nexceeding  four  in  each  race,  were  free  of  all  expenses  and  also  so  that  \nriders appearing as the manufacturer’s entrant were paid an appearance fee \nof  £20.  Once  again,  international  entries  were  considered.  It  was  agreed  \nthat official invitations to riders in the dominions should be reduced to one \nper  dominion  –  but  each  entry  would  only  be  accepted  after  the  British  \nmotorcycle manufacturer had signalled his intention to support the entrant. \n£50  would  then  be  given  to  the  manufacturer  to  cover  the  cost  of  the  \nprofessional assistance given to the rider. The balance of the £5,000 would \nbe  used  to  subsidise  foreign  riders,  and  if  riding  a  British  machine  a  £50  \nsubsidy would be payable to the manufacturer. Thus we can see that from \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n67\n  Competitions  Committee,  Manufacturers’  Union,  7  Nov.  1930,  Manufacturers’  \nUnion minutes 1930 – 31, pp. 1525 - 26, MRC, MSS.204/1/1/9. \n68\n Notes of conference between representatives of Manufacturers’ Union and ACU \n20  July  1932,  Manufacturer’s  Union  minutes  1931  –  1933,  p.  1769,  MRO,  \nMSS.204/1/1/10A. \n\nChapter Four \n100\n1930  financial  incentives  encouraged  entry  into  the  TT  races,  which  may  \nhave   had   the   effect   of   attracting   more   British   and   also   foreign   \nmanufacturers  to  the  event  and  even  attracting  a  more  international  entry  \nin the TT. Foreign manufacturers would also have sought to use the TT to \ntest  their  machines,  especially  against  machines  produced  by  British  \nmanufacturers, who were seen as the leaders in the industry.\n69\n  \nAdvertising and the TT \nDuring  the  inter-war  years  advertising  in  general  became  a  more  \norganised  and  effective  business.  Nevett  argues  that  the  inter-war  period  \nwas “the golden age of advertising” during which new media were used to \nimprove  the  precision  and  effectiveness  of  advertising.\n70\n Elliot,  in A \nHistory of English Advertising, also highlights the increasing organisation \nof advertising that took place during the inter-war years.\n71\n Both texts offer \nuseful  comment  on  developments  of  advertising  techniques  and  on  the  \npeople   and   personalities   behind   the   organisation   of   the   advertising   \nindustry, but this is not important to this section. What is important to note \nis  that  advertising  began  to  play  a  much  more  significant  role  in  the  \ndevelopment of the consumer society.  \nThe inter-war period also saw a rise in the consumption of sport. More \nmoney was spent on watching sport and gambling on sport and there was \ngreater  coverage  of  sport  in  national  newspapers.  For  example,  between  \n1937  and  1939  The  Times  devoted  21  per  cent  of  news  space  to  the  \ncoverage of sport, The Daily Mail 36 per cent and The Daily Mirror 36 per \ncent.\n72\n  Benson  considers  the  major  changes  that  took  place  nationally  in  \nthe   consumption   of   sport   during   the   inter-war   years,   and   also   the   \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n69\n  H.

If  more  people  were  watching  sport  then  there  would  be  much  \ngreater  knowledge  of  sporting  events  among  consumers.  The  TT  was  a  \nsporting  event  that  was  growing  in  significance  during  the  inter-war  \nperiod.  \nThe   motorcycle   industry   began   to   advertise   their   products   more   \nextensively, and one angle that was taken was the emphasis on success in \nracing, especially in the Isle of Man TT. If the decision were made to race \non  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  if  a  manufacturer’s  team  enjoyed  success  in  a  \nparticular  race  –  finishing  either  first,  second  or  third  –  this  achievement  \ncould be used to sell their machines. Despite the limited advertising before \nWorld  War  One,  by  1921  there  was  extensive  use  of  achievements  in  the  \nTT in advertisements produced not only by motorcycle manufacturers but \nalso  by  sellers  of  spare  parts  and  even  independent  garages  to  advertise  \ntheir products and services, especially in the motorcycle press where such \nadvertisements would be expected to appear. \nDespite  the  view  of  one  letter  written  to  the  editor  of  Motor  Cycling, \nwhich  suggested  that  too  many  advertisements  drawing  on  TT  success  \nproduced  confusion  as  to  who  the  winner  of  a  race  was,  there  were  \nadvantages to be derived from a victory in the TT.\n74\n One technical journal, \nThe  Automobile  Engineer,  noted  in  1928  that  there  were  “undoubted  \ncommercial advantages that follow upon success in this [the TT] and other \ntrials  of  a  sports  character”,  and  indeed  it  was  judged  a  “ruling  factor.”\n75\n \nEmphasis  on  sporting  events  was  again  endorsed  in  1937  as  “a  useful  \ndevice  in  breaking  down  sales  resistance.”\n76\n  It  was  claimed  that  a  firm  \nwhose  motorcycles  did  well  at  the  TT  was  almost  certain  to  enjoy  \nimproved  sales  shortly  afterwards.  “Many  chaps  of  quite  high  standing”,  \nclaimed J.M. West in an interview with Koerner, who confided to him that \nhis  choice  of  a  new  machine  was  dependant  on  the  outcome  of  the  TT  \nraces, decided: “I’m going to buy whatever wins the TT.”\n77\n \nWe  can  see  also  that  Triumph,  whose  chief  designer  allegedly  argued  \nagainst  participation  in  the  TT  races,  placed  a  TT  mark  on  some  of  their  \nmotorcycles.  Triumph  had  produced  a  500  c.c.  model  between  1909  and  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n73\n Benson, The Rise of Consumer Society, p. 110.  \n74\n Motor Cycling, 6 July 1921. \n75\n ‘Motor cycles’, The Automobile Engineer, August 1928, p. 273. \n76\n ‘Motor Cycle Sport’, The Export Trader, July 1937, p. 231. \n77\n As quoted in Koerner, ‘The British Motor Cycle Industry, 1935 – 1975’, p. 22. \n\nChapter Four \n102\n1914,  a  mark  which  appeared  again  in  1927  and  1928.\n78\n These  were \nproduction  motorcycles  for  the  public  market.  Triumph  was  using  their  \nearlier  experience  of  the  TT  to  develop  the  design  of  their  motorcycles,  \nand evidently judged that the existence of the TT mark on the motorcycle \nwould  make  it  more  attractive  to  Triumph’s  customers.  Gilbert  Smith,  \nmanaging  director  of  Norton  –  a  brand  which  became  synonymous  with  \nthe  TT  during  this  period  –  looked  back  on  the  success  of  Norton  \nmotorcycles  in  the  TT  during  the  inter-war  years  and  made  it  clear  that  \n“undoubtedly an Isle of Man win means that the winning make of machine \nis  publicised  in  every  important  newspaper  in  the  world:  this  is  valuable  \npublicity   and   would   normally   cost   far   more   than   any   motor-cycle   \nmanufacturer could spend.”\n79\n  \nIt   was   not   just   motorcycle   manufacturers   who   benefited   from   \nachievements   in   the   TT.   Examples   of   advertising   from   the   period   \ndemonstrate   independent   garages   and   manufacturers   of   accessories   \ndrawing  on  success  in  the  TT  to  advertise  their  services.  For  example,  in  \nan advertisement for Renold Chains it is stated that they were fitted to the \nfirst,  second  and  third  placed  machines  in  the  1921  Junior  and  Senior  TT  \nraces.  The  implication  is  that  if  this  accessory  were  fitted  to  a  production  \nmotorcycle  the  customer  would  be  benefiting  “by  the  experience  of  the  \nmen  who  know.”  Indeed,  Renold  Chains  was  a  well-established  business  \nby 1921, having been founded in 1879.\n80\n In this instance the TT was being \nused  to  publicise  the  business  of  Hans  Renold  Limited,  Manchester,  and  \nalso  to  signify  product  reliability.  Further  advertisements  from  Motor \nCycling again  draw  on  achievements  in  the  TT,  the  promoting,  for  \nexample,  the  reliability  of  AMAC  carburettors  that  were  fitted  to  TT  \nmachines and to independent garages selling AJS motorcycles, which had \nbeaten Indian to first place in the Senior TT race. Such promotion, it was \nassumed,  would  make  AJS  motorcycles  more  attractive  to  the  average  \nmotorcyclist  or  tourist.  He  would  be  buying  a  motorcycle  with  proven  \nsuccess on the racetrack and, as a result, reliability.  \nThere was further exploitation of success in the TT by firms selling oil, \ntyres  and  magnetos.  Miracle  Oil  exploits  the  victory  of  Tom  Sheard,  the  \nfirst Manx born TT winner. Dunlop is also shown to have promoted their \nsequence  of  victories  in  the  TT  since  1907  to  advertise  the  quality  of  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n78\n A list of models between 1902 and 1981 can be found in H. Louis and B. Currie, \nThe Story of Triumph Motor Cycles, pp. 126 – 141. \n79\n  G.  Gilbert  Smith,  ‘The  Manufacturer’s  Side:  Inner  History’,  in  G.S.

In each of these advertisements there evidently is no need to stipulate \nthat these products had been tested on the Isle of Man and indeed in very \nfew  advertisements  is  the  Isle  of  Man  referred  to.  The  advertisements  \nsimply  list  achievements  under  terms  such  as  “Senior  TT”,  “Lightweight  \nTT”  or  “Junior  TT.”  TT  and  Isle  of  Man  had  become  merged  in  a  single  \nbrand or identity. \nA  further  development  in  advertising  during  the  inter-war  period  saw  \nadvertising  agencies  brought  under  tighter  legal  control.  They  were  no  \nlonger allowed to use people’s names without their consent as if they were \nendorsing  a  product.  Such  misconduct  was  exemplified  in  the  case  of  \namateur  golfer  Cyril  Tolley  in  1928,  whose  name  Fry’s  used  without  his  \npermission. Ultimately Tolley brought an action against Fry’s for libel, in \nwhich  he  was  awarded  £1,000  damages.  This  case  set  a  precedent  and  \nadvertisers could no longer get away with using any person they chose to \nendorse   their   products.\n82\n   It   is   interesting   therefore   that   motorcycle   \nmanufacturers  also  used  the  success  of  TT  riders  to  promote  a  particular  \nmachine. We can see instances where victories of specific riders are drawn \non  to  promote  both  motorcycles  and  motorcycle  accessories,  providing  \nearly examples of a celebrity culture attached to TT victors. A Hutchinson \ntyre  advertisement  from  1922,  for  example,  drew  on  the  success  of  Tom  \nSheard, as noted earlier the first Manxman to win a TT race: \n \nA T.T. winner is Tom Sheard –  \n(Heavens! How the natives cheered!) \nNow Manx cats have a ‘Tail’ to tell –  \nThe ‘Tyre with nine lives’ did so well\n.\n83\n \n \nNorton’s  publicity  similarly  draws  on  the  triumphs  of  Jimmy  Guthrie  \nand  Stanley  Woods,  two  prominent  riders  of  the  period.\n84\n  Riders  such  as  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n81\n  The  history  of  the  development  of  Dunlop  can  be  seen  in  R.

He  was  killed  \ncompeting  in  the  1937  German  Grand  Prix,  and  is  commemorated  by  the  Guthrie  \nMemorial  situated  on  the  mountain  section  of  the  TT  circuit.  A  statue  was  also  \nerected  in  his  memory  in  Hawick,  Scotland.  Stanley  Woods  competed  in  the  TT  \n\nChapter Four \n104\nGuthrie,  Woods  and  even  Walter  Hanley  were  not  representative  of  the  \naverage  “tourist”  and  their  motorcycles  were  not  representative  of  the  \naverage   motorcycle,   but   if   the   everyday   rider   believed   a   firm   was   \nvictorious  in  the  Isle  of  Man  TT  and  could  even  put  a  name  on  this  \nsuccess,  the  attractiveness  of  the  machine  would  be  increased.  Whether  \nthese riders had given permission for their names to be used is unclear, but \nthey were racing for manufacturers’ teams and were not amateur riders, so \nthe  association  between  their  success  and  a  particular  brand  of  machine  \ncould be made. \nIndeed, even during the inter-war period there was some recognition of \nthe  celebrity  of  TT  riders  in  the  British  press,  with  the  Daily  Express  for  \nexample  commenting  in  1927  that  in  the  TT  “heroes  of  the  continent  \ncompete  side  by  side  with  the  men  whose  names  are  household  words  in  \nEngland.”\n85\n The Bolton Evening News claimed that “not the most brilliant \nDerby favourite can inspire such raptures of hero worship as those that are \nlavished each year in the Isle of Man on him who has covered those break \nneck  miles  on  the  flanks  of  Snaefell  at  record  speed.”\n86\n Even  during  the \ninter-war   period   it   was   realised   that   celebrity   sold   products,   and   \nrecognition that those racing in the TT were highly skilled and worthy of \n“celebrity” status.  \nThe  examples  of  Triumph  and  BSA  show  that  success  in  the  TT  was  \nnot  essential  in  order  to  become  a  profitable  motorcycle  manufacturer.  \nHowever,  even  if  entry  and  success  in  the  Isle  of  Man  were  not  essential  \nduring  the  inter-war  period,  they  probably  helped.  Most  motorcycle  \nmanufacturers  continued  to  attend  the  TT  races,  despite  the  obvious  \ndeterrents of cost and inconvenience. If a particular machine, be it AJS or \nNorton,  achieved  anything  from  first  to  even  fourth  or  fifth  place  this  \n“success” could be advertised: the machine on sale had proven TT quality.  \nManufacturers  continued  to  enter  teams  because  the  TT  was  a  test  of  \nreliability and the Isle of Man provided an arena where machines could be \ntested  in  competition.  Without  the  participation  of  manufacturers  teams  \nthere would be no TT race. If there were no TT, there would be no testing \nground  for  new  machines  and  accessories  and  there  would  not  be  an  \ninternationally  known  event  to  use  in  their  publicity.  Furthermore,  as  a  \nresult  of  the  continued  support  of  manufacturers  for  the  TT,  not  only  did  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\nfrom 1923 - 1939.

We  might  suggest  that  the  TT  became  part  of  a  Manx  \nidentity in the minds of Manx politicians, but not necessarily in the minds \nof the entire population. It has also been shown that the TT was supported \nby  motorcycle  manufacturers,  and  by  offering  their  support  they  too  \nplayed  a  part  in  the  development  of  the  TT  as  an  ingredient  of  Manx  \nidentity by increasing the external representation of the Isle of Man as the \nhome  of  the  TT  races. This  chapter  looks  at  the  construction  of  identity  \nboth  outside  and  inside  of  the  island  during  the  inter-war  period.  It  will  \ntake  as  its  theme  the  work  of  Urry,  especially  such  literature  as  The \nTourist  Gaze  and Consuming  Places.  Urry  suggests  that  the  “Tourist  \nGaze”,  which  describes  the  development  of  a  sense-of-place  or  place-\nmyth, is central to the consumption of tourist services. He suggests several \nkey  elements  that  go  towards  constructing  this  “gaze”,  and  explains  the  \nneed for such a construction.\n1\n Urry argues that tourism can be defined as a \nleisure  activity  that  is  organised  and  regulated.  The  greater  movement  of  \npeople  to  other  destinations  outside  normal  places  of  residence  and  work  \nmeans  an  increase  in  numbers  choosing  to  engage  in  tourist  practices,  \ntherefore  increasing  new  socialised  forms  of  provision  in  order  to  cope  \nwith the mass character of the “tourist gaze.” Tourists thus anticipate that \ntheir   chosen   destination   will   provide   pleasures,   distinctiveness   and   \ndifference  from  their  place  of  residence.  This  anticipation  is  constructed  \nand sustained, suggests Urry, through “non-tourist” practices such as film, \nnewspapers,  TV  programmes,  magazines,  records  and  videos  and  is  \nenhanced by particular signs or familiar sights. Urry points out that: \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n J.

Urry,  Tourist \nGaze, (London, Sage, 1990), p. 11.  \n\nCheering On the Racers: The TT and Manx Identity \n \n107\nWhen  for  example  tourists  see  two  people  kissing  in  Paris  what  they  are  \ngazing upon is ‘timeless, romantic Paris’; when a small village in England \nis seen, tourists think they are gazing upon the ‘real (merrie) England.’\n2\n \n \nIt  will  be  suggested  that  during  the  inter-war  period  the  Isle  of  Man  \nbecame so intrinsically bound up with the TT races that people travelled to \nthe Isle of Man in anticipation of seeing this event or at least the home of \nthis  event;  in  a  similar  way  tourists  commonly  travelled  to  the  Lake  \nDistrict  in  expectation  of  visiting  Wordsworth’s  home  in  Grasmere.\n3\n It \nwas  the  growth  and  absorption  of  the  TT  as  a  part  of  the  Isle  of  Man’s  \nidentity   that   led   to   the   ingraining   of   the   TT   races   in   external   \nrepresentations of the island. It is this “place-myth” that will be examined. \nThe premise of this chapter is that there were in fact two rival place myths \non  the  island  during  the  inter-war  period.  One,  based  on  heritage,  nature  \nand history and the other based on speed, danger and modern technology. \nThis  chapter  will  also  re-introduce  the  idea  of  a  “consumed”  national  \nidentity. In relation to this work, this is the consumption of the TT races in \nthe  press,  in  race  reports,  in  film  and  in  other  literature  about  the  Isle  of  \nMan,   because   no   team,   certainly   not   one   from   the   Isle   of   Man,   \n“represented”  a  nation.  The  Isle  of  Man’s  status  lay  as  a  venue  for  the  \nevent. In that way the TT came to be consumed as a representation of the \nIsle of Man. \nFurther to this, this chapter will also address the idea that the TT races \nbecame   ingrained   in   “Manx   identity”   and   thereby   became   intensely   \nfamiliar  to  the  islanders.  It  is  clear  that,  internally,  the  present  day  TT  \nraces  form  part  of  the  island’s  “banal  nationalism”,  being  a  familiar  \nsymbol  of  Manx  identity  to  residents.  Most  specifically  my  analysis  is  \ninfluenced    by    Billig’s    conclusion    that    nationhood    is    flagged,    \nunobtrusively,   throughout   the   nation.   Symbols   act   as   reminders   of   \nnationality,   and   as   Billig   states,   “the   metonymic   image   of   banal   \nnationalism  is  not  a  flag  which  is  being  waved  with  fervent  passion;  it  is  \nthe flag hanging outside the public building.”\n4\n It is this constant reminding \nthat  not  only  allows  nationalist  movements  to  be  motivated  in  times  of  \nnational crisis but that also draws people together as part of a community. \nThe TT races, it is suggested, came to play such a role on the Isle of Man \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n2\n Urry, Consuming Places, p. 133. \n3\n  For  an  analysis  of  the  development  of  a  ‘sense-of-place’  generated  in  the  Lake  \nDistrict during the inter-war period see C. O’Neill, ‘Visions of Lakeland: Tourism, \nPreservation  and  the  Development  of  the  Lake  District  1919  –  1939,  unpublished  \nPh.D. thesis, University of Lancaster, 2000.  \n4\n Billig, Banal Nationalism, p. 8.  \n\nChapter Five \n108\nbetween  the  wars.  This  sense  of  community,  suggests  Billig,  is  also  \nachieved  by  the  “homeland  deixis”,  the  use  of  words  such  as  “we”,  “us”  \nand “our” in newspapers, speeches and other literature.\n5\n  \nBillig’s work is also used as a central interpretative device in an article \nby  Hill.\n6\n  “The  Cup  Final”,  suggests  Hill,  “though  a  more  elaborate  affair  \nthan  the  symbols  studied  by  Billig,  is  nonetheless  a  part  of  the  ‘banal’  \nconstruction  of  nationhood.  Its  familiarity  serves  to  mask  its  flagging  \nfunction.”\n7\n  I  have  similarly  sought  to  demonstrate  the  “banal”  aspects  of  \nthe TT in an article in the International Journal of Motorcycle Studies, in \nwhich  I  suggest  that  the  TT  races  have  become  so  familiar  to  the  Manx  \npeople,  because  the  presence  of  the  course,  the  grandstand  and  other  \nsymbols of the TT all year round perform similar flagging functions, that \nthey  are  prepared  to  waive  the  inconvenience  caused  by  the  event.  It  has  \nalso  become  part  of  who  they  believe  they  are  as  a  “nation.”  This  article  \nalso made an early attempt to employ the homeland deixis to reports of the \nTT races, in which the familiarity of the Manx with the TT and the belief \nthat  the  “nation”  welcomed  the  event  each  year  were  endorsed  by  the  \nlanguage used in such reports.\n8\n  \nExternal Constructions of Manx Identity \nDuring  the  inter-war  period  the  outside  definition  of  the  Isle  of  Man  \nwas  joined  by  the  island’s  growing  fame  as  the  home  of  the  TT  races.  \nRather  than  collide  these  two  representations  came  to  exist  harmoniously  \nalongside  each  other.  Indeed,  in  1925  it  was  suggested,  in  an  article  in  \nSunday at Home that on the Isle of Man “in striking juxtaposition you will \nfind  the  ancient  and  the  modern  ...  These  things  do  not  blend  and  clash.  \nThey  are  merely  there,  and  you  make  your  choice.”\n9\n This  diversity  might \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n5\n Billig, Banal Nationalism, p. 11. \n6\n J.

One example of such literature is Radcliffe’s 1925 book \nThe Isle of Man.\n11\n One of a series of “little guides”, which included guides \nto  each  English  county,  the  book  gave  a  good  survey  of  the  island  but  it  \nrepresented  the  Isle  of  Man  in  a  particular  way,  a  way  which  highlighted  \nthe more traditional aspects of island life. Hall Caine praised the guide in \nthe preface, stating that: \n \n...I think the first thing [the book] will reveal is that the Isle of Man is very \nbeautiful ... It is lovely, with a loveliness that is perhaps all its own, and it \nis  due  partly  to  its  littleness,  so  many  features  being  packed  into  a  small  \nspace\n.\n12\n \n \nRadcliffe   describes   in   detail   the   “situation,   extent   and   physical   \nfeatures” of the Isle of Man, examining its geographical situation, geology \nand its climate. He goes on to consider the island’s flora and fauna and its \nscenery,  all  of  interest  to  the  naturalist.  There  are  brief  summaries  of  the  \nisland’s  industries,  communications  with  the  mainland,  and  ways  of  \ntravelling around the island, looking most specifically at the island’s roads \nand   railways.   Further   to   this   there   are   descriptions   of   the   island’s   \nantiquities,   Celtic   crosses,   prehistoric   tools   and   pottery   and   ancient   \nchurches.  This  section  moves  on  to  a  concise  narrative  of  the  island’s  \nhistory  up  to  the  twentieth  century,  including  the  changing  control  of  the  \nisland,  from  Celts  to  Vikings  to  the  English.  It  discusses  such  island  \ncelebrities   as   Hall   Caine,   T.E.   Brown,   A.W.   Moore   and   the   artist   \nArchibald Knox. Radcliffe’s is a small book, but it contains a broad survey \nof the Isle of Man. There is, however, no mention of the TT or indeed of \nany sport on the Isle of Man.\n13\n \nLike Radcliffe’s book, other inter-war guidebooks also focused on the \nmany  attractions  of  the  Isle  of  Man  but  ignored  the  TT.  Such  literature  \nincludes Black’s  Guide  to  the  Isle  of  Man  and  Abel  Heywood  and  Sons  \nIllustrated Guide to the Isle of Man, both published outside of the island. \nThese too take on the structure of describing the island town by town and \nconstructing   a   sense   of   place   that   focuses   on   the   natural   or   the   \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n10\n See J.K.

There are few \nplaces in the British Isles which could rival the Isle of Man in displaying \nwithin a little space a great variety of scenes.”\n15\n The island, it was pointed \nout, contained: \n \nAll the elements of a complete national life: ports and harbours, rivers and \nglens,  hills  that  attain  at  times  almost  to  the  dignity  of  mountains,  towns  \nand  villages,  and  a  continuous  and  interesting  history  that  can  be  traced  \nback  for  centuries;  a  sturdy  native  stock  pursuing  native  industries.  It  has  \neven succeeded in breeding its own brand of cat! That cat is symptomatic. \nIt is nearly like other cats – but not quite.\n16\n \n \nThere  was  no  mention  of  motorcycle  races  in  this  description  of  the  \nisland. The main attractions of the island were said to be its scenery, with \nso much crammed into a small space, plus history or the quaint. There was \nalso the recognition that the Isle of Man was not quite like any other place. \nA  special  issue  of  The  Humorist  (1934)  almost  neglected  to  mention  the  \nTT,  with  the  author  stating,  “personally,  I  cannot  see  all  the  need  for  the  \nhurry of the TT. The Island possesses quite a good little electric railway to \nget about on.”\n17\n This suggested that there were many other reasons to visit \nthe Isle of Man. The tourist need not visit the island during the TT period.  \nThe Isle of Man could be therefore still represented in rather traditional \nways.  Moreover,  it  was  not  only  travel  literature  that  highlighted  the  \nisland’s natural scenery, history and heritage as reasons to visit the island. \nEven  the  motorcycle  press  recognised  the  diversity  on offer in the Isle of \nMan  in  articles  that  made  suggestions  for  places  to  visit  when  not  \nwatching  the  TT  races.  Such  articles  include  “The  Mysteries  of  Mona”  \nwhich  attempted  to  explain  the  development  of  some  Manx  customs,\n18\n \n“Manxland  for  potterers”  which  proposed  places  to  visit  on  the  island  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n14\n  See  for  example,  Black’s  Guide  to  the  Isle  of  Man,  1919;  Abel  Heywood  and  \nSons  Illustrated  Guide  to  the  Isle  of  Man,  (Manchester,  1919/1932);  Midland  and  \nScottish Railway Company, The Isle of Man: Pleasure Island, (1929). \n15\n  Midland  and  Scottish  Railway  Company,  The  Isle  of  Man:  Pleasure  Island,  \n(1929). \n16\n  Midland  and  Scottish  Railway  Company,  The  Isle  of  Man:  Pleasure  Island,  \n(1929). \n17\n The Humorist, 23 June 1934.  \n18\n Motor Cycling, 24 June 1931, pp. 248-249.  \n\nCheering On the Racers: The TT and Manx Identity \n \n111\nwhen  there  were  no  motorcycle  races  to  watch,\n19\n  and  “Curiosities  of  the  \nIsle of Man: Interesting Oddities about the Land of Road Racing.”\n20\n \nHowever, although we might say that one particular construction of the \nIsle  of  Man  was  being  presented  -  one  that  focused  on  more  traditional  \naspects - the TT helped create a rival place-myth for the Isle of Man. The \nTT  was  representative  of  the  Manx  identity  not  because  it  was  Celtic  or  \nNorse but because it was modern. It imposed itself on the island’s natural \nscenery  and  was  in  some  accounts  juxtaposed  with  the  island’s  historic  \nsites. In fact and as one would expect the motorcycle press, since the TT’s \ninception  in  1907,  had  always  regarded  the Isle of Man as principally the \nhome of the TT, and had always eagerly anticipated the event. According \nto the motorcycle press, the  Isle  of  Man  largely  if  not exclusively existed \nfor motorcycle racing. The island’s biggest attraction was the TT. In 1928, \nStaxton,   a   correspondent   for   Motor   Cycling,   described   his   island   \nimpressions,  focusing  strongly  on  the  importance  of  the  TT.  His  opinion  \nwas that:  \n \nTo  be  the  complete  motorist,  one  must  have  seen  at  least  one  Tourist  \nTrophy meeting. The races must be seen and the atmosphere of the Island \nsampled before one can claim to know all the joys that are attached to this \nwonderful sport of ours. \n \nThe  “Magic  Island”  has  about  it  during  T.T.  week  an  atmosphere  that  is  \nunique;  it  becomes  for  the  time  being  the  motorcyclist’s  paradise.  He  and  \nhis  machine  are  welcomed;  his  pet  sport  is  the  one  and  only  topic  of  the  \nhour – and what could the keen rider want more? \n \nCertainly  this  year’s  [TT]  saw  no  diminution  of  T.T.  fever.  Once  again  a  \nrecord  number  of  visitors  arrived  in  the  Island,  with  a  record  number  of  \nmotor-cycles  and  cars.  Once  again  these  visitors  formed  themselves  into  \nhuge  crowds  around  the  course;  once  again  these  crowds  displayed  an  \nenthusiasm that neither pen nor camera can, somehow, get quite fully into \nprint. \n \nEverybody, too, seemed to be having the time of their lives. Whether they \ncame  over  for  the  Senior  only,  by  one  of  the  Motor  Cycling  steamers,  or  \nwhether  they  did  the  thing  in  de  luxe  manner  by  booking  a  room  for  a  \nweek  or  two  in  the  “Fort  Anne.”  The  visitors  seemed  bent  on  enjoying  \nthemselves ... the good Manx folk were more than kind to them; the Manx \npolice were forbearing to a point that at times became almost alarming, and \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n19\n Motor Cycling, 13 June 1933, pp. 170-171. \n20\n Motor Cycling, 16 June 1937, p. 243.  \n\nChapter Five \n112\nonly  the  Manx  weather  at  times  failed  to  smile.  As  a  holiday  the  week  \ncould not be beaten.\n21\n \n \nBy suggesting that to be the complete motorist one must have seen the TT, \nStaxton  brought  together  the  motorcyclist,  motorcycle  racing  and  the  Isle  \nof Man. He did this further by referring to the Isle of Man as the “Magic \nIsle” and as the “motorcyclist’s paradise.” Staxton also creates an image of \nthe Isle of Man being populated, albeit for a certain part of the year, by a \nlarge number of motorcyclists.  \nAlthough Staxon’s description of the island focused heavily on the TT, \nit  was  not  as  extreme  a  description  as  offered  by  a  columnist  in  a  1935  \nedition  of  TT  Special  who  admitted  that,  as  a  school-boy,  he  had  “no  \ndesire  to  learn  anything  more  than  was  considered  necessary”,  but,  \namusingly,  he  did  “learn  something  which  was  not  included  in  the  \ncurriculum. [He] learned that the Island had at least one road that formed a \n37  ¼  mile  circuit.  The  highest  mountain  was  Snaefell;  the  principal  \nindustry was racing and its inhabitants were all motorcyclists. To a school-\nboy   that   sounded   like   utopia.”\n22\n   There   is   an   overemphasis   on   the   \nimportance  of  the  TT  in  this  description  since  the  Manx  were  obviously  \nnot all motorcyclists. However, many travelled to the Isle of Man in June \nbecause  the  island  was  the  home  of  the  TT,  albeit  only  for  two  or  three  \nweeks of the year. Indeed, A Guide to the Sporting Facilities on the Isle of \nMan,  published  in  Dundee  in  1932,  noted,  “The  greatest  sporting  event  \nnow  held  in  the  island  is,  of  course,  the  great  Tourist  Trophy  Races.”  It  \nwent  on  to  point  out  that  the  TT  attracted  “more  visitors  than  any  other  \nsingle event ... As the events are held in June, which is before the big rush \nof    visitors    for    the    July    and    August    holidays,    there    is    ample    \naccommodation  for  visitors.”\n23\n  The  1935  volume  of  this  publication  went  \nfurther to point out that “the T.T. races and the Grand Prix are sure to be \nheld  in  the  Isle  of  Man  for  several  years  to  come,  and  the  fact  that  the  \nLegislature  now  offers  a  sum  of  £5,000  for  the  purpose  of  inducing  and  \nassisting foreigners and colonials to compete has made the T.T. races more \ninternational than ever before.”\n24\n  \nHowever,  it  was  not  only  the  motorcycle  press  and  publications  that  \nspecifically  considered  the  development  of  sport  on  the  Isle  of  Man  that  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n21\n Motor Cycling, 20 June 1928. \n22\n TT Special, 12 June 1935. \n23\n Simmath Press Ltd., Sports  in  Manxland:  A  Guide  to  the  Sporting  Facilities  on  \nthe Isle of Man, (Dundee, Simmath Press, 1932), p. 7.  \n24\n Simmath Press Ltd., Sports  in  Manxland:  A  Guide  to  the  Sporting  Facilities  on  \nthe Isle of Man, (Dundee, Simmath Press, 1935), p. 7. \n\nCheering On the Racers: The TT and Manx Identity \n \n113\nrecognised the Isle of Man as the home of the TT. The British daily press \nalso  commented  on  the  races,  particularly  on  the  aspects  of  speed  and  \ndanger  that  brought  fame  or  infamy  to  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  also  in  \nrecognition of the event’s vast importance to the motorcycling community. \nIn 1928 the Daily Express, noting the popularity of the event, reported that \n“tens  of  thousands  travel  to  the  Isle  of  Man  each  year  to  see  the  blue  \nriband  of  motor  cycling,  the  Tourist  Trophy  Races.”\n25\n  An  article  in  the  \nBolton Evening News highlighted both the prestigious nature of the TT and \nthe potential dangers and thrills when it suggested that in the TT “man is \npitted  against  man,  and  the  qualities  that  count  are  courage,  steadiness  of  \nnerve,  coolness  of  head.”\n26\n  The  dangers  of  the  course  could  be  overcome  \nby  steadiness  of  nerve,  and  those  who  won  the  races  were  lavished  with  \nthe spoils of victory. \nNot  all  comments  in  the  British  press  were  comfortable  with  the  \npurpose   of   the   TT.   A   letter   to   the   Manchester   Guardian   in   1931   \nquestioned whether the event should continue. It read: \n \nWhen  one  reads  of  a  rider  killed  and  five  others  more  or  less  seriously  \ninjured in one day’s motor-cycle racing in the Isle of Man one cannot help \nasking whether the game is really worth the candle ... There are two things \nto  be  said  for  such  contests  as  the  Tourist  Trophy  races.  The  first  is  that  \nthey  provide  the  most  exacting  test  possible  for  engines  and  appliances.  \nThe  second  –  and  perhaps  this  is  to  do  more  with  their  popularity  –  they  \nare extremely spectacular ... They draw so many people to watch them that \nthe Manx Government finds it worth while to turn the whole island upside \ndown for them every year.\n27\n \n \nThe  letter  might  have  started  off  by  questioning  the  value  of  the  TT  \nraces, but it moved on to highlight the efforts made by the Manx to make \nit possible for the races to take place on the island. For one enthusiast, and \nindeed  for  those  who  read  the  Manchester  Guardian,  the  impression  was  \nthat  the  Manx  authorities  were  prepared  to  do  whatever  they  could  to  \nmake  the  continuation  of  the  TT  possible,  despite  the  danger  associated  \nwith  the  TT.  This  was  an  early  example  of  criticism  being  aimed  at  the  \nraces. It also shows, however, that the belief existed outside the island that \nthe Manx wanted to see the TT continue. \nDuring  the  inter-war  period  the  TT  certainly  helped  to  define  the  \nposition  of  the  Isle  of  Man  and  likewise  the  purpose  of  the  island’s  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n25\n Daily Express, 25 June 1927. \n26\n Bolton Evening News, 4 June 1928. \n27\n Manchester Guardian, 20 June 1931. \n\nChapter Five \n114\ninhabitants; the Isle of Man was for TT racing, the island’s residents were \noccupied in catering for visitors. Yet the Isle of Man was still viewed as a \nplace  that  maintained  its  history,  heritage  and  natural  scenery.  There  was  \nmuch to do on the Isle of Man besides participate in motorcycle races.  \nIn  the  mid-1930s  these  rival  place  myths  were  firmly  set  down  in  \ncelluloid.  In  1935,  the  Isle  of  Man  Board  of  Advertising  allowed  the  \nfilming of Monty Banks’ film No Limit, starring George Formby and with \na story set at the TT races.\n28\n This film had originally been planned to show \nFormby  visiting  the  island’s  many  attractions.\n29\n No  Limit  follows  the  \nsuccess   of   George   Shuttleworth   riding   his   homemade   “Shuttleworth   \nSnap.”  It  follows  his  transformation  from  the  “lone  hand”,  whose  mother  \nstole from his grandfather the money to pay for the trip, to him becoming \nan   official   rider   for   Rainbow   motorcycles   (a   fictional   motorcycle   \nmanufacturer).  The  film  played  a  crucial  role  in  helping  to  reinforce  an  \nexternal perception of the Isle of Man. In the film we see shots of the Isle \nof  Man  TT  races,  of  the  rivalry  between  the  professional  and  amateur  \nmotorcycle  riders,  of  Douglas  beach  crowded  with  tourists,  and  of  the  \nisland’s range of other attractions.  \nThe  fact  that  this  film  was  made  at  all,  and  also  that  it  was  Formby’s  \nmost popular film, demonstrates the popularity of the TT externally.\n30\n It is \nparticularly  noticeable  that  throughout  the  film  the  Isle  of  Man  was  \nreferred  to  without  any  explanation  of  where  the  island  was  or  why  a  \nmotorcycle  race  was  being  held  there.  It  was  assumed  that  an  external  \naudience would be familiar with both. It is fair to assume that the island’s \ngrowing dependence on mass tourism – with visitors being drawn mostly \nfrom  the  northern  working  class  –  meant  that  the  majority  of  viewers  \nwould be familiar with the Isle of Man and the TT races before seeing the \nfilm. In this sense there is an implied familiarity between the audience and \nthe Isle of Man and between the audience and the TT races; the audience \nknows the location of the Isle of Man and they knew TT races took place \nthere  annually.  Viewers  might  have  holidayed  in  the  island  and  may  or  \nmay  not  have  seen  the  TT  races.  This  film  also  reflected  the  style  of  \nnewsreels  at  the  time,  demonstrating  the  popularity  of  the  races  in  scenes  \nshowing the bustling grandstands, crowds of spectators around the course, \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n28\n No Limit, (1935). \n29\n Board of Advertising Minutes, 13 March 1935. \n30\n Further discussion of No Limit and indeed Formby’s other films can be found in, \nfor  example,  D.  Bret,  George  Formby:  A  Troubled  Genius,  (London,  Robson  \nBooks,  2001);  J.  Richards,  The  Age  of  the  Dream  Palace:  Cinema  and  Society  in  \nBritain 1930 – 1939, (London, Routledge, 1984). \n\nCheering On the Racers: The TT and Manx Identity \n \n115\nand indeed advertising around the route.\n31\n The sense of familiarity with the \nIsle  of  Man  and  the  TT  races  portrayed  by  this  film  forms  part  of  an  \nexternal construction of the Isle of Man as the home of the TT races. There \nwas no need for any explanation of why a keen motorcyclist from Wigan \nwould want to enter a motorcycle race held on the Isle of Man.  \nReviews of No Limit were also favourable, further representing the Isle \nof  Man  as  the  home  of  the  TT  races.  Picturegoer  Weekly  described  the  \nfilm   as   a   “breezy,   happy-go-lucky   farce,   which   culminates   in   an   \nexhilarating   piece   of   slapstick   spectacle”,   but   most   importantly   “it   \nincludes  cut-in  shots  of  the  Isle  of  Man  T.T.  races.”\n32\n The Pontefract \nAdvertiser in a review of No Limit suggested that: \n \nWhitsuntide,   the   Isle   of   Man   and   the   TT   races   make   a   delectable   \ncombination  for  the  holiday  period,  and  for  those  who  like  the  idea,  but  \nfind  it  impracticable,  there  is  solace  at  the  Alexandra  Cinema,  Pontefract.  \nNo  Limit  which  is  booked  for  presentation  throughout  the  week  abounds  \nwith  fast  moving  and  powerful  scenes,  many  of  which  show  actual  \nsequences from the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy races.\n33\n \n \nNo Limit further cemented the representation of the Isle of Man as the \nhome of the TT races, and the presentation of the film to a large audience \nincreased  the  perpetuation  of  this  particular  aspect  of  the  island’s  place  \nmyth.  The  races  were  eagerly  anticipated  by  the  motorcycle  community  \nand the success of No Limit suggests that the TT races were familiar to and \npopular with a wider audience. By the end of the inter-war period, the TT \nraces had therefore become a secure part of the external representation of \nthe Isle of Man. The next section will go on to ask how far the TT became \npart  of  the  way  the  Manx  represented  themselves  during  the  inter-war  \nyears. \n \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n31\n  Examples  of  these  newsreels  can  be  found  online  at  www.britishpathe.com  and  \nwww.movietone.com.

It  lies  anchored  out  in  the  middle  of  the  Irish  Sea  and  as  you  \napproach  it  from  the  mainland  it  looks  like  a  bird  sitting  on  her  nest.  The  \nmajority  of  its  human  habitations  are  such  as  are  to  be  found  in  other  \nseaside  resorts  for  summer  visitors,  with  a  few  ivy  covered  and  turreted  \nmansions  of  moderate  size  and  a  number  of  thatched  and  whitewashed  \ncottages  which  stand  with  their  sides  and  back  to  the  highroads  and  are  \nusually screened by the thick foliage of the tammon [sic] tree, or the scarlet \ndroppings of the fuchsia. \n \nBut  it  bears  to  the  closer  observer  a  hint  of  ancient  history,  of  legend,  of  \npoetry,  and  of  the  struggles  of  [races],  in  the  ruins  of  old  churches,  the  \nremains of at least one abbey and of a large Elizabethan castle, a number of \nrunic  crosses,  and  (above  all  historical  interest)  a  circular  turf  mound  \nwhich is probably the only visible relic in the world of the ancient Althing, \nthe open air parliament of the Norse Republic\n.\n35\n \n \nIn  1904,  motor  car  racing  had  been  imposed  on  this  idyllic  scene  but,  \nas  discussed  earlier,  even  by  1914  motor  racing  had  not  yet  begun  to  be  \ningrained   within   a   Manx   sense-of-self,   something   which   is   well   \ndemonstrated in Caine’s description of the island.

He  did,  however,  spend  time  on  the  island  in  his  \nyouth and wrote a number of books on the society and culture of the island. These \nincluded novels such as The Deemster, 1887, The Manxman, 1894 and The Master \nof Man, 1921. His last book, The Woman of Knockaloe: A Parable, was published \nin 1923. Caine was also the author of Little Man Island (1894), a handbook for the \nIsle of Man Steam Packet Company and also gave three lectures titled ‘Little Manx \nNation’  at  the  Royal  Institution  in  1891.

This  period  also  saw  further  attempts  to  raise  the  profile  of  the  \nManx language and other aspects of the Manx culture  \nThe premise here is further to suggest that the old and the new existed \npeacefully  alongside  each  other  in  the  Isle  of  Man.  However,  in  1921  \nDorothy Eyre, in an article in Manx Quarterly, launched an attack against \nwhat she perceived as the ugliness of mass tourism on the Isle of Man. She \nasked: \n \nHow  ugly  are  all  imported  things  in  the  midst  of  the  natural  loveliness  of  \nthis  country  [sic].  Everywhere  the  visitor  brings  devastation  with  him.  \nThis, in a way, means a good amount of well-being to the Islander, and in \nconsequence  may  be  partly  over-looked.  But  the  visitor  seldom  brings  \nanything worthy of imitation, and rarely anything that Manxland would do \nwell to permanently maintain.\n36\n \n \nEyre clearly showed displeasure with the island’s growing dependence \non  the  attraction  of  tourists.  The  article  went  on  to  state  further  that  the  \n“invader arrives, and from that moment begins his habitual all-conquering \noffensiveness  with  a  widespread  distribution  of  largesse.”  It  was  pointed  \nout “for him [the visitor] they [the Manx] build hotels and hydros, and lose \ntheir  identity  ...  for  him  they  build  music-halls  and  picture-dromes,  and  \nlose  their  intelligence.”\n37\n  The  article  concluded:  “the  screaming  hectic  \nhurly  burly  is  the  price  the  Manxman  pays  for  the  desecration  of  his  \nland.”\n38\n These comments are filled with condemnation for the continuation \nof mass tourism on the Isle of Man. In Eyre’s opinion, then, the promotion \nof  mass  tourism  equalled  assimilation  with  England.  In  1908  a  “dweller  \nbeside  the  motor  course”  had  called  on  the  Manx  to  celebrate  their  \nseparateness  by  holding  motor  races,\n \nbut  Eyre  called  on  the  Manx  to  \ncelebrate  their  own  history,  language  and  the  natural  attractions  that  the  \nisland  had  to  offer.  These  two  contrasting  opinions  both  asserted  the  \nisland’s distinctiveness, but for very different reasons.  \nCaine celebrated the “traditional” characteristics of the island and Eyre \ncondemned the island’s reliance on mass tourism. Further constructions of \ntraditional   Manxness   can   be   seen   in   the   continuation   of   the   Manx   \nrenaissance. One aspect of this was the attempted resurrection of the Manx \nlanguage,  which  had  received  attention  in  the  years  before  World  War  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n36\n D.

For  the  Manx,  or  more  clearly  for  the  small  section  involved  in  the  \nManx  renaissance,  the  continued  pursuit  of  a  Manx  language  revival  \nmeant setting the island apart from England and denying the anglicisation \nof  the  island  which  was  the  result  of  mass  tourism.\n39\n  However,  in  1932  \nW.W. Gill, author of three volumes of A Manx Scrapbook, was compelled \nto  admit  that  “Manx  is  not  even  losing  ground,  languishing,  or  on  the  \nverge of extinction. As a means of communication it is dead, and has been \ndead  for  a  generation.”\n40\n  By  asserting  that  the  Manx  language  was  dead,  \nGill  removed  one  defining  characteristic  of  the  island’s  Celtic  identity.  \nAfter  taking  Gill’s  comments  into  consideration,  we  might  be  led  to  \nbelieve that Manx was unimportant as a means of communication and that \nattempts   at   its   revival   had   been   unsuccessful.   However,   Broderick   \nsuggests  that  the  Manx  language  underwent  a  second  phase  in  its  revival  \nduring the 1930s.\n41\n Broderick associates this second phase with J. J. Kneen \nand  Mona  Douglas.  Kneen  compiled  a  six-volume  work  on  Manx  place  \nnames, a Manx grammar and a work on Manx personal names.\n 42\n Kneen’s \nGrammar  of  the  Manx  Language  had  been  completed  in  1910,  but  it  was  \nnot published until the late 1920s when the Trustees of the Manx Museum \nrecognised  its  importance.\n43\n  Mona  Douglas,  who  it  must  be  pointed  out  \nwas  not  born  on  the  Isle  of  Man,  was  active  in  collecting  folklore  and  \nfolksongs  from  the  last  surviving  bearers  of  this  tradition  on  the  island.\n44\n \nShe founded the Manx youth movement Aeglagh Vannin in 1932 and was \nalso active in Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh (YCG), the Manx Gaelic Society, \nand   the   Celtic   Congress   up   until   World   War   Two.

Only \na  very  small  proportion  of  the  island’s  population  spoke  only  Manx  or  \nManx  and  English  in  1921  and  1931,  and  thus  the  island’s  dominant  \nlanguage  was  English.  In  1921  of  a  total  population  (aged  over  three  \nyears)  of  57,849  there  were  only  nineteen  speakers  of  Manx  alone,  896  \nspeakers  of  Manx  and  English  but  56,943  English  only  speakers.\n45\n By \n1931  of  a  population  (aged  over  three  years)  of  47,408  there  were  no  \nManx only speakers, only 529 speakers of English and Manx, and 46,879 \nEnglish only speakers.\n46\n Even with the disproportionately high population \nfigure recorded in 1921, as a result of the census being taken in June that \nyear  when  tourists  were  present  and  therefore  an  increased  number  of  \nsolely  English  speakers  on  the  island  we  can  see  that  the  Manx  language  \nwas indeed dying as a means of communication. Indeed, it could no longer \nbe used to construct Manx identity.  \nThe  attempts  to  increase  awareness  of  the  Manx  language  might  have  \nbeen    unsuccessful,    but    the    inter-war    period    did    see    important    \ndevelopments in the promotion of the island’s heritage. In 1922 the Manx \nMuseum  was  given  permanent  premises,  36  years  after  the  Museum  and  \nAncient  Monuments  Act  (1886)  had  provided  for  the  establishment  of  an  \ninsular   museum   and   better   protection   of   ancient   monuments.   The   \nmuseum’s  curators  during  the  inter-war  years,  Philip  Moore  Callow  \nKermode  (1922  -  1932)  and  William  Cubbon  (1932  -  1940),  sought  to  \npreserve aspects of the island’s Celtic history. Kermode’s focus concerned \narchaeological  work,  such  as  the  preservation  of  Manx  crosses  and  \nexcavations  at  Maughold  (1926)  and  Knock-e-Doonee  (1927).  Cubbon  \nwas responsible for compiling the two volumes of the Bibliography of the \nLiterature of the Isle of Man (1933 and 1939).\n47\n He also edited the Journal \nof  the  Manx  Museum  (1924  –  1939)  and  was  responsible  for  the  opening  \nof  Harry  Kelly’s  cottage  at  Cregneash,  the  Manx  National  Folk  Museum.  \nThese were efforts to sustain the more traditional parts of a Manx identity.  \nConstructions  of  a  traditional  Manx  identity  were  also  embodied  in  \npromotional  literature  produced  by  the  Board  of  Advertising  in  their  Isle  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n45\n Census 1921: Isle of Man, (London, H.M.S.O, 1924). \n46\n Census 1931: Isle of Man, (London, H.M.S.O, 1934). \n47\n W.

The  Board  printed  these  for  \nexternal  consumption  and  they  were  structured  to  promote  the  island  and  \nindicate  the  attractions  on  offer  to  the  tourist  in  the  different  areas  of  the  \nIsle of Man. The guidebooks were given names such as “Pleasure Island” \n(1925)  and  “Playground  of  the  British  Isles”  (1926).\n48\n The  prevailing \nimage created by these guidebooks was that the Isle of Man was a holiday \nresort  and  there  was  much  for  visitors  to  do.  These  mostly  excluded  \nwatching  the  TT  races.  One  indication  of  this  can  be  seen  in  the  type  of  \nnewspaper  comment  chosen  in  these  books  to  be  representative  of  the  \nisland.  These  were  examples  of  external  opinion  selected  for  use  by  the  \nManx  Board  of  Advertising  in  internally  produced  promotional  literature.  \nThe  examples  chosen  are  indicative.  In  1926,  the  Leicester  Advertiser  \nsuggested  that  “‘Just  one  big  playground”  was  as  apt  a  description  of  the  \nIsle  of  Man  as  one  can  give,  and  there  is  probably  no  place  in  the  British  \nIslands  where  the  traveller  is  more  deeply  and  effectively  catered  for.”\n49\n \nThis was a point of view that was reflected in the Aberdeen Press, which \npointed out that “‘Pleasure Island’ is certainly no misnomer. How to cater \nfor  visitors  is  the  Isle  of  Man’s  chief  end  ...  The  Island  is  full  of  beauty  \nspots,  the  roads  are  ideal,  and  everywhere  the  holiday  maker  is  the  first  \nconsideration.”\n50\n  Nevertheless,  in  this  instance  the  TT  races  were  then  \nmentioned  as  another  attraction.  A  paragraph  to  this  effect  was  contained  \nin the 1936 official guide. It stated: \n \nThe prevailing impression among those who have never been to the Island \nseems  to  be  that  T.T.  racers  dash  madly  through  dense  crowds  of  people,  \nand that any spare ground unoccupied by the holiday makers is taken up by \ntailless cats. The exquisite and varied beauty of the Island scenery; its age \nold  traditions;  its  gracious  hospitality;  and  above  all  the  possibility  of  \nfinding  miles  of  cliff  and  mountain  paths,  are  seldom  realised,  and  \nalthough  secure  in  the  affections  of  its  visitors,  Manxland  finds  difficulty  \nin  combating  the  too  general  opinion  that  it  is  over  run  with  visitors  and  \ncompletely given over to noisy pastimes.\n51\n \n \nIndeed,  despite  the  presence  and  promotion  of  the  more  traditional  \nfeatures of the Isle of Man, by the late 1920s there were clear indications \nthat   the   TT   races   had   become   embedded   within   Manx   identity   as   \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n48\n Isle  of  Man  Handbook:  Isle  of  Man:  Pleasure  Island,  (Douglas,  1925);  Isle  of  \nMan Handbook: Isle of Man: Playground of the British Isles, (Douglas, 1926).  \n49\n Isle of Man Handbook: ‘Isle of Man: Playground of the British Isles’, (Douglas, \n1926). \n50\n ‘Isle of Man: Playground of the British Isles’.  \n51\n Isle of Man Official Guide 1936, (Douglas, 1936).  \n\nCheering On the Racers: The TT and Manx Identity \n \n121\nexternally   marketed.   The   government-funded   Board   of   Advertising   \npromoted  the  TT  as  one  of  the  many  attractions  the  island  had  to  offer,  \nalongside  music  festivals  and  highland  games  and  indeed  the  Tynwald  \nceremony held each year on 5 July. \nSimilarly, there is evidence in the Manx press that the TT had become \nintegrated into the island’s sense-of-place. In 1928 the Isle of Man Weekly \nTimes  commented  on  the  passing  of  legislation  to  permit  further  road  \nclosures.  There  was  no  negative  reaction  to  the  inconvenience  of  closing  \nroads  to  allow  TT  racers  to  practice.  In  an  article  titled  simply  “roads  \nclosed  for  practising  at  last  [emphasis  added]”,  the  Isle  of  Man  Weekly  \nTimes  offered  their  support  for  the  TT,  noting  that  “the  T.T.  Races  exist  \nfor the purpose of improving the breed [the motorcycle]” and further that \n“this  year  practising  takes  place  under  what  can  be  described  as  ideal  \nconditions.”\n52\n  These  might  have  been  ideal  conditions  for  the  racers,  but  \nthey were not ideal for residents in towns and villages around the course. \nNevertheless,  there  was  unquestioned  support  offered  for  the  TT.  Further  \nto  this,  the  1928  Act  was  passed  by  a  legislature  “who  to-day  realise  as  \nmuch  as  we  all  do  the  value  of  motor-cycle  racing  to  this  Island.”\n53\n That \nthere  was  no  negative  reaction  to  the  passing  of  supportive  legislation  by  \nTynwald  suggests  that  the  TT  had  been  accepted  as  a  Manx  event,  which  \nshould  continue  to  take  place  on  the  island  and  that  was  beneficial  to  the  \nManx.  This  was  a  point  in  time  where  protests  could  have  been  made  \nagainst the continuation of the TT, yet it seems that because the event had \nbecome so far embedded in the Manx sense of what the island offered that \nthis would not happen.  \nThere was also a further representation of the TT as part of the island’s \nself-image in 1929. This was exemplified by the Speaker of the House of \nKeys when proposing the annual grant for the ACU. He was anxious that \nthe TT races should continue on the Isle of Man, having been “assured that \nthese races have been the cause of vast mechanical developments, not only \nin  connection  with  motors  and  vehicles  on  the  road,  but  indirectly  the  \naeroplane  industry  and  some  experimental  machines.”\n54\n The  Speaker  was \nclearly   proud   that   the   Isle   of   Man   had   become   associated   with   \nimprovements in technology. He went on to note: \n \nWe  are  anxious  that  these  races  should  continue,  and  we  are  all  very  \ndesirous  that  the  Island  should  be  the  arena  of  contests  of  this  kind.

The  Speaker  was  prepared  to  overlook  any  \npractical  disadvantages  that  there  might  be  in  holding  motor  races  on  the  \nIsle  of  Man  providing  that,  with  the  unrivalled  facilities  the  island  could  \nprovide, there were economic advantages to be had and above all that the \ncontinuation of motor racing on the island led to a positive representation \nof the Isle of Man as a place of distinction.  \nMoreover,  there  was  also  a  growing  claim  that  the  TT  placed  the  Isle  \nof  Man  towards  the  “centre  of  the  world.”  In  1921  Eyre  had  called  for  \nrecognition that: \n \nWithin  recent  years  this  English  conquest  of  the  Isle  of  Man  has  become  \nmore and more apparent. The Manx are gradually forsaking their priceless \nheritage – they have mostly forgotten or never known the language of their \nancestors,  and  it  has  become  the  fashion,  unfortunately,  to  do  things  as  \nthey are done in England.\n56\n \n \nThis  was  a  call  for  the  Manx  to  assert  their  independence,  to  use  \nlanguage and heritage to reject Englishness, and this should have included \nthe  intruding  presence  of  the  TT.  Yet,  by  the  late  1920s  the  TT  was  \nbecoming  a  global  event.  The  Manx  were  no  longer  doing  “things”  to  \nplease  the  English.  By  now  they  were  seeking  to  attract  TT  competitors  \nfrom  Europe  and  still  further  afield  to  give  the  event  an  increasingly  \ninternational feeling. In 1928 it was pointed out in Tynwald that: \n \nWe  have  machines  here  from  all  parts  of  the  world;  Italian,  Spanish  and  \nFrench  journalists  here;  German  machines  and  German  journalists.  As  far  \nas advertising is concerned, the Isle of Man is in a wonderful position not \nonly throughout the British Islands, but throughout the world, and it would \nbe a pity if anything was done to prevent the cyclists from coming here.\n57\n \n \nThe  attendance  of  motorcyclists  from  across  the  world  meant  greater  \npublicity  for  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  enhanced  substantially  the  status  of  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n55\n Debates, Vol. 45, 4 October 1929, p. 1203. \n56\n D.

A  1928  article  in  the  Isle  of  \nMan  Weekly  Times  suggested  that  there  was  no  doubt  that  the  “island”  \nappreciated the continuation of the TT and that: \n \nWe are  very  proud  indeed  of  our  course.  We know  it  is  the  finest  testing  \nground  in  the  world.  Riders  who  have  ridden  all  over  the  Continent  \nconfirm this statement. \n \nIn  saying  good-bye,  as  we do  today,  to  our  motoring  friends,  may  we \nexpress  the  wish  that  they  will  be  with  us  again  next  year,  and  that  the  \nlesson  learned  this  year  will  enable  the  British  motor-cycle  industry  to  \nmake  further  progress,  upholding  as  it  does,  the  supremacy  of  the  British  \nmotor-cycle over all others [Emphases added].\n58\n  \n \nWe  can  clearly  see  the  Manx  press  making  an  association  between  the  \nManx  people  and  the  TT  races.  This  was  clearly  an  association  between  \nthe  TT  and  what  it  meant  to  be  Manx,  an  ingredient  in  a  sense  of  Manx  \nidentity.  \nThe growing support of the Manx press for the TT, the recognition that \nthe races were a defining part of the island’s character and the suggestion \nthat they placed the Isle of Man towards the centre of the world can again \nbe seen in the Isle of Man Weekly Times’s support of Tynwald’s financial \ngrant  to  the  ACU  in  1930.  Instead  of  a  negative  reaction  to  this  use  of  \ntaxpayers’ money towards funding the event, it was stated that: \n  \nFor 23 years now the races have been run here, and now this little Island of \nours  has  become  the  hub  of  the  road  racing  universe  so  far  as  motor-\ncycling   is   concerned.   During   that   time   the   Manx   public   have   been   \ngradually  educated  to  a  realisation  of  the  important  part  which  the  races  \nplay  in  the  life  of  the  Island.  They  are  an  undoubted  attraction  to  visitors,  \nand this is fully realised here – so much so that the Manx Government last \nyear  voted  £5,000  to  the  A.C.U  in  order  that  the  prize  money  might  be  \nincreased  and  to  provide  a  fund  for  assisting  overseas  competitors  with  \ntheir expenses.\n59\n \n \nThere  is  not  even  the  smallest  hint  of  criticism  in  this  statement.  The  \njournalist considered the growing status of the TT internationally as reason \nto believe that the Manx people, as a whole, supported the continuation of \nthe event and that the TT races therefore belonged to the island and were a \nmatter of pride.     \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n58\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 9 June 1928. \n59\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 14 June 1930.  \n\nChapter Five \n124\nOf  course,  we  cannot  assume  that  simply  because  the  press  supported  \nthe TT and believed it represented the feelings of Manx residents that the \nman  and  woman  on  the  street  was  keen  to  see  the  races  return  year  after  \nyear.  However,  there  was  no  organised  protest  against  the  TT  during  the  \ninter-war  years.  An  article  in  the  Isle  of  Man  Examiner  in  1937  did  \nacknowledge there was a small minority “who frown upon [the races] and \nresent   that   nocturnal,   unearthly   dim   made   by   the   machines   during   \npractising”,  but  the  author  also  reported  that  there  was  an  overwhelming  \ndesire  to  see  the  TT  continue  on  the  Isle  of  Man.\n60\n This  article,  titled \n“What we have let us hold” suggested that the TT race had indeed become \npart  of  the  Manx  way  of  life.  The  author  did  “not  propose  to  waste  any  \ntime  by  reflecting  on  whether  we  want  the  T.T.  races  to  continue  or  not”  \n[emphasis  added].  He  was  certain  that  “any  plebiscite  would  give  an  \noverwhelming  vote  in  their  favour,  and  so  we will  accept  that  to  be  the  \ngeneral  wish...[T]o  most  people  the  T.T.  races  are  a  boon  and  a  blessing  \nto the Island.”\n61\n While this was the view of one journalist, his suggestions \nthat no time should be wasted on asking whether “we” want the races and \nthat “we” will accept a general vote in their favour are much more than the \njournalist  interacting  with  his  readers.  It  is  an  attempt  to  assert  what  had  \nbecome important to the Manx people and what it meant to be Manx.  \nConclusion to Part Two \nA quotation taken from the Manchester Evening News and contained in \nthe  1925  Isle  of  Man  handbook  makes  the  following  suggestion:  “The  \nManx  Arms  are  legs,  three  in  number,  surrounded  by  a  motto  which  \nmeans,  ‘Whichever  way  you  throw  me  I  shall  stand’.  Some  people  take  \nthis  to  mean  that  the  Manx  will  stand  anything.  This  is  wrong.”\n62\n This \nrather flippant assessment of the feelings of the Manx population would be \nan  inaccurate  view  of  their  response  to  the  TT,  as  something  that  would  \nnot  merely  be  tolerated.  From  the  conclusions  drawn  earlier  we  might  \nhave  expected  to  see  the  development  of  a  conflict  between  rural  and  \nurban  interests  that  was  occasionally  voiced  in  the  Manx  legislature.  We  \nmight  have  expected  to  see  the  old  and  the  new  clash.  However,  this  did  \nnot happen. Instead the TT races became incorporated as another element \nin   Manx   identity.   They   sat   harmoniously   alongside   the   traditional   \nconstructions of the Manx place-myth. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n60\n Isle of Man Examiner, 25 June 1937. \n61\n Isle of Man Examiner, 25 June 1937. \n62\n ‘Isle of Man Handbook: Isle of Man: Pleasure Island’, (Douglas, 1925).  \n\nCheering On the Racers: The TT and Manx Identity \n \n125\nDuring  the  inter-war  years  the  TT  became  ingrained  in  both  external  \nand  internal  representations  of  the  Isle  of  Man.  This  was  in  conjunction  \nwith the growing support for the TT in the Manx legislature. This support \nwas realised because it was believed that the event could help publicise the \nisland. By using the TT in their publicity the Manx government went some \nway  to  creating  a  place  myth  to  rival  the  traditional  Celtic  and  Norse  \nrepresentations  of  the  island;  a  construction  that  was  more  Celtic  Tiger  \nthan  Celtic  twilight.  The  continuing  support  of  motorcycle  manufacturers  \nfor  the  event  also  aided  the  growing  external  representation  of  the  Isle  of  \nMan as the home of the TT races. Their attendance at the TT sustained the \nevent,  which  led  to  extra  column  inches  in  the  press  and,  further,  visual  \nrepresentations of the Isle of Man as the home of the TT as in the film No \nLimit and in newsreels shown to the British public. \nWhat  is  significant  though  is  that  the  TT  was  only  one  way  in  which  \nthe  Manx  and  those  outside  the  island  constructed  their  identity.  Whilst  \nthere was some reaction against the growth of mass tourism in the Isle of \nMan  (see  Eyre  and  the  continuation  of  the  Manx  cultural  renaissance),  \nthere  was  no  apparent  organised  protest  against  the  TT.  The  TT  races,  a  \nmore   modern   ingredient   in   Manx   identity,   did   not   clash   with   the   \ntraditional Celtic (language) and Norse (Tynwald) symbols of identity. In \nrepresentations of the Manx, both on the Isle of Man and in Britain the old \nand the new sat alongside each other and were not antagonistic. \n\n\n\n\u0003\nPART III \nT\nHE TT SINCE 1945 \n \n \n \nThere  can  be  no  doubt  that  for  twenty  years  past,  and  longer,  the  Isle  of  \nMan has been associated with motor-cycle races. When I say this, I want to \nbring  to  members  minds  this  points  that  we  have  been  to  a  large  extent  \nresponsible  for  the  development  of  the  internal  combustion  engine  with  \nwhich the country has won two world wars. \n—Manx Debates, April 1947 \n \nManxmen  have  T.T.  racing  in  their  blood  and  many  of  us  look  forward  \neagerly  to  these  annual  meetings  with  old  acquaintances  who  come  here  \nyear  after  year,  some  on  business  some  just  because  way  back  along  the  \nyears they were bitten by the T.T. bug and have simply got to come to the \nIsland at this time. \n—Isle of Man Weekly Times, June 1948 \n\n\u0003\nCHAPTER SIX \nN\nO SLOWING DOWN: \nD\nOMESTIC SUPPORT CONFIRMED \n \n \n \nWorld War Two, in Europe at least, had only been over for one month in \nJune 1945 and the Isle of Man would still have had a number of internees \nin  boarding  houses  in  Douglas  and  the  barbed  wire  fences  on  Douglas  \npromenade  would  not  yet  have  been  taken  down.  There  would  still  have  \nbeen  service  personnel  on  the  island.  There  were  not  only  difficulties  for  \nthe Manx in restarting the TT, but also for motorcycle manufacturers who \nwould  not  have  time  to  switch  from  war  time  production  and  to  prepare  \ntheir motorcycles for the TT races, despite the industry being in relatively \ngood  shape  after  the  end  of  the  war.\n1\n  In  the  period  immediately  after  the  \nend  of  World  War  Two  domestic  support  for  the  TT,  which  had  been  \nstrengthened during the inter-war period, was confirmed.  \nStructure and Practice of Government  \nFurther changes were made to the structure and practice of the island’s \ngovernment  in  the  period  immediately  after  World  War  Two.  First,  the  \nboards of Tynwald were renamed and reconstituted. The Highways Board \nbecame the Highway and Transport Board (1951) and the Publicity Board \nbecame  the  Tourist  Board  (1952).\n2\n  Second,  the  process  of  selection  to  \nTynwald Boards changed as a result of the establishment of the Executive \nCouncil.  The  Executive  Council  was  to  be  composed  of  chairmen  of  the  \nmajor  spending  boards,  and  Tynwald  therefore  agreed  that  the  existing  \nprocess,  by  which  board  members  selected  their  chairman,  should  be  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n  See  S.  Koerner,  ‘The  British  Motor  Cycle  Industry  1935  -  1975’,  unpublished  \nPh.D. thesis, University of Warwick, 1995.  \n2\n Boards were renamed under the following Acts of Tynwald in 1946: The Isle of  \nMan  Board  of  Agriculture  and  Fisheries  Act,  the  Isle  of  Man  Board  of  Education  \nAct,  the  Isle  of  Man  Highway  and  Transport  Board  Act,  the  Isle  of  Man  Local  \nGovernment Board Act and the Isle of Man Board of Social Services Act: Statutes, \nVol. 16 1942 -1947, pp. 318-336. \n\nNo Slowing Down: Domestic Support Confirmed \n129\nreplaced  by  the  chairman’s  election  by  Tynwald.  Third,  MHKs  took  on  a  \ngreater role in providing chairmen of Tynwald boards. Despite the balance \nbeing in favour of the Legislative Council during World War Two and in \nthe years immediately after, by 1951 MHKs provided chairmen for all but \nthe  Local  Government  Board  and  the  Electricity  and  Water  Boards.\n3\n The \ngrowing participation of MHKs as members of Tynwald Boards and their \nparticipation  in  Tynwald  committees  continued  through  the  1950s.  Thus  \nMHKs had a greater say in the practice of government on the Isle of Man, \nand therefore a greater say in the continuation of the TT. \nPerhaps  the  most  significant  change  in  the  structure  and  practice  of  \ngovernment  in  the  post-war  period  was  the  establishment  of  an  executive  \ncouncil.  The  precedent  for  this  was  set  during  World  War  Two  when  the  \nWar  Consultative  Committee  was  established,  with  the  purpose  of  acting  \nas a cushion between the lieutenant governor and the Legislative Council.\n4\n \nThe  first  executive  council  was  appointed  on  16  October  1946.  The  \nstructure of government now saw the lieutenant governor at the top, but an \nexecutive  council,  composed  of  chairmen  from  the  main  spending  boards  \nof  Tynwald  now  sat  between  the  lieutenant  governor  and  the  Legislative  \nCouncil. Members of the first executive council were Cowin (Agriculture \nand  Fisheries  Board),  Crellin  (Local  Government  Board  (LGB))  and  Gill  \n(Highways  and  Transport  Board)  all  from  the  Legislative  Council  and  \nKneen  (Social  Services  Board)  from  the  House  of  Keys.  MHKs  Alfred  \nTeare  and  Higgins  were  also  elected  to  the  Executive  Council  from  the  \nmembership of Tynwald. In an attempt to provide continuity from the War \nConsultative  Committee,  Deemster  Cowley,  who  had  been  chairman  of  \nthis committee was appointed as the seventh member. This meant that the \nExecutive  Council  had  a  balance  that  favoured  the  Legislative  Council  \nrepresentatives, much to the Keys’ agitation who, in the past, had sought a \nbalance of five to two in their favour. More importantly, however, Cowin, \nCowley,  Gill  and  Alfred  Teare  would  all  be  elected  by  the  members  of  \nTynwald to the Tynwald Motor Races Committee during their time on the \nExecutive  Council.  This  meant  that  the  members  of  the  House  of  Keys,  \nLegislative  Council  and  the  Executive  Council  all  had  an  interest  in  the  \ncontinuation of the TT, and support was widespread amongst members of \nthe Manx legislature. \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n3\n Kermode, Offshore Island Politics, pp. 144-143.  \n4\n  Statement  by  Lieutenant  Governor,  in  War  Committee  Minutes,  Vol.  1,  28  \nNovember 1939 -7 June 1940, Isle of Man Public Records Office (IOMPRO). \n\nChapter Six \n130\nPost-war support \nFollowing  the  end  of  World  War  Two,  Cowin,  MHK  for  Middle,  the  \nconstituency  around  Douglas,  was  evidently  eager  to  see  the  TT  resume,  \ndespite  it  being  somewhat  inappropriate  to  suggest  restarting  the  TT  so  \nsoon  after  World  War  Two.  For  this  purpose  the  Tynwald  Motor  Races  \nCommittee  was  soon  restored  and  members  were  re-elected  by  Tynwald  \non  19  March  1946.\n5\n  At  a  meeting  of  Tynwald  on  19  June  1945,  Cowin,  \nwho   had   previously   been   a   member   of   the   Tynwald   Motor   Races   \nCommittee,  had  asked  the  lieutenant  governor  if  there  were  any  plans  to  \nre-elect this Committee with the restart of the TT in mind.\n6\n The lieutenant \ngovernor   agreed   that   if   Tynwald   wished   to   see   the   Committee   re-\nestablished  then  steps  would  be  taken.  Membership  remained  the  same,  \nwith  the  notable  exception  of  W.C.  Southward  who  had  died  in  1943,  \nbeing  replaced  by  Gill,  a  member  of  the  Executive  and  Legislative  \nCouncils   and   chairman   of   the   Highways   and   Transport   Board.   The   \nTynwald  Motor  Races  Committee  had  been  established  in  late  1937  to  \nassess  the  practicality  of  continuing  financial  assistance  to  the  ACU,  and  \nits re-establishment after 1945 meant that the restart of the TT was a much \nmore organised affair.  \nTynwald approved the Motor Races Committee’s first post-war report \non 17 April 1946. In this report the Committee had concluded that it was \nimpossible to revive the TT races in 1946, probably because it was simply \nimpractical  and  unlikely  to  attract  sufficient  entries  so  soon  after  the  end  \nof the war.\n7\n However, although the TT did not take place on the island that \nyear,  the  Committee  recommended  that  money  be  set  aside  from  the  \nannual budget, first for expenses incurred in staging the Manx Grand Prix \nin September (£1,500), second, for the cost of maintaining the grandstand, \nscoreboards, control tower and other expenditure (£1,900) and, last, so that \nany  loss  made  by  the  June  Effort  Committee  (which  had  been  made  \nresponsible  for  extending  the  island’s  tourist  season  into  June),  on  an  \nInternational  TT  Bicycle  Race  should  be  guaranteed  up  to  £300.  This  \nexpenditure  totalled  £3,700.\n8\n  It  is  apparent  that  the  Committee,  despite  \nviewing  the  restart  of  the  TT  as  impractical,  wished  to  see  the  return  of  \nsome events that might help re-establish the island’s tourist industry.

Cowin  had  been  a  member  of  the  \nTynwald Motor Races Committee in 1937. \n7\n Further Report, 1947, p. 3. \n8\n Further Report, 1947, p. 3. \n\nNo Slowing Down: Domestic Support Confirmed \n131\nmembers  of  Tynwald  supported  this,  so  financial  assistance  for  the  ACU  \nwas continued and the TT races were given political support.  \nLater  that  year,  on  15  October,  the  Tynwald  Motor  Races  Committee  \nwas elected once again for the purpose of assessing the annual grant to be \nmade  to  the  ACU.  The  Committee’s  membership  now  consisted  of  three  \nmembers   from   the   Legislative   Council,   Deemster   Cowley,   Gill   and   \nCowin,  and  two  members  from  the  House  of  Keys,  Alfred  Teare  (South  \nDouglas)   and   T.G.   Moore   (Rushen).\n9\n   Their   1947   report   made   the   \nfollowing  observations  regarding  the  grant  to  be  made  to  the  ACU.  \nTynwald’s  grant  of  £3,500  in  1939  had  helped  in  the  running  of  the  TT,  \nbut  the  event  had  been  run  at  a  loss  of  £1,257  to  the  ACU.  Moreover  the  \nACU believed that the cost of the TT would increase in 1947 and therefore \na  larger  grant  would  have  to  be  made  by  the  Manx  legislature.  As  a  \nbenchmark for the increase, it was pointed out that the Manx Grand Prix, \nwhich  had  been  held  on  the  island  since  1923,  had  cost  the  Manx  \ngovernment £519 in 1938 but £1,153 in 1946. It was therefore put forward \nby  representatives  of  the  ACU  that  the  Manx  government’s  grant  should  \nbe  increased  to  £7,000.  The  Motor  Races  Committee,  however,  thought  \nthis  too  large  an  amount  to  provide  and  recommended  a  grant  of  £6,000.  \nThe  ACU  were  happy  to  accept  this  sum  agreeing,  “if  this  grant  was  \nforthcoming,  they  would  be  prepared  to  enter  into  a  binding  contract  to  \ncontinue  the  Races  for  at  least  another  three  years.”\n10\n  Members  of  the  \nManx  legislature  thus  recognised  the  value  of  continuing  to  stage  the  TT  \non  the  Isle  of  Man,  but  were  not  prepared,  at  this  stage,  to  raise  their  \nfinancial commitment much above the £5,000 provided in the 1930s. The \nreport  was  discussed  in  Tynwald  on  15  April  1947.  A  resolution  was  put  \nforward  by  Deemster  Cowley,  chairman  of  the  committee,  proposing  that  \nTynwald  adopt  the  recommendations  of  the  report.  The  resolution  was  \nsupported by Cowin and by G.P. Quine, representative for North Douglas. \nThey  too  stressed  the  publicity  value  of  the  TT.  This  resolution  received  \nthe unanimous support of the members of Tynwald and the TT’s publicity \nvalue to the island was acknowledged. \n11\n  \nA third report by the Tynwald Motor Races Committee was presented \nto Tynwald in 1948 and discussed on 20 April. No objections were raised \nand  once  again  it  was  agreed  to  unanimously  by  members  of  the  House.  \nThe  TT  featured  only  minimally,  alongside  recommendations  made  for  \nmotorcar  races  on  the  island  and  the  International  TT  Bicycle  Race,  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n9\n Further Report, 1947, p. 3. \n10\n Further Report, 1947, p. 3. \n11\n Debates, Vol. 64, 15 April 1947, pp. 524-526.  \n\nChapter Six \n132\nsuggesting that the continuation of the TT was not contentious and needed \nonly to be briefly considered. The Committee’s 1948 report recommended \nthat  the  £6,000  given  to  the  ACU  in  1947  should  also  be  provided  in  \n1948.\n12\n  It  was  this  time  left  to  Gill  to  put  forward  the  resolution  for  the  \nreport  to  be  accepted  by  Tynwald,  and  this  was  seconded  by  Cowin.  The  \nrequirement for a further report on the future of motor racing on the island \nto  be  submitted  to  Tynwald  suggests  that  a  much  larger  consensus  of  \nopinion  was  needed  for  the  continuation  of  the  TT,  but  support  for  the  \nMotor  Races  Committee’s  reports  and  the  renewal  of  legislation  suggests  \nthat this consensus was guaranteed.  \nFrom  this  point  on  it  was  the  responsibility  of  the  Tynwald  Motor  \nRaces Committee to organise the continuation of the grant for motor races \non   the   island,   which   required   the   annual   consent   of   Tynwald.   The   \nHighway  Board  was  responsible  for  road  closures,  and  again  the  consent  \nof  Tynwald  was  required  before  any  action  was  taken.  In  both  1949  and  \n1950,  further  financial  grants  and  road  closures  were  permitted  after  \ndiscussion  in  Tynwald,  with  no  objections  raised.\n13\n  In  1949  the  Motor  \nRaces  Committee  recommended  that  the  grant  should  once  again  be  \n£6,000 but in 1950 this was raised to £7,000: a further commitment to the \nTT by the Manx legislature.\n14\n  \nRoad Races Act 1951 \nIn  1951  issues  of  safety  around  the  course  were  placed  on  the  \nlegislative   agenda.   This   was   a   point   where   members   of   the   Manx   \nlegislature  might  have  removed  their  hands  from  the  political  throttle.  \nHowever, their continued support for the TT was further demonstrated by \nthe  passing  of  the  Road  Races  Act,  1951.  The  Road  Races  Bill  was  \nintroduced  into  the  Legislative  Council  by  the  attorney  general  and  \nreceived  its  first,  second  and  third  readings  on  27  February  1951.\n15\n The \nattorney  general  made  it  clear  that  the  bill  was  necessary  to  give  the  \nHighway  Board  the  statutory  authority  to  request  the  public  to  keep  their  \nanimals   off   the   roads   during   racing.   Previous   legislation,   although   \nallowing the Highway Board to close roads, did not permit them to enforce \nregulations  concerning  the  restriction  of  animals  alongside  the  course.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n12\n See Report of the Committee on Motor Races with Respect to Motor Car Races \nand the TT Races, 19 March 1948.

During  this  discussion,  and  prior  to  a  third  reading  taking  place,  a  \nnumber of clauses were considered. Particular attention was paid to clause \nthree  of  the  bill  that  sought  to  make  the  owners  of  animals  responsible  if  \nthey  strayed  onto  the  TT  course  when  roads  were  closed.  Gill  offered  \nsupport for this clause, stating that “we must take every care to protect the \ncompetitors  and  the  public  who  are  watching  these  races.  The  speeds  are  \nnow in the region of 100 mph [sic], and I hate to think what would happen, \nif  an  accident  to  a  rider,  due  to  an  animal  being  on  the  course,  happened  \nwhile he was going that speed.”\n16\n Little attention was paid to the fact that \nowners of animals might not support the TT, and might therefore disagree \nwith   being   prosecuted   if   an   accident   occurred.   After   a   very   brief   \ndiscussion  of  the  bill,  and  with  no  objections  being  raised,  it  was  read  a  \nthird  time  and  passed  in  the  Legislative  Council.  As  had  been  the  case  in  \n1928,  by  supporting  amendments  to  legislation  to  make  the  TT  safer,  \nmembers of the Legislative Council demonstrated their continuing support \nfor the event.  \nAfter being passed in the Legislative Council, the bill was presented to \nthe  House  of  Keys  and  was  read  for  the  first  time  on  6  March  1951.  It  \nreceived  its  second  reading  on  24  April.\n17\n  T.G.  Moore,  representative  for  \nthe rural sheading of Rushen, moved that this was “a consolidation Bill ... \nit brings together into one body all the provisions relating to the holding of \nthe races and the closing of roads contained in the three Acts set out in the \nschedule, and which the Highway Board have needed to ensure the proper \nrunning of the various events which we hold in the Island.”\n18\n This was an \nendorsement  of  such  events  from  a  rural  MHK.  After  a  substantial  \ndiscussion,  the  majority  of  which  focused  on  the  publicity  benefits  of  the  \nTT, the bill was then read a third time and passed without division in the \nKeys.  \nAfter  due  consideration,  the  Road  Races  Act  was  passed  on  15  May  \n1951, received its Royal Assent on 29 June and was read at Tynwald Hill \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n16\n Debates, Vol. 68, 27 Feb. 1951, p. 409. \n17\n Debates, Vol. 68, 24 April 1951, p. 707. \n18\n Debates, Vol. 68, 24 April 1951, p. 707.  \n\nChapter Six \n134\non 7 July 1952.\n19\n As Moore had pointed out in the House of Keys, the Act \nconsolidated  previous  highways  legislation.  It  repealed  the  whole  of  the  \nHighway Amendment Act 1928, and certain sections of the Highway Act \n1927  and  Road  Traffic  Act  1933.  Under  part  one  of  the  1951  Act  it  was  \nstill the responsibility of the Highway Board to close roads for racing, and \nit was also necessary for the board to request the consent of the lieutenant \ngovernor  and  Tynwald  to  put  this  process  into  action.  So  the  lieutenant  \ngovernor still had a part to play in the continuation of the TT and Tynwald \nstill  had  to  agree  that  the  event  was  an  asset  to  the  island.  Also  put  into  \nplace  were  provisions  for  the  punishment  of  owners  who  allowed  their  \nanimals to stray onto the roads. Part two of the act made it possible for the \nHighway Board to restrict motor traffic on “all or any of the public roads \nof  the  Island  on  the  Sunday  immediately  preceding  the  day  of  the  races”  \nand,  further,  to  prohibit  motorcycle  traffic  on  “all  or  any  of  the  roads  or  \nstreets of any borough or town in this Island on the Sunday following the \nday  of  any  races.”\n20\n  This  was  a  continuation  of  provisions  made  in  \nprevious legislation.  \nPost-war continuity \nFollowing  the  passage  of  the  1951  legislation,  and  as  was  the  case  \nduring  the  inter-war  years,  the  extension  of  the  powers  of  the  Highway  \nBoard  to  permit  road  closures  for  racing,  and  the  provision  of  a  financial  \ngrant  by  the  Tynwald  Motor  Races  Committee,  required  the  consent  of  \nTynwald  annually.\n21\n  After  the  passing  of  the  1951  Road  Races  Act  there  \nwas  no  subsequent  condemnation  of  the  TT,  indicative  of  continuing  \npolitical support. The extension of the powers of the Highway Board and \nthe  provision  of  an  annual  financial  grant  was  repeated  in  Tynwald  each  \nyear,  with  no  objections  and  minimal  debate.  Indeed,  political  support  \nmanifested  itself  in  the  growing  financial  grant  given  to  the  ACU,  which  \nincreased from the £6,000 provided in 1947 to £10,500 in 1957.\n22\n  \nHowever, in 1956 the decision was made by Tynwald that the Tourist \nBoard  should  be  made  responsible  for  the  organisation  of  the  TT  in  the  \nIsle of Man, officially giving responsibility for the organisation of the TT \nto  the  body  responsible  for  publicising  the  island.  This  would  reduce  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n19\n  Road  Races  Act  1951,  Statutes  of  the  Isle  of  Man,  Vol.  XVII  1952-1959.  \nHereafter Statutes.  \n20\n Road Races Act 1951, Statutes, Vol. 17 1952-1959, pp. 1211-1215.  \n21\n Debates, Vols. 69–72, Oct. 1951–Aug. 1955. \n22\n See Accounts  of  Government  Treasurer.  The  provision  of  this  financial  grant  \nwas passed annually in Tynwald. See Debates, Vol. 69-72, Oct 1951-Aug. 1955.  \n\nNo Slowing Down: Domestic Support Confirmed \n135\nneed for co-ordination between the Highway Board, who were responsible \nfor  road  closures,  and  the  Motor  Races  Committee,  responsible  for  the  \ncontinuation of the annual grant.\n23\n In December 1956 the attorney general \nmoved  a  resolution  in  Tynwald  stating  that  it  was  “desirable  to  have  one  \nauthority  responsible  to  Tynwald  for  matters  affecting  the  TT,  Manx  \nGrand  Prix  and  Manx  International  Bicycle  Race  and  road  races  similar  \nwhich  may  from  time  to  time  be  organised  in  the  Isle  of  Man.”\n24\n The \nattorney  general  pointed  out  that  at  present  a  committee  of  Tynwald  was  \nlooking  after  the  financial  side  of  the  TT  and  “that  was  their  only  \npower”,\n25\n  and  that  the  ACU  had  to  contact  a  number  of  bodies  –  the  \nHighway  Board,  the  Tourist  Board  and  the  Douglas  Corporation.  Giving  \nthe  Tourist  Board  sole  responsibility  as  a  point  of  contact  on  the  island  \nstreamlined this process. It was also recommended by the attorney general \nthat,  “if  the  task  is  given  to  them  [the  Tourist  Board,]  [he]  would  \nrecommend  them  to  appoint  a  sub-committee,  which  would  be  a  Race  \nCommittee of people vitally interested in the races, and [he would] suggest \nthat this committee should comprise the chairman and two representatives \nof  the  Tourist  Board,  two  members  of  the  Highway  Board  and  two  \nmembers  of  the  Douglas  Corporation.”\n26\n  Such  a  sub-committee  would  be  \nrepresentative of all parties with an interest in the TT.  \nThere  was  considerable  debate  on  the  matter  of  a  single  coordinating  \nauthority  and  alternatives  were  proposed.  At  the  end  of  the  debate  the  \nlieutenant governor summed up each suggestion and proposed a vote. The \nfirst  suggestion  that  had  been  put  forward  was  that  instead  of  the  Tourist  \nBoard  taking  over  control  of  the  TT  and  other  motor  races,  a  separate  \ncommittee  should  be  appointed  that  consisted  of  two  members  from  the  \nHighway  Board,  two  from  the  Tourist  Board  and  one  from  the  Douglas  \nCorporation;  in  this  way  all  interested  parties  would  be  represented.  The  \nsecond suggestion was that the Highway Board and not the Tourist Board \nshould  be  given  sole  responsibility  as  the  body  responsible  for  road  \nclosures. The third suggestion asked that instead of the Tourist Board there \nshould  be  a  special  committee  of  Tynwald  consisting  of  five  members.  \nWho  these  five  members  would  be  was  not  stipulated.\n27\n Seemingly, \nmembers  of  Tynwald  wished  to  see  the  TT  continue  on  the  Isle  of  Man,  \nand there were only conflicting ideas as to how this continuation should be \norganised.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n23\n Debates, Vol. 74, 12 Dec. 1956, p. 190-197. \n24\n Debates, Vol. 74, 12 Dec. 1956, p. 190. \n25\n Debates, Vol. 74, 12 Dec. 1956, p. 190. \n26\n Debates, Vol. 74, 12 Dec. 1956, p. 190. \n27\n Debates, Vol. 74, 12 Dec. 1956, p. 197. \n\nChapter Six \n136\nUltimately,  it  was  resolved  that  the  Tourist  Board  would  be  the  \ncoordinating   authority   for   the   TT   and   other   races,   and   the   other   \nsuggestions for different approaches were rejected. The Tourist Board was \ngiven  authority  over  the  TT  in  the  1958  Tourist  (Isle  of  Man)  Act.\n28\n This \nAct  stipulated  that  the  duty  of  the  Tourist  Board  would  be  to  “maintain,  \nencourage,  develop,  protect,  promote  and  facilitate  tourism  in,  to,  and  \nfrom the Isle of Man to the best advantage of the Island.” Evidently the TT \nwas  firmly  recognised  as  advantageous  to  the  Isle  of  Man,  since  the  \nTourist  Board  was  now  solely  responsible  for  its  organisation.  The  Act  \nalso  gave  the  Board  power  to  “provide  or  assist  financially  (by  way  of  \ngrant, loan, guarantee or indemnity) or in any other manner, competitions, \nexhibitions,  services,  sports,  races,  amusements,  carnivals,  attractions,  \nentertainments  and  other  facilities,  relating  to  tourism.”\n29\n The  Tourist \nBoard  Race  Committee  was  also  established,  and  the  minutes  of  their  \nmeetings  provide  a  starting  point  for  further  examination  of  political  \nsupport  for  the  TT,  after  1958.\n30\n  Therefore,  by  1958  the  TT  had  become  \nstill  more  firmly  ingrained  by  Manx  legislation  and  in  the  island’s  \nadministrative structure.  \nThroughout  the  1960s  the  legislation  for  motor  racing  was  annually  \nrenewed,  with  very  little  discussion  in  the  Manx  legislature.  This  did  not  \nmean  that  there  was  no  protest  over  the  continued  closure  of  roads  for  \nmotor  races.  Indeed,  in  1962  Callister,  MHK  for  North  Douglas  and  a  \nrepresentative of the Manx Labour Party, made a protest over the severity \nof  the  conditions  for  road  closures  in  relation  to  the  TT  races.  Callister  \nargued: “I think the conditions laid down even for the T.T. are too severe. \nThere  are  people  living  around  the  course  who  cannot  get  to  their  homes  \nor place of business because they cannot go on the course when the races \nare  on”  and  furthermore  that  “road  closures  were  going  on  to  such  an  \nextent  that  it  is  intolerable.”\n31\n  However,  whilst  Callister’s  fears  were  \nrecognised  by  Bolton  who  stated  that  “we  must  protect  the  people  taking  \npart,  otherwise  we  may  lose  these  events”,  there  was  no  call  for  the  \nlegislation  to  not  be  renewed.\n32\n  An  amendment  to  the  resolution  was  \nproposed,  which  would  allow  people  to  be  given  the  right  of  access  to  \ntheir home or place of business, by permission of a constable or marshal. \nA vote was taken on the amendment but did not receive the full support of \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n28\n Tourist (Isle of Man) Act 1958, Statutes, Vol. 17 1952-1959, pp. 957-965. \n29\n Statutes, Vol. 17, 1952-1959. \n30\n See Tourist Board Race Committee Minutes.  \n31\n Debates, Vol. 79, February 28, 1962, pp. 653-655.  \n32\n Debates, Vol. 79, February 28, 1962, pp. 653-655.  \n\nNo Slowing Down: Domestic Support Confirmed \n137\nthe  house  with  13  votes  to  9  against  in  the  Keys  and  the  Legislative  \nCouncil voting unanimously against the amendment.  \nThroughout the twentieth century the TT continued to take place on the \nIsle of Man after the renewal of legislation by Tynwald, which took place \noften  with  little  discussion  and  with  the  full  support  of  the  island’s  \npoliticians.  This  continued  to  be  the  case  throughout  the  1970s  and  early  \n1980s  and  although  objections  to  the  TT  were  sometimes  raised,  there  is  \nlittle to suggest that ending the event was ever given serious consideration \nby  the  Manx  authorities.  During  this  period  the  TT’s  place  on  the  world  \nchampionship was threatened – this status would be lost in 1976. Two new \npieces  of  legislation  were  also  passed  by  Tynwald,  the  Road  Races  \n(Amendment)  Act  1975  and  the  Road  Races  Act  1982.  The  debate  that  \ntook  place  around  these  three  key  events  help  to  confirm  that  by  the  last  \nquarter  of  the  twentieth  century  the  TT  had  come  to  be  supported  \npolitically  in  the  Isle  of  Man.  Indeed,  it  is  today  the  1982  legislation  that  \npermits the closure of roads for the TT races.  \n1975: Road Races (Amendment) Act \nThe 1975 Road Races (Amendment) Bill was given its first reading in \nthe House of Keys on 4 February 1975 by Ward, MHK for South Douglas. \nThe  Bill  was  to  amend  existing  legislation  to  permit  motor  racing  to  take  \nplace on a Sunday. Ward noted that “those of us who believe in tourism as \nsomething that this Island can do well, and must go on regarding as one of \nthe  main  planks  of  our  economy,  must  realise  the  importance  of  the  T.T.  \nraces,  (a)  as  a  world  famous  event  coupled  almost  exclusively  with  the  \nname of the Isle of Man ever since its inception in 1907; and (b) a curtain \nraiser for our season which almost any holiday resort in the British Isles or \nanywhere  else  would  give  its  eye-teeth  to  promote.”\n33\n  Here,  once  again,  \nwas a Douglas MHK promoting the TT races in the interests of tourism.  \nThere  was  disagreement  over  the  necessity  of  the  proposal.  MHK  \nClucas  objected  to  the  “lack  of  priorities  we  seem  to  have  in  our  \ngovernment”,  echoing  the  objections  of  MHKs  in  1904.  He  questioned  \n“very much our priority in having this particular measure in front of us at \nthis  particular  time.  It  was  only  last  July  that  for  the  T.T.  week  we  had  \ndifficulty with the weather, and here we are, one year of difficulty and we \nare  immediately  flying  into  legislation.”\n34\n  Whilst  Clucas  objected  to  the  \nproposed   amendment   because   of   the   quickness   of   the   changes   to   \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n33\n Debates, Vol. 92, February 25, 1975, pp. K338-K339.  \n34\n Debates, Vol. 92, February 25, 1975, p. K342.  \n\nChapter Six \n138\nlegislation,  Miss  Thornton-Duesbury  did  not  support  the  bill  for  religious  \nreasons: \n \nThe  hon.  member  for  Ayre  has  said  that  the  churches  and  worship  \npossibilities  for  such  are  covered  in  this  Bill,  but  they  are  not  entirely,  \nbecause  quite  a  number  of  churches  and  in  particular  chapels  do  have  \nservices  in  the  afternoon  ...  I  feel  that  it  is  an  intrusion  into  a  day  which  \nalthough may not be kept as holy by many people today, yet it is a day set \napart  for  us  in  recreation  and  I  feel  that  such  a  Bill  as  this  is  driving  a  \nwedge  as  it  were  and  is  breaking  that  which  is  kept  for  the  good  of  the  \ncommunity and is doing it for only a certain section of the community.\n35\n  \n \nClucas  agreed  with  the  point,  stating  that  “I  am  against  this  Bill,  I  feel  it  \nbreaches  the  Sunday  and  once  people  are  going  to  be  able  to  race  motor-\ncycles  on  a  Sunday  they  will  use  it  as  an  excuse  for  all  sorts  of  other  \nthings.”\n36\n  Cringle’s  objection  to  the  Bill  was  because  of  the  timing  of  the  \nroad  closure.  He  was  prepared  to  accept  road  closure  on  the  first  Sunday  \nof  TT  week,  “because  I  think  that  is  what  is  commonly  called  ‘Mad  \nSunday’ and we have the inconvenience of the motor-cycle already on the \nIsland on the Sunday.”\n37\n  \nMHK Bell was quick to dismiss these worries: “What has been said is \nperfectly  clear.  The  T.T.  programme  is  mapped  out  months  beforehand,  \nno-one  knows  what  the  weather  is  going  to  be  in  five  years’  time  on  a  \nparticular date. We know everyone is going to church on that day and they \nwill be going to church for the other 52 or 53 Sundays in the year and we \nare  not  asking  them  to  give  up  church  every  Sunday.  We  are  not  even  \nsuggesting  in  the  Bill  that  they  will  have  to.”  \n38\n  Following  the  discussion  \nthe Bill was read for a second time and a vote was taken. In the Keys 13 \nwere  for  the  Bill  and  8  against,  and  so  the  Act  was  read  for  a  third  time.  \nThe discussion over the third reading was centred on the same points and \nnothing new was introduced into the debate. The Bill was read for a third \ntime and passed by members of the Keys, but not unanimously.  \nThe  Bill  was  then  considered  in  the  Legislative  Council,  on  8  April  \n1975  and  the  first,  second  and  third  readings  were  approved.  There  was  \nlittle discussion, and few objections were raised. However, Crowe pointed \nout that it was a “terrific thing if we have got to rush now and pretty well \nbreak our necks to get a Bill through, to put it through for this year. This is \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n35\n Debates, Vol. 92, February 25, 1975, pp. K342-K343.  \n36\n Debates, Vol. 92, February 25, 1975, p.

Any \nlittle  thing  that  might  be  evasive  or  an  irritant  could,  perhaps,  put  these  \nthings  in  further  jeopardy.”\n41\n  The  bill  was  then  read  second  and  third  \ntimes,  with  no  further  discussion  and  was  then  passed  in  the  Legislative  \nCouncil.  The  Road  Races  (Amendment)  Act  1975  therefore  provided  for  \nthe  closure  of  roads  for  racing  on  a  Sunday.  However,  it  would  only  be  \npossible  for  roads  to  be  closed  on  one  Sunday  of  the  year  during  the  \nmonths  of  May  or  June  and  this  would  be  the  Sunday  between  practice  \nweek  and  race  week.  Such  provisions  were  only  exercisable  if  a  race  had  \nbeen postponed during the preceding week and roads could only be closed \nbetween 1:30 pm and 6pm.  \nFollowing  the  amendment  to  the  Road  Races  Act  in  1975,  new  \nlegislation was drafted in 1982. New legislation was necessary because it \nwas felt that the provisions of section four of the 1951 Road Races Act did \nnot make it clear that all road traffic legislation was suspended when roads \nwere closed for racing. This was a matter that had been brought up by C.P. \nBowring  Motorsport,  the  principle  insurers  for  motor  racing  events,  and  \nthe  Attorney  General  had  advised  that  the  best  cause  of  action  was  to  \nredraft  the  Road  Races  Bill,  to  avoid  any  mistakes  in  interpretation.  This  \nwas  another  point  in  time  where  the  importance  of  the  TT  to  the  island  \nwas discussed in the Manx Legislature, with the event receiving support in \nboth the House of Keys and the Legislative Council.  \nThere  was  a  good  discussion  over  the  proposed  new  legislation  and  \nonce  again  support  for  motor  racing  on  the  island  was  forthcoming.  \nWalker, MHK for ..., supported the Bill believing it to be “right and proper \nthat the Government should update this legislation and consolidate it, and \nin  fact  [it]  makes  things  simpler  for  everybody  to  understand.”\n42\n MHKs’ \ndisagreements focused largely on the inconvenience caused by the TT and, \nindeed, other motor racing events held on the island. Anderson, MHK for \n...,  realised  that  in  his  constituency  “there  are  a  great  number  of  people  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n39\n Debates, Vol. 92, April 8, 1975, p.

Race; fair days, tin bath \nchampionships  ...  but  I  believe  the  vast  majority  of  people  in  the  Isle  of  \nMan accept it because the end result justifies it.”\n44\n \nMHKs believed that this inconvenience had to be tolerated because of \nthe economic benefits motor races brought to the island. Walker, MHK for \n..., proposed that “it is unfortunate, I think, that some people on the Island \nhave  to  put  up  with  a  certain  amount  of  discomfort  because  of  the  very  \nnature  of  the  business  we  are  in,  tourism,  but  I  think  that  is  a  fact  of  life  \nand  personally  I  am  proud  of  the  Isle  of  Man  and  the  events  it  holds.”\n45\n \nThis attitude was shared by Delaney and Teare, MHKs for ... respectively. \nDelaney  believed  that  “we  need  everyone  we  can  get  regardless  of  the  \ninconvenience,   because   we   either   have   to   suffer   inconvenience   or   \nbankruptcy  as  far  as  my  constituency  is  concerned,  and  I  would  rather  \nhave inconvenience for a couple of days and make money for the people in \nthe  Isle  of  Man  who  badly  need  it  than  satisfy  one  or  two  people  who  \nunfortunately might be inconvenienced.”\n46\n Teare thought it “wrong to miss \nthe  opportunity  to  try  and  reduce  the  irritation  and  inconvenience  to  the  \npublic.”\n47\n \nThe bill was read in the Legislative Council on 30 March, and Moore \nmade a similar statement to Radcliffe in the Keys, who had noted that the \nbill  reflected  the  need  for  clarity  in  existing  legislation.  Moore  then  went  \non  to  offer  further  information  on  the  bill, suggesting that there had been \nsome misunderstanding on behalf of the (Manx) National Farmers’ Union, \nwho felt some new clause was contained in the Bill with which they were \nnot happy. This was clause five, which dealt with the problem of animals \nstraying  onto  the  roads  and  the  question  of  who  was  responsible.  It  was  \nnoted  that  there  had  been  no  change  in  the  clause,  but  the  wording  had  \nbeen  redrafted  to  reflect  modern  terminology.  This  issue  was  dealt  with  \nquickly. The Council also considered the re-insertion of clause 1 (4). The \nLord Bishop proposed that “I think that it is important that the members of \nTynwald have the opportunity of making comments on these orders as so \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n43\n Debates, Vol. 99, February 2, 1982, p.

The annual approval of legislation \nwas  required  by  Tynwald,  which  enabled  the  Highway  and  Transport  \nBoard to make any orders under the road racing legislation. This was seen \nas  a  formality  as  it  did  not  specific  any  actual  races.  The  Highway  and  \nTransport  Board  then  made  an  order  to  close  roads  for  races,  gained  the  \nconsent  of  the  Governor  in  Council  and  then  gave  adequate  public  notice  \nof  the  orders.  The  Keys,  by  deleting  a  sub-clause  of  the  Road  Races  Act,  \nproposed a change to this procedure. It was suggested that under the 1982 \nbill,  the  Highway  Board  would  make  an  order,  get  the  consent  of  the  \nGovernor and then give “adequate” public notice of all orders. This cut out \nthe need for the renewal of legislation to be considered by Tynwald.\n49\n  \nIt  was  reported  in  the  Keys  that  members  of  the  Legislative  Council  \nhad  got  in  “quite  a  predicament”  over  the  removal  of  the  sub-clause.  The  \nKeys’  proposal  caused  disagreement  between  the  two  chambers  in  the  \nManx   legislature.   To   fix   this   disagreement,   the   Keys   voted   that   a   \ncommittee  of  three  of  its  members  should  meet  with  the  Legislative  \nCouncil.   The   conference   was   scheduled   to   take   place   on   18   May.   \nFollowing  this  conference  with  the  Legislative  Council,  the  proceedings  \nwere reported in the House of Keys on 25 May, and it was made clear that \nfollowing   discussion   over   the   re-insertion   of   the   sub-clause   the   \nrepresentatives of the Legislative Council were to recommend the deletion \nof the clause to their colleagues. Members of the House of Keys voted for \nthe  acceptance  of  this  report.\n50\n  Thus  the  Manx  legislature  had  come  to  \naccept  the  TT  in  the  period  after  World  War  Two  and  so  the  event  had  \ndeveloped from an imposition by the lieutenant governor. The next chapter \nwill  move  on  to  explore  the  strength  of  economic  support  for  the  TT  \namongst  members  of  the  Manx  legislature  and  the  manufacturers  of  \nmotorcycles. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n48\n Debates, Vol. 99, March 30, 1982, p.

In  1939,  before  the  outbreak  of  war,  the  \nrecorded number of visitors to the island was 546,019, but this dropped to \n25,841  in  1940.  Between  1941  and  1944  only  295,306  visitors  were  \nrecorded.\n1\n  The  Isle  of  Man  was  able  to  maintain  its  economic  stability  \nbecause  internees  occupied  the  empty  boarding  houses  in  Douglas,  Peel  \nand Ramsey and also in Port Erin and Port St. Mary. The costs of this were \nmet  by  the  UK  government.\n2\n  The  island’s  economy  also  benefited  from  \nthe stationing of military service personnel on the island, and the building \nof two aerodromes. Internees and service personnel replaced the tourists and \nprovided  a  market  for  agricultural  products  that  existed  all  year  round.  So,  \nwith island residents being given new employment opportunities as a result \nof wartime activity and boarding houses being filled all year round, the Isle \nof Man fared well during World War Two, at least in economic terms.\n3\n  \nHowever,  a  brief  analysis  of  occupational  data  taken  from  the  1951  \ncensus report shows the further demise of the island’s traditional industries \nof fishing, agriculture and mining (see table 7-1). By 1951 there were only \n119  people  employed  in  the  island’s  fishing  industry  and  the  majority  of  \nthese  worked  out  of  Peel.  Agriculture  was  by  now  only  employing  2,609  \npersons and mining and quarrying 135. In contrast and despite the notable \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n Isle  of  Man  Summer  Passenger  Arrivals  1887  –  Present,  (Economic  Affairs  \nDivision, Isle of Man Government, Douglas, 2007). \n2\n  For  further  comment  on  internment  on  the  Isle  of  Man  see,  for  example,  C.  \nChappell, Island of Barbed Wire, (Corgi 1984); Y. Cresswell, Living with the Wire, \n(Douglas, Manx National Heritage, 1994).  \n3\n  For  further  analysis  see  J.W.  Birch,  The  Isle  of  Man  a  Study  in  Economic  \nGeography,  (Cambridge,  Cambridge  University  Press,  1964);  D.  Winterbottom,  \n‘Economic History, in J. Belchem (ed.), A New History of the Isle of Man Volume \nV:  The  Modern  Period  1830  –  1999,  (Liverpool,  Liverpool  University  Press,  \n2000), pp. 207-278. \n\nGoing Global: The Growth of Capitalist Support \n143\ndown  turn  in  tourist  figures  during  World  War  Two,  4,123  people  were  \nrecorded as being employed in personal service by 1951 and 1,208 persons \nwere  employed  as  lodging  or  boarding  house  keepers  and  a  further  164  \nemployed  as  hotel  proprietors  or  managers.  Most  notably  the  majority  of  \nthese persons were situated in Douglas (982). The dominance of Douglas \ncan  also  be  noted  by  the  large  amount  of  accommodation  for  visitors  on  \noffer  there  (see  table  7-2).  Statistics  for  1951  show  that  of  a  total  1,242  \nboarding  houses  situated  on  the  island  882  were  situated  in  Douglas  and  \nonly  340  were  situated  across  the  rest  of  the  island.\n4\n  By  1961  the  total  \nnumber  of  hotels  and  boarding  houses  was  1,510,  with  1,079  situated  in  \nDouglas,  and  431  in  other  areas  of  the  island,  reaffirming  Douglas’s  \ndominance both economically and in terms of population.\n5\n  \nTourist  numbers  recorded  for  this  period  are  also  significant.  In  1946  \nthere were 482,962 visitors recorded, rising to 602,230 in 1947, 624,737 in \n1948  and  611,286  in  1949.\n6\n  However,  this  initial  post-war  recovery  was  \nnot  typical  of  the  post  war  period,  and  after  1949  the  island’s  economy  \nentered a period of recession.\n7\n Tourist figures fell from 611,286 (1949) to \n535,558  (1950)  and  averaged  500,000  during  the  1950s,  before  hitting  a  \nlow  of  473,704  in  1960.\n8\n  Despite  this  decline  in  visitor  numbers,  the  \ntourist industry still remained a valuable source of income for the island’s \neconomy.  Birch  estimates  average  per  capita  expenditure  by  tourists  over  \nthe  time  spent  in  the  island  to  be  £15,  which,  if  multiplied  by  542,065  \ntourists  gives  a  figure  of  approximately  £8,500,000.\n9\n  This  figure  was  \nincreased  in  1955  when  the  Visiting  Industry  Commission  estimated  the  \ntotal spent per tourist to be £18, which was multiplied by an approximate \nfigure  of  580,000,  a  total  that  was  approximately  ten  times  the  island’s  \npopulation, giving a total value of £10,500,000. This figure was adjusted to \ntake   into   consideration   travel   expenses,   which   were   estimated   to   be   \n£1,500,000 to give a net valuation of tourist expenditure in the Isle of Man \nof  £9,000,000.\n  10\n  The  Commission  put  this  into  context  by  valuing  the  \nScottish tourist trade at £45,000,000, the Welsh tourist trade at £30,000,000 \nand the tourist trade in Jersey at £10,000,000.\n11\n On the Isle of Man, with a \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n4\n Census 1951: Report of Isle of Man, (London, H.M.S.O, 1956). \n5\n Census  1961:  Report  on  Isle  of  Man:  Part  II  Migration,  Economic  Activity  and  \nOther Topics, (London, H.M.S.O, 1966).  \n6\n Isle of Man Summer Passenger Arrivals 1887 – Present. \n7\n Birch, The Isle of Man.  \n8\n Isle of Man Summer Passenger Arrivals 1887 – Present. \n9\n Visiting Industry Commission, (Douglas, 1955), p. 11. See Appendix Three of the report. \n10\n Visiting Industry Commission, p. 11. \n11\n Report of the Visiting Industry Commission 1955, p. 11. \n\nChapter Seven \n144\npopulation   of   55,523   this   meant   the   tourist   industry   was   valued   at   \napproximately £162 per capita.\n12\n  \nBirch  argues  that  the  decline  in  tourist  figures  in  the  mid-1950s  “re-\nemphasised  the  island’s  dependence  on  this  source  of  income  and,  in  \nparticular,   demonstrated   the   increasingly   competitive   nature   of   the   \nindustry.”\n13\n  Indeed,  Craine  (MHK)  voiced  the  view  that  the  island  relied  \nheavily  on  the  tourist  industry  in  1952,  when  he  stated  that  he  supported  \nthe TT because “you can talk about agriculture and anything else, but we \nhave only one industry [tourism]. We should do our utmost [to support the \nTT] because we live on [it].”\n14\n The decline in tourist numbers visiting the \nisland  also  emphasised  the  need  to  retain  the  TT,  at  least  for  Craine.  He  \nwent  further  to  point  out  that  “the  arrivals  in  June  last  year  [1951]  \nrepresented  22.8%  of  the  total  arrivals  for  the  season.”\n15\n  The  TT  could  \nextend into June a tourist season that currently saw the largest number of \nvisitors  between  July  and  August.  The  TT  would  continue  to  draw  \nattention to the island, and thus would act as something like free publicity. \nThe TT also remained a unique selling point for the island. The spectacle \nprovided by the TT and the publicity it generated throughout the post-war \nperiod, were enough to justify continued political support for the TT.  \n \nTynwald and Business Interests in the TT \n \nDuring  a  public  sitting  to  consider  the  recommendations  of  the  1955  \nVisiting Industry Commission Report, a member of the Douglas Residential \nand Boarding House Association made the following statement: \n \nI am going to make a statement at which you may perhaps be amused. We \nhave  three  big  sporting  events  which  take  place  during  the  periods  when  \nWakes  do  not  occur.  The  T.T.  races  in  early  June,  the  cycle  races  a  \nfortnight later, and the Grand Prix races at the back end of the season. All \nof these things happened accidentally on the Isle of Man. No Government \nbody,  no  Municipal  body  in  any  way  encouraged  or  supported  them  ...  A  \ngroup  of  dirty  little  lads  got  going  on  motor  cycles,  when  everybody  was  \nhorrified  by  them,  and  started  the  T.T.  Races;  they  were  unobserved  and  \nunhelped  [sic]  for  years  until  it  was  seen  that  they  could  be  helpful  to  the  \nvisiting industry.\n16\n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n12\n Census 1951: Report on Isle of Man, (London, H.M.S.O., 1956).  \n13\n Birch, The Isle of Man, p. 28.  \n14\n Debates, Vol. 69, 10 Apr. 1952, p. 448. \n15\n Debates, Vol. 69, 10 Apr. 1952, p. 448.  \n16\n Visiting Industry Commission, p. 54. \n\nGoing Global: The Growth of Capitalist Support \n145\nTable  7-1:  Occupations  of  males  and  females  in  the  Isle  of  Man  by  \narea, 1951 \n \n  \nFishing \nAgriculture \nMining and Quarrying \nPersonal Service \nLodging and Boarding \nHouse Keepers \nHotel managers and \nProprietors \nIsle of \nMan \nTotal         119      2.609      135      4,123      1,208      164      \nMales        118        2.428        135        945        268        95        \nFemales         1          181          0         3,178         948         69         \nCastletown \nMales          2          20          10          24          0           2          \nFemales         0            0            0           86           8            2         \nDouglas \nMales          30         158         16         550         208         52         \nFemales         1            1            0         1,777         688         34         \nPeel \nMales          37          37          23          26           4            4          \nFemales         0            1            0           93          34           2         \nRamsey \nMales         19         50          5          65          8          12         \nFemales         0            1            0          273         46           7         \nRest of \nIsland \nMales         30         2,163         81         280         43         25         \nFemales          0          177          0          949          172          24          \nSource: Census 1951: Report of Isle of Man \n \nThough  not  entirely  accurate,  this  statement  highlights  the  importance  of  \nthe  TT  in  advertising  the  island.

His confidence arose \nbecause a large number of race entrants for the 1948 event was expected. \nA larger entry would attract a greater number of visitors, which, in Gill’s \nbelief, would equate to more revenue for the island. Later, in 1951, Brew, \nrepresentative  for  the  rural  sheading  of  Ayre,  pointed  out  that  “we  don’t  \nwant   to   lose   the   T.T.   races,   because   they   are   one   of   the   finest   \nadvertisements  that  we  have.  I  hope  this  House  will  give  it  [the  Bill]  \nunanimous support.”\n20\n His support for the TT and acknowledgement of the \nadvertising potential of the races demonstrates that support for the TT was \nnot confined to urban areas, especially Douglas.  \nSupport  for  the  races  amongst  members  of  Tynwald  was  strong  and  \narose  from  the  widely  held  belief  that  the  TT  advertised  the  island.  \nHowever,  not  all  members  of  Tynwald  were  keen  to  see  the  continuation  \nof  the  TT.  Commander  Quine,  representative  for  the  rural  sheading  of  \nGarff,  raised  his  voice  in  opposition  in  1947,  arguing  that  by  continuing  \nwith the TT the Manx government were encouraging an activity that was, \nin his view, lethal. In Quine’s opinion: \n \nIt seems strange that we should encourage these lethal machines, which are \nresponsible for killing seven thousand people on the roads of Great Britain, \nand injuring 25,000, every year, whereas I have a distinct recollection that \nwhen  the  same  hon.  member  proposed  a  vote  of  £100  for  the  Isle  of  Man  \nrifle  association  which  is  concerned  with  national  defence,  it  was  laid  \ndown that no part of the money was allowed for prizes.\n21\n \n \nThat  the  Manx  rifle  association  was  concerned  with  national  defence  is  a  \ncontentious  point,  but  Commander  Quine  did  highlight  a  fact  that  could  \nnot  be  denied:  the  TT  was  a  hazardous  contest  and  motorcycles  were  a  \ndangerous  form  of  transport.  However,  G.P.  Quine,  no  relation,  strongly  \nbacked the event and indeed claimed the support of the Manx people. He \nwas “sure the majority of the people in the Isle of Man endorse this policy \nof the Government supporting these events ... Apart from the advantage to \nthe  manufacturers,  these  events  provide  a  delightful  holiday  and  a  fine  \nspectacle for the visitors who come to our Island.”\n22\n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n19\n Debates, Vol. 65, 20 April 1948, p. 664. \n20\n Debates, Vol. 68, 24 April 1951, p.708. \n21\n Debates, Vol. 65, 20 April 1948, p. 664. \n22\n Debates, Vol. 65, 20 April 1948, pp.664-5. \n\nGoing Global: The Growth of Capitalist Support \n149\nInterests outside Tynwald \nWe  have  seen  earlier  in  this  discussion  that  members  of  Tynwald  \nlargely  subscribed  to  the  TT’s  continuation.  However,  whilst  some  of  the  \nrevenue  from  TT  visitors  would  in  a  taxation  of  income  go  to  the  Isle  of  \nMan government, there were also a number of private interest groups who \nstood  to  benefit  directly  from  the  continuation  of  the  TT  on  the  Isle  of  \nMan.   Such   interest   groups   included   the   Isle   of   Man   Steam   Packet   \nCompany,  which  was  responsible  for  transporting  the  majority  of  TT  \nparticipants and spectators to the island, plus boarding house keepers and \nhoteliers,  who  would  provide  accommodation  for  these  people,  and  also  \nthe  small  businesses  benefiting  from  the  provision  of  goods  and  services  \naround  the  course.  However  because  of  the  dearth  of  sources  it  has  been  \nharder  to  examine  the  interests  of  boarding  house  keepers  and  hoteliers,  \nnor of other small businesses. \nThe existence of minute books recording directors’ meetings of the Isle \nof Man Steam Packet allow us to get a general idea of the importance this \ncompany placed on the continuation of the TT to its business interests. A \n1948  incident  that  saw  a  clash  of  interests  between  the  Company  and  the  \nACU  illustrates  this  point.  In  January  1948  a  letter  from  the  Secretary  of  \nthe  ACU,  advising  that  riders  were  asking  for  concessions  to  be  made  \nbecause of the higher costs of entering the TT, was read in a meeting. The \nACU   had   proposed   that   the   Steam   Packet   Company   should   carry   \ncompetitors’   motorcycles   for   free,   since   this   would   help   greatly   in   \nreducing  the  cost  of  entering  the  TT.  It  might  also  have  the  effect  of  \nencouraging  a  larger  number  of  competitors  to  enter  the  event.  Hence,  it  \nwas  argued  this  would  be  beneficial  for  both  the  ACU  and  the  Steam  \nPacket  Company.  However,  the  company  was  not  persuaded.  It  was  \npointed  out  to  the  ACU  that  they  already  donated  100  guineas  to  support  \nthe TT. The company also worried that if they permitted these competitors \nto  travel  for  free,  further  requests  for  such  assistance  would  be  made  in  \nregard to other motorcycle races, such as the Manx Grand Prix. It did not \nmake financial sense to them to transport a large number of motorcycles to \nthe island without monetary rewards.\n 23\n  \nThe ACU did not accept the Company’s decision, and in April 1948 a \nfurther  letter  from  the  secretary  of  the  ACU  was  read,  expressing  the  \nUnion’s  dissatisfaction.  It  was  hoped  that  the  Steam  Packet  Company  \nwould at least see fit to do something to encourage the continuation of the \nTT,  even  if  it  were  only  to  offer  a  return  fare  for  half  the  price  to  racers  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n23\nIsle of Man Steam Packet Minutes Book, 19 Jan. 1948. \n\nChapter Seven \n150\ntravelling to the island. In response to this it was pointed out that if such a \nconcession  were  granted  it  would  mean  a  financial  loss.  The  Steam  \nPacket’s   original   decision   was   therefore   maintained;   although   the   \ncompany’s  financial  contribution  to  the  ACU  was  increased  to  120  \nguineas.\n24\n  This,  at  least,  demonstrates  the  importance  placed  by  the  \ncompany  on  the  TT  to  maintain  business  before  the  beginning  of  the  \nconventional tourist season in July. \nAlthough the Steam Packet Company benefited from the holding of the \nTT on the island, there was little co-ordination between their interests and \nthe  interests  of  the  government.  In  1955  a  letter  from  the  Isle  of  Man  \nSteam  Packet  Company  to  the  island’s  government  secretary  made  this  \npoint clear. It stated that: \n \nWe  understand  that  consideration  is  being  given  by  the  Isle  of  Man  \nGovernment,  the  Isle  of  Man  Highway  Board,  the  Douglas  Corporation,  \nthe  Auto  Cycle  Union  and  other  interested  parties  to  the  fixing  of  the  TT  \nRaces in 1956 on June 4\nth\n, 6\nth\n and 8\nth\n, and, if possible, to keep these early \ndates for future years. \n \nThis company has never been consulted about the dates for the Races and \nonly  after  repeated  enquiries  in  October/  December  each  year  are  we  able  \nto  ascertain  the  dates  which  have  been  agreed  upon  for  the  next  Races,  in  \nfact in some cases we have had to schedule our sailings for the T.T. Races \nblindly and hope that the dates provisionally fixed will be actual.\n25\n \n \nBoth   the   need   for   the   coordination   of   interests   and   the   financial   \ncontribution  made  to  the  ACU  were  necessary  to  maintain  TT-related  \nbusiness in the early part of the season. The advertised price for a passage \non the Isle of Man Steam Packet in 1947 was 6s 9d.\n26\n Therefore, it might \nbe  suggested  that  if  visitor  figures  for  the  TT  week  remained  at  between  \n30,000 and 40,000, which was the suggested figure towards the end of the \ninter-war  period,  the  Steam  Packet  Company  could  make  approximately  \n£13,500  in  the  early  part  of  the  season.  The  TT  races  were  thus  an  \nimportant  boost  to  business  in  June  when  tourist  figures  were  otherwise  \nlow.  Even  with  the  development  of  air  travel  and  the  increasing  ease  of  \ntravelling  to  the  Isle  of  Man,  the  TT  races  would  still  provide  a  large  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n24\nIsle of Man Steam Packet Minutes Book, 3 Apr. 1948.  \n25\n  Letter  from  Isle  of  Man  Steam  Packet  to  Government  Secretary  (Isle  of  Man),  \nSeptember  1955.

There  is  \nsome  evidence  for  the  continuation  of  a  split  between  rural  and  urban  \ninterests in support of the TT, but during the 1950s a consensus of opinion \nin  favour  of  the  TT  races  developed.  However,  although  support  for  the  \nTT  was  much  stronger  during  the  post-war  years  and  Tynwald  endorsed  \nthe  economic  interests  of  its  members  there  would  be  no  TT  unless  \nmotorcycle  manufacturers  still  continued  to  send  teams  to  the  event  or  if  \nno  private  entrants  were  attracted,  and  this  will  be  discussed  in  the  next  \nchapter.  \nGoing global: manufacturers’ interests \nThe  inter-war  period  saw  significant  developments  take  place  in  the  \nsupport  offered  to  the  TT  races  by  motorcycle  manufacturers.  By  the  \nbeginning of the 1950s the TT had become firmly supported by the Manx \nauthorities. The event now had the full support of the Manx legislature and \nthere  was  a  dedicated  Tynwald  Committee  responsible  for  restarting  and  \nrunning   the   TT.   Members   of   the   Manx   legislature   recognised   the   \neconomic  value  of  the  event  to  the  Isle  of  Man.  The  TT  had  become  an  \nevent that was firmly embedded in the minds of Manx politicians. The TT \nhad   also   during   the   inter-war   period   become   an   event   attended   by   \nmanufacturers’ teams from across Europe, if no longer by the 1950s from \nthe  United  States  and  not  yet  from  Japan.  As  Ixion  put  it  in  1950  “the  \ncontrast between this mighty spectacle and the slightly puny and laughable \naffair of 1907 is stupendous.”\n27\n  \nDuring  the  inter-war  years  the  British  motorcycle  industry  enjoyed  \nconsiderable  prosperity  and  the  motorcycle  grew  in  popularity  as  a  mode  \nof   transport,   outstripping   the   motorcar   in   terms   of   both   sales   and   \nproduction figures. In the decade after the end of World War Two and in \ncontrast  to  the  austerity  felt  in  Britain,  the  result  of  the  economy  being  \noverstretched  as  a  result  of  the  demands  of  war,  the  British  motorcycle  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n27\n Ixion, Motor Cycle Cavalcade, (London, Illiffe and Sons Ltd., 1950), p. 147. \n\nChapter Seven \n152\nindustry  entered  a  period  of  relative  prosperity.\n28\n However,  during  the \n1960s  and  up  until  the  collapse  of  the  industry  in  1975,  the  British  \nmanufacturers faced increasing competition from the Japanese motorcycle \nindustry.\n29\n  \nThe British motorcycle industry fared well during World War Two and \nas  a  result  of  improved  means  of  production  by  the  war’s  end  some  \nmanufacturers  were  in  better  shape  after  1945  than  in  1939.\n30\n Indeed, \nKoerner points to the example of Triumph who had much of their factory \nrebuilt  after  bomb  damage  as  one  example  of  this.\n31\n Increased  prosperity \nwas  also  the  result  of  reduced  competition  in  export  markets  resulting  \nfrom  the  destruction  of  the  German  and  Italian  motorcycle  industries,  \nwhich needed time to rebuild and recover after World War Two, and also \nthe  loss  of  competition  from  the  American  motorcycle  industry  that  had  \nbegun  to  focus  more  heavily  on  the  domestic  market.\n32\n  It  was  for  these  \nreasons the Manufacturers’ Union set the motorcycle industry new targets \nin  1945.  British  manufacturers  were  expected  to  convert  to  civilian  \nproduction as quickly as possible, and after doing so were expected to re-\nopen  export  markets,  realise  and  complete  designs  for  new  models,  make  \nthese  new  designs  available  in  showrooms,  and  develop  new  plants  and  \nfactories  where  possible.\n33\n  It  might  be  assumed  that  all  this  would  help,  \nand would be helped by, the restart of the TT races.  \nDuring  the  1950s  the  popularity  of  the  motorcycle  grew,  so  much  so  \nthat  by  1959  there  had  been  a  record  jump  of  200,000  in  motorcycle  \nregistrations,  giving  a  total  of  1,750,000  motorcycles  in  Great  Britain.\n34\n \nClarke concludes, “this was the golden age of the motor bike [sic], poised \nbetween the artisan image of the bumbling family sidecar and a shockingly \nfast  youth  culture  based  on  new  teenage  affluence.”\n35\n Therefore  it  might \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n28\n S.

During  the  \n1950s races were staged for lightweight machines, 250 c.c. machines and \n125   c.c.   machines,   in   addition   to   the   Senior   and   Junior   TT   races.   \nMotorcycle manufacturers continued to return to the Isle of Man, because \nthe  TT  had  established  itself  securely  as  the  most  important  event  on  the  \nmotorcycle  calendar.  The  following  section  will  consider  why  the  TT  \ncontinued to be supported by motorcycle manufacturers and motorcyclists \nalike. \nBy  the  beginning  of  the  post-war  period,  we  can  say  that  the  TT  was  \nfirmly  embedded  as  an  event  in  which  motorcycle  manufacturers  could  \ntest  their  machines  and  also  that  if  success  were  achieved  on  the  Isle  of  \nMan  this  was  good  promotion  for  a  particular  brand  of  motorcycle.  \nHowever,  the  secretary  of  the  ACU,  S.T.  Huggett,  writing  immediately  \nafter   World   War   Two,   noted   that   “after   the   first   world   war   [sic]   \nmanufacturers  generally  plunged  wholeheartedly  into  the  T.T.,  but  after  \nthis  latest  upheaval  it  was  only  the  distinguished  few  who  officially  \nentered the struggle.” He went on further to claim that “It would seem that \nthe  excuse  which  was  put  forward,  that  concentration  on  the  export  drive  \nprohibited   the   maintenance   of   a   factory   racing   stable,   was   hardly   \njustified.”\n36\n Furthermore,  the  managing director  of  Triumph,  Edward  \nTurner, who in the 1920s had been of the opinion that attendance in the TT \nraces was not necessary to further the design and mechanical reliability of \nmotorcycles,\n37\n   maintained   his   stance   after   World   War   Two.   Bert   \nHopwood, a co-worker, reported, “Turner would never listen to the many \npersuasive voices urging him to enter and support Grand Prix events such \nas  the  TT  races.”\n38\n  Hopwood  agreed  with  Turner’s  opinion,  writing  in  \n1981 that: \n \nI feel now, as I did then, that this policy was absolutely right. [Triumph’s] \nstrength  and  reputation  lay  with  the  many  sporting  Triumph  owners  who  \nthemselves  entered  and  were  successful  in  various  competitive  events  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n36\n  S.T.

Hopwood, Whatever Happened to the British Motor Cycle Industry, p. 63. \n\nChapter Seven \n154\nthroughout  the  world.  This  gave  the  product  the  publicity  it  needed  and  \nunderlined  its  reliability,  without  having  the  problem  of  works-supported  \nrace  teams  and  their  management.  Furthermore,  it  left  us  free  of  the  \nextreme  demands  which  such  projects  would  have  made  on  the  cream  of  \nour   technical   staff,   to   the   possible   detriment   of   the   production   \nprogramme.\n39\n \n \nIt  seems  that  the  obduracy  of  Triumph’s  managing  director  meant  that  a  \nteam  would  not  be  entered  into  the  TT  races,  because  doing  so  meant  \ninterrupting   domestic   production.   This,   it   seems,   was   the   managing   \ndirector’s decision. However, other manufacturers did enter teams into the \nTT,  and  belief  in  the  technical  and  publicity  benefits  to  be  had  from  the  \nevent remained. \nA  1953  article  in  Motor  Cycling  noted  the  large  participation  of  \nmotorcycle  manufacturers  in  the  TT.  It  was  stated  that,  by  this  date,  150  \ndifferent makes of machine had been raced on the island and that the most \nsuccessful  had  been  Norton,  winning  16  Senior  and  10  Junior  TT  races  \nsince  1907.  The  three  most  popular  makes  which  were  entered  were  \nNorton,  Velocette  and  A.J.S.,  with  entries  totalling  682,  423  and  404  \nrespectively.\n40\n  There  can  be  little  doubt  of  the  popularity  of  the  TT.  \nMotorcycle manufacturers by the beginning of the post-war period would \nbe  familiar  with  the  location  of  the  TT  course  and  the  Isle  of  Man.  By  \n1947  the  TT  had  taken  place  on  the  Isle  of  Man  for  40  years,  and  it  also  \nbecame the British stage of the motorcycle World Championship in 1949, \nthus adding prestige to the event. The ACU had the backing of the Manx \nlegislature  both  legally  and  financially,  and  the  event  could,  therefore,  be  \neasily  organised  each  year.  By  contrast,  there  was  little  chance  of  a  race  \nbeing  held  in  England,  which  would  require  legislation  to  be  passed  in  \nWestminster,  and,  as  was  discussed  earlier,  passing  such  legislation  was  \nimprobable.\n41\n  Indeed  the  contrasting  attitudes  of  Westminster  and  the  \nManx legislature towards road racing were acknowledged in an editorial in \nMotor   Cycling   early   in   1949.   The   editorial   stated   that   the   British   \nmotorcycle  industry  did  not  enjoy  the  same  freedom  to  run  races  as  was  \nallowed in Italy, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, France, Holland and Germany, \nwhere public roads could be closed for racing. It was further stated that: \n \nOnly in England are the domestic manufacturers forced to cross the sea  \nin search of similar facilities. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n39\n Hopwood, Whatever Happened to the British Motor Cycle Industry, pp. 65.  \n40\n Motor Cycling, 4 June 1953, p. 142.  \n41\n See Chapter Three.  \n\nGoing Global: The Growth of Capitalist Support \n155\nThe fault lies with governments who have recognised the need for racing in \nthe development of bloodstock but which have failed to recognise the same \nneed in the development of motor vehicles. But for the progressive policy \nof the Manx Government and its wisdom in permitting the T.T. Races our \nmotorcycle industry would probably have died in its infancy.\n42\n \n \nMotorcycle races did take place in other areas of Great Britain, usually on \nenclosed  racetracks.  In  1946  a  road  race  had  been  established  at  Oliver’s  \nMount  in  Scarborough,  the  origins  of  which  are  somewhat  mysterious  \nsince  racing  on  public  roads  was  illegal.\n43\n  However,  no  other  race  \nprovided the same unique test as the Isle of Man TT course. Manufacturers \nstill wanted to prove their machines on the tight corners and steep hills of \nthe  Isle  of  Man  TT  circuit  and,  moreover,  by  then  a  lot  of  prestige  was  \nassociated with the event.  \nBy the time the TT restarted after World War Two it can be said with \nsome  certainty  that  most  motorcycle  manufacturers  were  prepared  to  \nforgive  the  disadvantages  of  the  TT’s  location  in  order  to  take  advantage  \nof the prestige to be gained from success in the event. Indeed, a June 1949 \neditorial in Motor Cycling argued that there were a number of benefits to \nbe  had  for  both  the  motorcycle  manufacturer  and  the  consumer  from  \nracing on the Isle of Man: \n \nThe  objects  of  these  meetings  [the  TT]  are  three  in  number:  First,  to  \npromote   technical   development;   secondly,   to   provide   sport   for   the   \ncompetitors and a spectacle for the onlookers; lastly, to supply publicity for \nthe   motorcycle   industry.   The   [1949   TT]   satisfied   each   of   these   \nrequirements in full measure.\n44\n \n  \nIxion, a contributor to The Motor Cycle also reckoned that whilst men \nraced  for  motives  of  research  and  to  perfect  the  numerous  components  \ninvolved  in  a  design,  they  also  raced  for  fame.  This  aspect  will  be  \ndiscussed  later.\n45\n  More  specifically  many  manufacturers  entering  teams  \ninto  the  TT  did  so  because  they  believed  the  TT  experience  to  be  \nadvantageous to the design of the motorcycle. Indeed, articles appeared in \nthe motorcycle press after the conclusion of each TT race, commenting on \nthe technical benefits that were derived from that year’s event. \nMotorcycle manufacturers believed that racing in the TT could lead to \nimprovements  in  the  mechanics  and  design  of  their  machines.  Indeed,  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n42\n Motor Cycling, 16 June 1949. \n43\n This still takes place today. See www.oliversmount.com. \n44\n Motor Cycling, 23 June 1949. \n45\n Ixion, Cavalcade, p.141. \n\nChapter Seven \n156\nIxion  put  forward  the  argument  that  motorcycle  manufacturers  “cannot  \nafford not to race. [Their] duty to customers demands that [they] give them \nthe   best   machines   possible.   This   implies   that   [they]   must   perfect   \nroadholding, steering, brakes, control and reliability by all means in [their] \npower. [Their] experience [was] that every race teaches [them] something \nnew.”\n46\n  But  what  value  did  the  TT  have?  Ixion  also  answered  this  \nquestion.  The  T.T.  races  “had  been  much  maligned”,  possibly  as  a  result  \nof the danger associated with the event, but it was “indisputable that they \ntransformed  the  primitive  motorcycle  from  a  flimsy  toy  into  a  well  nigh  \nperfect  two  wheeler,  in  which  it  [was]  impossible  to  fault  any  feature  \nessential for safety.”\n47\n In Ixion’s mind then, there were definite advantages \nto  be  had  from  competing  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  As  mentioned  earlier,  after  \neach  TT  meeting  was  finished  motorcycle  magazines  would  offer  reports  \nof the races and comment on the success of the TT in their editorials and \nalso  include  articles  commenting  on  the  technical  developments  achieved  \nby  racing  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  For  example,  a  1951  editorial  in  Motor \nCycling stated that: \n \nCollectively  the  races  again  served  their  primary  purpose  by  disclosing  \nwhere  further  development  is  necessary.  The  chain  trouble  experienced  \nsuggests the time has come when, in fairness to the producers, this type of \ntransmission must be improved with efficient lubrication – and that implies \nenclosure  in  light  cases,  possibly  made  of  plastic  materials.  Such  a  \ndevelopment   would   be   of   direct   benefit   to   everyday   motorcyclists.   \nSimilarly   the   tyre,   sparking   plug   and   magneto   manufacturers   gained   \nvaluable data, whilst theories on the construction of ultra-light frames were \nproved in some instances and disproved in others.\n48\n  \n \nThis   comment   might   be   fairly   difficult   for   the   non-motorcyclist   to   \nunderstand, and it is not made clear exactly what knowledge sparking plug \nand   magneto   manufacturers   had   taken   from   the   event,   but   it   does   \ndemonstrate  that  amongst  the  motorcycling  community  and  especially  in  \nthe  motorcycle  press,  there  was  an  interest  in  the  purpose  of  the  TT  as  a  \ntesting ground. It was not just an event designed to discover who could get \nround  the  Isle  of  Man  in  the  fastest  time.  Indeed,  this  attitude  was  \nsustained in a 1953 article in The Motor Cycle, which considered in more \ndetail the technical developments on display in the 1953 event: \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n46\n Ixion, Cavalcade, p.140. \n47\n Ixion, Cavalcade, p.140. \n48\n Motor Cycling, 14 June 1951. \n\nGoing Global: The Growth of Capitalist Support \n157\nAn  unorthodox  three-cylinder  two  stroke;  a  transverse  four  of  only  350  \nc.c.;  oil  cooling  of  the  exhaust  valve;  ignition  by  battery  and  coil;  a  three  \nvalve   cylinder   head;   quickly   adjustable   hydraulic   damping   on   rear   \nsuspensions;  variety  in  front  fork  design;  wider  use  of  two-leading-shoe  \nbrakes; these, and others less obvious, are among the wealth of interesting \nfeatures  of  this  year’s  Isle  of  Man  machines.  The  classic  series  of  T.T.  \nRaces continues to serve its function as a testing ground to stimulate design \nand development.\n49\n  \n \nOnce  again  we  can  see  certain  technical  developments  were  the  result  of  \nracing in the TT. Indeed, TT programmes also noted that the TT continued \nto  be  an  event  which  would  further  the  design  of  the  motorcycle.  An  \narticle  in  the  1952  TT  programme,  written  by  the  editor  of  The  Motor  \nCycle stated that: \n \nBetter  chains,  more  rigid  brake  drums,  better  friction  materials  for  brakes  \nand  clutches,  improved  steels  for  a  variety  of  components,  especially  \nrockers,  valves,  springs  and  gears,  more  efficient  speaking  plugs  and  \nignition equipment, better tyres; all owe their development, in part at least, \nto the stimulus of the endless quest for success in the T.T. and other races. \nRacing  is  a  hard  task  master.  It  brings  proud  success  and  disappointing  \nfailures.  But  racing  never  ceases  to  have  its  lessons  that  mean  so  much  in  \nthe evolution of finer motor cycles.\n50\n \n \nDespite  the  benefits  of  racing  that  were  pointed  out  in  the  motorcycle  \npress, not all manufacturers would send teams to the Isle of Man. \nThe   Clubman’s   TT   was   used   by   the   ACU   to   help   secure   the   \ncontinuation  of  the  financial  grant  from  the  Manx  government.  It  was  \nstated  by  the  ACU  that  this  race  would  “improve  their  [the  TT  races]  \nattractiveness and popularity.”\n51\n The Union said it was anxious to interest \na  larger  number  of  manufacturers  in  the  TT  and  were  introducing  an  \nentirely new type of race. The proposed new race was the Clubman’s TT, \nwhich  would  be  four  laps  of  the  course.  The  Secretary  of  the  ACU  \nbelieved   that   “a   ready-made   opportunity   was   afforded   to   the   trade   \ngenerally  to  take  a  close  interest  in  the  Isle  of  Man  circuit  by  the  \nintroduction  of  the  Clubman’s  races.”\n52\n  Entries  were  to  be  made  by  \nmotorcycle club members, not by manufacturers, and the machines would \nbe fully equipped stock machines, with slight improvements, but still with \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n49\n Motor Cycle, 11 June 1953.  \n50\n H.

The  Clubman’s  TT  ran  \nbetween  1947  and  1956  and  was  aimed  at  private  entrants  who  had  no  \ndirect  association  with  the  motorcycle  trade,  but  they  were  riding  shop-\nbought motorcycles. The entry form also testifies to the different nature of \nthe  event  especially  in  comparison  to  the  standard  TT  entry  form  which  \nshows that modifications could not be made to motorcycles, and that riders \nin  the  Clubman’s  TT  must  be  amateurs,  unattached  to  a  manufacturer’s  \nteam.  This  shows  that  the  TT  was  not  only  popular  amongst  motorcycle  \nmanufacturers  as  a  testing  ground  for  their  products  but  also  for  private  \nentries,  or  enthusiastic  motorcyclists  wanting  to  try  their  hand  at  racing  \naround  the  TT  course.  However,  there  was  more  to  it.  Manufacturers’  \nmachines  would  still  be  publicised  in  the  results  of  each  race  and  so  \nsuccess and reliability were still important issues, and even more so since \nmotorcycles  raced  would  be  similar  to  production  cycles.  Manufacturers  \nmight, as was the case with Geoff Duke and Norton, take a rider from the \nClubman’s TT and give them a place on their team.  \nBritish  manufacturers,  such  as  Norton,  Triumph  and  BSA,  enjoyed  \nmixed success in the TT during the post-war period. Norton continued the \nsuccess it had first achieved in 1907, which was due much to the prowess \nof  Geoff  Duke.  Triumph,  however,  was  not  so  successful.  In  February  \n1948  Triumph  released  the  500  c.c.  “Grand  Prix”,  which  was  a  racing  \nmotorcycle;  its  success  in  the  TT  was  limited.  Each  of  the  six  Triumph  \nGrand  Prix  motorcycles  entered  in  the  1948  TT  retired.  In  1949  only  two  \nof thirteen finished the race. The Grand Prix model has been described as \nbeing  obsolete  by  1950,  and  by  1951  with  only  two  senior  TT  entries  it  \nwas  dead.  This  may  have  led  to  the  dissatisfaction  with  the  TT  expressed  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n53\n Further Report, 1947, p. 3. \n54\n  These  regulations  were  included  in  Government  Office  File  R2701/1/2,  Tourist \nTrophy Races 1952.  \n\nGoing Global: The Growth of Capitalist Support \n159\nby Triumph’s managing director.\n55\n BSA had not been successful in the TT \nraces  during  the  inter-war  period,  but  the  company  dominated  the  market  \nin the post-war period, and was especially successful in the Clubman’s TT. \nThe organisers of the Clubman’s TT had hoped to attract a wide range of \ndifferent  brands.  However,  BSA’s  domination  of  the  event,  with  BSAs  \neventually  taking  up  the  majority  of  the  entries,  meant  the  purpose  of  the  \nrace  was  lost,  and  eventually,  after  1956,  it  was  removed  from  the  TT  \nprogramme.\n56\n  However,  other  TT  races  still  continued  and  manufacturers  \nwere  still  able  to  use  the  event  as  a  showcase  for  their  products,  as  the  \nfollowing section will demonstrate.  \nBy the beginning of 1954 Honda, the Japanese motorcycle manufacturer \nhad been established for around five years. In March 1954 Soichiro Honda \nhad made the decision to enter the Isle of Man TT races:  \n \nNow  that  we  are  equipped  with  a  production  system  in  which  I  have  \nabsolute confidence, the time of opportunity has arrived. I have reached \nthe firm decision to enter the TT Races next year.  \n  \nNever before has a Japanese entered this race with a motorcycle made in \nJapan. It goes without saying that the winner of this race will be known \nacross the globe, but the same is also true for any vehicle that completes \nthe  entire  race  safely.  It  is  said,  therefore,  that  the  fame  of  such  an  \nachievement  will  assure  a  certain  volume  of  exports,  and  that  is  why  \nevery  major  manufacturer  in  Germany,  England,  Italy,  and  France  is  \nconcentrating on preparations with all its might\n.\n57\n  \n \nHonda clearly identified that in order for their motorcycles to be improved \nthey  needed  to  compete  against  the  best  manufacturers  and  at  the  best  \nmotorcycle race in the world. Honda viewed the TT as a test bed for their \nmachines, but was also quick to note the international nature of the event. \nBy  the  end  of  1958  the  Honda  Motor  Company  was  Japan’s  biggest  \nmotorcycle  maker.  It  had  3,000  employees,  a  high-speed  test  track  and  \nwas  gearing  up  to  enter  the  European  and  American  markets.  It  is  not  \ndifficult to see that entry into the TT would be of great importance.  \nBetween 1959 and the late 1960s Honda took their first steps towards \nsuccess  in  the  TT.  Honda  entered  the  TT  for  the  first  time  in  1959  and  \nafter  some  initial  confusion  regarding  the  rules  of  some  race  categories  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n55\n  H.

The Japanese were \nmeticulous  in  their  preparation,  even  filming  a  coin  on  the  road  to  record  \nthe  state  of  the  track’s  surface.  A  correspondent  from  the  Motor  Cycle \nreported, “I was very impressed by [their] bike. It was fantastically fast for \na one-two-five. I could see from the way the team were going about things \nthat  they  meant  business.  But  some  of  my  press  colleagues  didn’t  take  \nHonda  seriously  in  the  early  days  and  there  was  still  some  anti-Japanese  \nfeeling   around.”\n58\n   In   1959   four   machines   were   entered,   under   the   \nmanagement  of  Kiyoshi  Kawashima  and  Honda  motorcycles  came  sixth,  \nseventh, eighth and eleventh in the 125cc lightweight class. They also won \nthe manufacturers’ team award. Following this early success, Honda lifted \nits  first  winner’s  trophy  at  the  Isle  of  Man  TT  in  1961  when  Mike  \nHailwood was victorious in the 125cc and 250cc races. By now it was not \njust   Japanese   riders   riding   Honda’s   motorcycles.   The   brand   was   \nrepresented by Mike Hailwood, most significantly, but also by riders such \nas  the  Swiss  Lugi  Taveri,  the  Rhodesian  Jim  Redman  and  the  Scottish  \nrider  Bob  McIntyre.  By  1966,  Honda  was  represented  in  all  classes  –  50,  \n125, 250, 350, and 500cc.  \nHonda  dominated  the  world-series  in  the  1960s,  winning  not  just  on  \nthe  Isle  of  Man  but  in  other  European  events  as  well,  but  despite  early  \nsuccess,  between  1967  and  1977  Honda  sent  no  production  team  to  the  \nTT.  The  brand’s  representation  at  the  event  rested  on  the  success  on  \nstandard motorcycles. Honda did return in 1977, to an event that was now \ncalled  the  “Formula  TT”  established  after  the  Isle  of  Man  was  removed  \nfrom the World Championship circuit following the refusal of many of the \ntop riders, like Barry Sheene, to compete on the Isle of Man. Honda would \ngo  from  strength  to  strength  during  the  1980s  and  1990s,  and  the  TT  \nwould  see  the  emergence  of  two  of  its  greatest  riders:  Joey  Dunlop  and  \nSteve  Hislop.  Today,  Honda  is  very  recognisable  at  the  event  and  five  \nyears ago celebrated 50 years of TT racing (2009). Honda has provided a \nnumber  of  “star”  riders.  Looking  down  the  list  of  results,  one  sees  a  \nnumber of Japanese manufacturers – Honda, Suzuki, Yamaha for example. \nThe TT has become a truly international competition.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n58\n M.  Duckworth, Realising  the  Dream  at  the  TT,  (Ramsey,  Lily  Publications,  \n2009), p. 23. \n\nGoing Global: The Growth of Capitalist Support \n161\nAdvertising and the TT \nDuring the post-war period, after wartime restrictions were lifted, there \nwas  a  considerable  rise  in  advertising  expenditure,  from  £76  million  in  \n1947  to  £323  million  in  1960.\n59\n  Nevett  suggests  that  between  1952  and  \n1954 the expansion of advertising began with the lifting of restrictions on, \nfor example, food, confectionary products and petrol. He further suggests \nthat  growth  in  one  area  stimulated  demand  in  another,  for  example  the  \nincrease  in  house  building  stimulated  demand  for  furnishings.\n60\n Also,  as \nnoted  by  Clarke  earlier,  the  popularity  of  motorcycles  was  growing  and  \nthus we might suggest advertising plays a bigger role in their marketing.  \nIt  was  also  noted  earlier  that  there  was  a  rise  in  the  consumption  of  \nsport  during  the  inter-war  years,  measured  by  the  growing  amount  of  \nmoney spent on watching sport and gambling on sport. The post-war years \nsaw a continuation of this trend.\n61\n This was despite a decline in newspaper \ncoverage of sport, between 1947 and 1951. The Times, which had devoted \n21 per cent of news space to the coverage of sport between 1937 and 1939, \nnow only set aside sixteen per cent. The Daily  Mail, 36 per cent between \n1937  and  1939,  now  only  set  aside  33  per  cent  and  The Daily  Mirror, 36 \nper  cent  between  1937  and  1939,  now  allotted  only  24  per  cent  of  space.  \nThese  figures  were  reduced  despite  a  rise  in  circulation  or  the  evident  \nsustained interest in sport to consumers.\n62\n  \nIxion  pointed  out  that  “the  motor  industries  are  fiercely  competitive,  \nand  their  success  is  very  largely  based  on  shrewd  publicity.”\n63\n In  1951  a \njournalist writing for The Motor Cycle and Cycle Trader commented, “one \nis apt to think of the TT as a sporting event that the trade happens to find \nworthwhile  to  patronise.  But  it  is  more  accurate  to  consider  it  as  a  trade  \nevent that happens to be of a sporting character...The ultimate purpose of \nthe [race] meeting is the sale of motor cycles.”\n64\n To an extent this was an \naccurate  assessment  of  the  value  of  the  TT  to  motorcycle  manufacturers,  \nand  also  manufacturers  of  other  products,  such  as  tyres,  spark  plugs  and  \nbrake.  Motorcycle  manufacturers  continued  to  use  the  publicity  gained  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n59\n T.R.

Koerner does, however, suggest \nthat  motorcycle  sport  had  two  practical  functions.  First,  races  provided  \ncommercial   opportunities   –   allowing   advertising   and   increasing   the   \nprestige of British motorcycles in foreign markets. According to an article \nin Export  Trader  “past  racing  successes  have  done  much  to  build  and  \nmaintain the supremacy of the British sports motor cycle, and its racebred \nprecision  has  brought  it  admirers  in  every  overseas  country.”\n65\n Second, \nraces  acted  as  a  forum  for  research  and  development  and  the  race-track  \nprovided   the   perfect   environment   on   which   to   perfect   design   and   \nmechanical reliability.\n66\n Improvements in design and reliability still had to \nbe demonstrated to the public, and one way to do this was by advertising \nsuccess in the TT.  \nAgain, advertisements in the motorcycle press, demonstrate the use of \nsuccess  at  the  TT  to  advertise  motorcycles  and  motorcycle  accessories.  \nWithin these advertisements, whilst emphasis placed on achievement was \nstill  evident,  we  can  see  the  development  of  more  visual  advertisements  \nusing  images  of  the  Isle  of  Man  and  TT  riders,  of  increased  use  of  the  \nriders’  names  and  of  the  coming  together  of  accessories  and  motorcycle  \nbrands  in  a  single  advertisement  for  instance  a  certain  tyre  to  relate  to  a  \ncertain   machine.   Advertisements   for   Dunlop   tyres,   for   instance   and   \nsuggest that “Dunlop leads the way again!” and states that this is “the tyre \nwith  a  background  of  leadership.”  We  immediately  see  a  difference  in  \npromotion  from  the  inter-war  period.  The  artwork  presents  a  large  “TT”,  \ndrawing  the  reader  to  assume  that  this  success  was  achieved  at  the  1947  \nTT,  overlying  an  image  of  the  Isle  of  Man.  Similar  adverts  drew  on  the  \nachievements  of  riders  such  as  Firth,  Foster  and  Bell  in  the  1948  TT  to  \npromote  the  quality  of  Dunlop  tyres,  and  others  promoted  Dunlop’s  \nachievement in what is “the Toughest Test”, pointing to 190 successes and \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n65\n Export  Trader,  June  1947,  p.  167  as  quoted  in  Koerner,  ‘The  British  Motor  \nCycle Industry 1935 – 1975’.  \n66\n S.

It \ndraws  on  the  achievement  of  particular  riders,  but  also  places  the  Isle  of  \nMan  and  the  TT  together  by  placing  the  “Three  Legs  of  Man”  on  the  \nmotorcycles  in  place  of  the  rider’s  number.  The  role  played  by  Lucas  \nMagnetos  in  the  victories  of  TT  riders  is  also  evident  in  advertising.  For  \nexample,  the  success  of  John  Surtees  in  the  1959  Junior  TT  using  the  \nimage  of  the  crowds  gathering  at  the  finish  line,  and  the  slogan  “Taking  \nthe Flag.”  \nOnce again we can see that in each of these advertisements there is no \nneed to stipulate that these accomplishments were achieved on the Isle of \nMan,  as  was  similarly  the  case  during  the  inter-war  period.  TT  races  are  \nsimply referred to as “Junior TT” or “Senior TT”, and not the “Isle of Man \nJunior  TT.”  We  can  see  that  achievement  in  the  TT  continued  to  be  \nprevalent  in  advertising  motorcycles  and  motorcycle  accessories.  This  \nangle  had  developed  during  the  inter-war  period  and  continued  to  be  \nimportant in the post-war period but by then there was more extensive use \nof images of the Isle of Man and of TT riders, and more extensive use of \nriders’ names.  \nThe emergence of TT “Celebrity” \nWe  have  seen  above  that  there  was  particular  use  of  the  names  of  \naccomplished  TT  riders  in  advertising  during  the  post-war  period.  This  \nleads  into  a  discussion  of  celebrity  and  its  relationship  to  the  Isle  of  Man  \nTT.  Celebrity  endorsement  makes  products  more  attractive  because  it  \nhelps  create  an  image  of  success.  In  the  modern  day  the  celebrity  and  \nindeed  the  sports  celebrity  have  become  a  part  of  everyday  life  and,  as  \nPringle  proposes,  when  “we  watch  movie  stars  on  the  screen  or  great  \nsportsmen  on  the  pitch  we  are  in  awe  of  them  but  we  also  get  to  know  \nthem. We learn about their capabilities and their characters.”\n68\n Businesses \nchoose a celebrity to promote their product because “in choosing a star to \nbe  associated  with,  the  advertiser  is  attempting  to  gain  instant  fame,  for  \nsome of the glitz and glamour to rub off on their brand and to acquire by \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n67\n  B.

This  section  will  readdress  this  issue,  and  \nexplore  it  further.  Today  sportspersons  are  widely  involved  in  selling  a  \nwide range of products to the consumer, from watches to crisps, and from \nrazors to bank accounts.\n70\n It is easy to pick up a book and read about how \nan accomplished sportsperson has achieved such a level of success. Indeed \nit is difficult, if not impossible, to pick up a newspaper or a magazine and \nnot  see  sports  people  advertising  one  product  or  another.  Indeed,  in  \ntoday’s  sporting  events  promotional  logos  for  all  sorts  of  products  are  \nplaced on the motor cars and motorcycles, in Formula One and at the TT. \nThis  is  a  practice  that  has  developed  over  the  last  50  years.  Today’s  \nFormula  One  drivers,  footballers,  golfers,  cricketers,  tennis  players  -  and  \nthe list continues - are not just celebrities in their own sports and amongst \ntheir  own  sports  fans  but  to  a  global  audience.  This  might  not  yet  be  the  \ncase  for  riders  in  the  Isle  of  Man  TT,  but  they  are  still  celebrities  at  least  \namongst  the  TT  community.  Indeed,  perhaps  as  a  foretaste,  shortly  after  \nthe  2007  TT  John  McGuinness’s  success  in  setting  a  new  record  average  \nspeed of 130 mph was used to advertise Honda motorcycles in the Sunday \nTimes Magazine.\n71\n This section will ask how far riders such as Geoff Duke \nwere  created,  and  indeed  commercially  exploited,  as  TT  celebrities.  The  \nnames  of  other  TT  riders  are  included  in  advertising  from  the  1950s,  but  \namong them it is Geoff Duke who remains the most famous.  \nThe  concluding  sentence  of  Geoff  Duke’s  biography  on  the  Isle  of  \nMan TT website reads: “as legends and heroes go, they don’t come much \ngreater  than  Geoff  Duke.”\n72\n  This  official  TT  website  lists  an  extensive  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n69\n Pringle, Celebrity Sells, p. xxiv. \n70\n ‘A Hundred Years of Sport and Advertising’, Telegraph, 26 Feb. 2008.  \n71\n  While  it  is  difficult  to  find  literature  focusing  specifically  on  the  history  of  \ncelebrity,  it  is  clear  that  images  created  through  the  use  of  celebrities  to  advertise  \nproducts  is  a  campaign  particularly  well  used  in  the  advertising  world.

Yet  he  is  still  a  \nvery  well-known  rider.  Duke’s  career  is  impressive.  His  success  in  the  \nClubman’s  TT  in  1949  paved  the  way  for  further  achievement  during  the  \n1950s,  when  he  rode  for  Norton  and  then  the  Italian  Gilera  firm.  He  was  \nthe  first  rider  to  wear  one-piece  leathers,  which  became  a  distinguishing  \nmark. He also won the Seagrave Trophy in 1951, Sportsman of the Year in \n1952\n73\n and he was awarded an MBE in 1953, a year celebrated also for the \nQueen’s Coronation, the ascent of Everest by Hilary and Tensing and the \nso called Stanley Matthews Cup Final. He recorded the first 100 mph lap \nof the TT course in 1955. After retiring, Duke would become a member of \nthe  Isle  of  Man’s  Tourist  Board  Race  Committee  and  he  played  a  part  in  \nthe    discussion    surrounding    the    future    of    the    TT    when    World    \nChampionship  status  was  threatened  in  the  mid-1970s.\n74\n I  was  also \nreminded  of  his  success  and  popularity  by  the  presence  of  a  1976  \nadvertisement  in  The  Isle  of  Man  Weekly  Times  that  used  an  image  of  \nGeoff  Duke  to  promote  the  Whitestone  Garage  Ltd.  and  the  Volkswagon  \nPolo with the slogan “Geoff Duke does a lap and a half...easy!” \nDuring  his  career  the  motorcycle  press  praised  Duke’s  talent  and  \nachievement.  A  1950  editorial  in  Motor  Cycling  commented  on  Duke’s  \nvictory  that  year,  when  he  was  riding  for  the  Norton  team  in  the  Senior  \nTT:  “The  1950  series”,  it  stated,  “will  always  be  remembered  for  Duke’s  \neffortless   Senior   victory.”   This   article   went   further   to   suggest   that   \n“arguments  have  raged,  and  will  continue  to  do  so,  as  to  whether  Alec  \nBennett,  Jimmy  Simpson,  Walter  Handley,  Tim  Hunt,  Stanley  Woods  or  \nJimmy  Guthrie  was  the  finest  T.T.  rider  of  all  time,  but  there  are  now  \nmany  who  believe  the  new  star  will  eventually  be  awarded  that  title  \nwithout equivocation.”\n75\n Indeed, one does not readily remember the names \nStanley  Woods,  Jimmy  Guthrie  or  Walter  Handley  unless  you  are  an  \nardent  TT  fan,  but  many  people  will  have  an  idea  of  who  Geoff  Duke  is.  \nSuch was the popularity of Duke during the 1950s that a reduction in the \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n73\n M.

An editorial in Motor Cycling stated that “as to the \nInternational events, it is perhaps too early to try to plumb all the reasons \nfor  the  falling  off  of  popularity,  though  three  major  causes  appear  to  be  \nobvious:  (a)  a  plethora  of  races  on  the  mainland:  (b)  times  are  getting  \nharder and, (c) no Geoff Duke.” The suggestion was put forward that “as \nGeoff and the Gilera ‘Fours’ would have competed on the Friday only it is \nperhaps not fair to ascribe all the downward drop in visitors to their non-\nappearance. It seems fairly certain, however, that the staggering falling off \nin  ‘Senior’  excursionists  can  be  generally  attributed  to  Geoff’s  absence  \nfrom the races. From all quarters it is reported that the ‘Stanley Matthews \nof  motorcycling’  is  the  man  the  crowds  will  pay  to  see”  [Emphasis  \nadded].\n76\n  This  comment  is  clearly  in  praise  of  Duke’s  sporting  prowess,  \nespecially in the likening of him to Stanley Matthews, the footballing hero \nof  the  1950s  whose  popularity  leads  one  sports  historian  to  conclude  that  \n“rarely  have  so  many  been  entertained  so  richly  by  a  solitary  football  \nplayer.”\n77\n  In  the  motorcycle  press  Duke  was  placed  on  the  same  level  of  \nsporting achievement.  \nGeoff Duke was perhaps not the “household name” that Hill describes \nCompton  to  have  become.  The  fact  that  Denis  Compton  can  be  so  easily  \nreferred  to  as  “Brylcreem  Boy”  demonstrates  his  profile  outside  football  \nand  cricket.\n78\n  He  might  be  seen  as  one  of  the  earliest  examples  of  a  \nsportsman  being  used  to  advertise  a  non-sporting  product.  However,  the  \nsame  cannot  be  said  of  Duke.  Walker  states,  “there  is  little  doubt  ...  that  \nGeoff  Duke  could,  equally,  have  reached  the  very  top  in  not  only  road  \nracing, but trials and scrambling (motocross). In fact, he can very well lay \nclaim to being the most successful all-rounder motor cycle sport has ever \nseen.”\n79\n    Predominantly    advertisements    featuring    Duke    are    only    \nadvertisements  for  motorcycles,  motorcars  or  related  products.

Duke  is  given  prominence  in  advertisements  for  \nNorton,  and  “Lucas  Ignition”  in  which  the  success  of,  as  well  as  his  new  \n“record  speed  and  record  lap”  are  drawn  upon.  A  1954  advertisement  for  \nCastrol  draws  on  Duke’s  success  in  the  Italian  Grand  Prix  on  an  Italian  \nmotorcycle.  This  is  an  advertisement  for  Castrol,  with  whom  Duke  had  a  \ncontract,   which   demonstrates   that   his   name   was   used   not   only   in   \nassociation with the Isle of Man TT but also with other motorcycle races.\n80\n \nAnother  Castrol  advertisement  significantly  includes  a  photograph  of  \nDuke,  with  the  advice  “It’s  risky  to  just  ask  for  ‘oil’  I  say  Castrol.”  \nConsumers  were  not  presented  only  with  the  name  of  a  successful  rider,  \nbut also with an instantly recognisable image. Denis Compton was used to \nsell  Brylcreem,  and  by  doing  so  he  lent  the  image  of  a  successful  \nsportsman  to  the  product  and  increased  its  desirability.  By  using  Castrol  \nmotorcyclists would be using the same oil as a six-time World Champion \nand successful TT rider.  \nBoorstin points out that the “the celebrity is a person who is known for \nhis   well-knowness”   but   that   “the   hero   was   distinguished   by   his   \nachievement.”  Geoff  Duke  might  be  seen  as  a  TT  celebrity.  He  still  \nattends  the  event  and  was  a  focal  point  in  the  centenary  celebrations  in  \n2007.  Yet,  during  the  1950s  he  was  also  hero  at  least  to  motorcyclists,  \ndistinguished  by  his  achievements,  as  were  other  riders  featured  in  TT-\nrelated advertisements. In Sport and Identity in the North of England, Holt \npoints to the cricketers, the footballers and the rugby league players in the \n“north”  who  might  be  viewed  as  northern  sporting  heroes.\n81\n Duke  was, \nand  remains,  one  of  the  most  well-known  TT  riders,  and  he  was  a  \n“northerner”,  from  St.  Helens,  who  enjoyed  considerable  success  in  this  \ninternational event, and other motor sports events, whose image was used \nin  advertising  and  who  members  of  the  motorcycling  community  hugely  \nrespected. Indeed, Duke, who raced in his last TT in 1959, is even pointed \nto  as  a  sporting  champion  on  Manchester  UK,  a  virtual  encyclopedia  of  \ngreater  Manchester.\n82\n  He  is  one  of  seven  sports  celebrities  alongside  \nAndrew   Flintoff   (cricketer),   Ricky   Hatton   (boxer),   Paula   Radcliffe   \n(athlete), David Lloyd (cricketer), Stanley Matthews (footballer) and Billy \nNevett (jockey).

For  example  the  1956  British  Railways  \nHoliday Guide described the island in the following way: \n \nIn  many  superficial  ways  you  can  match  the  Island  to  England.  Yet  it  is  \nnever  wholly  England,  for  its  roots  are  not  the  same  ...  It  has  queer  \nsuperstitions, dealing for instance with the herring trade which was once its \nmain  industry,  and  with  the  rowan  in  whose  mystic  power  the  Norsemen  \nbelieved.  It  remembers  its  witchcraft,  its  mermaids,  its  water-bulls,  its  \nfairies, folksongs and prophecies. It remembers from very ancient times its \nKing-wizard,  Mannanan,  who  in  the  clearest  weather  could  protect  it  \nagainst invaders by sudden mist.\n1\n \n \nHere  we  have  a  description  that  focuses  on  the  more  traditional  indeed  \nmythical aspects of the island’s past. Consideration is given to the island’s \nfolklore,  but  most  importantly  stress  is  placed  on  the  island’s  difference  \nfrom  England.  The  TT,  however,  did  not  have  a  place  in  this  brief  \ndescription  of  the  island  and  in  fact  this  representation  went  on  to  focus  \nfurther on the Norse ingredients of the island’s identity: “On Tynwald Hill \nthe parliament of Manxland is held annually; this is a relic of Norse rule, \nand is the only ceremony of its kind to outlast a thousand years.”\n2\n Further \nto this, the 1947 Isle of Man: Footpath Guide noted that “no conspectus of \nthe  Island,  however,  brief,  would  be  complete  without  a  reference  to  the  \nManx  Arms  and  the  Manx  cat,  which  with  the  Great  Wheel...are  among  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n British  Railways  Holiday  Guide  1956,  (Railway  Executive,  1956),  p.  231.

This  was  a  fusion  of  the  two  rival  place-\nmyths  that  emerged  during  the  inter-war  period.  The  old  and  new  are  \nencompassed   in   the   first   chapter   of   Maxwell   Fraser’s   In   Praise   of   \nManxland,  which  is  titled  “The  Island  Where  Yesterday  Meets  Today.”\n4\n \nHer  book,  after  introducing  the  Isle  of  Man,  describes  the  island’s  towns,  \nvillages  and  places  of  interest  in  clearly  marked  chapters.  It  is  somewhat  \nsurprising  then  that  the  opening  description  of  the  Isle  of  Man  is  the  \nfollowing: \n \nMany people associate only three things with the Isle of Man: tailless cats, \ncrowds  of  holiday  makers,  and  the  T.T.

Only  those  \nwho have visited the island – and by that is meant those who have explored \nits  country-side  and  not  merely  stayed  in  Douglas  –realize  that  within  its  \nnarrow limits the Isle of Man has scenery comparable with the finest to be \nfound  in  the  British  Isles,  with  a  background  of  history  and  tradition  as  \ndifferent from that of England as if it were a foreign country.\n5\n \n \nFraser immediately made clear the contrasting place-myths in evidence \non  the  Isle  of  Man.  She  goes  on  further  to  describe  aspects  of  the  island,  \nand  writes  about  the  island’s  natural  scenery,  its  folklore,  customs  and  \nhistory  and  integrated  into  this  description  is  a  paragraph  commenting  on  \nthe  TT  races,  noting  their  establishment  in  1907  and  describing  the  \nspectacle provided by the event. Further allusions to the TT are contained \nat  various  points  in  the  text.\n6\n  For  instance,  in  the  description  of  Douglas  \nshe  notes  the  existence  of  Governor’s  bridge  where  crowds  gather  to  \nwatch the races.

In  Castletown  she  takes  note  \nof  the  troop  of  boy  scouts  there  who  give  assistance  with  the  signalling  \napparatus in the TT, and in St. Johns she points out Ballig Bridge “where \nin the contest the motor-cycles sometimes leap 30 feet as they tear over the \nbridge.”\n7\n  This  comment  suggests  that  for  Fraser,  whose  book  commented  \ncertainly   on   the   more   traditional   attractions   of   the   island,   seeing   \nmotorcycles   racing   along   country   roads   was   not   an   unexpected   or   \nunwelcome sight.  \nJohn  Betjeman  also  embodied  old  and  new  in  his  contribution  to  \nMoloney’s Portraits of Isles, in 1951. He suggested “the Isle of Man, like \nShakespeare,  has  something  memorable  for  everyone.  It  is  a  place  of  \nstrong contrasts and great variety.”\n8\n Betjeman describes the island between \nJune and September as being packed with visitors, with the lodging houses \n“stuffed to capacity.” He describes how “the main road around the island, \nthe  famous  T.T.  track,  hums  with  ‘charas’”,\n9\n  and  he  then  contrasts  the  \nmodernity of Douglas and the peacefulness of the countryside: “all this in \nsuch a small kingdom, such wildness and such sophistication, such oldness \nand such newness.”\n10\n His final paragraph sums up pertinently the contrasts \non the Isle of Man: \n \nAnd while the dance bands are playing in Douglas and the yellow moon is \nrising in its bay, on the western, wilder coast the herring fleet is setting out \nfrom  Peel.  The  sun  sets  behind  the  rugged  outline  of  the  Castle  and  the  \nruined  Cathedral  and  Round  Tower...Inland,  the  last  rays  of  sun  are  \nlighting  the  winding  lanes  of  Peel,  the  red  sandstone  of  its  church  towers,  \nand  the  soft  protecting  mountains  behind  it  of  the  Isle  of  Man.  Here,  salt  \nspray,  seagulls,  wild  rocks  and  cavernous  cliffs.  Beyond  these  mountains  \nthe dance halls of Douglas and the dance-band leader in his faultless tails. \nAn isle of contrasts!\n11\n  \n \nThe TT sits effortlessly alongside descriptions of the island’s beauty, of its \nhistory  and  of  its  tourist  industry  as  a  further  illustration  of  the  fusing  \ntogether  of  the  two  rival  place-myths.

But integrated into his trip was a \nvisit  to  the  TT  course,  and  references  were  made  to  the  event  as  if  they  \nwere expected by the reader. This again was an integration of the TT in a \nconstruction  of  the  island’s  identity.  Mais  believed  that  “the  excellent  air  \nservice has made the Island so much more easily accessible to everyone. I \ncan see more families from the South discovering the allurement of what, I \nthink, can fairly claim to be the liveliest and most progressive island round \nour coast.”\n13\n  \nOf  course,  the  motorcycle  press  also  continued  to  promote  the  Isle  of  \nMan as the home of the TT races. Alongside reports of the races, articles \nappeared  that  considered  the  other  attractions  of  the  Isle  of  Man.  A  1948  \narticle   in   Motor   Cycling,   commented   on   the   “new   generation”   of   \nspectators  who  were  expected  to  visit  the  island,  stating  that  “if  you  are  \ngoing  to  the  Isle  of  Man  next  week  you  can  be  sure  of  one  thing.  As  an  \noccasion it will be terrific...Viewed from any angle this is the meeting of \nthe year.”\n14\n In 1949 R.R. Holliday suggested ways of making the most of a \ntrip by visiting the other attractions the island had to offer and by taking in \nthe scenery and enjoying long walks in the countryside.\n15\n An article in The \nMotor  Cycle  in  1956,  titled  “Our  Island”  noted,  “The  Isle  of  Man’s  \nromantic history is full of fascination and legend.” It went on to state that: \n \nTo  most  readers  of  this  journal  the  Isle  of  Man  means  motor-cycle  racing  \nand nothing else. But the fact that it was the birthplace of the T.T. Races in \n1907  and  their  home  ever  since  is  surely  an  indication  that  there  is  \nsomething  about  the  island  that  distinguishes  it  from  all  other  parts  of  \nBritain. Where else could 37 ¼ miles of public roads be closed against the \nQueen’s subjects for the purpose of racing? \n16\n \n \nThe  article  continued  by  stating:  “motor-cycle  racing  epitomises  the  \nunique  position  that  the  Isle  of  Man  has  enjoyed  for  centuries  as  a  self-\ngoverning  dependency  of  the  crown.”\n17\n  However,  it  also  went  on  to  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n12\n S.P.B.

We can see, therefore, that the Isle of Man continued to \nbe associated with the TT races through the post-war period, and also that \nthe  two  rival  place-myths  that  had  emerged  during  the  inter-war  years  \nwere now commonly fused together. The next section will look at the way \nthis developed inside the Isle of Man.  \nIdentity inside the Isle of Man \nEarlier it was mentioned that members of the Manx cultural elite were \nkeen  to  revive  the  Manx  language  as  a  means  of  guarding  themselves  \nagainst  the  growing  anglicisation  of  the  island.  However,  census  data  \nreveals that the Manx language underwent a decline and by the beginning \nof  World  War  Two  we  can  see  that  attempts  at  reviving  the  Manx  \nlanguage had been unsuccessful. Possibly as a result of this, the post-war \nperiod saw the beginning of the third phase of these attempts at language \nrevival.\n18\n This was marked in 1952 by calls from Fargher (secretary of Yn \nCheshaght  Gailckagh  (YCG))  and  Woods  (secretary  of  the  Manx  branch  \nof  the  Celtic  congress)  for  the  Manx  language  to  be  reinvigorated,  and  \nappeals  to  support  the  Manx  language  were  printed  in  Mona’s  Herald. \nDuring  this  period  YCG  also  recorded  the  speech  of  the  few  surviving  \nManx  speakers  on  the  Isle  of  Man.\n19\n  In  his  attempts  to  revive  the  Manx  \nlanguage, Fargher made a call for the Manx people to: \n \nThrow  off  apathy  and  disinterestedness  [sic]  and  take  part  in  another  \ncrusade   which   can   harm   no   one,   but   which   will   strengthen   us   as   \nindividuals  and  as  a  nation.  We  refer  to  the  crusade  for  maintaining  and  \nusing  the  Manx  Language.  Join  an  evening  class,  Manxmen,  and  bring  a  \nfriend with you.\n20\n \n \nClearly,  Fargher  believed  that  language  played  an  important  role  in  the  \nconstruction,  or  in  this  case  in  the  survival  of  a  distinctive  identity.  Here  \nwe  can  see  once  again  emphasis  being  placed  on  the  more  traditional  \ningredients  in  this  construction.  The  reasons  for  such  a  desperate  call  for  \n“Manxmen”  to  become  committed  to  a  revival  of  the  Manx  language  are  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n18\n  G.

Census  data  for  the  years  1951  and  1961  \nshows a further decline of Manx speakers on the island. In 1951 of a total \npopulation  of  52,897  (over  the  age  of  three  years)  there  were  no  solely  \nManx speakers and only 355 capable of speaking both English and Manx. \nBy  contrast  52,542  were  English  only  speakers.\n21\n  By  1961  from  a  total  \npopulation  of  46,321  (over  the  age  of  three  years),  there  were  only  155  \nbilingual English and Manx speakers and 46,156 solely English speakers.\n22\n  \nFurther  emphasis  was  also  placed,  by  some  in  the  Isle  of  Man,  on  the  \npromotion of the island’s traditional heritage. Carrying on from the inter-\nwar period, during which William Cubbon had published his Bibliography \nof the Literature of the Isle of Man and was responsible for the opening of \nthe  Cregneash  folk  museum,  the  next  curator  Basil  Megaw  (1940-1957)  \nset about cementing the work of Cubbon and enlarging the Manx museum \nin  Douglas,  developing  Cregneash,  and  opening  in  1951  the  island’s  \nnautical museum, a celebration of the island’s seafaring history. 1951 also \nsaw  the  passing  of  the  Manx  National  Trust  Act.  When  his  emphasis  on  \nthe promotion of traditional aspects of island life was challenged, Megaw \nanswered thus: \n \nA people which breaks all links with its traditions and inherited knowledge \nof  the  forebears  is  like  a  tree  without  roots.  By  the  addition  of  a  folk  \nsection  to  the  museum  we  are  able,  for  the  first  time,  to  appreciate  the  \ncontinuity of development in Manx domestic life from remote times to the \npresent day. \n23\n \n \nClearly  we  can  see  that  some  stressed  the  role  to  be  played  by  language,  \nhistory   and   heritage   in   constructions   of   Manx   identity   during   the   \nimmediate  post-war  period  and  earlier,  especially  those  responsible  for  \ncultural institutions and societies such as YCG and the Manx Museum.  \nHowever,  we  also  see  that  there  was  emphasis  placed  on  the  new  as  \nwell  as  the  old  in  such  promotional  literature  as  the  Isle  of  Man  Official  \nGuides produced by the Publicity Board, and later the Tourist Board. The \ngreat  variety  of  attractions  on  offer  in  the  island  was  stressed  in  these  \nguides.  For  instance,  the  1951  guidebook  contained  an  article  written  by  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n21\n Census 1951: Report on the Isle of Man, (London, H.M.S.O, 1954).  \n22\n Census  1961:  Report  on  the  Isle  of  Man:  Part  II  Migration,  Economic  Activity  \nand Other Topics, (London, H.M.S.O, 1966).  \n23\n S.

Stenning, which certainly represented the Isle of Man as the location \nof traditional virtues:  \n \nDo   visitors   look   for   a   holiday   of   vigorous   amusements,   dancing   \nentertainments,  excursions,  sea-bathing  and  sunshine?  These  are  always  \navailable  here.  Do  they  seek  quiet  seclusion  with  just  the  peace  of  the  \nmountains  and  the  moors,  rivers  and  glens,  the  unpeopled  [sic]  coastal  \nscenery, the quiet bays and the creeks and coves, free from the hurly-burly \nof  everyday  life?  Here  they  all  are.  Do  they  look  for  a  quiet  motoring  or  \ncycling  holiday  not  too  strenuous  but  full  of  interest?  Here  we  can  offer  \nroads,  better  than  the  rest  in  Britain,  passing  through  places  of  surpassing  \nnatural  and  historical  interest,  every  turn  in  the  road  bringing  into  view  \nsome new and delightful vista.\n24\n \n \nStenning here focused on aspects that were not the TT races and by doing \nso  helped  in  the  further  construction  of  a  sense-of-place  that  was  centred  \non the traditional, and not the modern. Such a construction of the island’s \nplace-myth  can  also  be  seen  in  the  1953  Isle  of  Man  Guidebook,  which  \nstressed the traditional friendliness of the welcome afforded to visitors by \nthe islanders.  \n \nCatering  for  visitors  in  this  Isle  is  no  summer  sideline;  it  is  a  principle  \nindustry in which the minds and endeavours of many people living here are \nconcentrated.  Their  job  is  to  maintain  and  enhance  the  island’s  reputation  \nas  a  place  where  the  happiest  of  holidays  can  be  spent,  and  they  take  a  \ngood deal of pleasure in the fulfilment of that task.\n25\n \n \nHowever,  the  traditional  place-myth  stressing  the  modern  is  also  \nevident within this tourist literature, as is the harmony with which the rival \nmyths  sat  alongside  each  other.  Whilst  Stenning  had  described  the  more  \ntraditional attractions of the Isle of Man, he also stressed “the greatest lure \nof  all  in  this  mechanical  age,  a  lure  which  attracts  so  many  thousands  to  \nour nation. For does not this island claim the greatest and most spectacular \nof  all  speed  events...the  Tourist  Trophy  Race?  Where  else  in  the  world  \ncan  be  seen  such  thrills  as  we  have  to  offer  on  our  island  course?”\n26\n \nStenning’s   assertion   was   most   definitely   not   solely   focused   on   the   \ntraditional attractions of the island, but on the modern appeal of speed and \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n24\n E.

This  statement  seemed  to  sit  comfortably  in  Stenning’s  \narticle  alongside  his  description  of  the  island’s  history,  heritage  and  \nnatural beauty.  \nThe  1954  Isle  of  Man  Guidebook  similarly  made  it  clear  that  the  TT  \nraces played an important role in attracting visitors to the Isle of Man and \npromoting the island internationally. It was suggested that: \n \nIn   the   sporting   field   the   Isle   of   Man   is   already   world   famous.   Of   \noutstanding  interest  are  the  International  Tourist  Trophy  Motor  Cycle  \nRaces,  which  bring  together  every  June  the  world’s  most  daring  and  \naccomplished  road  racers.  The  development  of  the  internal  combustion  \nengine  has  been  very  closely  linked  with  T.T.  racing  in  the  Isle  of  Man.  \nWill the island play a similar part in the development of the jet engine, or \neven atomic power for the propulsion of road vehicles? Who knows?\n27\n \n \nThe  Manx  were  clearly  keen  to  represent  themselves  as  curators  of  a  \nnatural  beauty  and  an  appealing  history,  but  also,  paradoxically,  as  being  \nat  the  forefront  of  modernity  epitomised  by  technological  advance  and  \nindeed  by  danger.  The  TT  itself  was  described  in  1954  as  being  “one  of  \nthe most thrilling and hazardous events in the world”, and the excitement \ndescribed  as  being  “high  and  continuous.”\n28\n  Similarly  the  1955  official  \nguide noted that the TT was “amongst the most important sporting events \nwhich  take  place  on  the  Isle  of  Man.”\n29\n  It  was  further  stressed  that  the  \nevent attracted enthusiasts “from all over the world” and that therefore the \nisland  was  not  some  backwater  because  “Douglas  assumes  a  decidedly  \ncosmopolitan  air  as  competitors  and  their  supporters  talk  in  their  many  \ndifferent  tongues.”\n30\n  So  there  still  existed  within  constructions  of  Manx  \nidentity apparently discordant elements, but in tourist guides these did not \nclash.  \nThe Manx press also comfortably combined old and new. The TT races \nwere prominent in the Manx press during this period. TT reports appeared \nalongside   domestic   news,   and   advertisements   for   motorcycles   and   \nmotorcycle   accessories   adorned   large   areas   of   these   newspapers,   \nespecially in the period before, during and for a couple of weeks after the \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n27\n Isle of Man Guidebook 1953: The Isle of Man puts the Seal on Happy Holidays, \n(Douglas, Isle of Man). \n28\n Isle  of  Man  Guidebook  1954:  The  Isle  of  Man  for  Happy  Holidays,  (Douglas,  \nIsle of Man). \n29\n Isle of Man Guidebook 1955: The Isle of Treasured Holidays, (Douglas, Isle of \nMan). \n30\n Isle of Man Guidebook 1955. \n\n“The Motorcycling Isle”: The TT as Part of Manx Identity \n177\nTT  had  taken  place.  The  structure  of  most  Manx  newspapers  meant  that  \nthere  was  no  dedicated  sports  section  and  so  reports  of  the  TT  were  \njuxtaposed  with  local  news  and  events,  as  a  textual  representation  of  the  \nharmony  that  existed  between  the  old  and  the  new.  Therefore,  it  was  not  \nuncommon to find a report of the TT race next to a story about the Manx \nmusic festival or such like.  \nFor  instance,  a  1958  article  in  the  Isle  of  Man  Weekly  Times  reported  \nthe  visit  of  “exiled”  Manxmen  from  Canada  and  the  United  States.  It  \nreported  the  welcoming  ceremony  that  took  place  on  Douglas  harbour.  It  \nwas stated that: \n \nThey  were  greeted  by  the  Lon  Leah  Choir’s  recording  of  ‘Oh  Canada’,  \n‘The  Star  Spangled  Banner’  and  the  Manx  national  anthem  as  they  drew  \nnearer  landing...There  was  also  the  singing  of  ‘Ellan  Vannin’  and  other  \nbeautiful  national  songs  by  a  quartet,  charming  speeches  of  welcome  and  \nmany grand reunions of the quayside.\n31\n \n \nWe are thus given the impression that those responsible for organising the \nofficial  reception  were  keen  to  promote  a  traditional  view  of  the  island.  \nBut, the report of this ceremony went on to suggest that: \n \nIf   the   music   of   church   bells   did   not   come   over   the   water   to   the   \nHomecomers in this early hour there was instead the roar of high-powered \nmotor  cycles  a  sound  as  nostalgically  sweet  to  Manxmen  as  a  belfry  \ncarillon, for  are  not  the  world  famous  TT  and  the  homeland  synonymous? \n[Emphasis added] \n32\n \n \nThis comment demonstrates the belief, perpetuated in the Manx press, that \nthe  TT  races  were  good  for  the  island.  Indeed  the  report  went  further  by  \nputting the old and the new together and by suggesting that those returning \nto the island would be listening for the sound of motorcycles and that this \nsound   would   remind   them   that   the   Isle   of   Man   was   indeed   their   \n“homeland.” The Isle of Man and the TT were synonymous and so a point \nhad  been  reached  where  the  Isle  of  Man  and  the  TT  could  not  be  \nseparated.  \nThis  might  be  taken  further  to  suggest  that  whilst  inside  the  Isle  of  \nMan and within the Manx press there was an emerging opinion that the TT \nwas  a  defining  part  of  a  Manx  sense-of-self,  the  TT  races  also  seemed  to  \nposition  the  Isle  of  Man  at  the  centre  of  the  world  in  both  spectacle  and  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n31\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 30 May 1958. \n32\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 30 May 1958.  \n\nChapter Eight \n178\ntechnological development. The TT was an event that had made the Isle of \nMan world famous. Indeed, in 1949 Mona’s Herald commented: “the Isle \nof  Man  has  the  right  to  feel  some  pride  in  staging  this  world  famous  \nspectacle, as well as joy in the material gain it brings.” That was why “as a \npeople  we  jointly  -  and  cheerfully  we  hope  –  subscribe  to  the  cost  of  \npromotion.”\n33\n  \nIt  was  also  believed  that  the  success  of  British  motorcycles  in  the  TT  \nfurther  elevated  the  Isle  of  Man’s  position  at  the  centre  of  the  world,  \nbecause  the  British  motorcycle  industry  used  the  Isle  of  Man  as  a  testing  \nground  for  their  machines.  Indeed,  in  1949  when  commenting  on  the  \nunsatisfactory  arrangements  made  by  the  BBC  for  broadcasting  the  TT,  \nthe press noted that: \n \nThese motorcycle races are of great importance, and not only for the Island \nbut  for  the  whole  of  the  country.  They  have  made  the  British  motorcycle  \nthe premier motorcycle in the world and at the present moment they are the \nfinest advertising medium the motorcycle has in Britain in connection with \nthe export drive, upon which we all depend for our very existence.\n34\n \n \nThe TT might have increased publicity for the British motorcycle industry \nbut undoubtedly it did the same for the Isle of Man. Mona’s Herald might \nhave exaggerated the feelings of the Manx people when it stated that “we \nlike  to  think  that  even  those  who  have  this  mundane  interest  in  the  races  \nand  their  results  share  a  strong  desire  to  see  the  prestige  of  the  British  \nmotor cycle upheld.”\n35\n The sentiment was, however, the same. Success for \nthe  British  motorcycle  industry  would  equal  further  publicity  for  the  Isle  \nof  Man  and  this  enhanced  sense  of  importance  was  factored  into  Manx  \nidentity.  \nDespite stronger support for the TT in the Manx press, and the greater \nuse  of  the  TT  in  promoting  the  island  in  tourist  literature,  the  fact  still  \nremained that a large amount of inconvenience was caused by the staging \nof the event on the Isle of Man. Roads still had to be closed, and the Manx \npeople would still be prevented from going about their everyday business. \nYet  no  evidence  of  an  organised  protest  has  been  found.  Indeed,  in  1956  \nthe Isle of Man Weekly Times, welcoming people to the Isle of Man for the \nTT,   commented   that   “next   week   the   countryside   of   Manxland   will   \nreverberate  to  the  ‘roar  of  the  free  exhaust’  and  once  again  we  wish  the  \nbest of luck to those men who will provide the amazing spectacle offered \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n33\n Mona’s Herald, 21 June 1949. \n34\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 5 June 1949.  \n35\n Mona’s Herald, 21 June 1949. \n\n“The Motorcycling Isle”: The TT as Part of Manx Identity \n179\nby   the   incomparable   T.T..”\n36\n   This   comment   suggests   that   racing   \nmotorcycles along the island’s roads was an inconvenience that would be \ntolerated. \nCannon   E.H.   Stenning,   a   Manx   resident   (since   1912)   and   once   \npresident of the Manx Motor Cycle Club, to whom the Duke of Edinburgh \nonce referred as the “Motorcycling Dean”,\n37\n was also quick to discard the \ninconvenience  caused  by  the  TT  and  to  make  the  point  that  the  event  \nunited the Manx people. In an article in the 1954 TT programme he noted \nthat – and the language used is indicative: \n \nYear by year we on the Island look forward with the greatest of pleasure to \nthe   coming   of   the   A.C.U.   and   the   attendant   train   of   riders   and   \nmanufacturers. We look  forward  to  renewing  old  friendships,  making  new  \nassociations  which  we  trust  will  last  for  many  years  ...  welcoming  \ncompetitors  from  all  parts  of  the  earth,  welcoming  foreign  machines  (for  \nwe  realise  that  competition  is  the  backbone  of  success)  ...  So  we on  the  \nIsland bid you welcome, and hail your arrival with great pleasure. It is true \nthat you bring us wealth, but to the great majority of us that is no concern. \nWe like to hear of new designs, new devices, new speeds, but all these are \nsmall  matters  to  us  compared  with  the  human  side,  the  personal  contact  \nwith  you  all  ...  look  upon  us  ...  as  people  who  welcome  you  all,  who  \nappreciate  you  fully,  who  hope  you  will  come  again  to  our  lovely  island.  \n[Emphases added].\n38\n \n \nUsing Stenning’s comments we can begin to appreciate the insular point of \nview by looking at the language used in his article about the TT races. We \nshould not assume that all Manx residents were as keen as Stenning to see \nthe  TT  continue,  but  Stenning’s  point  of  view,  which  was  projected  from  \ninside the island outwards to TT visitors, groups the Manx together in their \nsupport  of  and  enthusiasm  for  the  TT  races  and  was  never  significantly  \nchallenged.\n39\n  We  can  therefore  see,  from  the  evidence  discussed,  that  the  \nTT  had  become  accepted  in  internal  constructions  of  Manx  identity.  This  \nacceptance  of  the  event  by  the  islanders  was  particularly  exemplified  in  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n36\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 1 June 1956.  \n37\n This reference was included in an article in the Isle of Man Weekly Times, 2 May \n1958.  \n38\n E.H. Stenning, ‘The TT Races: An Insular Point of View’, TT Programme 1954.  \n39\n  Stenning  also  expressed  this  in  future  TT  programmes.  He  wrote  a  number  of  \narticles  in  support  of  the  TT  races,  expressing  the  views  of  various  clubs  and  \norganisations  involved  with  the  races  and  also  looking  at  the  history  of  the  event,  \nSee  articles  such  as  E.H.  Stenning,  ‘Four  wheels  on  the  T.T.  course’,  1962  TT  \nprogramme; ‘The “Nurseries” of the Tourist Trophy Race’, 1961 TT programme. \n\nChapter Eight \n180\n1953  when  the  Manx  press  defended  the  TT  against  external  criticism,  \nwhen  a  section  of  the  British  press  criticised  the  TT  because  it  entailed  \nrisk, danger and death.  \nEarlier it was shown that The Times had raised such matters in 1908 in \nreaction  to  the  staging  of  the  “four-inch”  race.\n40\n  The  TT  was  again  \nattacked  by  the  British  press  in  1953  on  three  grounds.  First,  fatalities  in  \nthe  TT  were  pointed  out  as  a  reason  to  stop  the  event.  It  was  reported  in  \nThe  Daily  Sketch  and  Graphic  that  on  8  June  “two  more  young  men  met  \ndeath...on  the  37  miles  of  tortuous  roads  which  form  the  Isle  of  Man  \nmotor-cycle T.T. race course.”\n41\n The Daily Mirror went as far as to list the \nfatalities  from  the  past  five  TT  races:  one  killed  in  1948,  two  killed  in  \n1949,  four  killed  in  1950,  six  killed  in  1951  and  five  killed  in  1952.\n42\n \nThese  fatalities  were  seen  as  reason  enough  to  stop  the  TT  races.  The \nDaily Mirror exclaimed, “slap down on the whole show. Close it up”, and \nstated  further  that  “now  with  speeds  of  up  and  over  100  m.p.h.  this  \nspectacle,  once  called  the  greatest  sport  on  earth,  has  degenerated  into  a  \nsuicidal free for all.”\n43\n The Times’ reaction against the “four-inch” race in \n1908 was caused by the possibility of fatal accidents. In 1953 criticism of \nthe TT in a section of the British press was to the actuality of death in the \nTT.  \nSecond,  what  made  it  worse  was  apparently  that  the  Manx  prospered  \nfrom this murderous event: \n \nFour  young  men  died  this  week  providing  a  spectacle  which  brought  \n25,000 people with £250,000 to spend to this small island. Four young men \nwhose  deaths  are  set  against  the  balance  sheet  of  ‘progress’  in  an  island  \nwhere officialdom does not separate their tragic end from the ‘normal run \nof casualties’.\n44\n \n \nThis article in the Sunday Pictorial evidently considered the prosperity the \nTT  brought  to  the  Isle  of  Man,  but  did  not  justify  the  continuation  of  the  \nevent.  Third,  it  was  claimed,  “the  islanders  are  used  to  it  [the  TT].  For  \nsome  46  years  they  have  lived,  slept  and  eaten  motor-cycle  racing.  It  has  \nbecome part of their life.” The Manx therefore should, “turn a blind eye to \nthe  fact  that  the  roaring  modern  motor-cycle  has  outgrown  the  narrow  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n40\n Government Office File, R2701/1/3, Tourist Trophy Races 1953 (IOMPRO).  \n41\n Daily Sketch and Daily Graphic, 9 June 1953. \n42\n Daily Mirror, 10 June 1953. \n43\n Daily Mirror, 10 June 1953. \n44\n Sunday Pictorial, 14 June 1953.  \n\n“The Motorcycling Isle”: The TT as Part of Manx Identity \n181\ntwisting  roads  of  the  island.”\n45\n  The  morality  of  the  Manx  was  being  \nassaulted because they were seen to tolerate death and danger for the gain \nof  economic  prosperity  and  allowed  the  TT  to  become  an  integral  part  of  \ntheir life. \nThe  reaction  of  the  Manx  press  to  this  criticism  was  resentful  and  \nabove all defensive. The event was not defended in 1953 just because the \nEnglish  wished  to  stop  it,  as  was  the  case  in  1908.  The  TT  was  now  \ndefended because it was a distinguishing Manx event that had the support \nof the Manx people. The sensationalist angle taken in reports in the British \npress, were particularly resented. The Isle of Man Times argued that “there \nare  people  in  the  newspaper  world  with  insufficient  intelligence  to  report  \ncurrent  events  in  readable  fashion,  and  they  have,  perforce,  to  rely  on  \nsensationalism”,\n46\n whilst  the Isle  of  Man  Examiner  noted  that  “national  \nnewspaper  representatives  are  incapable  of  filing  a  report  without  losing  \nall  sense  of  proportion.  A  race  without  a  tragedy  or  some  trumped  up  \n‘human  angle’  leaves  them  floundering  for  material.”\n47\n Their  responses \nmay  appear  as  comments  on  the  skills  of  the  journalists  writing  for  these  \nnewspapers,  but  in  essence  they  were  defensive  of  the  TT  as  part  of  a  \nManx identity.  \nArticles  in  the  Manx  press  did  not  ignore  the  fatalities  suffered  in  the  \nTT,  but  attempted  to  deny  the  implications.  The  Isle  of  Man  Examiner \ncommented, “two fatalities on Monday provoked some of the most vicious \nreporting  we  have  seen  of  a  T.T.  race.”  It  was  pointed  out  that  over  the  \nyears  165  races  had  been  held  on  the  mountain  course,  which  totalled  \nroughly  37,000  laps.  During  these  races  there  had  only  been  59  fatalities,  \nand  “those  few  statistics  are  sufficient  to  put  the  story  into  proper  \nperspective.”  This  comment  sat  alongside  the  assertion  that  “there  are  no  \nsimilar  campaigns  focusing  attention  on  the  100  deaths  and  5,000  road  \ncasualties a week being recorded regularly on the other side of the water.” \nThe same article went on to state that it should not be necessary to stress \nwhat is obvious, that “the hordes of roaring motor-cycles going round the \nfamous circuit day and night are music to the ears of everyone who has the \nIsland’s  interests  at  heart.”\n48\n  These  comments  were  in  defence  of  a  TT,  \nwhich had become part of Manx life and a Manx sense of identity.  \nIn  the  face  of  the  1953  criticism  The  Isle  of  Man  Weekly  Times \nsummed up what it believed to be the general feeling in the island towards \nthe continuation of the TT: \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n45\n Sunday Pictorial, 14 June 1953. \n46\n The Isle of Man Times, 10 June 1953. \n47\n Isle of Man Examiner, 12 June 1953. \n48\n Isle of Man Examiner, 12 June 1953. \n\nChapter Eight \n182\nWhatever  happens  in  the  future,  the  Isle  of  Man  people  will  take  pride  in  \nthe  fact  they  were  able  to  place  a  course  at  the  disposal  of  organisers  for  \nmotor  cycle  races  which  undoubtedly  did  much  to  develop  the  internal  \ncombustion engine; which did much to make the Spitfire possible in those \ndread and dreary days of 1940, which has brought fame to some and given \nsatisfaction to others, but which most regretfully has brought tragedy, too, \nin its train.  \n \nThese  people  who  write  horrific  articles  in  which  they  describe  the  Manx  \nas a people who think blood well shed so long as it lines their pockets with \nmoney  forget  one  thing:  They  forget  many  of  us  know  the  men  who  race  \nhere: that their fortunes are our concern, and that we regret the death of any \none of them as we would regret the passing of a friend.\n49\n \n \nThere  was  then  a  general  defence  of  the  TT  not  only  because  of  an  \nunsporting  attempt  by  the  English  to  dictate  to  the  Manx  people.  The  TT  \nwas  defended  because  it  had  become  by  1953,  as  earlier  and  later,  fully  \nincorporated into Manx identity, something to be defended because of that \nsense of “who we are”: the parallel defence of bull-fighting by the Spanish \nagainst  external  critics  comes  readily  to  mind.  The  reaction  of  the  Manx  \npress  to  sensationalist  reports;  the  lack  of  notice  taken  by  the  Manx  \nlegislature to this criticism; and the continuation of the event show that the \nTT had become firmly embedded within a Manx sense-of-self.  \nAfter  1945,  the  island  continued  to  promote  its  Celtic  and  Norse  \nheritage,  its  natural  beauty  and  its  distinctive  history.  However,  in  both  \nexternal   and   internal   representations   of   the   island   these   different   \ningredients  were  placed  alongside  each  other  and  combined.  The  TT  had  \nbeen accepted as part of Manx identity, and it had a definite role to play in \nconstructions  of  a  Manx  sense-of-self.  Most  importantly  and  with  greater  \nemphasis,  the  TT  also  put  the  Isle  of  Man  on  a  world  stage.  Symbols  of  \nManx  identity,  which  by  now  most  definitely  included  the  TT,  sat  \nharmoniously  alongside  one  another.  Motorcycle  racing,  which  had  been  \nimposed  on  the  island  and  the  islanders  but  which  had  been  gradually  \naccepted  during  the  inter-war  period,  was  now  firmly  ingrained  in  the  \nisland’s place-myth alongside the island’s natural beauty and its distinctive \nhistory and heritage. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n49\nIsle of Man Weekly Times, 20 June 1953. \n\n“The Motorcycling Isle”: The TT as Part of Manx Identity \n183\nConclusion to Part Three \nWhat  began  as  an  imposition  by  the  lieutenant  governor  before  1914  \nand  became  an  imposition  led  by  Douglas  based  politicians  and  interest  \ngroups  during  the  1920s  became,  in  the  years  after  World  War  Two,  an  \nevent  that  was  supported  by  the  Manx  legislature  and  endorsed  by  \nmembers  of  Tynwald.  During  this  period  we  can  see  the  passing  of  \nsupportive legislation, the delegation of the orgnanisation of the TT to the \nTourist Board and the continuation and development of the belief that the \nTT was beneficial to the Manx economy. In addition, the TT continued to \nbe  attended  by  some  motorcycle  manufacturers’  teams  and  the  new  \nClubman’s  TT  increased  its  popularity  by  giving  private  entrants  that  \nchance  to  race  on  the  island.  It  was  also  during  this  period  that  the  TT  \nwould  become  a  more  ‘global’  event  attracting  teams  and  riders  from  as  \nfar afield as Japan and New Zealand. The continued support of the Manx \nlegislature,  the  growing  economic  value  of  the  TT  and  the  established  \nrepresentation of the Isle of Man as a place for motorcycle races, were all \nelements  that  contributed  to  the  further  embedding  of  the  TT  in  the  \nconstruction of a Manx identity or a Manx sense-of-self and contributed to \nthe  continuation  of  the  TT  after  World  War  Two  and  in  subsequent  \ndecades. \n\n\u0003\nCHAPTER NINE \nT\nAKING THE CHEQUERED FLAG? \n \n \n \nIn 2014 John McGuinness was inducted into the Motor Sport magazine \nHall of Fame, along with motor racing greats Alain Prost, James Hunt and \nRoss  Brawn.  In  recognition  of  his  20  wins  at  the  Isle  of  Man  TT,  he  \nreceived  his  award  from  John  Surtees.  Recently  the  TT  has  once  again  \nbegun to gain greater publicity outside of the Isle of Man. The 2011 film \nTT: Closer to the Edge was shown at cinemas nationwide (to considerable \nacclaim).  TT  riders  such  as  Guy  Martin  and  John  McGuinness  have  \nbecome  household  names.  There  are  a  number  of  documentaries  on  \nnational  television  that  follow  a  now  familiar  fly-on-the-wall  style  in  the  \nbuild up to the event. It is much easier to follow the outcomes of the two \nweeks on motorcycle racing on the Isle of Man without having to make the \ninevitably expensive trip to the island. Such is the continued popularity of \nthe TT if you want to visit the Isle of Man in June you need to make your \nplans a year in advance. \nTwo international sporting events were established at the beginning of \nthe  twentieth  century:  the  Isle  of  Man  TT  motorcycle  races  and  the  Tour \nde France bicycle race. Both are subject to their share of controversy, but \nboth continue to be supported by the communities that host the event, and \nbecause  they  are  an  integral  part  of  a  “national  identity.”  The  year  2007  \nmarked  the  centenary  of  the  Isle  of  Man  TT  races,  and  so  the  event  has  \ncontinued  to  be  an  almost  constant  part  of  twentieth  and  twenty-first  \ncentury Manx history.\nͳ\n The only time the TT has not been run was during \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n \n1\n  Huddersfield  University  Business  School  celebrated  the  TT’s  centenary  by  \norganising  a  conference,  ‘The  Isle  of  Man  TT  Races:  Heritage,  Place  and  Spirit’,  \nbetween 28 and 30 May 2007. Papers presented at this conference were published \nin   a   special   edition   of   the   International   Journal   of   Motorcycle   Studies: \nhttp://ijms.nova.edu.  An  article  summarising  the  main  points  of  this  work  was  \npublished in the International Journal of Motorcycle Studies. See S.

In the light of what \nthe TT has become - a large scale international event commonly associated \nwith speed, danger and death - this book has set out to explain the origins \nof the TT and also, more importantly, why the TT was not stopped despite \neasy opportunities to do so in 1914 and 1939, for example, after the event \nhad been disrupted by war. The Manx authorities might also have given in \nto external criticism in, for example, 1908 and 1953 but they did not. Even \nin  1927  the  death  of  a  rider  did  not  call  a  halt  to  the  TT,  but  instead  \nprompted  the  passage  of  legislation  intended  only  to  improve  safety  for  \ncompetitors when practising for the main event. Thus, by the 1960s the TT \nhad become securely established in the island’s politics, and it continues to \nbe supported today despite criticism from outside. After the loss of World \nChampionship   status   in   1976,   the   continuation   of   the   TT   was   still   \nendorsed  by  members  of  the  Manx  legislature.  In  a  1976  debate  in  \nTynwald the Speaker of the House of Keys proposed that the chairman of \nthe   Tourist   Board   should   enquire   into   its   future,   “in   view   of   the   \nwidespread   concern   felt   by   motorcycling   enthusiasts   throughout   the   \nworld.”  The  chairman  of  the  Tourist  Board  was  adamant  in  his  response:  \n“I  would  never  submit  to  pressure  from  inside  or  outside  the  Island  to  \nabandon the magnificent mountain circuit.”\nʹ\n  \nIndeed,  a  1976  letter  to  the  editor  contained  in  the  Isle  of  Man  \nExaminer  asked:  “Will  someone  tell  me  what  has  the  T.T.  been  but  the  \ngreatest  endurance  of  man  and  machine  in  the  whole  world.”\n 3\n The  letter \nwent on to suggest that, should the races be cancelled, in the next year Isle \nof Man TT arrivals would be down 65-70, and the season would then start \nin  the  first  week  of  July.  This  was  “in  short  a  devastating  blow  to  the  \nIsland.”  Further  confirmation  of  the  event’s  status  in  this  edition  of  the  \nnewspaper: “It is surely the unique nature of the course which attracts the \nthousands  of  riders  and  enthusiasts  to  the  Island.  The  evidence  is  here  \nnow.  The  main  championship  contenders  have  not  been  here  this  week,  \nbut  the  entry  has  been  terrific  and  the  crowd  bigger  than  ever.  Whatever  \nhappens, hands off the TT course. Short circuits are two a penny. We are \ncertain no one would come here for races on one!”\n4\n By the late 1970s then, \nthe  TT  had  become  firmly  ingrained  and  supported  as  part  of  a  Manx  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n2\n Manx Debates, Vol. 93, 15 June 1976, p.

Similarly,  in  2008  the  Manx  legislature  continued  to  support  the  \ncontinuation of the TT after strong criticism following fatalities in 2007.\nͷ\n \n \nThe discussion of how and why the TT has continued over the past 100 \nyears  has  been  structured  around  three  themes  dealing  with  politics,  \neconomics  and  national  identity.  The  theme  of  politics  addressed  the  \nquestion of how the TT was established and sustained on the Isle of Man \nand it has shown that political history matters in understanding the origins \nand  continuation  of  the  TT.  I  have  demonstrated  that  motor  racing  was  \nimposed on the Manx legislature, and therefore on the Manx people, by an \nauthoritative   lieutenant   governor.   Comparisons   with   the   moves   that   \nlegalised  an  international  motorcar  race  in  Ireland  in  1903  were  made  \nbecause this set a precedent for Manx legislation in 1904. What cannot be \ndoubted  is  that  legislation  that  authorised  motorcar  races  on  the  island,  \npaved the way for the motorcycle TT races held on the Isle of Man in 1907 \nand thereafter to 1914.  \nHowever,  between  the  wars,  following  constitutional  reforms,  members  \nof Tynwald now offered their backing for the TT’s continuation. Members \nof  the  Legislative  Council  and  the  House  of  Keys  were  able  to  express  \nsupport  for  the  TT  in  more  open  and  transparent  debates  in  Tynwald  and  \nthis led to the embedding of more widespread political support for the TT \nand the passing of supportive legislation. This was a result of the changing \nstructure  and  practice  of  government  in  the  island.  Further  political  \nsupport  was  demonstrated  by  the  endorsement  of  Hill’s  initiative  in  1929  \nfor a financial grant to be given to the ACU to allow the TT to continue on \nthe  Isle  of  Man.  This  meant  that  after  World  War  Two,  there  was  little  \ndoubt  that  the  TT  would  be  restarted  on  the  Isle  of  Man,  because  of  the  \npolitical  support  that  existed  in  Tynwald.  So  after  World  War  Two,  there  \nwas  a  further  consolidation  of  political  support  for  the  TT.  The  TT  was  \nnot,  therefore,  an  event  imposed  on  the  Manx  people  since  there  was  \ncertainly  strong  support  for  the  event  amongst  elected  members  of  the  \nManx  legislature.  Political  endorsement  of  the  TT  was  demonstrated,  for  \nexample,  by  the  re-election  of  the  Tynwald  Motor  Races  Committee  in  \n1946  and  by  the  unanimous  support  for  the  annual  renewal  of  legislation  \nand the government’s financial grant to the ACU. By the end of the 1950s \npolitical  support  for  the  TT  was  confirmed,  and  this,  as  indicated  earlier,  \nhas been sustained into the present day. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n5\n  This  matter  was  widely  discussed  in  the  Manx  press  and  it  was  made  clear  that  \ndespite  the  publishing  of  a  report  which  concluded  that  health  and  safety  had  not  \nbe adhered to by those policing the course, it was clear that the Manx government \nwere not going to end the TT.  \n\nTaking the Chequered Flag? \n \n187\nBy  the  1960s  then,  Manx  interest  groups  and  ultimately  the  Manx  \npeople  had  come  to  accept  and  indeed  welcome  the  legislation,  which  \nallowed  the  TT  to  continue.  There  continues  to  be  no  organised  protest  \nagainst  the  TT’s  continuation,  an  absence  that  has  been  noted  throughout  \nthis work. Only occasional rumbles have been unearthed. True, expressions \nof active public support have been largely confined to anecdotal evidence \nfound  in  the  Manx  press.  In  1988,  however,  an  article  included  in  The \nScottish Geographical Magazine assessed residents’ opinions of the Manx \nTT  races  and  concluded  that  the  event  was  “not  considered  excessively  \ndisruptive  by  the  Manx  population.”\n͸\n  The  investigation  asked  residents  \nwhether  they  personally  enjoyed  TT  week  and  for  their  views  on  its  \npromotion  and  its  economic  impact  and  whether  they  found  it  disruptive.  \nThe  results  of  this  survey  can  be  seen  in  appendix  one.  Interestingly  they  \nwere  also  asked  whether  the  TT  generated  “national  feeling.”  Three  \nstatements  were  put  to  Manx  residents:  first,  “the  TT  races  create  a  \nnational  feeling”,  second,  “in  my  experience  most  Islanders  welcome  the  \nTT  races”,  and  third,  “the  TT  races  are  an  essential  part  of  the  Island’s  \ntwentieth-century  heritage.”  A  total  of  500  residents  were  asked  if  they  \nagreed or disagreed with these statements. Seventy-four per cent agreed or \nstrongly agreed that the TT created national feeling, 78 per cent agreed or \nstrongly  agreed  that  most  islanders  welcomed  the  TT  and  85  per  cent  \nagreed  or  strongly  agreed  that  the  TT  was  part  of  the  island’s  twentieth-\ncentury  heritage.\n͹\n  Clearly,  there  was  a  strong  body  of  public  opinion  in  \nfavour   of   the   TT.   Only   two   per   cent   strongly   disagreed   with   the   \nstatements.  Although  in  the  past  the  Manx  people  had  not  been  given  \ndirectly  the  chance  to  express  their  opinions  this  poll  demonstrated  that  \ncertainly by 1988 there was still much support for the continuation of the \nevent amongst the Manx people.  \nThroughout  the  twentieth  century  the  TT  became  an  integral  part  of  \nManx  identity  and  an  important  part  of  the  way  the  island  is  marketed  to  \noutsiders,  as  we  have  seen  above.  Yet,  one  question  still  remains:  that  is  \nwhy  the  TT  continues  to  be  tolerated  by  the  Manx.  It  is  undoubtedly  an  \nevent  that  causes  disruption  to  the  local  community.  Indeed,  in  2006  \n52.4%  of  residents  were  born  outside  of  the  Isle  of  Man,  suggesting  that  \nsome  protest  against  the  inconvenience  of  the  race  might  be  expected.\n8\n It \nis difficult to fully understand what the ‘man-on-the-street’ feels about the \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n6\n R. Prentice, ‘The Manx TT Races and Residents’ Views: A Case Study of Doxy’s \n“Irridex”’, Scottish Geographical Magazine, 107 (1988), pp. 155-160.  \n7\n Prentice, ‘The Manx TT Races and Residents’ Views’, p.156. \n8\n 2009 Digest of Economic and Social Statistics, (Economic Affairs Division, Isle \nof Man Treasury). \n\nChapter Nine \n188\ncontinuation  of  the  TT;  there  is  no  way  to  really  understand  how  greatly  \nthe beer sellers, ice-cream sellers or proprietors of campsites believed that \nthe  TT  offered  them  an  economic  advantage,  which  has  been  the  case  \nthroughout  the  TT’s  history.  This  is  data  that  has  simply  not  been  \nrecorded.  \nSo in order to summarise how far public opinion had developed since \nPrentice’s  1988  survey,  I  carried  out  a  similar  survey.  1,292  people  took  \nthe  survey:  779  or  60.9%  of  the  respondents  were  Manx  residents;  40.8  \nper  cent  of  participants  were  aged  between  20  and  39  and  44.7%  aged  \nbetween 40 and 59. Only 2% were aged between 0 and 19, 11.8% 60 to 79 \nand  0.4%  80  or  older.  The  majority  of  participants,  64.7%  were  male,  \nmeaning the other 35.3% were female. Of the 779 initial respondents, 738 \nrecorded  their  place  of  residence.  177  (24%)  lived  inside  the  TT  course  \nand  561  (76%)  lived  outside  the  TT  course.  Surprisingly  a  large  majority  \nof participants lived in the north of the island.  \nThe  survey  was  designed  to  be  a  way  to  get  some  idea  of  how  both  \nManx  residents  and  some  non-residents  viewed  the  TT  and  to  ask  further  \nhow important a part of Manx identity residents believe the TT to be and \nthe following statements were proposed: \n \n1) Most islanders welcome the TT races \n2) The TT races are good for the Manx economy \n3) The TT races bring the Island good publicity \n4) The TT races are a significant inconvenience to Islanders \n5) The TT races disrupt the peacefulness of the Island \n6) The TT races are dangerous \n7) The TT races are an important ingredient in Manx identity \n8) The TT races create a national feeling \n9) The  TT  races  are  an  important  part  of  the  island’s  21\nst\n  century  \nheritage \n10) Without the TT the Isle of Man would lose a distinctive part of its \nidentity \nThese  were  opinion  statements,  and  participants  were  asked  if  they  \nstrongly  agreed,  agreed,  disagreed  or  strongly  disagreed  with  a  particular  \nstatement or if they had no opinion (an opinion which only a small amount \nof people chose).  \nThe results of the survey are represented in appendix one, below. From \nthe results it can be suggested that there continues to be strong support and \ncommitment  towards  the  TT  from  a  majority  of  Manx  residents.  In  this  \nrespect  little  has  changed  since  Prentice  published  his  research  in  1988  –  \nand  this  still  remains  the  only  comparable  data  available.  The  figures  are  \n\nTaking the Chequered Flag? \n \n189\nstrikingly similar. For example, 78.8% of participants in the online survey \nagreed  that  islanders  welcomed  the  TT;  Prentice  calculated  this  figure  to  \nbe  78%.  79%  of  participants  believed  the  TT  was  good  for  the  Manx  \neconomy; Prentice’s figure was 83%. However, where the continuation of \nthe  TT  comes  into  question  the  figures  differ  slightly.  My  survey  showed  \nthat  72.7%  of  residents  who  responded  disagreed  that  the  TT  should  be  \nended,  whereas  Prentice’s  figure  was  closer  to  90%.  This  relates  directly  \nto  changes  in  perceptions  of  the  dangerous  nature  of  the  TT.  76.9%  of  \nresidents  agreed  that  the  TT  was  dangerous,  and  only  15.7%  disagreed.  \nOpinion  was  split  in  Prentice’s  survey:  47%  agreed  and  47%  disagreed.  \nBut  there  are  other  areas  that  are  also  ripe  for  further  examination.  For  \ninstance, the balance of opinion between residents living inside the course \nand outside the course was fairly even - in some cases people living inside \nthe course had a more positive commitment towards the TT. The results of \nthis  survey  were  fairly  unsurprising.  There  was  strong  support  for  the  \ncontinuation  of  the  TT  amongst  the  738  residents  that  participated  in  this  \nsurvey.  It  must  be  concluded  that  the  evidence  supports  that  assumption  \nthat the TT is strongly established as a part of Manx national identity.  \nDecisions  made  and  legislation  passed  by  the  Manx  government,  \nalongside  changes  to  the  structure  and  practice  of  government  in  the  Isle  \nof Man, were clearly important to the development of the TT. Thus we can \nsee that politics had a large role to play in the origins and continuation of \nthis  event  and  this  is  surely  also  the  case  for  sport  in  general,  which  \ncommonly  involves  the  use  of  public  money  and  has  public  profiles,  \nespecially  large-scale  international  events.  Hosting  an  Olympic  Games  or  \na  World  Cup  tournament  involves  a  large  deal  of  political  decision-\nmaking. Indeed, Guttmann clearly points to the political agenda behind the \nestablishment  and  staging  of  the  Olympics.\nͻ\n  Political  endorsement  of  a  \nsporting  event  might  not  be  forthcoming,  however,  unless  there  were  \neconomic benefits expected. \nTherefore,  whilst  the  political  theme  had  introduced  and  answered  the  \nquestion of how the TT races were established and maintained on the Isle \nof Man it was the economic rewards, which helped to explain the event’s \npolitical endorsement. The TT’s continuation owed much to an anticipated \neconomic  gain.  Members  of  Tynwald  believed  with  good  reason  that  the  \nTT  brought  economic  benefits  to  the  Isle  of  Man.  Before  the  First  World  \nWar  these  interests  were  minimal  and  members  of  Tynwald  did  not  \nsuggest  until  as  late  as  1912  that  the  TT  might  bring  prosperity  to  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n9\n A.

During the inter-war years, however, the belief that the TT offered \neconomic  benefits  grew  considerably  amongst  members  of  Tynwald.  \nHence  the  TT  was  used  to  publicise  the  island  and  the  provision  of  an  \nannual grant to the ACU. Also during this period, interest groups such as \nthe Isle of Man Steam Packet Company demonstrated their support for the \nTT  with  their  own  grant  to  the  ACU.  The  belief  that  the  TT  would  bring  \nfinancial rewards was consolidated during the post-war years. Thus we can \nsee that economics played a large part in the growth of support for the TT \nraces in the Isle of Man between 1919 and the 1960s. Support continues to \nbe offered for economic reasons up to the present day. When in 1976 the \nchairman  of  the  Tourist  Board  insisted  that  the  TT  should  be  continued,  \nhis  argument  was  very  explicit:  “Our  main  consideration  must  always  be  \nthe attraction of tourists.”\nͳͲ\n In fact so popular is the event, and such are the \neconomic benefits that the Manx are seen to take from staging the TT, that \na 2008 article in the Lancaster Guardian reported that: \n \nTT  legends  John  McGuinness,  Ian  Lougher  and  Richard  ‘Milky’  Quayle  \nare  to  visit  Miyakejima  Island,  one  of  the  Islands  off  Tokyo,  approved  by  \nthe  Isle  of  Man  Government’s  Department  of  Tourism  and  Leisure.  \nMiyakejima Island is looking into creating its own equivalent of the Isle of \nMan   TT   races   to   boost   local   tourism   and   the   economy   following   \nsignificant volcanic eruption in 1983 and 2000.\n11\n \n \nThe  use  of  a  motorcycle  race  to  boost  an  economy  in  the  wake  of  a  \nnatural  disaster  could  be  seen  as  strange,  indeed  bizarre.  However,  the  \nJapanese have taken the Isle of Man TT races as their guide, because it has \nindeed boosted the island’s tourist trade and brought money into the Manx \neconomy.  A  pseudo-TT  race  on  this  Japanese  island  may  well  attract  \nspectators,  especially  when  we  take  into  consideration  the  number  of  \nJapanese  manufacturers  involved  in  the  event  in  the  present  day  and  the  \npopularity  of  the  Isle  of  Man  TT  internationally.\nͳʹ\n  But  it  must  also  be  \nremembered that the TT was established at a time when health and safety \nissues did not overwhelm the organisers and that today’s competition only \ncontinues because of the history attached to the event. \nWe  have  also  seen  that  it  was  not  just  the  Manx  who  believed  that  \nthere  was  money  to  be  made  from  the  continuation  of  the  event.

See  \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/isleofman/content/articles/2007/05/22/firsttimevisitor_featur\ne.shtml (accessed March 2014). \n\nTaking the Chequered Flag? \n \n191\nand overseas motorcycle manufacturers sent teams to the TT because they \nbelieved   in   the   technical   improvements   that   could   be   derived   from   \ncompeting in a TT race. These interests developed most noticeably during \nthe inter-war years, when there was also more extensive use of success in \nthe  TT  to  advertise  motorcycles  and  motorcycle  accessories.  During  the  \npost-war  period  this  led  to  the  exploitation  of  celebrity  riders,  such  as  \nGeoff  Duke  in  advertising  material.  This  exploitation  of  TT  success  still  \ncontinues  today,  and  we  can  see  riders  such  as  John  McGuinness,  being  \nused to advertise Honda motorcycles because of his ability to complete the \nIsle  of  Man  TT  course  at  high  speed;  at  the  time  of  writing  he  holds  the  \nlap-speed  record.  Also  in  evidence  is  advertising  around  the  course,  on  \nmotorcycles and on riders’ leathers. The TT has indeed become more than \na test bed for motorcycles, but the capitalist spectacle provided by the TT \nis  not  yet,  however,  on  a  par  with  such  event  as  the  World  Cup  or  the  \nOlympics Games, which are hugely attractive to producers of a wide range \nof products.\nͳ͵\n Nevertheless, the exposure provided by the TT continues to \nbe  exploited  worldwide  by  motorcycle  manufacturers  and  manufacturers  \nof accessories.  \nPolitical support for the TT and the economic gains to be had from the \nevent’s continuation has led to the ingraining of the TT in constructions of \na  Manx  national  identity.  Over  the  course  of  this  book  I  have  taken  \naccount  of  the  different  ingredients  in  representations  of  Manx  identity  \noutside  and  inside  of  the  island,  defining  what  this  means  and  assessing  \nthe place of the TT within this identity. I set out initially to suggest that in \nthe  years  before  1914  Manx  identity,  both  internally  and  externally,  was  \nconstructed largely around the island’s Celtic and Norse traditions and its \nnatural  beauty;  motor  racing  did  not  impinge  upon  this.  Inside  the  Isle  of  \nMan there was little recognition of motor racing as an ingredient of Manx \nidentity,  and  externally  it  was  almost  only  the  motorcycle  press  who  \npointed  to  the  Isle  of  Man  as  the  home  of  the  TT  races.  This  changed  \nduring  the  inter-war  period  and  the  TT  came  to  find  a  place  in  the  \nconstruction of Manx identity, both inside and outside the island. This led \nto the emergence of two rival place-myths, one still embracing the island’s \nancient  heritage  and  natural  beauty,  the  other,  apparently  discordant,  \nstressing  such  aspects  of  modernity  as  technology  and  speed.  However,  \nthese rival place-myths were fused together during the post-war period and \nthe  TT  thus  became  ingrained  in  constructions  of  Manx  identity.  It  was  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n13\n  See  J.  Horne  and  W.  Manzenreiter,  Sports  Mega-events:  Social  Scientific  \nAnalyses of a Global Phenomenon, (Oxford, Blackwell, 2006) and J. Horne, Sport \nin Consumer Culture, (Basingstoke, Palgrave, 2006).  \n\nChapter Nine \n192\nthen more common to find the new and the old in juxtaposition rather than \nseparated.  The  island’s  identity  therefore  became  multifaceted  and  was  \nbased  around  the  old  (Celtic  and  Norse  traditions  and  the  beauty  of  the  \nlandscape) and the new (TT races and the excitement of the modern). Most \nimportantly, however, these representations did not collide, as might have \nbeen  expected,  but  came  to  sit  alongside  each  other  harmoniously,  as  \nidentifiers of the Isle of Man and components of Manx identity.  \nAs Tony Mason proposes, “sport often  contributes  to  an  enhancement  \nof  the  individual’s  sense  of  identity  with  or  belonging  to  a  group  or  \ncollectivity. It can be district, village, town, city or country. It can be class, \ncolour or country.”\nͳͶ\n That certainly is the case with respect to the TT and \nManx  identity.  Anderson  has  famously  described  nations  as  “imagined  \ncommunities” in which large and dispersed populations are led to a sense \nof commonality by especially the media.\nͳͷ\n In the case of the TT or the Isle \nof Man, the sources used in this study certainly show that the Manx press \ndid  advertise  the  TT  as  a  matter  of  common  interest.  However,  in  other  \nrespects the small space of the island through most of which a 37 ¾ mile \nroad  race  circuit  runs  makes  the  TT  pretty  inescapable  as  a  bonding  \nexperience for a population which has never topped 80,000. Moreover, as \nnoted,  the  year-round  unavoidable  remembrance  of  the  TT  along  those  \npublic  roads  and  in  the  grandstand  in  Douglas  did  much  to  insert  the  TT  \ninto  Manx  consciousness,  along  the  lines  suggested  by  Billig’s  thesis  on  \n“banal nationalism.”\nͳ͸\n  \nSmith  and  Porter  state  in  their  introduction  to  Sport  and  National  \nIdentity  in  the  Post-war  World  that  “the  idea,  for  example,  that  sport  in  \ngeneral, or one sport in particular, creates or fosters a senses of nationhood \nis   important,   not   least   because   international   competition   creates   a   \nseemingly  endless  number  of  occasions  where  nations  are  embodied  in  \nsomething   manifestly   real   and   visible.”\nͳ͹\n However,   Manx   riders \ncompeting  in  the  TT  do  not  embody  Manx  national  identity.  There  are  \nManx riders, and the success of Manx born rider Tom Sheard in the 1923 \nTT was celebrated, but there is not a national Manx team, embodying the \nManx  nation.  Nor  were  there,  or  indeed  are  there,  national  teams  from  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n14\n T.

Much  was  made  of  the  success  of  British  motorcycles,  or  US,  \nItalian,   German   and   later   Japanese   motorcycles,   but   it   was   the   \nmanufacturers  who  were  more  celebrated  than  their  home  countries.  \nTherefore the TT did not embody other nations either. The Isle of Man is \nthe  only  winner  in  terms  of  national  identity.  In  fact  only  the  national  \nidentity of the Isle of Man is expressed and endorsed by the TT. Moreover, \nrather than the Isle of Man being embodied by the TT, it is because the TT \nis consumed  internally  and  externally  that  it  has  become  an  ingredient  in  \nthe  construction  of  a  Manx  identity.  The  island  is  famous  as  a  venue  for  \nmotorcycle  racing.  It  is  true  that  Wembley  stadium  is  famous  as  a  venue  \nfor  international  football  matches.  Hill  and  Varrasi,  in  a  1997  article,  \ndefined  Wembley  as  a  national  monument:  “it  in  fact  became  a  synonym  \nfor English  football  and  something  of  an  icon  of  Englishness:  its  twin  \ntowers were readily identified by millions as a mark of identity, almost as \nfamiliar as Big Ben.”\nͳ ͅ\n Wembley stadium has become clearly identifiable \nas  the  English  home  of  football.  Likewise,  Monaco  is  the  venue  for  the  \nMonaco Grand Prix, and Singapore has recently become the venue for the \nfirst  nighttime  Formula  One  race.\nͳͻ\n  These  are  certainly  internationally  \nrecognised  venues  where  sporting  events  take  place.  None,  however,  can  \nmarket themselves the same way that the Isle of Man projects itself as the \nvenue  for  a  unique  international  motorcycle  road  race.  The  sport  and  the  \nplace   embrace   each   other   and   constitute   a   distinctive   element   in   a   \nprojected national identity consumed inside and outside the Isle of Man.  \n The study of sport therefore enables us to examine politics, economics \nand the construction and consumption of a national identity. We have also \nseen that when a sport becomes embedded in a sense-of-self it is difficult \nfor  it  to  be  given  up,  much  like  the  Spanish  and  their  bullfighting.\nʹͲ\n \nUndoubtedly  the  TT  causes  inconvenience  to  the  Manx  people,  but  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n18\n  J.  Hill  and  F.  Varrasi,  ‘Creating  Wembley:  The  Construction  of  a  National  \nMonument, The  Sports  Historian,  No.  17  (1997),  p.40.  The  original  Wembley  \nstadium  was  demolished  in  2003  and  the  rebuilt  stadium  opened  in  2007.  The  \n‘twin towers’ a feature that made Wembley easily identifiable were replaced by a \ngigantic  steel  arch.  Hill  and  Varrasi,  stated  at  the  end  of  their  article  that  ‘in  the  \nimminent,  end  of  century  re-building  of  Wembley  the  towers  are  to  remain,  the  \nonly vestiges of the original structure. Thus an artefact designed to commemorate \nnineteenth-century empire will survive into the world of the twenty-first century’. \nPerhaps unfortunately, this commitment was subsequently abandoned.  \n19\n An idea of the promotion of these events can be seen at www.visitmonaco.com \nand www.visitsingapore.com.  \n20\n  For  further  comment  on  this  ‘sport’  see  T.  Mitchell,  Blood  Sport:  A  Social  \nHistory  of  Spanish  Bullfighting,  (Philadelphia,  University  of  Pennsylvania  Press,  \n1991).  \n\nChapter Nine \n194\nraces  continue  to  be  tolerated  because  of  the  prestige  they  bring  to  the  \nisland  and  because  they  have  become  part  of  whom  the  Manx  think  they  \nare. The TT has been the subject of criticism from outside because of the \ndanger that comes with racing motorcycles around the Isle of Man, but the \nTT  is  sustained  because  it  is  a  distinctive  part  of  Manx  identity.  The  TT  \nhas thus become so far ingrained in a Manx sense-of-self that if the event \nwere to be ended, this would not just mean the loss of a “sport”, or the loss \nof  the  economic  rewards  brought  by  the  TT.  If  the  TT  were  abandoned  a  \ndistinctive  part  of  the  island’s  identity  would  be  lost,  an  ingredient  that  \nhas, in the past and still in the present, set the island apart from not just the \nUK  but  also  the  rest  of  the  world.  It  can  be  said  with  some  certainty  that  \nthe  TT  placed  the  Isle  of  Man  on  a  world  stage  and  has  become  firmly  \ningrained in constructions of Manx identity and in the consciousness of the \nManx  people.

      "text": "INTRODUCTION \nT\nHE ISLE OF MAN TOURIST TROPHY RACES \n \n \n \nThe  Isle  of  Man  is  home  to  the  most  unique  and  perhaps  the  most  \ncontroversial  motor  racing  event  in  the  world.  It  is  an  event  that  places  a  \nsmall island, situated in the heart of the Irish Sea, firmly on the world map. \nThe  Isle  of  Man  is  thirteen  and  a  half  miles  wide  and  32.5  miles  long,  \nhome to a population of approximately 80,000 people and is situated at the \nvery  heart  of  the  British  Isles,  but  despite  its  size  and  location  the  island  \nmaintains a distinctive and diverse sense of identity. It has its own unique \nsystem  of  government,  the  more  than  1000  years  old  Tynwald  assembly.  \nThere is a well-developed and internationally renowned heritage industry, \nan  established  film  industry  and,  of  course,  an  abundance  of  outstanding  \nnatural  beauty.  However,  if  you  were  to  ask  any  Briton,  European  or  \nindeed any world citizen if they know the location of the Isle of Man, you \nmight receive the reply “is that the home of the TT races?” or be met with \nquizzical   expressions.   This   might   be   an   exaggerated   claim,   but,   \nnonetheless,  over  the  past  100  years  or  so  the  Tourist  Trophy  (TT)  \nmotorcycle races, held annually on the Isle of Man, have helped this small \nisland stand out on the world map.  \nThe start of the summer on the Isle of Man is signaled by the roaring of \nthousands  of  motorcycles  disembarking  at  Douglas  harbour  from  one  of  \nthe  ferries  that  serve  the  island.  Coming  to  the  island  via  Liverpool  and  \nHeysham, motorcyclists travel from all corners of the world to make what \ncould be described as a pilgrimage to what they regard as one of the most \noutstanding  events  on  the  motorcycling  calendar.  Interest  in  participation  \nin  the  event  is  massive.  By  way  of  illustration,  in  1994  there  were  620  \nentries  in  eight  events  involving  572  competitors,  from  20  countries  \nranging  from  the  USA  to  New  Zealand.  Racers  completed  4,137  laps,  \ntotaling 156,089 miles in practicing and racing.\n1\n In 2007 the TT celebrated \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n  TT  media  pack  issued  by  the  Isle  of  Man  Department  of  Tourism  in  1995,  as  \ncited  in  R.

      "text": "Introduction \n \n2\nits  centenary  and  the  popularity  of  the  event  was  unabated,  with  an  \nestimated   60,000   people   visiting   the   Isle   of   Man   during   TT   week,   \ngenerating  revenue  of  £48,000,000.  As  the  Guardian stated  in  2005:  \n“every year 40,000 leather clad bikers make their pilgrimage to what they \ndescribe as the best festival of their sport. It is about celebrating fraternity \nand a way of life.”\n2\n \nThe Isle of Man TT course is composed of 37 and three quarter miles \nof  public  roads,  stretching  across  much  of  the  northern  half  of  the  island  \nand  passing  through  the  island’s  two  largest  towns,  Douglas  and  Ramsey  \nand  through  small,  sleepy  villages  like  Glen  Vine  and  Kirk  Michael.  The  \ncourse  has  long,  fast  straights  and  sharp  bends  flanked  by  stonewalls  or,  \non the mountain section, by sheer drops. The stern test of riding skill and \nsharpness  of  reflex  has,  to  date,  taken  the  lives  of  240  riders.  At  points  \naround  the  course  are  memorials  to  riders  who  have  made  their  name  at  \nthe  TT:  Birkin’s  bends,  Handley’s  corner,  and,  the  Guthrie  memorial.\n3\n \nThese  are  continued  reminders  of  the  immense  challenge  posed  by  the  \ncourse.  In  one  lap  the  competitors  will  pass  through  areas  of  outstanding  \nnatural  beauty,  past  sites  of  historic  interest  and  within  touching  distance  \nof  residents’  doorsteps  at  speeds  of  up  to  180  miles  per  hour,  in  front  of  \nspectators lining the hedgerows to witness the event. It is an event that like \nno  other,  places  the  modern  firmly  alongside  the  traditional.  The  riders’  \nultimate goal is to make it to the end of this historic course. At the time of \nwriting,   the   current   lap   speed   record   held   by   Morecambe’s   John   \nMcGuiness stands at 131.617 miles per hour (mph).  \nIt  might  be  considered  odd  that,  in  the  modern  day,  such  an  event  is  \npermitted  to  take  place.  But,  there  has  never  been  any  organised  protest  \nagainst the continuation of the TT races on the Isle of Man; or none that I \nhave  uncovered  during  the  course  of  my  research.  This  is  despite  the  \ninconvenience  caused  by  road  closures,  the  fatalities  in  the  event  and  the  \nracing  of  motorcycles  at  high  speeds  around  the  island’s  roads.  Another,  \nsimilar motorcycle race does take place in Northern Ireland but on a much \nsmaller  scale.  Similarly,  Formula  One  cars  also  race  annually  around  the  \nstreets of Monaco, and in France public roads are also closed for the Tour \nDe France Bicycle race. No event, however, is quite the same as the Isle of \nMan TT. The event presents an obvious inconvenience to Manx residents, \nbut  also  the  location  of  the  TT,  on  an  island  in  the  Irish  Sea,  remains  an  \ninconvenience for competitors and overseas spectators alike.

This is partly the result of the spectacle provided by \nthe  races,  but  also  perhaps  because  ordinary  riders,  not  competitors  as  \nsuch,  are  able  to  test  themselves  against  the  course  on  what  has  become  \npopularly  known  as  “Mad  Sunday”.  “Tomorrow  they  will  open  up  their  \nthrottles  and  ride  the  circuit  themselves  on  a  day  called  Mad  Sunday”,  \nobserved the Guardian, and “they do it in the full knowledge that it can be \ncarnage, with riders falling off all over the course.”\n4\n \nMoreover,  and  somewhat  remarkably,  the  TT  also  continues  despite  \nthe   deaths   and   injuries   caused   not   only   to   competitors   but   also   to   \nspectators  and  those  policing  the  course.  This  has  not  deterred  fans  from  \nturning   up   or   motorcycle   racers   from   entering   the   TT,   which   is   \nunsurprising when it is considered that one report from the 1970s claimed \nthat “all the competitors ... were fascinated by the race.” One rider declared \nthat the TT was “the finest road race in the world unconditionally”, whilst \na Yorkshire rider suggested more crudely that he rode in the race “because \nI’m  a  bloody  twat,  that’s  why.  It’s  self-inflicted  pissin’  torture.”\n5\n The \ndanger  inherent  in  the  event  appears  to  secure  the  TT’s  place  as  the  best  \nmotorcycle  race  in  the  world.  The  TT,  of  course,  still  draws  criticism.  A  \n2003 article in Sports Illustrated questioned the purpose of the event when \nit  asked  “is  there  a  sporting  event  more  perilous  than  the  Tourist  Trophy  \nraces in the Isle of Man?” It was vigorously stated, “this festival of speed \nis  how  boosters  on  this  tiny  Irish  Sea  island  bill  its  mad  scramble  of  \nmopeds,  motorcycles  and  motor  scooters.  Dead  is  how  participants  often  \nwind  up.”\n6\n  Yet  despite  the  dangers  presented  by  the  course  and  the  \ncriticism  of  the  event,  the  TT  still  continues  today.  In  a  2013  article  the  \nIndependent described this as a race that “defies the nanny state.”\n7\n \nJeffrey  Hill,  in  his  wide-ranging  work  Sport,  Leisure  and  Culture  in  \nTwentieth  Century  Britain  suggests  that  sport  may  be  regarded  as  a  \nprocess  “shaped”  by  economic,  political,  demographic  or  intellectual  \nforces.  Hill  suggests  that  this  helps  to  “understand  how  the  process  of  \nmodernization   affected   sport,   but   it   stops   short   of   affording   any   \nautonomous  agency  to  sport  itself.  The  history  of  sport  becomes  a  \n‘window’ through which to study developments in other areas of society.”\n8\n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n4\n Guardian, 4 June 2005. \n5\n R.

Over the course of this book we will see \na  change  from  a  small-scale  “domestic”  event  into  an  internationally  \nknown  competition.  This  analysis  is  based  around  the  discussion  of  the  \ngrowth of political support for the TT on the Isle of Man; the evaluation of \nthe  economic  commitment  to  the  TT  by  the  Manx  and  motorcycle  \nmanufacturers; and, it will show that as a result of the growing economic \nand political commitment the TT has become ingrained in constructions of \na Manx identity over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.  \nThe themes of politics and economics are easily understood. Under the \nbroader heading of politics falls an examination of how the TT races were \nestablished  and  sustained  on  the  Isle  of  Man  alongside  changes  to  the  \nstructure  and  practice  of  government  on  the  island.  The  economic,  or  \ncapitalist theme explores the way that the TT races were exploited by the \nManx government in advertising the island and further the way the TT was \nan  event  used  by  motorcycle  manufacturers  in  selling  their  products.  The  \nmost  contestable  of  these  themes  is  that  of  national  identity.  National  \nidentity  is  a  term  that  is  necessarily  multi-dimensional.  Any  definition  of  \nnational identity might encompass such aspects as a common language, a \ncommon political structure, a shared history and a common culture. These \nare all factors present on the Isle of Man. It is the plurality of identity that \nwill  be  explored  throughout  this  book.  It  will  ask  whether  the  different  \ningredients  employed  in  the  construction  of  Manx  identity  throughout  the  \ntwentieth  century,  which  included  the  TT  races,  clashed  as  might  be  \nexpected, or if they existed harmoniously alongside each other. Together, \nthe  themes  of  politics,  economics  and  national  identity  begin  to  answer  \nhow and why the TT has been sustained over the past 100 years or so. \nIt is, however, difficult to judge how far the TT races have become part \nof  an  insular  Manx  identity  and  just  how  far  the  Manx  people  associate  \nthemselves with motorcycle racing.

The  subconscious  reminding,  and  the  reason  that  the  \nManx  people  readily  accept  the  disruption  caused  by  the  TT  races  each  \nyear,  is  because  they  are  continually  reminded  that  the  event  will  take  \nplace  annually  as  the  public  roads  on  the  island  form  part  of  the  race  \ncourse; the grandstand is a reminder which is present all year round; and, \nthere  are  countless  reminders  around  the  course.

Robert \nKelly   suggests,   somewhat   spuriously,   that   the   motor-mad   Emir   of   \nAfghanistan  believed  “that  the  Isle  of  Man  [was]  such  a  splendid  place”  \nand  asked  “would  the  British  consider  an  exchange  –  his  kingdom  and  \nwives  for  the  Isle  of  Man.”\n2\n  The  Isle  of  Man  was  not  the  UK’s  to  \nexchange, but this was a nice  sentiment.  Even  in  the  modern  day  the  Isle  \nof Man is an odd location for a motor race. It must be considered an even \nstranger  location  at  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century.  In  1904  the  \nisland was not easy to access and it was costly to travel to; it is, after all, \nseparated from mainland Britain by the often-hostile Irish Sea. There were \nother  more  accessible  locations  that  might  have  been  used  for  motor  \nracing. If the automobile club had in mind hills and twisting roads for the \nearly  reliability  trials  then  they  might  have  made  use  of  the  roads  in  the  \nChilterns, in North Wales or in the Lake District. \nThere was, however, no chance of a motorcar race being held on public \nroads  in  England,  or  Britain  at  this  time.  This  was  due  to  restrictive  \nlegislation and the negative opinion of some MPs towards the motorcar in \nthe  pre-war  period.  Historically,  motorcars  and  motorcycles  had  been  \n“vociferously  opposed  by  the  carriage-owning  classes  and  the  many  \nrailway directors in Parliament.”\n3\n UK legislation reflected this. In 1865 the \n“Red  Flag”  Act  had  restricted  cars  to  four  miles  per  hour  (mph)  in  the  \ncountryside  and  two  mph  in  urban  areas.  Moreover,  legislation  also  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n  ‘Tourist’  in  Tourist  Trophy,  should  be  taken  to  mean  the  everyday  motorcyclist  \nwho  did  not  use  their  motorcycle  for  racing  but  for  making  trips  for  pleasure  or  \ncommuting to work. \n2\n R.

      "text": "On the Starting Line: The Origins of the TT Races \n9\nrequired automobiles to have three attendants, including one to carry a red \nflag  sixty  yards  in  front  of  the  vehicle.  Even  more  restrictive  were  rules  \nthat prohibited the sounding of a whistle by the driver of a motor vehicle \nand those allowing any person on horseback or in a horse-drawn carriage \nto   demand   that   the   motorcar   be   stopped   while   they   passed.   Local   \nauthorities  could  even  regulate  the  time  at  which  motorcars  could  pass  \nthrough towns and villages. Motorcar drivers were permitted few liberties, \nand it has been suggested that the development of the motorcar in Britain \ncame  to  a  halt  as  a  result  of  such  restrictive  legislation.\n4\n However, \nlegislation was amended in 1878 making it possible for local authorities to \nrepeal  red  flag  restrictions,  but  they  were  not  repealed  all  together.  The  \nmost significant breakthrough came in 1896 when the Locomotives on the \nHighway  Act  raised  the  permissible  maximum  speed  limit  to  fourteen  \nmph.  This  legislation  and  the  improvement  in  conditions  for  motorists  \nwere  celebrated  on  “emancipation”  day,  14  November  1896,  with  a  \ndemonstration run of motorcars between London and Brighton. But, racing \non public roads was still prohibited, and although further legislation – the \nMotor   Car   Act   1903   –   raised   the   speed   limit   to   twenty   mph,   the   \nprohibition of racing on public roads was not repealed.\n5\n  \nEarly   motorcars   were   very   much   the   preserve   of   the   wealthy   \nenthusiast,  as  the  first  motorcars  were  costly  to  purchase  and  to  run.  Sir  \nRobert  Ensor  has  suggested  that  at  this  time  “only  rich  men  could  afford  \nthem;  and  as  they  dashed  along  the  narrow  untarred  carriage  ways,  \nfrightening  the  passer  by  on  their  approach  and  drenching  him  in  dust  as  \nthe  receded,  they  seemed  visible  symbols  of  the  selfishness  of  arrogant  \nwealth.”\n6\n  This  negativity  towards  motorcars  was  also  demonstrated  in  a  \nHouse of Commons debate over the speed of such vehicles, in June 1903. \nCathcart  Wason,  MP  for  Orkney  and  Shetland,  was  typical  of  the  voice  \nthat  spoke  out  in  opposition  to  motorcars.  In  his  opinion  “a  few  people  \n[claimed] the right to drive the public off the roads. Harmless men, women \nand  children,  dogs  and  cattle,  have  all  got  to  fly  for  their  lives  at  the  \nbidding  of  these  slaughtering,  stinking  engines  of  iniquity.”\n7\n Although \nWason’s  opinion  was  based  in  his  experiences  outside  Shetland  and  \nOrkney, and he admitted there was not a single car in his constituency, he \nassured MPs that irritation had begun to occur in the countryside because \ncars  were  beginning  to  monopolise  public  roads.  Wason  believed  that  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n4\n Perkin, Age of the Automobile, p. 35. \n5\n S.

Motor  racing  was  \nbecoming  increasingly  popular  on  the  continent  at  the  beginning  of  the  \ntwentieth  century  and  a  number  of  races  were  held  on  the  European  \nmainland,  such  as  the  International  Gordon  Bennett  Race  between  1900  \nand  1905  and  town-to-town  races  such  as  the  much-maligned  1903  Paris  \nto Madrid race. American newspaperman Gordon Bennett had established \nthe  International  Gordon  Bennett  Race  in  1900.\n9\n  As  a  result  of  British  \nsuccess in the 1902 International Gordon Bennett race, the 1903 event was \nto  be  held  in  England.  As  there  was  no  chance  of  a  race  in  England  \nbecause of legal restrictions, the 1903 Gordon Bennett race was staged in \nIreland  in  July  of  that  year.  A  lack  of  success  for  the  British  team  in  this  \nevent led to the first motorcar race being held on the Isle of Man under the \nprovisions of the Highways (Light Locomotives) Act 1904 – a trial for the \n1904 Gordon Bennett Race. What took place in Ireland in 1903, therefore, \nset the precedent for later events in the Isle of Man.  \nThe Irish Precedent  \nWhen  the  English  driver  Selwyn  F.  Edge  had  won  the  1902  Gordon  \nBennett  race  held  in  France,  he  had  given  the  Automobile  Club  of  Great  \nBritain and Ireland a difficult decision to make. After exploring a number \nof  different  possibilities,  their  eyes  inevitably  fell  on  Ireland.  Why  did  a  \nmotor race on public roads take place in Ireland in 1903, when legislation \nprohibited  such  events  in  Britain?  The  answer  seems  to  be  fairly  simple:  \nIreland was far enough on the periphery for this not to be a problem.  \nIn contrast to the opinions of the majority who believed that motorcars \nwere  an  outrage,  the  Automobile  Club  believed  that  the  Gordon  Bennett  \nCup and motorcar racing generally were beneficial to the development of \nthe  motorcar.  It  was  the  opinion  of  the  Automobile  Club  that  prolonged  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n8\n Parliamentary Debates (Commons), 11 June 1903, (4\nth\n Series), Vol. 123, col 699. \n9\n The Gordon Bennett Cup had been designed by American newspaperman James \nGordon Bennett who had come to Paris to found the continental edition of the New \nYork  Herald.  He  was  keen  on  sport  and  became  a  founder  member  of  the  French  \nAutomobile   Club.   The   Gordon   Bennett   Race   was   proposed   in   1900   as   a   \n‘regularised  international  motor  race  to  evidence  the  advance  of  the  nations  in  \nmotor car construction’, as quoted in Holliday, Racing Round the Island, p. 11."

The French motor industry was far ahead of the British. In 1898, for \nexample, the French had produced 1,850 vehicles and exported seven per \ncent of these to Britain. By 1904 Britain was selling two cars per month in \nFrance  and  importing  400  in  return.\n12\n  A  Gordon  Bennett  Cup  race  in  the  \nUK  would  add  impetus  to  the  British  motor  car  industry,  suggested  the  \nAutomobile  Club,  and  would  further  educate  the  public  in  the  value  of  \nthese vehicles. \nFurther  to  this,  the  relationship  between  motor  car  racing  and  the  \nmanufacture of vehicles for domestic use was also highlighted in a letter to \nThe Times by Scott Montagu who argued that the modern racing machine \nhad no purpose and “the rules of motor racing ought now to be altered, not \nonly in the interests of the public and the competitors, but for the eventual \nadvantage  of  manufacturers  as  well.”\n13\n O’Connell  in The  Car  in  British  \nSociety,   suggests   that   in   order   to   redress   this   balance,   the   British   \nmanufacturers  had  to  demonstrate  the  benefits  of  the  motor  car  to  the  \npublic, convincing them that it would carry them securely from A to B; it \nwas  for  this  reason  that  part  of  the  marketing  of  the  motor  car  revolved  \naround  road  races  and  reliability  trials.\n14\n  If  the  Gordon  Bennett  race  were  \ntransferred  to  France,  as  would  be  the  case  if  a  suitable  venue  were  not  \nfound  in  Britain,  a  valuable  opportunity  to  improve  the  manufacture  of  \nBritish  motorcars  would  be  lost  and  the  technological  gap  between  the  \nBritish and the French would widen. Members of the political elite, whose \nnegative opinion was discussed earlier, would need to be convinced. \nThe Automobile Club had then settled on the idea of racing in Ireland, \nbut  it  was  still  necessary  to  first  pass  legislation  that  would  permit  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n10\n Petition  for  Racing  to  be  held  in  Ireland  1903,  (Churchill  College  Archives,  \nCambridge). \n11\n Petition for Racing to be held in Ireland 1903. \n12\n K.

      "text": "Chapter One \n12\nclosing  of  public  roads  for  motorcar  racing.  In  January  1903  the  Autocar \ncarried  a  message  in  its  editorial  advocating  this.  If  legislation  were  not  \npassed the race in Ireland would: “not only be illegal, but, further to that, \nwould almost be certain to be stopped at an early stage, and this would be \ngrossly  unfair  to  the  competitors  and  especially  to  those  who  came  from  \nabroad. If the race cannot legally and openly be held, it will not take place \nin  this  country  [Ireland].”\n15\n  Members  of  the  motoring  community  thus  \nrealised  the  need  for  legislation.  Contrary  to  this,  however,  one  Irish  \ncolumnist believed that “the English [were] far too law-abiding altogether, \nwe are prepared to hold the race, official approval or not!”\n16\n Additionally \nthere was also a feeling that such legislation would bring a sense of unity \nto  the  Irish.  Commenting  on  the  passing  of  legislation  to  permit  the  race,  \nthe ultra-Orange publication Northern Whig reported, “we see a wonderful \nblending  of  the  Orange  and  Green.  There  is  about  this  a  matter  of  \nunanimity  of  which  some  people  considered  Irishmen  to  be  incapable.”\n17\n \nIrish  MPs  such  as  Sir  Edward  Carson,  leader  of  the  Irish  Unionists,  and  \nJohn  Redmond,  leader  of  the  Irish  Nationalist  Party  would  support  this  \nlegislation.  They  were  fiercely  divided  politically,  but  were  brought  \ntogether by the promise of motor racing in Ireland.  \nThe Light Locomotives (Ireland) Bill was given its first reading in the \nHouse of Commons on 20 February 1903, received its second reading on \n26  February  and  was  considered  in  committee  and  given  its  third  reading  \nand passed on 2 March. Nothing was said against the passage of the bill.\n18\n \nThe  bill  was  passed  onto  the  Lords  and  received  its  first  reading  on  3  \nMarch,  the  second  reading  on  16  March  and  was  passed  on  24  March.\n19\n \nOnce  again  nothing  was  said  in  protest.  Despite  minimal  debate  over  the  \nlegislation  the  notion,  or  at  least  promise,  of  unity  was  expressed.  In  the  \nHouse of Lords Earl Spencer found it “gratifying and a new sensation ... \nto  find  a  Bill  dealing  with  Ireland  on  which  all  sides,  both  in  the  other  \nHouse and in this are united.”\n20\n His opinion was echoed in the Commons \nby  Saunderson,  MP  for  Armagh  North,  who  asked  “is  his  Majesty’s  \nGovernment  aware  that  this  is  a  rare  occasion  on  which  the  whole  of  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n15\n Autocar, 4 January 1903. \n16\n   As   quoted   in   B.

Taking  this  fact  into  consideration,  will  his  \nMajesty’s  Government  give  a  favourable  reply?”\n21\n  This  was  a  comment  \nthat  was  met  by  laughter  in  the  House,  suggesting  that  the  question  of  \nholding  a  motor  race  in  Ireland  was  viewed  as  a  light-hearted  matter.  \nWhyndham,  Chief  Secretary  for  Ireland,  was  confident  that  legislation  \nwould  be  passed  and  did  “not  like  to  contemplate  the  possibility  of  other  \nmembers  of  the  Commons  opposing  this  measure”  and  believed  further  \nthat  “no  one  can  be  opposed  to  it.”\n22\n  Politicians  at  Westminster  then  \npraised the unity inspired by the proposal of a motor race in Ireland; they \nwere not, it seems, put off by the danger and inconvenience posed by such \nan  event.  There  was  no  intention  of  passing  legislation  to  allow  motor  \nracing  in  England  (or  in  Scotland  or  Wales)  but  it  was  accepted  without  \ndemur  as  fair  to  allow  motor  racing  to  take  place  in  Ireland.  The  Light  \nLocomotives  (Ireland)  Act  received  the  Royal  Assent  on  27  March  1903,  \nhaving  had  its  first  reading  in  the  Commons  only  a  month  earlier,  on  20  \nFebruary.\n23\n \nIt  was  not  left  up  to  MPs  alone  to  put  forward  the  benefits  of  a  motor  \nrace  in  Ireland.  Whilst  legislation  was  being  debated  at  Westminster  the  \nAutomobile Club embarked on a direct mail campaign, designed to foster \nsupport  for  a  motor  race  in  Ireland.  Letters  were  sent  mostly  to  members  \nof  the  Irish  elite,  but  were  also  sent  to  some  who  it  was  believed  would  \nbenefit  from  the  staging  of  a  motor  race  in  Ireland,  for  example,  railway  \ncompanies and hoteliers. All in all, letters were sent to 102 Irish MPs, 300 \nnewspapers,  34  chairmen  of  county  and  district  councils,  34  county  \nsecretaries,   26   mayors,   90   Irish   peers,   41   railway   companies,   460   \nhoteliers, 13 parish priests and to the Bishop of Kildare and Leiglin.\n24\n The \nletter stressed the benefits that the Gordon Bennett race would supposedly \nbring locally and suggested that the event would benefit the Irish economy \nto  the  tune  of  £20,000.  It  is  unclear  how  this  figure  was  reached,  but  it  \nwould  have  included  revenue  generated  by  visitors  who  would  travel  to  \nIreland  exclusively  for  the  race.  This  was,  after  all,  an  international  \ncompetition.  The  letters  also  promised  that  rigorous  safety  measures  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n21\n Parliamentary Debates (Commons), 23 Feb. 1903, (4\nth\n Series), Vol. 118, col. 510. \n22\n Parliamentary Debates (Commons), 23 Feb. 1903, (4\nth\n Series), Vol. 118, col. 511. \n23\n  Montagu  states  in  The  Gordon  Bennett  Races  that  the  bill  passed  through  in  \nrecord time ‘receiving the Royal Assent on 27 March 1903, a bare seven days after \nit  first  reading  in  the  Commons’  (p.65).

To  avoid  interference  with  local  \nbusinesses, the race would be held on a public holiday.\n25\n  \nReaction  to  the  letters  was  positive  and  members  of  the  Automobile  \nClub  reported  that  they  had  met  little  opposition  whilst  touring  the  Irish  \ncountryside.  The  Bishop  of  Kildare  and  Leighlin  it  was  suggested  had  \ndeclared  himself  to  be  an  ardent  advocate  of  the  race.\n26\n County  councils, \nwho would be responsible for making necessary arrangements for the race \nin  Ireland,  unanimously  approved  the  plans  especially  after  they  learned  \nthat  they  would  not  foot  the  bill  for  preliminary  road  repairs.\n27\n The  race \nthen   was   an   attractive   proposition.   Potentially   roadways   could   be   \napproved  at  no  cost  to  the  local  council.  Although  a  softening  up  process  \nwas taking place, it must be remembered that legislation was being passed \nby  Westminster,  not  by  an  Irish  parliament  and  it  was  the  Irish  periphery  \nthat was being softened up. It may have been considered insensitive for the \nAutomobile  Club  to  see  legislation  passed  and  then  simply  turn  up  and  \nrace. Although this would not be impossible, the Automobile Club wanted \nto be seen to do the right thing in terms of gauging public opinion.  \nLegislation had been passed, and, selectively, public opinion seemed to \nbe in favour of the event. However, there still existed the need to construct \na  course.  Before  deciding  to  hold  the  event  in  Ireland,  the  Automobile  \nClub  had  pursued  various  other  ideas  in  their  ambition  to  hold  races  on  \nhome soil. These included the construction of a course over the flat land of \nLincolnshire,  building  a  course  in  Surrey  and  even  the  suggestion  of  \nholding  the  race  in  Scotland,  as  was  proposed  by  the  Edinburgh  Evening  \nDispatch.\n28\n Richard  Mecredy,  proprietor  of  the  Motor  News  magazine,  \nwas  asked  if  he  could  suggest  a  suitable  course,  after  which  it  was  \nproposed  that  the  Irish  race  be  held  over  closed  public  roads.\n29\n  It  was  on  \nMecredy’s  instigation  that  a  reconnaissance  party  from  the  Automobile  \nClub was sent to Ireland in November 1902 and inspected the areas to the \nSouth  and  West  of  Dublin.  One  racing  enthusiast  has  gone  as  far  as  to  \nsuggest  that  this  reconnaissance  party  displayed  “a  rare  unity  of  Saxon  \nenergy   and   Celtic   ardour   as   English   and   Irish   officials   inspected   \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n25\n Montagu and Sedgwick, The Gordon Bennett Races, p. 63. \n26\n Montagu and Sedgwick, The Gordon Bennett Races, p. 63. \n27\n  Members  of  the  Lords  believed  this  to  be  the  case.

This  area  was  well  served  by  railways  \nand  roads  out  of  Dublin,  reducing  the  problem  of  transporting  spectators,  \ncompetitors and racing machines. The area was also thinly populated, with \nthe  exception  of  the  main  towns  –  Carlow,  Kildare  and  Athy  –  which  \nmeant  that  the  number  of  controls,  and  subsequently  costs,  could  be  kept  \nto a minimum, showing that those in charge of organizing the race realised \nthe  inconvenience  that  would  be  caused  to  the  public  by  the  necessary  \nroad closures.  \nEverything  appeared  to  be  going  along  smoothly,  but  the  Automobile  \nClub  de  France  (ACF)  was  not  enthusiastic  about  the  idea  of  a  closed  \ncourse race. They disliked the shortness of the proposed course and hoped \nthat legislation would not be passed to allow the race to go ahead. It was in \nthe interest of the French to not see racing go ahead, as the race would be \nheld  in  France.  However,  this  sentiment  was  not  shared  by  Le  France  \nAutomobile  who  attempted  to  placate  the  ACF,  reminding  them  that  they  \nhad   been   losers   in   1902   and   “a   little   indulgence   would   not   be   \nmisplaced.”\n31\n The Automobile Club was quick to respond to this, arguing \nthat  the  French  were  scared  of  British  ascendency  in  world  matters  or  at  \nleast in the French-dominated automobile industry. Dublin’s Evening Mail \nalso spoke out against the opinion of the ACF remarking that “we are not \naware  that  they  do  things  better  in  France  -  witness  the  Paris-Madrid  \nmotor race disaster.”\n32\n A more positive opinion was offered by one of the \ncompetitors, the American Percy Owen. He commented that “we couldn’t \nhave  better  roads.  They  are  marvelous,  nothing  in  America  can  compare,  \nand they are as good as any in France, though not so wide.”\n33\n  \nThe organisers then faced one further problem: the Paris-Madrid motor \nrace  held  in  May  1903.  A  large  number  of  fatalities  in  the  race  had  seen  \nthe event ended at Bordeaux. There were now doubts over the safety of the \nIrish  race.  The  attitude  of  MPs  at  the  time,  as  we  have  seen  above,  was  \nthat  motorcars  were  unsafe  and  motorcar  races  were  unnecessary.  This  \ntown-to-town  race  did  little  to  prove  the  safety  of  motor  racing  and  did  \nlittle to quell the debate against the motorcar. In fact, English writer S.C.H \nDavies was compelled to comment that “for a while it seemed as thought \n[sic]  racing  might  be  stopped  for  good  and  all,  and  that  made  one  sick  at  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n30\n Lynch, The Triumph of the Red Devil, p. 37.  \n31\n Montagu and Sedgwick, The Gordon Bennett Races, p. 60. \n32\n Evening Mail as quoted in Lynch, Triumph of the Red Devil, p. 46. \n33\n Lynch, Triumph of the Red Devil, p. 37."

      "text": "Chapter One \n16\nheart.”\n34\n The Times reported that “an examination of yesterday’s incidents \nseems to prove pretty conclusively that it is well nigh impossible to escape \nserious   accidents   in   such   races   on   the   public   roads   under   existing   \nconditions.”\n35\n Concerns over the events of the Paris-Madrid race were also \nraised  in  the  House  of  Commons,  and  worries  were  expressed  over  the  \nsafety of the proposed Irish race. It was emphasised, by its supporters that \nthe  race  would  be  held  under  entirely  different  circumstances  and  that  \nvigorous  safety  measures  would  be  put  in  place  by  members  of  the  Irish  \nconstabulary  and  the  military,  supplemented  by  stewards  supplied  by  the  \nAutomobile club.  \nThe  Paris-Madrid  race  did  not  deter  the  members  of  the  motoring  \ncommunity from showing their support for racing. The Times published a \nletter  from  John  Scott  Montagu  who  argued  that  fatalities  that  had  \noccurred  in  the  Paris-Madrid  race  had  no  bearing  on  the  future  of  motor  \ncar racing, or indeed a proposed Gordon Bennett race in Ireland. The two \nraces, he claimed, would be entirely different and he argued that negative \nopinion  caused  by  the  events  in  France  was  entirely  unreasonable.  In  his  \nopinion  motor  racing  was  no  more  dangerous  than  other  sports:  “every  \nyear  people  are  killed  and  injured  in  the  following  sports:-  football,  at  \ncricket  (a  few),  steeplechasing,  polo,  hunting,  shooting,  yachting:  and  yet  \nno one clamours for the abolition of these contests.”\n36\n For Montagu, motor \nracing  was  just  another  sport,  not  matter  how  dangerous  it  was.  In  short  \nthe  Paris-Madrid  race  had  done  little  to  reduce  the  enthusiasm  for  motor  \nracing  among  the  elite.  Despite  the  reaction  in  England  to  the  events  on  \nthe Paris-Madrid race, the Irish Gordon Bennett race was still scheduled to \ngo ahead.  \nThe  race  took  place  at  the  beginning  of  July  1903.  On  the  day  before  \nthe race The  Times reported that there was a good deal of support for the \nrace  in  Ireland,  stating  that  “the  hotels  here  [Naas]  and  in  all  the  other  \ntowns  on  the  route  are  packed  to  overflowing  and  the  sides  of  the  course  \nwere lined this evening with thousands of tents ... It is quite certain that a \nreally  enormous  crowd  of  spectators  from  all  nations  will  witness  the  \nGordon  Bennett  race  tomorrow.”\n37\n  The  so-called  “Red  Devil”  Camille  \nJenatzy  won  the  race  and  his  victory  was  reported  alongside  the  “bad-\nluck” experienced by English drivers. The Irish Times, however, reported \nthat  “there  is  no  parallel  in  Irish  history  for  the  scenes  which  were  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n34\n As quoted in B.

It might \nbe  assumed  that  the  lack  of  achievement  by  British  drivers,  coupled  with  \nthe  tardiness  of  members  of  the  Automobile  Club  in  seeking  to  have  \nlegislation  renewed  after  the  1903  race,  as  suggested  by  The  Times, \ncontributed  to  trials  for  the  1904  Gordon  Bennett  race  not  being  held  in  \nIreland.\n39\n \nIn  1904  the  Automobile  Club  were  therefore  faced  with  a  problem:  \nwhere  to  hold  trials  for  the  1904  Gordon  Bennett  Race  if  not  in  Ireland.  \nThis race was to be held in Germany and was billed as a race that \n \nwith   its   accompanying   automobile   amenities   has   drawn   the   nations   \ntogether  on  a  common  sporting  ground  as  no  other  pastime,  industry  or  \ninterest  has  ever  before  ...in  effect  such  an  international  camaraderie  of  \nsport is an unsigned treaty of peace and good fellowship.\n40\n  \n \nThe   German   Gordon   Bennett   race   was   advertised   as   an   extremely   \nimportant sporting event, in fact an event that could be likened, in regard \nto the latter description, with the Olympic Games, which had been revived \nin their modern form in 1896. The British participants were determined to \nbe  successful  and  keen  to  make  up  for  their  lack  of  achievement  in  the  \n1903 Gordon Bennett Race. A British team could not be selected using the \nsame illegal and rushed trials such as those held on the London to Oxford \nroad before the 1903 race, and since other competing nations were holding \ntheir own trials, it was important that the British team did the same.\n 41\n The \nAutomobile  Club  had  only  the  possibility  of  racing  in  Ireland  under  \nlegislation passed in 1903. However, in May 1904 The Times commented \nthat “it was thought that there would hardly be time to renew or extend the \nAct passed last year [1903] permitting racing in Ireland.”\n42\n This meant that \nthe  obvious  solution  -  to  hold  trials  in  Ireland  -  did  not  happen.  But,  the  \nunobvious,  racing  in  the  Isle  of  Man,  did  happen  with  Irish  legislation  \nsetting a precedent for Manx legislation.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n38\n Irish Times, 1 July 1903, p. 7. \n39\n The Times, 10 May 1904, p. 13. \n40\n  From  Julian  Orde’s  copy  of  the  book  Offizieller  Gordon  Bennett  Führer  1904,  \npublished to mark the occasion of the Gordon Bennett race in Germany 1904. \n41\n Kelly, TT Pioneers, p. 15. \n42\n The Times, 10 May 1904, p. 13."

      "text": "Chapter One \n18\nStructure and Practice of Government on the Isle of Man \nIn 1904 the Manx government consisted of the lieutenant governor, the \nLegislative  Council  and  the  House  of  Keys  and  the  two  chambers  met  in  \nTynwald Court, a practice maintained throughout the period of this study. \nBoards  of  Tynwald  consisting  of  Members  of  the  Legislative  Council  \n(MLC)  and  Members  of  the  House  of  Keys  (MHK)  directed  other  \nadministrative duties.  \nLord Raglan was appointed to the post of  lieutenant governor in 1902, \nand would enjoy considerable personal authority during his time in office \n(1902-1919).  He  had  the  power  to  summon  and  adjourn  the  Manx  \nparliament  and  veto  expenditure.  He  was  also  president  of  the  Local  \nGovernment  Board  and  head  of  the  police.  In  fact,  such  was  the  power  \nmaintained   by   Raglan   between   1902   and   1919   that   Hall   Caine,   a   \nprominent  figure  on  the  island,  was  compelled  to  compare  him  with  the  \nTsar  of  Russia,  and  Spencer  Leigh  Hughes  commented  in  Reynolds \nNewspaper  in  1911  that  “Raglan  has  more  power  than  the  Kaiser.”\n43\n \nSamuel   Norris,   a   prominent   reformist,   suggested   that   the   lieutenant   \ngovernor  was  “his  own  Prime  Minister,  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  and  \nHome  Secretary.”\n44\n  The  British  Crown  appointed  the  lieutenant  governor  \nand only the British Crown could remove him from the position.  \nYet,  despite  his  considerable  power  over  Manx  affairs,  Raglan  was  \ndescribed    in    his    obituary    in    the    Manx    Quarterly    as    intensely    \ncompanionable,  and  it  was  claimed  that  no  one  could  deliver  speeches  \nmore gracefully, wittily and pithily.\n45\n This would indeed be evident in his \nadvocacy  of  motor  races  on  the  island.  Even  Samuel  Norris,  one  of  \nRaglan’s sternest critics and founder of the Manx National Reform League \nin  1903,  conceded  that  no  charitable  event  lacked  his  presence  or  that  of  \nhis  wife.\n46\n  Deemster  Callow,  a  member  of  the  Legislative  Council  and  \nthus  by  association  a  supporter  of  Raglan,  also  wrote  that  Raglan  “knew  \nthe Island intimately from the Point of Ayre to the Calf [of Man]; he took \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n43\n Reynolds Newspaper, Feb. 1911 as cited in J.

Kermode argues, “Raglan interpreted his \nrole  firmly  in  the  colonial  tradition.  He  believed  in  the  superiority  of  the  \ncolonial  administration  and  had  a  jaundiced  view  of  the  ability  of  the  \nelected  members  of  the  Keys.”\n48\n  What  the  passing  of  legislation  in  1904  \nsuggests, however, is that Raglan was closely in touch with the Manx elite, \nrepresented especially in his Legislative Council. He knew little and cared \nless about the Manx people as a whole. \nDespite  the  considerable  personal  authority  enjoyed  by  the  lieutenant  \ngovernor, it must be remembered that he had to receive the consent of the \nLegislative  Council  and  the  House  of  Keys  before  legislation  could  be  \npassed  on  the  island.  In  1904,  when  legislation  for  motor  racing  was  \nintroduced  into  the  Legislative  Council,  the  Council  consisted  of  eight  \nmembers  who  were  appointed  for  life  by  the  lieutenant  governor.  These  \nwere  the  bishop,  the  archdeacon,  the  vicar  general,  the  clerk  of  the  rolls,  \ntwo deemsters (judges), the attorney general and the receiver general. The \nlieutenant  governor  presided  over  the  Council.  It  has  been  suggested  that  \nthe  Legislative  Council  therefore  offered  a  “formidable  obstacle  to  any  \nnotion  of  reform”  that  might  have  been  proposed  by  members  of  the  \nKeys.\n49\n  Reformists  on  the  island  were  suspicious  of  the  power  of  the  \nLegislative  Council,  and  believed  that  Westminster  saw  it  as  a  vehicle  \nthrough  which  to  manipulate  Manx  affairs.  It  was  also  believed  that  \nmeetings  of  legislative  councillors  to  discuss  proposed  legislation  were  \noften  unofficially  held  in  private,  with  the  lieutenant  governor  acting  as  \nchairman  and  exercising  the  casting  vote.  If  this  were  the  case,  the  \nlieutenant  governor  would  have  had  the  chance  to  acquaint  the  Council  \nwith  proposed  legislation  before  formal  debate  and  thereby  avoid  any  \npossible  dispute  between  himself  and  the  Legislative  Council.\n50\n This \ndemonstrates   the   authority   maintained   by   Raglan   over   the   Manx   \nlegislature  and  also  helps  explain  how  legislation  for  road  racing  was  so  \nswiftly passed in 1904 and 1905, as we will see later.  \nThe  House  of  Keys  had  become  an  elected  House  as  a  result  of  the  \nHouse  of  Keys  Election  Act  1866,  and  was  composed  of  the  elected  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n47\n Manx Quarterly, 7 (1922), p. 45. \n48\n D.G.

Again this is demonstrated in the passage \nof legislation for motor racing in 1904 and 1905.  \nThe  two  chambers  of  the  Manx  parliament  sat  together  in  Tynwald  \nCourt. The lieutenant governor could not vote in Tynwald, but he was able \nto  address  the  meeting.  In  order  for  bills  to  be  passed,  they  had  to  be  \nratified  by  both  the  Legislative  Council  and  the  Keys,  with  each  body  \nvoting separately. However, a disparity existed in this arrangement due to \nthe fact that the Legislative Council could vote if three of its members and \nthe lieutenant governor were present. The Keys could only reject or pass a \nbill if thirteen of its members were for or against the proposal. This meant \nthat  only  three  members  of  the  Legislative  Council  could  defeat  a  bill.  \nTherefore, the lieutenant governor and the Legislative Council maintained \na large amount of power.\n52\n  \nThe   administration   of   the   island   was,   however,   delegated   to   \nrepresentatives of Tynwald by the Tynwald’s board system, although these \nboards  of  Tynwald  were  still  answerable  to  the  lieutenant  governor.  This  \nsystem of administration established itself between 1872 and 1894. Before \nthen only the Highway Board had existed (established 1836) and this was \nthe   only   example   of   Tynwald   members   being   involved   in   the   \nadministration  of  the  island.  The  period  between  1872  and  1894  saw  the  \nestablishment  of  eight  bodies,  which  involved  both  MLCs  and  MHKs  in  \nthe   administration   of   the   island.   These   boards   were   the   Harbour   \nCommissioners,  Board  of  Education,  Highways  Board,  Board  of  Fishery  \nConservators, the Asylum Board, Fisheries Committee, Local Government \nBoard,  and  an  Advertising  Committee,  which  would  later  become  the  \nBoard  of  Advertising,  a  state-funded  body  to  advertise  the  island  and  \npromote  it  as  a  tourist  destination.\n53\n  MLCs  chaired  all  but  one  of  these  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n51\n For further discussion of this Act see D.

MHKs  gained  little  control  over  boards  of  Tynwald  until  after  \nWorld War One.\n54\n  \n1904: Gordon Bennett Trials in the Isle of Man \nAs we saw earlier, after rejecting Ireland as a venue for their trials, the \nAutomobile  Club’s  glances  had  turned  towards  the  Isle  of  Man.  Julian  \nOrde, the secretary of the Automobile Club was sent to the Isle of Man to \nexplore  the  possibility  of  racing  there.\n55\n  Lord  Raglan,  Orde’s  cousin,  was  \nthe  island’s  lieutenant  governor.  This,  however,  was  only  one  powerful  \ningredient  in  the  mix.  Tynwald,  the  island’s  parliament,  was  able  to  pass  \nlegislation  legalising  the  closing  of  public  roads  without  reference  to  \nWhitehall  or  Westminster  and,  as  we  have  seen  above,  the  lieutenant  \ngovernor  exerted  considerable  power  over  the  legislative  process.  Raglan  \nwas also a member of the Automobile Club.\n56\n  \nIn February 1904 and before the legislative process began, Orde visited \nthe  island  to  assess  the  potential  for  racing  there.  After  Orde’s  successful  \nvisit  -  he  had  been  accompanied  around  the  island  by  Raglan  to  plan  a  \ncourse  -  it  was  left  to  the  Manx  government  to  pass  the  necessary  \nlegislation. Closer examination of the legislative process demonstrates that \nthe   legislation   was   imposed   on   both   the   Manx   legislature   and   the   \nislanders.  There  was  no  “softening  up”  process  as  had  taken  place  in  \nIreland,  or  any  poll  of  residents’  opinions.  On  15  March  1904,  the  \nHighway  (Light  Locomotives)  Bill  was  introduced  into  the  Legislative  \nCouncil by Raglan. He had drawn the bill  up  along  the  lines  of  the  Light  \nLocomotives  (Ireland)  Act  1903.

It received its three readings \nin  the  Legislative  Council  on  the  morning  of  15  March  and  was  received  \nby  the  House  of  Keys  later  that  afternoon.  It  passed  through  its  three  \nreadings in the Keys that day. It was then signed in Tynwald the following \nmorning.\n58\n  \nThe debate, or lack of debate, surrounding the bill has been overlooked \nin literature concerning the history of TT races, and may have been taken \nas  a  sign  of  enthusiasm,  from  both  members  of  the  Manx  legislature  and  \nthe  islanders  themselves,  for  the  holding  of  a  motor  race  on  the  island.  \nRaglan  was  evidently  determined  that  this  legislation  would  pass,  and  he  \nmade  his  views  on  the  matter  clear  in  the  Legislative  Council.  Raglan  \nanticipated  little  difficulty  in  passing  the  bill  through  its  stages.\n59\n He \nargued that regulations were required to guarantee the safety of both those \ninvolved  in  motor  races  and  the  spectators.  Although  it  was  doubtful  that  \nthe  Gordon  Bennett  trials  would  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  tourist  \nindustry, Raglan claimed that benefits would accrue if the trials were held \non the Isle of Man. He even suggested that there was considerable public \nopinion  in  favour  of  the  trials  taking  place  on  the  Isle  of  Man;  this  \nsuggestion  is  somewhat  spurious.  It  is  unclear  where  this  public  support  \nfor  the  trials  came  from.  Raglan  had  toured  the  island  with  Orde  in  \nFebruary  1904,  but  it  is  unlikely  that  he  managed  to  gain  a  great  deal  of  \npublic support at this time, or even sought it. It could well be argued that \nRaglan’s confidence arose not from the support of the Manx people but as \nthe  result  of  the  Legislative  Council  being  filled  entirely  with  Crown  \nappointees  on  whose  support  he  could  rely.  This  then  is  also  an  issue  of  \nclass. Members of the Manx elite, who were inclined to support Raglan on \nall  matters,  were  imposing  the  races  on  the  Manx  people.  At  this  stage  \nlegislation   for   motor   racing   on   the   Isle   of   Man   was   a   Raglan-led   \nimposition. \nSubsequent  debate  after  the  introduction  of  the  bill  in  the  Legislative  \nCouncil  was  minimal.  There  was  not  even  a  printed  text  of  the  bill  to  \nexamine and what debate there was hinged on two main issues: the safety \nof  the  races  and  the  cost  of  the  races.

It  was  felt  \nthat ample funds must be made available for meeting the costs of policing \nthe  event.\n60\n  The  Irish  authorities  -  county  councils  -  had  been  wary  of  \nfooting  the  bill  for  racing  in  1903  and,  so  it  seems,  was  the  Manx  \nLegislative  Council  in  1904.  The  Council  suggested  that  funds  for  racing  \nmight come from the organisers of the event, in this case the Automobile \nClub and maybe even from interest groups such as the Isle of Man Steam \nPacket  Company  and  hoteliers.  As  a  result  of  this  the  1904  legislation  \nmade it clear that “applicants” were to pay for the costs incurred by racing \non the island.\n61\n  \nThe  bill,  still  only  in  draft  and  not  yet  returned  from  the  printers,  was  \npassed  to  the  Keys  in  the  afternoon  and  rather  more  of  a  debate  ensued.  \nEven  so,  most  disquiet  in  the  Keys  concerned  the  speed  with  which  the  \nlegislation  was  being  passed  and  not  the  proposal  itself.  After  the  Keys  \nhad  been  asked  to  offer  an  opinion  on  a  bill  which  had  not  yet  been  \nreceived from the printers, W. T. Crennell, MHK for the rural constituency \nof Kirk Michael commented that the Bill, which was rapidly being passed \nthrough  the  necessary  channels,  was  not  a  matter  of  “such  extreme  \nurgency...that  we  should  in  the  face  of  all  precedent  read  the  Bill  first,  \nsecond and third times – because that is what is intended – a Bill we have \nnever  seen,  it  is  really  making  ourselves  a  laughing  stock”  [Emphasis  \nadded].\n62\n  Raglan  had  expected  that  there  would  be  little  difficulty  in  \npassing  the  bill  and  that  the  Legislative  Council  and  Keys  would  swiftly  \npush the legislation through. This anticipated speed in the legislature was \nthe Keys’ main objection. Raglan’s expectations highlight his authoritarian \ninterpretation  of  his  role,  believing  that  the  usual  legislative  procedures  \ncould be by-passed to make motor racing a reality. Some members of the \nKeys,  however,  would  not  accept  this  without  some  squeaks  of  protest,  \nand this was fair since the bill had not been seen in its entirety, or even in \nits printed form, and yet members of the Keys were expected to subscribe \nto it.  \nThe fact that the two opposing opinions on the merits of the bill from \nCrennell and Radcliffe, were offered by members whose sheadings would \nbe affected differently by the races, is also noticeable. Crennell’s sheading, \nKirk  Michael,  was  on  the  intended  route  of  the  course  and  therefore  the  \ntrials were likely to cause disruption to his constituents. However, the race \nwould largely bypass Radcliffe’s constituency, the sheading of Ayre and it \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n60\n Debates, Vol. 21, 15 Mar. 1904, pp. 400-403. \n61\n Highway (Light Locomotives) Act 1904, Statutes, Vol. 7, pp. 468-469. \n62\n Debates, Vol. 21, 15 Mar. 1904, p. 453."

      "text": "Chapter One \n24\nwould, therefore, be easier for Radcliffe to ignore the disruptive effects of \nholding a motor race on the island, as he would be distanced from the race. \nIt can also be argued that MHKs would have little idea of the nature of the \nactivity they were being asked to sanction, and therefore of the benefits it \nmight  generate.  Unsurprisingly,  Crennell’s  objections  were  not  given  any  \nsupport by other members of the Keys. Members of the Keys showed their \nweakness  in  the  face  of  the  lieutenant  governor.  The  demands  of  the  \nopposition  in  the  Keys  fell  on  deaf  ears,  and  in  sum,  and  due  to  Raglan’s  \nattitude, the debate was lost before it had begun.  \nThe  lack  of  debate  or  serious  engagement  with  the  bill  made  it  clear  \nthat the idea of motor racing - or at least the idea of passing legislation for \nmotor  racing  at  such  a  fast  pace  -  was  not  seriously  opposed  by  the  \nrepresentatives  of  the  Manx  people.  The  unprinted  bill  was  passed  by  a  \nLegislative  Council  and  a  House  of  Keys  that  usually  did  the  lieutenant  \ngovernor’s  bidding.  Between  them,  they  had  only  ventured  to  express  \nconcern  about  the  speed  of  the  legislation  and  the  safety  and  cost  of  the  \ntrials. This was also the only time that unprinted legislation was passed by \nTynwald, demonstrating the way in which Raglan exercised his power, the \nwillingness  of  the  Legislative  Council  to  do  what  Raglan  suggested,  and  \nthe weakness of the Keys in the face of the lieutenant governor. After this \nminimal debate, the legislation was signed in Tynwald the next morning.  \nThe  Highway  (Light  Locomotives)  Act  1904  allowed  the  Highway  \nBoard to close public roads for the purpose of racing, from “time to time.” \nHowever,  this  excluded  Sundays  (for  religious  reasons)  and  racing  could  \nonly take place for three days in the year. The Act also allowed for a £20 \nfine to be imposed on anyone in breach of the rules of the law. These were \nrules that were put in place to reduce speed in populated areas and protect \nspectators. The legislation was to expire on 31 December 1904.\n63\n It is fair \nto conclude that no one involved with the legislation or the trials expected \nthis  to  be  more  than  a  one-off,  a  point  that  could  partly  explain  Raglan’s  \nconfidence in the bill being successful and the apparent submission of the \nLegislative  Council  and  the  Keys  when  asked  to  pass  a  piece  of  unseen  \nlegislation.  This  also  helps  account  for  no  discussion  on  the  possible  \neconomic  benefits  of  the  Gordon  Bennett  trials  to  the  island.  Fittingly,  in  \norder  to  pass  the  Act  officially,  a  special  ceremony  was  held  at  Tynwald  \non   5   May   1904,   once   again   showing   that   Raglan   was   prepared   to   \ncompromise Manx political procedures. The Act was passed not on 5 July, \nthe  Manx  national  day,  when  it  was  usual  for  new  Manx  laws  to  be  \npromulgated.  This  was  because  of  the  need  to  hold  trials  before  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n63\n Highway (Light Locomotives) Act 1904, Statutes, Vol. 7, pp. 468-469."

It  was  reported  in  the  Manx  press  that  a  special  \nconvoy   of   motorcars   was   arranged   to   carry   members   of   the   Manx   \nlegislature  to  Tynwald  Hill.\n  64\n  This  was  arranged  by  Julian  Orde,  and  \nmight  be  seen  as  a  final  move  to  seal  the  “deal”  between  Raglan,  elite  \nmembers of the Manx legislature, and the Automobile Club.  \nThere  has  been  a  large  amount  of  comment  on  the  origins  of  the  TT.  \nFor  example,  Robert  Kelly  argues  that  “the  start  of  motorsport  in  the  Isle  \nof  Man  was  a  mixture  of  farce  and  melodrama”,\n65\n  and  this  further  \nexamination  of  the  origins  of  the  races  would  appear  to  substantiate  this,  \nwith  legislation  being  imposed  by  the  lieutenant  governor.  Kermode,  on  \nthe other hand, suggests that there is  a  link  between  the  Highways  (Light  \nLocomotives)  Act  passed  by  Tynwald  in  1904  and  tourism,  stating  that  \n“tourism   which   benefited   from   much   of   the   general   enabling   and   \nregulatory   activity   was   also   the   focus   of   specific   legislation.   The   \nHighways  (Light  Locomotives)  Act  1904  provided  for  the  Island’s  first  \nmotor racing on public roads.”\n66\n That the TT was originally established as \na boost to the island’s tourist industry is an opinion also expressed in much \nof  the  enthusiasts’  literature,  alongside  the  suggestion  that  motor  racing  \nwas  widely  welcomed  by  islanders.  Further  to  this,  enthusiasts’  literature  \nalso  suggests  that  Raglan  was  a  motoring  enthusiast  himself  and  that  he  \nmight  have  spotted  the  potential  of  the  Manx  road  system  for  road  \nracing.\n67\n   It   is   also   argued,   insubstantially   with   little   evidence,   that   \nenthusiasm  for  racing  permeated  through  all  strata  of  Manx  society  and  \nthat some Manx people wanted to offer the motor industry a home and the \nAutomobile   Club   of   Great   Britain   and   Ireland   a   place   to   hold   an   \neliminating  trial,  for  the  1904  Gordon  Bennett  race.\n68\n This  is  barely \nbelievable,  as  is  the  contrary  claim  that  Orde  instead  faced  the  task  of  \nawakening this “Rip van Winkle Island” and stimulating interest in motor \nracing.\n69\n  \nLegislation   passed   in   1904   was   only   designed   to   last   until   31   \nDecember that year, and Manx politicians expected no obvious effects on \nthe  tourist  trade.  This  legislation  was  not  aimed  at  boosting  the  tourist  \ntrade, but rather pandered to a wealthy elite. It was imposed on the Manx \npeople  and,  therefore,  there  was  no  need  to  create  an  interest  in  motor  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n64\n Mona’s Herald, 19 March 1904. \n65\n Kelly, TT Pioneers, p. 39. \n66\n Kermode, Offshore Island Politics, p. 71. \n67\n  P.

One motor sport historian \nclaims that at the time of Orde’s visit there were only two motor vehicles \non  the  island.\n70\n  If  so,  the  Isle  of  Man  would  hardly  be  the  home  of  \nenthusiasts  urging  this  race  upon  the  Manx.  Roads  would  have  to  be  \nclosed and the routine of some Manx people would be disrupted. If racing \ntook  place  in  the  autumn,  the  work  of  farmers  would  be  disrupted.  \nHarvesting  crops  would  have  been  a  much  more  difficult  task  if  roads  \nwere  closed  and  motorcars  were  racing  along  them.  Closing  public  roads  \nfor   motorcar   races   was   an   unprecedented   inconvenience,   yet   an   \ninconvenience Raglan believed would be tolerated by the Manx people. \nIn 1904 then, in order to allow motoring enthusiasts, all of whom were \nmembers of the elite from mainland Britain, to race on the Isle of Man, the \nLegislative  Council  and  to  some  extent  the  House  of  Keys,  driven  on  by  \nRaglan, were prepared to suspend domestic motoring rules and regulations \nfor  three  days  of  the  year,  albeit  for  one  year  only.  They  were  also  \nprepared  to  speed  up  necessary  legislative  procedures.  As  a  consequence  \nof this, what should have taken weeks to be read and considered in a first, \na  second  and  third  reading  was  crammed  into  just  one  day.  This  also  \nresulted  in  very  little  debate  being  produced  in  each  chamber,  which  is  \nreflected  in  the  trivial  number  of  pages  dedicated  to  the  subject  in  the  \nprinted  debates,  the  House  of  Keys  Journal  and  the  Legislative  Council  \nMinutes.\n71\n  It  is  no  wonder  that  Crennell  believed  that  the  Keys  were  \nmaking  a  laughing  stock  of  themselves.  True,  prohibiting  racing  on  a  \nSunday  protected  the  interests  of  the  religious  community  on  the  island.  \nKeeping  racing  to  three  days  a  year  protected  the  interests  of  the  rural  \ncommunity.  Insisting  that  the  organisers  of  the  race  cover  the  expense  of  \nsuch an event protected the Manx from having to use their own money to \npay  for  the  enthusiasm  of  a  few  members  of  the  British  elite.  That,  \nhowever, was all about which the legislators chose to show concern. \n1905: The Motorcycle TT precedent \nThe Highways (Light Locomotive) Act expired on 31 December 1904, \nand  it  was  therefore  necessary  to  consider  new  legislation  when  in  1905  \nthe Automobile Club approached the island for the purpose of racing once \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n70\n Holliday, Racing Round the Island, p. 14.

The Manx authorities were therefore given an early \nopportunity to stop all further motor racing on the Isle of Man, but this did \nnot  happen.  Indeed  the  opportunity  to  prevent  a  repeat  of  the  trials  was  \ngiven little consideration by Raglan, the Legislative Council or the House \nof  Keys.  In  1905  Raglan  did  not  have  to  rely  on  Irish  legislation  to  \nconvince the Council and the Keys to hold racing on the island once again; \nthere  was  now  Manx  legislation  from  1904  that  could  be  renewed.  Those  \nsanctioning  motor  racing  on  the  island  would  also  have  a  clearer  idea  of  \nthe type of activity they were allowing.  \nIn  early  1905  legislation  was  once  again  introduced  in  the  Legislative  \nCouncil by Raglan. This new bill closely followed the 1904 Act, but with \na  couple  of  significant  amendments.  The  Act  did  not  specify  an  expiry  \ndate,  as  was  the  case  in  1904,  but  did  include  a  clause  which  stated  that  \n“the  powers  of  the  [Highway]  Board  shall  not  be  exercised  after  the  \nexpiration  of  one  year  from  the  promulgation  of  this  Act,  unless  the  \nTynwald  court  shall,  by  resolution,  expressly  authorize  [sic]  the  exercise  \nof  the  same.”\n72\n  This  clause  meant  legislation  had  to  be  annually  renewed  \nby Tynwald, giving them power to refuse permission for motor racing on \nthe island if they so wished. Moreover, the three days previously allowed \nfor  motor  racing  were  replaced  by  six,  authorising  three  days  to  be  set  \naside  in  May  and  three  days  in  September  for  motor  racing.\n73\n The \nHighways  (Motor  Car)  Bill  unsurprisingly  again  produced  very  little  \ncomment  in  the  Legislative  Council  and  this  lack  of  questioning  is  again  \nreflected in the limited account in the printed debates.\n74\n \nHowever, in contrast to this and unlike the rushed debate in 1904, the \nKeys  in  1905  were  at  least  given  more  time  to  consider  the  bill,  though  \ndiscussion  was  once  again  limited.  Issues  raised  in  this  debate  indicated  \nsome  antagonism  between  farming  and  the  visiting  industry,  or  between  \nurban  and  rural  interests.  Racing,  if  it  were  to  take  place  in  September,  \nwould   cause   some   disruption   to   the   farming   community,   and   this   \nimmediately caused disquiet amongst the rural section of the Keys. E. M. \nGawne  (Rushen)  voiced  his  concerns,  arguing:  “we  are  not  going  to  let  \npeople  say  that  the  visiting  industry  is  the  paramount  industry,  and  that  \nalone is to be studied. I maintain that farming is the chief industry we have \non  the  Island.”\n75\n  At  the  heart  of  this  matter  was  the  concern,  albeit  \nmisplaced,  that  agriculture  was  suffering  as  a  result  of  investment  in  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n72\n See Highways (Motor Car) Act 1905, Statutes, Vol. 7, pp. 569-571. \n73\n Highways (Motor Car) Act 1905, Statutes, Vol. 7, pp. 569-571. \n74\n Debates, Vol. 22, 1905, p. 545. \n75\n Debates, Vol. 22, 1905, p. 501."

Rural  MHKs  were  eager  to  see  that  \nthe interests of the farming community were not compromised.  \nWhilst  Gawne  believed  that  motor  racing  would  be  detrimental  to  the  \nrural  Manx,  Joseph  Qualtrough  (Rushen)  on  the  other  hand  urged  the  \nHouse  to  take  a  wider  view.  He  claimed  that  racing  would  cause  little  \ndisruption to the public and he went on to state that he believed that where \nracing  was  concerned  the  welfare  of  the  Manx  would  come  first  and  the  \nwelfare of the visitors second.\n76\n It is difficult to believe that this would be \nthe  case,  as  motor  racing  was  once  again  being  imposed  on  the  Manx  \npeople.  Qualtrough  then  offered  very  ambivalent  support  for  the  races  \nstating that:  \n \nI am not at all favourable to the Motor Car Bill; I have no great sympathy \ntowards it. I don’t know really whether if I was put to the test of my own \nfeelings I would vote for it at all. But I believe it will advertise the Isle of \nMan, and if that is so, I believe every member should consider whether we \ncannot secure that benefit, and for that purpose the Bill has my sympathy, \nand for that only.\n77\n \n \nQualtrough believed the races could publicise the island, but at this point it \nwould  have  been  more  a  case  of  publicity  being  the  good  word  of  mouth  \nof those who attended the motor races. It can certainly be argued that there \nwould be much immediate monetary benefit to the Manx economy.  \nDespite  Qualtrough’s  comments  and  despite  legislation  being  made  \npermanent  in  1905,  there  was  still  very  little  indication  that  the  races  \nwould  have  a  big  impact  in  the  future.  Furthermore,  the  1905  legislation  \nhad again been imposed on the Manx. The passage of the legislation again \nshows the power wielded by Raglan, who was once more pandering to the \nwishes  of  members  of  the  British  elite.  There  were  minor  differences  in  \n1905,  which  included  the  fact  that  more  time  was  taken  to  consider  the  \nlegislation, but no opportunity was given to rehearse objections and it was \nstill  inevitable  that  this  new  legislation  would  be  passed.  Once  again,  in  \n1905,  motor  racing  was  imposed  on  the  island.  With  legislation  being  \nmade  permanent,  the  Automobile  Club  now  arguably  had  a  racetrack  on  \nthe Isle of Man.  \nIn  1907  the  first  motorcycle  TT  race  was  held  on  the  Isle  of  Man,  \norganised  by  the  Auto  Cycle  Union  (ACU).  Both  the  Highways  (Light  \nLocomotive)  Act  1904  and  the  Highways  (Motor  Car)  Act  had  provided  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n76\n Debates, Vol. 22, 1905, p. 501. \n77\n Debates, Vol. 22, 1905, pp. 506 -507."

The  ease  with  which  the  motorcycle  TT  was  \nestablished  suggests  a  further  imposition,  and  no  discussion  over  the  \nholding  of  this  motorcycle  race  has  been  found  in  the  printed  debates.  \nHowever,  minute  books  recording  meetings  of  the  Isle  of  Man  Highway  \nBoard  reveal  that  the  ACU  did  write  to  the  Highway  Board  to  apply  for  \npermission to hold a motorcycle race on 28 May 1907. This letter was read \nin a meeting on 15 May, with the Highway Board granting permission for \nthis race.\n80\n \nThe  origins  of  the  motorcycle  TT  races  are  a  matter  of  some  debate  \nbetween  motor  sport  enthusiasts,  although  it  is  usually  accepted  that  they  \nare   as   follows.   In   1906   the   Auto   Cycle   Club   (ACC)   came   to   the   \nconclusion   that   to   encourage   the   development   of   motorcycles   the   \nmotorcycle  industry  needed  a  similar  race  to  the  motorcar  TT  races  \nestablished  in  1905.  By  1907,  Julian  Orde,  secretary  of  the  Automobile  \nClub,  who  had  been  instrumental  in  bringing  motor  racing  to  the  island,  \nhelped  to  arrange  this  and  persuaded  Raglan  to  designate  for  racing  an  \neighteen-mile  circuit  in  the  west  of  the  island.\n81\n  This  is  one  shortened  \nversion  of  events.  Another  suggests  that  the  TT  races  were  the  brainchild  \nof  the  editor  of  the  Motor  Cycle  magazine  and  that  the  concept  was  first  \nproposed  at  the  annual  ACC  dinner  on  17  January  1907.  The  reason  for  \nthis  proposal  had  much  to  do  with  disenchantment  with  the  International  \nCup race for motorcycles that had been held in Europe since 1904. There \nis little primary material available from which to ascertain a real version of \nevents.  However,  it  might  be  argued  that  Orde  had  a  hand  in  the  \nestablishment   of   this   race,   given   his   involvement   in   1904   and   his   \nrelationship with Raglan. It also cannot be stated with certainty that these \nraces were an imposition as had been the case with motor car races, but the \nlittle  evidence  found  might  suggest  that  this  is  likely.  The  origins  of  the  \nmotorcycle TT therefore lie firmly in the origins of motorcar racing on the \nIsle of Man.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n78\n Highway (Light Locomotives) Act 1904, Statutes pp. 468-469. \n79\n Highways (Motor Car) Act 1905, Statutes, vol.

Legislation was renewed annually by \nTynwald,  in  conjunction  with  the  lieutenant  governor,  and  permission  \ngranted  to  the  RAC  and  indeed  the  ACU  to  organise  motor  car  and  \nmotorcycle  races  to  take  place  on  the  Isle  of  Man.\n82\n  However,  a  boycott  \nled  by  motorcycle  manufacturers  in  1912  threatened  the  continuation  of  \nthe  motorcycle  TT  and  caused  Tynwald  to  reassess  the  importance  of  \nstaging the event on the Isle of Man.  \nIn January 1912 the vicar general, a member of the Legislative Council \nand chairman of the Highway Board, put forward a resolution in Tynwald \nto permit the extension of the 1905 legislation for a further year. It will be \nrecalled  that  this  annual  renewal  of  legislation  by  Tynwald  had  been  a  \nstipulation of the 1905 legislation, thus allowing motorcycle races to take \nplace  annually  up  to  1912.\n83\n  After  the  vicar  general  had  put  forward  the  \nresolution  and  in  the  same  sitting  of  Tynwald,  Raglan  introduced  a  letter  \nhe  had  received  from  the  Manufacturers’  Union.\n84\n Deemster  Moore  read \nthe  letter  to  members  of  Tynwald,  making  them  aware  of  the  attitude  of  \nthe  Manufacturers’  Union  towards  the  TT  and  the  Union’s  proposal  to  \nboycott the event. It was pointed out that in the opinion of members of the \nManufacturers’  Union,  it  was  “contrary  to  public  interests  that  such  road  \nraces should be held in future.”\n85\n This conclusion had been reached for the \nfollowing reasons: \n \n1.  Experience  has  proved  that  personal  accidents,  sometimes  fatal,  as  you  \nknow, are inseparable from such events. \n2.  The  public  require  [sic]  no  further  demonstration  of  the  extraordinary  \nspeed at which the modern motor bicycle may be driven. \n3. If the utmost speed of which the motor-cycle is capable is required to be \ndemonstrated,  it  can  be  done  without  undue  risk,  and  without  any  public  \ninconvenience,  on  an  enclosed  and  specially  constructed  track,  such  as  \nexists at Brooklands. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n82\n  The  Automobile  received  Royal  patronage  in  1908  and  thus  changed  its  title  to  \nthe  Royal  Automobile  Club  (RAC).

It  is  contrary  to  public  prejudice  to  associate  the  word  “tourist”  with  a  \nspeed of nearly 60 miles an hour. \n5. Young and heedless men in all parts of the country, hearing of the speed \nattained  under  special  circumstances  in  the  Isle  of  Man,  are  tempted  to  \nemulate that speed on ordinary roads, with the result that all other users of \nthe highroads suffer considerably.\n86\n  \n \nThe reasons why this letter was sent to Raglan are unclear. What is clear, \nhowever,  is  that  the  Manufacturers’  Union  was  becoming  unsure  that  the  \nmotorcycle   TT   races   served   any   purpose   to   manufacturers.   The   \nManufacturers’ Union had presented Tynwald with an opportunity to stop \nthe TT at this early stage. \nMembers  of  the  Manx  legislature  did  not  share  the  opinions  of  the  \nManufacturers’   Union.   Instead   they   were   actually   keen   to   see   the   \ncontinuation  of  the  TT  on  the  island.  Kerruish,  MHK  for  South  Douglas,  \nsuggested  that  the  Union’s  letter  should  be  ignored,  stating  that  “I  have  \nsome experience of that Society, and I know what it is, and I think we may \ndisregard  it  absolutely.”\n87\n  Quite  what  this  comment  referred  to  is  unclear.  \nIn  further  discussion  of  the  resolution  MHKs  and  MLCs  voiced  both  \nsupport  and  objections  towards  the  continuation  of  the  TT  on  the  island,  \nsuggesting that a more open debate was permitted, but also that members \nof Tynwald on the whole were by then accepting the lieutenant governor’s \nimposition.  \nThe vicar general had earlier made his support clear when introducing \nthe  resolution.  He  pointed  out  that,  “the  [Highway]  Board  recognise  that  \nthere  is  a  considerable  body  of  opinion  throughout  the  Island  probably  \nagainst  holding  these  competitions”  but  this  was  not  important  as  “on  the  \nother hand, they [the Highway Board] are fully aware that there is a strong \nbody of opinion in favour of these races, and they also recognise that these \ncompetitions  are  of  very  great  benefit  to  the  people  of  the  Island  in  one  \nway or other.”\n88\n The vicar general was confident that, in asking for the TT \nto  be  continued  on  the  island  and  in  asking  that  roads  be  closed  at  some  \ninconvenience  to  some  islanders,  he  still  had  the  support  of  at  least  the  \nmajority of the island’s residents.  \nThe  attorney  general  and  Deemster  Moore,  both  members  of  the  \nLegislative  Council,  and  Crennell  and  Clucas  from  the  House  of  Keys,  \nraised  objections  to  the  continuation  of  the  TT.  The  attorney  general  did  \nnot  support  the  TT  because  he  believed  the  Isle  of  Man  was  being  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n86\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 186. \n87\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 190. \n88\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 187."

The  organisers  of  these  races  had  taken  advantage  of  \nthe  island’s  constitutional  position.  He  also  believed  that  a  great  deal  of  \ninconvenience  was  caused  by  the  holding  of  the  TT  on  the  island.  His  \nobjections  were  that  the  debate,  which  in  his  opinion  had  sunk  to  the  \n“most  sordid  level  possible  to  imagine”,  took  into  account  the  financial  \ngain   that   could   be   made   from   the   races   but   did   not   consider   the   \ninconvenience  the  races  caused  to  the  island’s  residents.  He  also  argued  \nthat “it is not a matter of right or wrong, or consideration for the comfort \nof the people of the Island, but a mere matter of getting a little money. It is \nthe principle that supports Monte Carlo, because it pays all the rates at the \nexpense  of  vice.”\n89\n  We  can  clearly  see  that,  in  the  mind  of  the  attorney  \ngeneral at least, the Isle of Man was gaining a reputation for doing things \ndifferently, for seeking to be distinctive. By staging the TT the Manx held \nan  event  that  would  not  be  permitted  elsewhere.  The  attorney  general,  \nhowever, was not prepared to support the TT simply because of the belief \nthat the event might advertise the island.  \nMHKs  Crennell  and  Clucas  had  their  own  reasons  for  not  supporting  \nthe  continuation  of  the  TT.  Crennell  was  confused  by  the  actions  of  the  \nHighway  Board,  stating  that  “one  thing  which  [he  had]  not  been  able  to  \nunderstand is the mysterious way in which the Highway Board moves, in \nthat  it  allows,  and  did  allow  last  year,  a  race  for  motor  cycles  but  \nprohibited  a  race  for  motor  cars.”\n90\n  Crennell  went  on  to  argue  that,  in  his  \nopinion,  and  as  far  as  residents  along  the  road  were  concerned,  “the  \nmotorcyclist  [was]  infinitely  more  objectionable  than  the  motor  car-ist  \n[sic],  and  so  far  as  experience  in  this  Island  goes  for  anything,  racing  by  \nmotor cycle seems to be more dangerous than racing by motor car.”\n91\n The \nHighway  Board,  it  might  be  suggested,  were  pursuing  an  agenda  that  \nwould see motorcycle racing maintained on the island. The Board did not \nhave  the  support  of  all  MHKs,  and  this  was  not  forthcoming  because  \nmotor races on the island were deemed to be an inconvenience to some.  \nIn  1912  there  was  a  more  open  and  transparent  debate  over  the  future  \nof  the  TT,  and  we  can  see  much  greater  discussion  over  the  future  of  \nracing on the Isle of Man than had been the case in 1904, 1905 and 1907. \nThere  was  active  support  for  the  continuation  of  the  TT  by  members  of  \nTynwald,  although  objections  were  put  forward  most  notably  by  the  \nattorney  general,  a  member  of  the  Legislative  Council.

From around 1896 \nthe Manx economy entered a period of specialisation, a phase that saw the \ngrowing  dependence  of  the  Manx  economy  on  tourism  as  a  result  of  the  \ndecline  of  primary  and  secondary  industries  such  as  mining,  manufacturing  \nand fishing. For example, in 1826 the Manx fishing fleet had consisted of \n250  boats  and  employed  2,500  men.\n1\n  However,  during  the  mid-1880s  the  \nfishing  industry  entered  a  period  of  steady  decline  and,  Kinvig  states,  by  \n1911  the  number  employed  in  the  fishing  industry  had  fallen  to  1000,  \nalthough statistics taken from the 1901 and 1911 censuses show that there \nwere only 864 and 525 people employed in this industry respectively (see \ntable  2-1).  Indeed,  Kinvig  also  notes  that  in  1914  the  Manx  fishing  fleet  \nwas made up of only 57 boats.\n2\n There was, then, a considerable decline in \nthe island’s fishing industry.  \nThis  decline  was  joined  by  the  decline  of  numbers  employed  in  \nmining,  an  industry  that  had  been  prosperous  during  the  mid-nineteenth  \ncentury.  During  the  1870s  and  1880s  Laxey  mines  recorded  their  highest  \nproduction  figures  for  lead,  zinc  and  silver.  The  value  of  the  ore  shipped  \nfrom  Laxey  in  this  period  has  been  estimated  as  £90,915,  and  the  annual  \nvalue  of  production  in  the  Foxdale  mines  was  £40,000.\n3\n  It  has  also  been  \nestimated  that  the  mining  industry  as  a  whole,  between  1855  and  1880,  \nemployed   almost   1000   men.\n4\n   These   levels   of   prosperity   were   not   \nmaintained.

Census \ndata also shows that the number of people employed in mining or related \nindustries was also declining. In 1901 a total of 769 people were employed \nin  this  sector  of  the  economy,  but  this  number  had  fallen  to  522  in  1911.  \nBy  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century  mining  no  longer  employed  a  \nsignificant number of the island’s workforce (see table 2-1).  \nThe development of the island’s tourist industry was facilitated by the \nfinancial  reforms  of  1866,  under  the  Customs,  Harbours  and  Public  \nPurposes Act passed on the instigation of Lieutenant Governor Loch.

Total  visitor  \nnumbers  show  that  in  1900  the  island  received  351,238  visitors,  which  \nincreased  to  a  record  number  of  634,512  in  1913,  the  highest  recorded  \ntotal  between  1900  and  1960.  Between  1900  and  1914  tourist  figures  did  \nnot  fall  below  350,000.\n11\n  Census  data  also  demonstrates  the  development  \nof  this  industry,  showing  a  rise  in  those  employed  in  occupations  loosely  \ntermed under the heading food, tobacco, drink and lodging, from 2,729 in \n1901  to  3,801  in  1911  (see  table  2-1).\n12\n  This  is  a  rise  of  1000  people  \nproviding  such  services  on  the  Isle  of  Man  during  a  period  when  visitor  \nfigures were steadily rising suggesting that during the pre-war period, the \nisland’s economy was becoming concentrated on tourism. Also interesting \nto note is that in the printed record of visitor figures for the period 1887 – \n2003,  the  years  1904,  1905  and  1907  are  pointed  out  as  significant  dates,  \nbecause  of  the  establishment  and  holding  of  motor  races  on  the  island.  \nHowever,  the  statistics  show  that  visitor  figures  were  already  increasing  \nafter 1900, regardless of motor races, and so the motor races held in these \nyears had little role in boosting tourist figures, although the origins of the \nTT have been closely associated, by some scholars, with the development \nof the island’s tourist industry.\n13\n \nManx Economic Interests \nThe lack of debate around the passage of legislation in 1904 and 1905 \nmeant  that  very  few  capitalist  interests  in  holding  motor  races  on  the  \nisland   were   recognised   by   members   of   Tynwald.   It   must   also   be   \nremembered  that  legislation  passed  in  1904  was  only  valid  until  31  \nDecember  that  year.  Few  if  any  economic  benefits  would  be  had  from,  \nholding  motor  races  on  the  Isle  of  Man  in  one  year,  and  it  is  not  \nunreasonable to expect these not to be considered by members of Tynwald. \nIt should therefore be asked whether or not, in 1904 and 1905 members  \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n10\n Commission on Local Industries, 26 March 1900. \n11\n Isle  of  Man  Summer  Passenger  Arrivals  1887  –  Present,  (Douglas,  Economic  \nAffairs Division; Isle of Man Government, 2007).  \n12\n Census  1901:  Islands  in  the  British  Seas:  Isle  of  Man,  Jersey,  Guernsey  and  \nAdjacent  Islands,  (London,  H.M.S.O,  1903);  Census  1911:  Islands  in  the  British  \nSeas:  Isle  of  Man,  Jersey,  Guernsey  and  Adjacent  Islands,  (London,  H.M.S.O,  \n1913).  \n13\n Kermode, Offshore Island Politics, p. 71."

Legislation was imposed on the Manx legislature, and the \nspeed  with  which  the  legislation  was  passed  and  the  lack  of  open  debate  \nmake it clear that there was little time to consider the contribution, if any, \nthe   event   might   make   to   the   Manx   economy.   In   1904   Radcliffe,   \nrepresentative  for  Ayre  did  claim  that  the  bill  was  a  matter  of  great  \nimportance  to  the  island  believing  that  it  would  be  “a  means  of  bringing  \nover  a  class  of  visitor  that  will  be  of  very  great  benefit.”\n14\n  This  is  not,  \nhowever,  a  statement  from  which  we  can  deduce  that  Radcliffe  was  \nencouraging  the  use  of  motor  sport  in  publicising  the  island.  Equally  it  \ncannot be argued that, in 1904, there was any belief amongst members of \nTynwald  that  such  an  event  would  help  attract  visitors  to  the  island.  This  \nmotor race was only a trial for the Gordon Bennett Race. It was therefore \nnot  an  international  race  such  as  had  been  held  in  Ireland  in  1903.  It  \nshould also be noted that this was an opinion voiced only by one member \nof  the  Keys.  It  provides  little  evidence  that  the  passing  of  legislation  and  \nthe  holding  of  a  motor  race  on  the  island  were  geared  towards  the  \ndevelopment  of  the  tourist  trade,  as  suggested  by  Kermode  who  claims  \nthat the 1904 legislation facilitated the development of the island’s tourist \nindustry,\n15\n  and  by  Kelly  who  argues  that  the  Manx  government  had  \napproached the 1904 trials with “an eagerness for new tourist business but \nan uncertainty over what to expect.”\n16\n \nThere  was  more  open  debate  over  the  passing  of  legislation  in  1905,  \nand  this  allowed  MLCs  and  MHKs  to  voice  their  opinions.  It  must  be  \nremembered, however, that motor racing had only once taken place on the \nIsle  of  Man  before  the  suggestion  that  further  legislation  be  passed  in  \n1905.  Gawne  (Rushen)  had  expressed  concerns  over  the  impact  of  motor  \nraces  on  rural  communities,  especially  since  they  were  to  be  held  in  \nSeptember  in  1905.  As  already  reported,  Gawne  had  argued,  “we  are  not  \ngoing to let people say that the visiting industry is the paramount industry, \nand that alone is to be studied. I maintain that farming is the chief industry \nwe have on the Island.”\n17\n Contrary to Gawne’s opinion, Qualtrough urged \nthe  House  to  take  a  wider  view,  pointing  out  that  whilst  he  was  not  \nfavourable  to  the  Motor  Car  Bill,  he  believed  that  it  “would  advertise  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n14\n Debates, Vol. 21 15 March 1904, p. 453. \n15\n Kermode, Offshore Island Politics, p. 71.  \n16\n Kelly, TT Pioneers, p. 39. \n17\n Debates, Vol. 22, 1905, p. 501."

The report stressed that the tourist industry had reached such a point \nthat  the  demand  for  labour  in  connection  with  this  industry  made  it  \ndifficult to obtain labour in other areas of the economy. The Commission \nalso judged that there was no way in which the mass of unskilled workers \nthat  faced  unemployment  at  the  end  of  the  tourist  season  could  be  \nemployed  in  the  winter.\n19\n  The  tourist  industry  was  indeed  becoming  the  \nchief  industry  on  the  island,  but  this  was  not  necessarily  a  welcome  \ndevelopment.  Statistics  in  the  1901  and  1911  censuses  show  that  there  \nwere almost twice the number of people employed in “food, tobacco, drink \nand lodging” than in the fishing industry (see table 2-1). It might therefore \nbe argued that motor racing may have been geared towards the enrichment \nof this industry, but very little was said so positively in the debate.  \nThe Highways (Motor Car) Act 1905 was renewed each year with the \nconsent  of  Tynwald  and  the  lieutenant  governor,  and  allowed  motor  car  \nraces,  and  after  1907  motorcycle  races,  to  take  place  on  the  Isle  of  Man  \neach year. As there was little debate over the renewal of legislation and the \ncontinuation of motor racing on the Isle of Man, it is difficult to trace how \nfar members of Tynwald discerned an economic value in the continuation \nof these events. It can, however, be noted that there was no effort made on \nbehalf of the Manx government to advertise the TT alongside the island’s \nother  attractions  during  this  period.  This  was  a  step  that  would  not  be  \ntaken  until  1922.\n20\n  In  1912,  however,  the  Manx  legislature  was  faced  by  \nthe  possible  termination  of  the  motorcycle  TT,  and  there  was  an  open  \ndebate to consider this matter in Tynwald. On this occasion members were \nquick  to  point  out  the  economic  benefits  of  continuing  to  hold  the  \nmotorcycle TT on the island, which by then had still only been running for \nfive years. \nSurprisingly,  when  the  origins  of  motor  racing  on  the  Isle  of  Man  are  \nconsidered,  it  was  not  just  members  of  the  Legislative  Council  who  \noffered their support for the TT in 1912. The majority of MHKs present in \nthe debate also supported the continuation of the event. In 1910, Kerruish \n(South  Douglas)  put  forward  a  proposal  in  Tynwald,  without  the  consent  \nof  the  lieutenant  governor  that  the  Board  of  Advertising’s  budget  should  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n18\n Debates, Vol., 22, 1905, p. 501. \n19\n Commission on Local Industries Report, 26 March 1900. \n20\n Pre-war Board of Advertising Minute Books makes no reference to the TT races."

He  \nclaimed that the event brought a large amount of revenue to the island. He \nadmitted that: \n \nIt is impossible to say with any exactness how many people were brought \n[to the island], but it is easy to get the minimum computation. There were \n150 competitors at least; each of those competitors involved a party of six, \nwhich  makes  900  people  directly  interested  in  the  races.  They  were  here  \nfor  six  weeks,  but  putting  them  down  at  10  –  12  days,  each  one  of  them  \nwould spend 15s or £1 a day. There you have £10,000 spent in the Isle of \nMan.  Now,  put  that  alongside  of  what  you,  farmers,  get  extra  for  a  calf  \nfrom a premium bull, and where are you? [Laughter].\n23\n \n \nKerruish’s  comment,  which  was  met  with  light-hearted  agreement  in  \nTynwald,  shows  an  early  division  between  rural  and  urban  interests  in  \nTynwald.  It  was  implied  that  more  money  could  be  made  from  holding  \nmotor  racing  events  on  the  island  than  could  be  made  from  farming.  \nKerruish viewed the £10,000 spent by those who came to the island to take \npart in the TT as a good enough reason for the races to continue. This was \nnot as large a sum as would be generated by the races in future years, but \nthe  money  would  be  spent  in  Douglas  and  it  is  therefore  reasonable  to  \nassume  that  it  would  largely  benefit  Kerruish’s  constituents.  The  TT  was  \nthen, in Kerruish’s opinion, far more profitable than agriculture. Kerruish \nwas not alone by 1912 in stressing the potential economic value of the TT \nfor the Isle of Man. The vicar general, for example, argued that: \n \nI  do  not  say  that  they  [the  TT  races]  do  not  cause  some  noise  and  \ndiscomfort;  but,  speaking  from  a  financial  point  of  view,  there  can  be  no  \ndoubt that benefit is derived from the large number of persons coming over \nhere and from the money expended in connection with this competition.\n24\n  \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n21\n Kermode, Offshore Island Politics, p. 71.  \n22\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 January 1912, p. 189. \n23\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 January 1912, p. 189. \n24\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 187."

We  might  also  suggest  that  the  money  \nspent  in  connection  with  the  competition  would  mostly  be  retained  by  \nbusinesses  located  in  Douglas  the  island’s  largest  town  (Fig.  2-1).  This  \nlocalised  advantage  was  certainly  picked  up  on  by  some  critics.  Clucas  \nopposed the TT’s continuation, and his objections were based partly on the \nexploitation of the Isle of Man by the ACU and the Automobile Club, but \nalso  because  he  reckoned  the  races  benefited  only  Douglas,  and  no  other  \nareas of the island: \n \nI never could see why this Island should be made the playground of these \npeople,  either  the  Automobile  Society  or  the  Auto  Cycle  Society,  or  that  \nmanufacturers  or  traders  should  use  it  as  a  ground  for  testing  their  \nmachines.  The  hon.  member  for  South  Douglas  states  that  a  great  deal  of  \nmoney is spent on the Island as a result of this race. I have no doubt that as \nfar as that applies to Douglas, it is right; but of the other parts of the Island \neven  this  cannot  be  said  in  their  favour  and  people  along  the  route  of  the  \nrace have to suffer the inconvenience.\n25\n  \n \nNevertheless,  the  TT  was  supported  because,  in  the  view  of  most  \nmembers  of  Tynwald,  they  were  profitable  for  the  island  and  therefore  \nnecessary. In the words of the Vicar General, “we [the Manx] live entirely \nby  our  attractions,  and  by  obtaining  whatever  prominence  we  can  get  for  \nthe  attractions  that  we  have  to  offer.  We  are  really  an  entertaining  place,  \nand  we  depend  for  our  livelihood  on  our  power  to  attract  visitors.”\n26\n \nKerruish  had  relayed  on  a  rumour  that  the  French  were  keen  to  run  the  \nevent and that the corporation of Dieppe was even prepared to subsidise a \nTT race to the amount of £4,000. He argued that “I do not know how far \nthat  this  statement  is  true,  but  at  any  rate  they  [the  French]  are  extremely  \nanxious to take our leavings, if we are saucy enough to reject this event.”\n27\n \nAccordingly,  Tynwald  endorsed  the  holding  of  the  TT  races  again  in  the  \nsummer of 1912.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n25\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 192. \n26\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 194.  \n27\n Debates, Vol. 29, 23 Jan. 1912, p. 192."

The \n1905  International  Cup  Race  at  Dourdon  was  won  by  the  Austrian  rider  \nWondrick,  and  this  gave  Austria  the  right  to  stage  the  1906  race.  The  \nproblem  faced  by  the  Auto  Cycle  Club  (ACC)  in  Britain  was  finding  a  \nvenue  to  hold  trials  for  this  forthcoming  race;  the  Automobile  Club  had  \nfaced  a  similar  problem  for  motor  races  in  1904.\n29\n  These  trials  could  not  \nbe held alongside the motor car Tourist Trophy race, as had been the case \nin  1905,  because  the  car  races  were  not  due  to  be  held  until  September  \n1906 and trials earlier in this year were needed. The ACC did not have the \nfunds  to  organise  its  own  race  on  the  Isle  of  Man,  a  possible  location  \nbecause  of  the  legislation  that  had  been  passed  in  1904  and  1905.  Their  \nproblem was solved by the Hon Arthur Stanley, the Club’s president, who \narranged  for  a  short  speed  course  to  be  laid  out  in  the  grounds  of  \nKnowsley  Hall.  The  team  was  selected  at  these  trials,  and  travelled  to  \nAustria,  but  it  enjoyed  little  success.  The  Austrian  course  was  poor  and  \ncomplaints  were  made  that  the  Austrian  riders  had  received  unauthorised  \noutside assistance. Subsequently, “just as the Gordon Bennett Trophy had \ndone,   the   International   Cup   disappeared   into   limbo.”\n30\n The   Gordon \nBennett motorcar races had given way to the Tourist Trophy car races in \n1905 and, as we have seen, in 1907 the International Cup was replaced by \nthe  motorcycle  Tourist  Trophy  (TT)  race,  held  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  The  \ninterest   of   manufacturers   in   organising   this   race   now   needs   to   be   \nexplained.  \nThe   dissatisfaction   with   the   International   Cup   and   the   desire   of   \nmotorcycle  enthusiasts  to  hold  a  race  of  their  own  led  Freddie  Straight,  \nsecretary  of  the  ACC,  and  the  Marquis  de  Mouzilly  St.  Mars,  who  \nprovided a trophy for the event, to work hard to organise the first TT race \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n28\n  Such  advertisements  can  be  found  in  The  Times  from  the  beginning  of  the  \nmotorcar Tourist Trophy in 1905 up to 1914.

It was hoped then that \nthe  entry  fees  for  the  TT  along  with  donations  would  cover  the  cost  of  \nrunning  it.  The  rules  for  the  races  caused  several  arguments  between  \norganisers  and  competitors,  but  they  were  all  concerned  with  improving  \nthe  motorcycle  as  a  mode  of  transport.  Questions  were  asked  about  such  \nmatters  as  the  length  of  the  course,  engine  capacities,  weight  limits  and  \neven  the  size  of  mudguards.  Eventually  it  was  agreed  that  the  deciding  \nfactor  in  the  race  would  be  fuel  consumption;  a  far  cry  from  the  modern  \nrace  which  focuses  on  speed.  An  agreement  was  reached  which  divided  \nthe  race  into  two  classes;  the  first  for  single-cylinder  machines  and  the  \nsecond  for  multi-cylinder  machine.  It  was  also  decided  that  the  prize  for  \nthis  event  would  be  £25  for  each  of  the  winners  and  £15  and  £10  for  the  \nrunners up. \nOn  this  basis  the  motorcycle  TT  took  place  each  year  between  1907  \nand  1911,  and  attracted  teams  put  together  by  prominent  manufacturers.  \nJudging only from the list of prize winners, many of the famous (and some \nless   famous)   motorcycle   manufacturers   shared   the   honours:   Norton,   \nMatchless,  Triumph  and  Indian  taking  most  spots,  but  also  making  their  \nmark were Vindec, Rex, D.O.T, B.A.T, F.N, Humber and Forward. Riders \nhad successfully navigated a twisting and hilly course of over 150 miles in \nraces  lasting  initially  over  five  hours  and  at  average  speeds  which  over  a  \nmere  five  years  considerably  increased.\n31\n In  1911, The  Motor  Cycle \nconfirmed  the  purpose  of  the  races  when  it  argued  that  “it  is  generally  \nconceded   that   the   TT   racer   of   today   possesses   features   which   are   \nembodied  eventually  in  the  flexible  roadster  of  a  year  or  two  later...That  \nbeing  the  case,  there  is,  of  course,  more  raison  d’etre  for  the  race  than  \nappears  at  first  sight.”  It  was  also  claimed  “what  has  placed  the  British  \nmotor  industry  in  its  premier  position  is  nothing  more  or  less  than  first-\nclass reliable workmanship, assisted by competitions such as the TT races, \nthe 1,000 miles trials, and other events.”\n32\n \nHowever,  in  August  1911,  at  a  meeting  of  the  motorcycle  section  of  \nthe  Manufacturers’  Union,  a  proposal  was  put  forward  that  motorcycle  \nmanufacturers should boycott the TT, despite the existence of a report that \nadmitted  that  the  1911  TT  had  been  well  organised  and  that  invaluable  \nassistance had been given to the organisers by local residents, “cheerfully \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n31\n  It  has  to  be  conceded  that  the  list  on  results  does  not  indicate  whether  the  \nwinning  machines  were  entered  by  private  owners  or  manufacturers:  either  was  \nallowed.  \n32\n Motor Cycle, 7 September 1911, p.922."

      "text": "Picking Up Speed: Economics and Identity \n45\nand   conscientiously.”\n33\n   There   were   a   number   of   reasons   for   this   \ndissatisfaction, which were discussed by the Manufacturers’ Union and in \nthe  motorcycle  press.  First,  the  TT  did  not  continue  to  serve  its  intended  \npurpose  that,  as  we  have  seen  earlier,  was  to  improve  the  design  of  the  \nmotorcycle.  The  report  of  the  Manufacturers’  Union  on  the  1911  TT,  \nstated  that  this  had  been  run  as  a  race  which  from  a  mechanical  point  of  \nview   was   in   fact   not   a   race   that   sought   to   improve   the   “touring”   \nmotorcycle  but  a  “race  to  destruction”,  which  demonstrated  the  weakest  \npart of a machine “under extravagant conditions, not met by any tourist.”\n34\n \nIndeed,  an  article  in  The  Motor  Cycle  reported  that  “the  members  of  the  \nManufacturers’  Union  who  are  prepared  to  abstain  are  not  antagonistic  \ntowards racing, but they are of the opinion that the conditions of the Isle of \nMan  races  are  not  conducive  to  the  best  results,  i.e.,  the  perfection  of  a  \ntourist  mount”,  and  for  this  reason  it  was  declared  that  the  title  ‘tourist  \ntrophy’  was  a  “farcical  misnomer.”\n35\n  Evidently,  the  consequences  of  \nfailure  for  the  many  outweighed  the  virtues  of  success  for  the  few.  \nDissatisfaction  with  a  race  preoccupied  with  speed  was  also  expressed  in  \nthe letter sent by manufacturers to Raglan in 1912 (see above), which had \nregretted the emphasis that was placed on speed and which concluded that \nthe  TT  was  a  bad  influence  on  young  consumers.  It  was  also  pointed  out  \nthat motorcycle manufacturers were not getting as much publicity from the \nevent  as  they  might  have  hoped  for:  “The  average  newspaper  report”  it  \nwas  stated  was  “most  inadequate,  frequently  inaccurate  and  particularly  \nuninteresting’. Usually two lines is sufficient to report the race but a whole \ncolumn is devoted to hair-breadth scrapes and fatal accidents.”\n36\n  \nSecond, there was also some indication in the motorcycle press that the \ncosts  involved  in  preparing  for  the  TT  were  also  becoming  prohibitive.  \nThe  cost  of  travelling  to  the  island  was  considerable  in  comparison  to  \ncompeting   at   a   track   such   as   Brooklands.   These   expenses   included   \ntransporting and housing teams in boarding houses on the island during the \none  or  two  weeks  of  racing  and  shipping  motorcycles,  spare  parts,  tools  \nand  other  “impedimentia”  [sic]  across  the  water.  If  the  race  were  to  be  \nheld at Brooklands, expenditure would be less, even if the teams had to set \nup their base there for a week or so.\n37\n Furthermore, it was not just the cost \nthat was prohibitive but also the opportunities for debauchery presented in \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n33\n Report  of  the  Secretary  of  Motor  Cycle  Section  of  Manufacturers’  Union,  \nMinutes Book 1909-1912.  \n34\n Report of the Secretary of Motor Cycle Section of Manufacturers’ Union.  \n35\n Motor Cycle, 19 Oct. 1911, p. 1132.  \n36\n Report of the Secretary of Motor Cycle Section of Manufacturers’ Union. \n37\n Motor Cycle, 7 Sept. 1911, p. 922."

It  was  reported  in  The  Motor  Cycle  that  the  Manufacturers’  \nUnion believed that “the general holiday surroundings at a sea-side resort \nlike Douglas are not conducive to that thorough training and self-restraint \nwhich a severe contest like the TT race imposes on those who take part in \nit.”\n38\n  It  was  argued  that,  whilst  no  one  could  object  to  a  little  harmless  \namusement  during  TT  week,  some  forms  of  amusement  did  not  promote  \nthe health and sobriety of the competitors. It was felt therefore that a few \nriders  who  could  not  resist  temptation  “instead  of  coming  to  the  starting  \npost with clear heads and strong nerves, are physically unfit to take part in \nany    strenuous    form    of    competition.”\n39\n Tension    existed   between \nmanufacturers who saw the TT as a test bed for their machines and those, \nthe  riders,  who  liked  to  enjoy  their  stay  on  the  island.  Here  then  was  a  \nboycott,  which  threatened  the  continuation  of  the  TT,  even  though,  as  we  \nhave seen, the Manx legislature endorsed its continuation. \nThis state of affairs was not maintained for long. Early in 1912, on the \ninstigation  of  a  representative  from  Triumph,  the  manufacturers  who  had  \nsigned the original bond were released from it.\n40\n However, manufacturers \nwere  not  released  from  the  bond  early  enough  to  participate  in  the  1912  \nTT.  It  is  clear  from  the  discussion  above  that  motorcycle  manufacturers  \nviewed the TT as a test bed for their machines. Evidently they would not \ncommit  themselves  to  the  event  when  speed  was  the  only  issue  to  be  \ntested.  The  1912  boycott,  however,  was  only  a  minor  disagreement  with  \nthe purpose of the race. Manufacturers returned in 1913 and 1914 to race \non  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  there  was  the  presence  of  Indian,  Sunbeam,  AJS  \nand Royal Enfield. Clearly the commercial benefits associated with the TT \nwere too good to reject. \nWe  can  also  see  that  motorcycle  manufacturers  were  keen  to  stage  a  \nrace in which the design and reliability of the motorcycle would be tested, \nand the motorcycle press, motorcycle manufacturers and the Manufacturers’ \nUnion  also  believed  that  this  was  the  purpose  of  the  TT  race.  By  1912,  \nhowever,  it  was  believed  that  the  TT  had  become  a  test  of  speed.  The  \nmanufacturers’  boycott  of  the  TT  in  1912  highlights  their  reluctance  to  \naccept the TT as a test bed merely for speed. However, the entry of teams \nby several manufacturers in 1913 and 1914 suggest that they were finding \nthe TT irresistible as a showcase for their machines.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n38\n Motor Cycle, 26 Oct. 1911, p.1132.  \n39\n Motor Cycle, 26 Oct. 1911, p.1132.  \n40\n  Meeting  of  Motor  Cycle  Section,  Feb.  21  1921,  Manufacturers’  Union  Minute  \nBook 1909-1912."

In \neither case motor racing was not judged as a sporting event or even as an \neconomic  opportunity  but  as  indicative,  one  way  or  another,  of  Manx  \ndistinctiveness  and  separation  from  the  UK.  It  will  also  be  shown  that  by  \n1914  only  in  the  motorcycle  press,  and,  to  a  lesser  extent  in  some  of  the  \nnational UK press was the Isle of Man recognised as being peculiarly the \nhome of motor races.  \nFirst  of  all,  it  must  be  pointed  out  that  motor  racing  historians  have  \ncasually assumed that holding competitive motorcycle races on the Isle of \nMan from 1907 was not a problem for the Manx people. They were, it is \nsaid,  “starting  to  get  used  to  the  idea  of  their  homeland  becoming  the  \nworld  centre  for  motor  sport”,  presumably  because  motorcar  races  had  \nbeen held on the island since 1904. Apparently “road closures, barricades, \nambulance  stations  and  marshals  were  considered  the  norm,  not  in  the  \nleast inconvenient and a small price to pay, particularly if it meant putting \nthe Island on the map for the, by now, improving visitor arrivals.”\n44\n There \nis,  however,  no  robust  evidence  to  support  such  claims,  though  it  is  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n41\n  John  Urry  puts  forward  the  idea  that  tourist  destinations  are  marketed  in  a  \nparticular  way.

However,  when  we  \nlook  more  closely  at  the  way  the  island’s  Board  of  Advertising  marketed  \nthe Isle of Man and at the Celtic renaissance that took place on the island \nduring  the  pre-war  years,  it  become  less  credible  that  the  Manx  people  \n“welcomed”  the  TT  races,  despite  the  island’s  growing  association  with  \nmass tourism.\n45\n  \nThe  1898  Isle  of  Man  Official  Guide  introduced  the  island  in  the  \nfollowing way. It stated that: \n \nThe beauty-loving Italians of the South have a proverb – ‘See Naples, and \ndie’  ...  It  is  the  Manxman,  who,  beyond  question,  dwells  in  one  of  the  \nloveliest lands on the earth’s wide surface. He, too, can boast of a country \nwhose scenery is so uniquely beautiful, so diversified in aspect, so rich in \nhistorical  associations  and  in  the  memories  of  a  greater  past,  that  we  can  \nsympathise  with  the  patriotic  Italian,  and  echo  his  proud  boast  –  ‘See  \nManxland, or you have missed one of the brightest spots on earth’\n46\n \n \nWe can immediately see here the construction of the Isle of Man as a place \nthat  had  great  natural  beauty  and  a  distinctive  history,  and  these  were  \npromoted  as  reasons  to  visit  the  island.  This  construction  was  maintained  \nin a 1902 Board of Advertising lecture entitled “Picturesque Mona.” In the \nbooklet  that  accompanied  this  lecture  it  was  stated,  “Of  all  places  in  the  \nUnited  Kingdom  there  is  none  more  adapted  for  the  enjoyment  of  a  \nSummer  Holiday  than  this  picturesque  Island.  Here  every  taste  may  be  \ngratified.”  It  went  on  to  describe  further  the  natural  attractions  of  the  \nisland,   pointing   out   that   “the   Artist   will   find,   in   its   well-rounded   \nmountains, its rolling landscape and charming glens, ample inspiration for \nhis  pencil.”  The  naturalist  and  botanist,  it  was  noted,  would  find  ample  \nscope for their studies, the geologist would find a wide range of interesting \nfeatures, and the archaeologist could take pleasure in the island’s druidical \ncircles and runic remains. The Island was also “unrivalled for yachting and \nrowing;  river,  bay  and  deep  sea  fishing;  bathing,  coaching,  cycling,  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n45\n  Further  comment  on  the  reaction  of  some  in  the  island  to  the  development  of  \nmass   tourism   can   be   found   in   J.   Belchem,   ‘“The   Playground   of   Northern   \nEngland”:  The  Isle  of  Man,  Manxness  and  the  Northern  Working  Class’,  in  N.  \nKirk  (ed.),  Northern  Identities:  Historical  Interpretations  of  ‘The  North’  and  \n‘Northernness’, (Aldershot, Ashgate, 2000), pp. 71 – 86.  \n46\n Isle of Man Official Guide 1898, issued by the Board of Advertising."

Indeed,  this  remained  unchanged  even  after  \n1904. Official guides published annually during the pre-war years always \nfocused on the more traditional aspects of the island, with no reference at \nall to motor racing or specifically to the TT in the pre-war decade.\n48\n \nThe  pre-war  years  also  saw  the  first  phase  of  the  Manx  renaissance.  \n(The second and third phases took place during the inter-war and post-war \nperiods).\n49\n Efforts were made to revive the Manx language and other more \n“traditional”  aspects  of  Manx  culture.  This  was  partly  a  reaction  to  the  \nisland’s development as a working-class tourist destination, and partly as a \nresult  of  the  Manx  elite’s  desire  to  engage  in  the  wider  Celtic  revival  \ntaking  place  in  the  late  nineteenth  century.\n50\n  This  “renaissance”  might  \nhave  attracted  a  better  class  of  visitor  by  bringing  the  more  traditional  \nattractions  of  the  island  to  the  forefront,  ahead  of  the  dancing  halls  and  \ndrinking  establishments  frequented  by  the  working-class  tourist.  This  \nwould  have  defined  the  island’s  difference  to  resorts  such  as  Blackpool  \nand  Morecambe,  which  could  not  boast  of  a  Celtic  and  Norse  past.\n51\n As \nBelchem puts it: \n \nWithout    abandoning    ‘high’    and    polite    cosmopolitan    norms,    the    \ngentlemanly  antiquarians  of  the  ‘Manx  renaissance’  of  the  late  nineteenth  \nand    early    twentieth    centuries    girded    themselves    against    cultural    \nanglicanisation  through  assertion  of  ethnic  Celticism,  a  project  which  \ntended to downgrade Norse contributions to the island’s past.\n52\n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n47\n  ‘“Picturesque  Mona”:  Some  Beauty  Spots  on  the  Isle  of  Man’,  (Isle  of  Man  \nBoard of Advertising, 1902), p.3-4.  \n48\n See Isle of Man Official Guides 1900 – 1914.  \n49\n These phases are pointed to in G.

Moore,  protected  themselves  against  “anglicanisation”  was  through  \nthe   establishment   of   the   Manx   Language   Society,   Yn   Cheshaght   \nGailckagh (YCG).\n53\n Broderick suggests that the establishment of the Manx \nLanguage  Society,  with  A.W.  Moore  as  its  chairman,  marked  the  first  \nphase  in  the  revival  of  the  Manx  language.\n54\n  The  establishment  of  this  \nsociety was influenced by the wider Celtic revival emanating from Ireland \nin the late nineteenth century. The aims of YCG were to preserve Manx as \nthe  national  language  of  the  Isle  of  Man  and  to  study  existing  Gaelic  \nliterature and cultivate modern Manx literature. YCG also sought to have \nManx taught in schools, to promote Manx music and songs and to collect \nrelevant  oral  literature  from  the  Manx  people.  The Isle  of  Man  Examiner \nalso  promoted  the  Manx  language,  printing  a  column  in  Manx  and  \nincluding  material  on  Manx  folklore.\n55\n  However,  there  was  a  gradual  \ndecline in enthusiasm for the Manx language, epitomised by the folding of \nthe  journal  Mannin  in  1917,  which  had  been  published  by  YCG  since  \n1913,  after  the  death  of  its  editor  Sophia  Morrison.\n56\n This  journal  had \nincluded  reports  of  the  Manx  language  society,  and  articles  commenting  \non Manx culture and traditions.  \nYCG  in  seeking  to  revive  the  Manx  language  failed  to  recognise  the  \nfact  that  the  majority  of  the  island’s  population  had  abandoned  the  Manx  \nlanguage in favour of English in order to grasp the economic opportunities \npresented  by  tourism.\n57\n  Indeed,  census  data  supports  this.  From  this  we  \ncan see that of a total population of 51,409 (over the age of three years) in \n1901 only 59 spoke Manx only, 4,598 Manx and English, and 46,699 only \nEnglish.  In  Douglas,  the  island’s  largest  urban  area,  there  were  17,068  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n53\n  A.W.  Moore  (1853  -  1909)  was  an  historian  and  Manx  scholar.  He  published  a  \nlarge  amount  of  work  concerning  the  history,  culture  and  traditions  of  the  Isle  of  \nMan,  including  his  two  volumes  work  A  History  of  the  Isle  of  Man.

Of \ncourse there was also a distinctive Manx polity. The Isle of Man was home \nto and indeed very proud of Tynwald its Norse Parliament, which had met \ncontinuously  for  over  900  years  by  now.  The  Tynwald  ceremony  was  \ncarried  out  annually  on  5  July,  where  new  legislation  was  read  to  the  \nManx  people.  These  elements  provided  the  ingredients  by  which  identity  \nwas  constructed  during  the  pre-war  years,  and  it  was  the  Tynwald  \nparliament  that  made  the  Isle  of  Man  especially  distinctive,  and  this  \nlegislative  independence  was  very  important,  as  episodes  in  1908  and  \n1912 reveal. \nThe “Isle of Manslaughter” \nIn 1908 the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) promoted a motor car race \nwhere speed was most important and fuel consumption did not matter. The \n1908 TT race for motorcars, which became known as the “four-inch race” \nas  a  result  of  cars  with  more  powerful  four-inch  cylinder  engines  being  \nraced,  was  scheduled  to  take  place  in  September  1908.  However,  on  12  \nAugust  1908,  Motoring  Illustrated  reported  that  racing  at  the  Brooklands  \nracetrack in Surrey had been marred by fatalities and also on the same day \nat the Dieppe circuit in France. This had a bearing on the TT race that, in \nthe   opinion   of   Motoring   Illustrated,   “could   not   be   passed   over   in   \nsilence.”\n67\n  The  race  at  Brooklands  had  also  seen  the  5.8  litre  Napier,  \n“Little  Dorrit”,  achieve  speeds  of  up  to  83  mph.  As  the  1908  race  was  to  \nbe  run  without  any  limitations  being  put  on  motor  cars,  save  those  on  \ncylinder dimensions, the “four inch race” would be all about speed, rather \nthan  reliability  or  fuel  consumption  as  had  been  the  case  in  the  past.  As  \nthis  was  the  case,  it  was  estimated  that  speeds  of  over  60  mph  had  to  be  \nachieved to even contemplate winning. Nor could it be claimed that what \nwas  being  raced  were  models  subsequently  to  be  commercially  available.  \nMotoring  Illustrated  believed  that  the  organisers  of  the  event,  the  RAC,  \nhad   to   take   responsibility   for   anything   that   might   happen   to   the   \ncompetitors   or   the   spectators.\n68\n   This   provided   the   background   for   \ndemands, made by The Times for racing to be stopped on the Isle of Man. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n66\n  See  A.W.

      "text": "Picking Up Speed: Economics and Identity \n53\nThe Times’ campaign was the result of the focus placed on speed. The \nTimes felt  that  a  motor  race  in  which  cars  could  attain  speeds  of  80  mph  \nwas of considerable danger. However, it was acknowledged that there was \nno easy way to bring about its cancellation.\n69\n First, the UK authorities did \nnot constitutionally have the power to prohibit the race in the Isle of Man \nsince the island was not part of the UK. The Times suggested that even if \nthey did have the power they would not exercise it. The Home Office was \nunlikely to get involved in an event that took place on the Isle of Man, and \nwas the enthusiasm of a wealthy sporting elite. Moreover, the programme \nof  racing  had  already  been  arranged  with  the  sanction  of  the  island’s  \nlieutenant  governor  and  the  Isle  of  Man  Highway  Board.  The  Times \nindicated that these authorities would have a natural reluctance to reverse \ntheir  decisions.  Furthermore,  The  Times  believed  that  the  races  had  \nregrettably  come  to  be  supported  by  at  least  some  of  the  Manx  people.  \nAfter  all  “catering  for  strangers  is  one  of  the  most  important  of  Manx  \nindustries and the inhabitants rely largely upon the harvest they reap from \nthe  summer  visitors.”\n70\n  The  Steam  Packet  Company  benefited  from  \ntransporting people to the races; hotels and boarding houses put them up. \nThe Times estimated the amount of money spent in the island as a result of \nthe  races  was  £5000.  “The  question  arises  what  reason  is  there  for  \nsummarily  putting  an  end  to  an  event  from  which  the  people  derive  so  \nmuch pleasure and profit?”\n71\n The answer was that despite the profits made \nfrom the races by the Isle of Man, if indeed this was the case, the four-inch \nrace was not aimed at the development of the motor car, but rather at a few \nmembers  of  an  elite  group  getting  around  the  Isle  of  Man  as  fast  as  they  \ncould putting themselves and others at risk. \nInterestingly The  Times  also  insisted  that  motor  racing  was  becoming  \nembedded  in  a  Manx  sense-of-self.  It  was reported  that  the  view  of  the  \nManx people towards the cancellation of the race would be one of “almost \nuniversal opposition ... A few carping critics here and there may be found \nto  raise  objections  to  the  races  but  by  the  vast  majority  of  the  Manx  \npopulation  the  races  are  looked  forward  to  with  the  greatest  interest.”\n72\n \nEvidently The  Times  believed  that  most  of  the  Manx  wished  to  see  the  \nraces go ahead, yet there is little evidence to suggest that the Manx people \nwere   strongly   in   favour   of   motor   racing.   Certainly   the   possible   \ncancellation  of  the  four-inch  race  was  rarely  mentioned  in  Tynwald  or  in  \nthe  Manx  press.  However,  two  letters  were  published  in  The  Isle  of  Man  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n69\n The Times, 24 August 1908, p. 9. \n70\n The Times, 22 August 1908, p. 9. \n71\n The Times, 24 August 1908, p. 6. \n72\n The Times, 24 August 1908, p. 6."

      "text": "Chapter Two \n54\nWeekly Times, which indicated some support for motor races on the island. \nBoth were attributed to “a dweller beside the motor track.” The first letter \nstated the absurdity of cancelling the races in 1908: \n \nThe idea of stopping the motor race is too absurd to be given consideration \nfor a moment. The whole island is on the lookout for them, on the Qui Vive \nas  some  would  say  ...  I  am  totally  against  pandering  to  England.  The  \nservile  following  of  precedents,  a  failure  of  the  present  day,  making  what  \nHorace calls a servile pecus – a servile horde following England in place of \nleading  her,  as  well  I  know  to  have  been  the  case  in  by-gone  days,  and  a  \ngreater mistake was never made, proved by the fact that when in the Island \ncosts  of  living  and  other  things  differed,  retired  officers  and  their  families  \ncame to live there; but ... when the tendency is to make all as much alike \nas  possible  none  will  come.  ...Vindicate  your  home  rule!  Stop  following  \nEnglishmen and have your motor races and any others you like!\n73\n  \n \nThe second letter commented on the issue of safety surrounding the four-\ninch race. Once again support for the races was offered, but in rather more \nmacabre terms: \n \nThe English papers seem to lay great stress upon the dangers of the motor \nraces.  If  men  avoided  all  danger,  they  would  never  go  to  battle,  or  ride  a  \nhunt  or  a  race  or  go  out  to  sea  on  a  rough  day  or  go  up  in  a  balloon.  The  \npoint is to keep the public out of danger and if that is properly done, no one \nshould  mind  if  the  races  only  get  some  spills  as  men  do  in  the  hunting  \nfields or the race field. Should most unfortunately death befall, man is but \nmortal: and how often in the train on shore or the ship in the sea does death \ntake place suddenly and unexpectedly. Still people go in them.\n74\n \n \nFrom  these  letters  it  is  apparent  that  the  continuation  of  the  race  was  \nimportant  to  some  of  those  living  on  the  island.  The  first  highlights  the  \nsense  that  the  presence  of  this  motor  race  on  the  island  made  the  Isle  of  \nMan  unique.  Moreover,  because  the  races  aggravated  the  English,  this  \nalone seemed justification enough for them to go ahead. Even the potential \nfor fatalities, the subject of the second letter, as a result of increased speed, \nhad little effect on the desire of some of the Manx to see motor racing take \nplace  on  the  island  once  again  in  1908.  It  is  therefore  possible  to  argue  \nfrom  this  evidence  that  what  had  been  imposed  by  Raglan  in  1904  was  \nnow  being  accepted  by  some  of  the  islanders.  Indeed,  this  can  be  taken  \nfurther  to  suggest  that  already  some  of  the  Manx  were  defending  their \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n73\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 12 September 1908, p. 4. \n74\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 12 September 1908, p. 4."

It  seems  that  in  this  instance  \n“Home Rule” might be taken to mean anything including motor racing that \nmight irritate the English.  \nThis was, however, far from an acceptance of motor racing as such by \nthe Manx people, rather it was a further insistence on difference from the \nUK.  The  events  of  1908  show  more  than  the  fact  that  the  TT  had  been  \ngiven  the  new  dimension  of  speed.  They  also  show  that  only  four  years  \nafter  racing  had  been  imposed  on  the  island,  the  Isle  of  Man  was  slowly  \nbecoming  associated,  externally,  with  motor  racing.  While  the  Manx  \npublic  or  even  the  Manx  authorities  were  not  yet  consciously  promoting  \nmotor racing as part of their identity, it may be argued that the two letters \npublished  in  The  Weekly  Times  show  that  a  minority  of  the  Manx  were  \nbeginning to defend the races, as a distinguishing feature of Manx identity \nand the product of its separate history.  \nWhen  the  Manx  legislature  sought  to  defend  the  continuation  of  the  \nevent in 1912, issues of independence and identity were again raised. Even \nthe attorney general, who objected to the TT in 1912, accepted that the TT \nattracted   some   local   support   because   it   made   the   island   distinctive.   \nHowever, his opposition was similarly based on the notion that the Isle of \nMan  was  independent  and  special.  The  TT  was  “so  objectionable,  so  \ndangerous,  not  only  to  the  people  who  engage  in  it  but  to  the  public,  and  \nso  disturbing  to  the  reasonable  comfort  of  the  people,  that  the  British  \nParliament will not listen to it, and the only chance is to come to the Isle of \nMan,  the  opinion  formed  of  us  being  ‘Oh,  you  will  get  anything  there  as  \nlong  as  it  advertises  the  Island’.”\n75\n  This  was  an  objection  not  merely  to  \nmotorcycle racing on the Isle of Man but to the implicit degradation of the \nManx   implied   in   tolerating   an   intrusion   from   outside   that   was   not   \nacceptable  on  the  mainland.

This  event,  which  is  \nlooked   forward   to   with   the   greatest   interest   by   practically   every   \nmotorcyclist in the United Kingdom and the British dominions beyond the \nseas, is the only road race we are allowed to have. It is a test for man and \nmachine  which  can  be  obtained  in  no  other  way,  and  beside  it  a  long-\ndistance race on Brooklands is dreary, tame and boresome to a degree.\n77\n \n \nClearly,  this  “magnificent  event”  was  beginning  to  have  a  bearing  on  \nthe  way  outsiders,  especially  motorcycle  enthusiasts,  viewed  the  Isle  of  \nMan. This was not as yet an internally projected viewpoint; Manx opinion \non  the  TT  as  an  expression  of  their  community  remained  ambivalent.  \nCertainly  the  Manx  authorities  were  not  yet  promoting  the  island  as  the  \nhome of motorcycle racing, although this was the way that motor cycling \nenthusiasts viewed the Isle of Man. What this does show is that what had \nbeen  imposed  in  1904  had  now  become  an  externally  recognised  part  of  \nManx identity, in the motorcycling community at least.  \nConclusion to Part One \nIn  1907  an  arrangement  of  “Mylecharaine”,  the  most  popular  and  \nversatile of Manx songs, was adopted as the Manx National Anthem – “O \nland  of  our  birth,  O  gem  of  God’s  earth,  O  Island  so  strong  and  so  fair;  \nBuilt as firm as Barrule, thy throne of Home Rule.”\n78\n The line “thy throne \nof  Home  Rule”  may  be  seen  as  a  reference  to  the  desire  of  reformists  to  \nmaintain   their   independence   from   the   UK   parliament.   Those   Manx   \nscholars  involved  with  the  Manx  renaissance  during  the  early  twentieth  \ncentury  sought  to  highlight  the  island’s  distinctiveness  by  promoting  its  \ntraditional  Gaelic  language  and  culture.  Yet  it  was  Tynwald,  the  Manx  \nlegislature  and  the  focal  point  of  the  island’s  Norse  identity,  which  met  \nevery  year  on  5  July  to  promulgate  Manx  laws  in  a  perpetuation  of  an  \nancient  Norse  ceremony  that  with  very  little  effort  brought  the  island’s  \nseparateness  to  the  foreground  by  passing  legislation  for  motor  racing  on  \nthe island, in one day, in 1904. This decision would, unintentionally affect \nconstructions   of   Manx   identity   during   the   following   century   more   \nstrongly, it might be argued, than language or culture. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n77\n Motor Cycle, 9 November 1911, p. 1165. \n78\n  F.

This gap in racing \nmight have led to the end of the races if there had been no political support \nfor  their  resumption  after  World  War  One  or  if  there  had  been  doubts  \nabout   the   potential   economic   value   of   the   races   for   motorcycle   \nmanufacturers and the Manx economy, even if the TT had not yet become \nan  ingredient  of  Manx  identity.

Raglan  had  defined  his  role  in  the  colonial  tradition,  but  the  \nlieutenant  governors  of  the  inter-war  period  were  by  comparison  “liberal  \nin  outlook,  sympathetic  to  the  interests  of  the  Island  and  more  willing  to  \nbe  advised  by  the  elected  representatives  of  the  Manx  people.”\n8\n After  the \nreplacement  of  Raglan  by  Sir  William  Fry,  constitutional  change  looked  \nmore likely to take place. It has been further suggested that in this period \n“a  new  Lieutenant-Governor,  a  reform-minded  House  of  Keys  and  a  \nreconstituted  Legislative  Council  co-operated  to  deliver  a  package  of  \nsocial and economic reforms that were to transform the role of the state in \nManx  society.”\n9\n  It  is  not  the  transformation  of  the  role  of  the  state  that  is  \nimportant here, but the suggestion that the new lieutenant governors were, \nunlike Raglan, sympathetic to and willing to co-operate with the different \nsections of the legislature. \nThe  formal  structure  of  the  Manx  legislature  remained  the  same  –  \nlieutenant  governor,  Legislative  Council,  House  of  Keys  and  Tynwald  –  \nbut  from  1919  the  practice  of  government  changed.\n10\n The  lieutenant \ngovernor was now only to be appointed for a fixed term of seven years, as \nrecommended  by  the  MacDonnell  Committee.  He  remained  head  of  the  \nexecutive,   but   further   changes   between   the   wars   required   more   \ncooperation  between  the  elements  of  the  constitution.  For  example,  Fry  \nsupported  the  passage  through  the  Legislative  Council  of  the  Isle  of  Man  \nJudicature  (Amendment)  Act  1921.  This  removed  him  from  the  High  \nCourt  of  Justice,  thus  creating  an  independent  judiciary  and  limiting  the  \nlieutenant governor’s power – a step that would have been out of character \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n6\n Report of the Departmental Committee on the Constitution of the Isle of Man, 31 \nAugust 1911, (H.M.S.O., 1911). \n7\n J.

This  was  an  unofficial  committee  of  five  members,  which  he  \nwould consult on matters relating to the governing of the island. This went \nsome  way  to  reducing  demands  from  the  House  of  Keys  for  an  official  \nexecutive council to advise the lieutenant governor. Hill’s opinion was that \nthe  reliance  merely  on  “irregular  and  informal  consultations”  which  had  \nbeen the case previously, had left “a good deal to be desired.”\n11\n  \nThe Legislative Council was also reformed according to the suggestions \nof  the  MacDonnell  Committee.  This  meant  that  the  Council  would  come  \nto  be  composed  of  ten  members,  with  the  lieutenant  governor  continuing  \nto preside. Members would include two deemsters, the bishop, the attorney \ngeneral  and  two  nominees  of  the  lieutenant  governor.  However,  four  \nmembers were to be elected by the House of Keys from the membership of \nthe  House.  These  reforms  meant  that  the  archdeacon,  the  vicar  general  –  \nwho had previously supported the continuation of the TT in 1912 – one of \nthe deemsters and the receiver general, would lose their seats. This meant \na reduction in the members appointed ex officio by the lieutenant governor \nand,  therefore,  of  potential  support  for  Hill,  or  any  future  lieutenant  \ngovernor. \nOn  meeting  the  House  of  Keys  in  1919,  Deemster  Moore  commented  \nthat this was the fifth cohort of members whom he had welcomed into the \nHouse  of  Keys,  and  he  “remembered  no  House  in  which  he  had  seen  so  \nmany  new  faces.”\n12\n  Indeed,  the  1919  election,  and  the  four  by-elections  \nheld  as  a  result  of  the  election  of  the  four  members  of  the  Keys  to  the  \nLegislative  Council,  produced  a  radically  changed  membership  in  the  \nHouse of Keys. Of the 24 members, there was a new speaker, fifteen new \nmembers  and  a  further  six  members  who  had  served  only  one  term.  \nFredrick Clucas, who was elected to the position of Speaker of the House \nof  Keys  (he  held  this  position  between  1919  and  1937),  Samuel  Norris,  \nnewly elected to the Keys, and Richard Cain had all been associated with \nthe  Manx  reform  movement  since  1903.  Such  a  composition  of  the  Keys  \nwould  make  it  less  likely  that  the  new  lieutenant  governor  could  merely  \nimpose  motor  racing  on  the  island  like  his  predecessor.  Subsequent  \nelections  to  the  Keys  in  1924,  1929  and  1934  saw  little  change  in  the  \nKeys’ membership.  \nTynwald’s board system also developed during this period. During the \npre-war  years  it  was  primarily  members  of  the  Legislative  Council  who  \nacted  as  chairs  of  boards,  thus  limiting  the  opportunities  for  members  of  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n11\n Kermode, Offshore Island Politics, p. 88.  \n12\n Norris, Manx Memories and Movements, p. 338."

MHKs  also  took  on  greater  \nresponsibility  for  providing  chairs  for  these  boards.  Deemsters  were  also  \nno  longer  involved  with  the  work  of  the  boards,  further  reducing  the  \ninfluence  of  the  lieutenant  governor’s  appointees  in  this  system.  The  \nHighway  Board  chose  W.C.  Southward  (South  Douglas),  an  elected  \nmember  of  the  Legislative  Council,  to  act  as  chairman  throughout  the  \ninter-war period, and he would offer strong support for the continuation of \nthe TT races. \nWe can see therefore that although the lieutenant governor retained his \nexecutive authority, where the day-to-day administration of the island was \nconcerned   greater   co-operation   was   required   between   himself   and   \nmembers of Tynwald. Also, a newly elected House of Keys and reformed \nLegislative  Council  that  now  included  elected  members,  meant  the  need  \nfor   greater   co-operation   between   the   lieutenant   governor   and   these   \nlegislative  bodies.  Therefore  there  would  be  a  much-reduced  chance  of  a  \nfurther imposition of motor racing by the lieutenant governor after World \nWar  One.  Indeed,  the  political  decisions  taken  by  the  Manx  in  respect  of  \nthe   TT   during   the   inter-war   period   would   require   a   much   greater   \nconsensus of opinion. An important part in these developments, however, \nwas  that  there  was  no  Raglan.  Although  his  imposition  had  given  the  \nManx  the  TT  races,  it  was  left  to  a  new  generation  of  politicians  in  the  \nKeys and the Legislative Council to decide on the TT’s future.  \n1920 – 1922: Revival of the TT \nThe 1905 Highways (Motor Car) Act had stipulated that the Highway \nBoard had the authority to close public roads for races by both motorcars \nand  motorcycles  on  the  application  of  any  person  or  club.  The  Act  had  \nalso made these powers exercisable only for one year, unless renewed by a \nresolution  in  Tynwald.  During  the  pre-war  period  the  ACU  had  applied  \neach year to the Highway Board for permission to hold the TT and in each \ncase  this  permission  had  been  granted  by  the  lieutenant  governor  and  in  \neffect  with  the  automatic  approval  of  Tynwald.\n14\n  Similarly,  after  a  brief  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n13\n Kermode, Offshore Island Politics, pp. 56-57.  \n14\n See Highway Board Minutes for Pre-War Period."

However,  on  this  occasion  the  views  of  the  elected  representatives  \nwere heard, but those present raised little objection.  \nIn  supporting  the  resolution  for  the  1920  TT,  Drinkwater,  who  had  \npreviously  been  an  MHK  but  by  1920  was  an  appointed  member  of  the  \nLegislative  Council,  argued,  “a  certain  amount  of  inconvenience  will  be  \ncaused  by  the  closing  of  the  roads,  but  the  Manx  people  are  sufficiently  \ngood  natured  enough  to  waive  any  trouble  of  that  sort.”\n15\n Callister,  MHK \nfor   the   rural   sheading   of   Glenfaba,   supported   Drinkwater,   arguing,   \n“considerable inconvenience is caused to the country people; but we are a \nlong  suffering  people  and  we  will  put  up  with  the  inconvenience.”\n16\n The \nopinions of these two members of Tynwald suggest that the revival of the \nTT races was more important than the inconvenience that would be caused \nto  some  Manx  people,  especially  in  rural  areas,  by  the  closing  of  public  \nroads  for  motorcycle  racing,  and  this  inconvenience  was  not  regarded  as  \nsignificant.  It  also  shows  that  debate  and  formal  approval  by  Tynwald  \nalong  with  greater  articulation  of  opinion,  and  not  just  by  the  will  of  the  \nlieutenant governor, now characterised the decision-making process where \nthe TT was concerned.  \nIn  November  1921,  W.C.  Southward,  in  his  role  as  chairman  of  the  \nHighway  Board,  introduced  a  resolution  into  Tynwald  that  would  again  \nextend the powers of the Highway Board for a further year, allowing it to \nclose roads for motorcycle racing, and for permission to be granted to the \nACU  and  RAC  for  motor  car  and  motorcycle  races  to  be  held  in  1922.  \nHowever, in proposing this resolution Southward pointed out that the 1905 \nlegislation had expired on 5 July 1921, and therefore a new bill had to be \nsubmitted to the legislature “at an early date, provided the Court approves \nof this resolution”, again demonstrating the need for consensus.\n17\n Callister, \na  member  of  the  Highway  Board,  who  in  1920  had  pointed  out  the  \ninconvenience  of  the  TT  to  the  Manx  people,  summed  up  his  feelings  on  \nthe matter further in this debate. His point of view was that: \n \nPersonally  I  would  say,  ‘No’.  But  I  am  not  going  to  vote  against  the  \nresolution,  although  I  know  right  well  that  more  people  are  dead  against  \nhaving  them  here  than  the  Court  is  aware  of.  It  is  all  very  well  for  the  \ntowns  to  demand  this,  because  they  benefit  by  it,  but  there  is  another  side  \nto  be  considered.

However,  if  the  \nmajority of the people want it, I am not going to vote against it.\n18\n \n \nCallister’s  attitude  reflects  the  stance  that  would  be  taken  by  other  \nmembers of Tynwald in respect of the TT during the inter-war period. He \nrecognised  that  the  island’s  towns,  especially  Douglas,  would  principally  \nbenefit  from  the  TT  and  that  those  living  in  rural  areas  or  on  the  circuit  \nwould suffer some inconvenience. The majority of the visitors for the TT, \nand indeed the TT riders and others associated with the races, would stay \nin  hotels  and  boarding  houses  in  Douglas.  Those  living  on  the  TT  course  \nwould  not  be  able  to  carry  out  their  usual  business  when  the  roads  were  \nclosed, and would, allegedly, be woken early in the morning by practising \nmotorcycles.  However,  rather  than  vote  against  holding  further  races  on  \nthe  island,  Callister  argued  that  if  the  majority  of  people  –  or  at  least  the  \nmajority  of  Tynwald  –  wanted  these  races,  he  would  not  vote  against  \nthem.  The  point  must  also  be  made  that  Callister  was  able  to  express  his  \nopinion  on  the  TT  and  could  choose  not  to  endorse  its  taking  place.  \nHowever,  what  can  be  seen  is  that  even  those  who  objected  to  the  event  \nendorsed its continuation. \nThe resolution to extend the powers of the Highway Board was further \ndiscussed in Tynwald on 8 November 1921. Cain proposed an amendment \nto   the   original   resolution.   This   proposal   would   lift   the   restrictions   \npreventing  racing  motorcycles  from  going  on  the  roads  on  a  Sunday,  \npresumably  for  the  purposes  of  further  practices.  At  this  time  roads  were  \nnot  closed  for  practices  to  take  place.  Cain,  in  proposing  the  amendment,  \nstated: \n \nI don’t want to raise anything of a controversial nature in this motion, but I \nwant  it  to  be  understood  by  the  court  that  unless  it  is  carried,  there  is  a  \npossibility  that  the  ACU  will  not  come  to  the  Island  and  the  race  will  not  \ntake place.\n19\n \n \nThe  point  was  also  made  that  the  ACU  were  looking  for  alternative  \nlocations to hold the TT, which in the minds of some members of Tynwald \nposed  a  serious  threat  to  the  continuation  of  the  TT  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  \nThe question of moving the event was indeed occasionally discussed in the \nmotorcycle  press  during  the  1920s,  citing  the  expense  of  travelling  to  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n18\n Debates, Vol. 39, 1 Nov. 1921, p. 43. \n19\n Debates, Vol. 39, 8 Nov. 1921, p. 104."

      "text": "The Acceleration of Domestic Support \n67\nIsle of Man and the inconvenience of its location.\n20\n Cain went on to point \nout  that  “unless  they  [the  ACU]  know  that  these  restrictions  are  to  be  \nremoved, they may go down to Belgium, where the authorities are ready to \nwelcome  them,  and  are  doing  all  they  can  to  induce  them  to  come.”\n21\n \nAlthough  it  is  unclear  how  likely  it  was  that  the  races  might  move  away  \nfrom  the  island,  the  fear  that  the  Isle  of  Man  might  lose  the  TT  was  \nenough for some members of Tynwald to speak in favour of sustaining the \nevent. Cain believed that the lifting of restrictions would help to continue \nto attract the ACU. He argued that “we, as representatives of the people of \nthe  Island,  should  not  do  anything  which  will,  next  year,  prevent  people  \ncoming  to  this  Island.”\n22\n  Clearly,  the  resumption  of  the  TT  after  World  \nWar One was not an imposition by the lieutenant governor but was urged, \nor  at  least  endorsed,  by  members  of  Tynwald,  and  ostensibly  in  the  \ninterests of the Manx public.  \nOf course, concerns were raised about the lifting of Sunday restrictions, \nbut   openly   by   elected   members,   which   is   again   indicative   of   the   \ntransparency  of  the  process.  Closing  roads  on  Sunday  to  ordinary  traffic  \nwhile allowing racing motorcycles to practise on the course would have an \nimpact   domestically.   It   had   been   suggested   by   one   MHK   that   a   \ncompromise  might  be  reached  if  the  roads  were  to  be  closed  to  all  other  \ntraffic  before  nine  o’clock  and  opened  afterwards.  However,  closing  the  \nroads  to  domestic  vehicles  would  be  a  great  inconvenience,  and  Norris  \n(North Douglas) asked “how can people get to the other side of the Island \nif they cannot cross the course?”\n23\n Norris was referring to the fact that the \nTT course covered much of the island. Callister had earlier commented, “I \nthink we ought to have a little consideration for the people who live along \nthe course.”\n24\n However, Alfred Teare (South Douglas) argued that keeping \nrestrictions in place would help increase safety around the course. Voicing \nhis experience of the races, he stated that:  \n \nI  was  at  Kirk  Michael  on  the  Sunday  of  the  year  before  restrictions  were  \nimposed, and a most dangerous state of affairs existed, as racing machines \nwent  around  dangerous  corners,  where  there  were  a  number  of  children  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n20\n  Such  reports  can  be  found  in  issues  of  Motor  Cycle  and  Motor  Cycling  during  \nthe inter-war years, with the impression being that there was some desire to see the \nTT moved to England.

The present motion, \nhowever, deals with this difficulty because it provides that no racing car or \nmachine be on the road.\n25\n \n \nDespite  the  concerns  of  some  MHKs,  the  amendment,  which  would  \nhave  lifted  the  restrictions  placed  on  motorcycles  on  a  Sunday,  was  not  \nincluded  in  the  final  Act  in  1922,  being  lost  by  six  votes  to  twelve  in  the  \nKeys.  Only  the  receiver  general  and  W.C.  Southward  voted  for  it  in  the  \nLegislative  Council.  What  is  striking  here  is  that  the  objections  were  to  \nclosing  the  roads  for  practising  on  a  Sunday,  and  not  to  racing  as  such.  \nThe open debate still concluded by endorsing the continuation of the main \nevent, the TT races. \nAfter   the   resolution   was   passed   in   November   and   Tynwald   had   \ndemonstrated their support for the continuation of the TT, it was necessary \nto  pass  new  legislation  to  extend  the  1905  law.  The  Highways  (Closing  \nOrder)  Bill  was  introduced  into  the  Legislative  Council  by  the  attorney  \ngeneral  on  12  January  1922.  It  was  subsequently  read  three  times  and  \npassed  in  the  Council,  with  little  further  discussion.\n26\n  The  bill  was  then  \npassed to the House of Keys and was given its first reading on 17 January. \nWhen the bill was read for the second time on 24 January, Gill, MHK for \nMiddle, the constituency surrounding Douglas, explained that the bill was \nnecessary  for  motor  races  to  take  place  on  the  island  in  the  summer  of  \n1922, and for any races that were “likely” to occur in the future. He went \nfurther  to  argue  that  “it  is  not  a  very  contentious  Bill,  and  I  hope  it  will  \npass  without  discussion.  It  is  necessary  that  it  should  be  done  quickly.”\n27\n \nThe  matter  was  urgent  because  it  would  take  two  months  for  the  bill  to  \nreceive  the  royal  assent  and  the  TT  was  to  be  held  in  four  months’  time.  \nThe  resolution  in  favour  of  the  bill  was  seconded  by  Alfred  Teare  (the  \nSouth Douglas MHK) and no further objections were raised nor were any \nfurther expressions of support voiced, and  the  bill  was  passed  and  signed  \nin  Tynwald  on  7  March  1922.\n28\n  Here  too  we  can  see  that  the  opportunity  \nfor Tynwald to object and block the legislation necessary to sustain the TT \nraces was constitutionally open to members, but they opted not to protest \nbut, rather, willingly to support the legislation.  \nThere  was  a  further  sign  in  the  passage  of  the  Highways  (Closing  \nOrder) Act 1922 that the TT races were no longer an intrusion imposed by \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n25\n Debates, Vol. 39, 8 Nov. 1921, p. 105. \n26\n Debates, Vol. 39, 13 Jan. 1922, pp. 329 and 335. \n27\n Debates, Vol. 39, 24 Jan. 1922, p. 381.  \n28\n See also House of Keys Journal, Vol. 14 1920 – 1922, which states that this bill \nwas carried in the Keys and notes no opposition."

Moreover,  this  Act  was  renewed  annually  \nthereafter  with  the  approval  of  Tynwald,  with  minimal  debate,  thus  \nallowing  the  TT  to  continue.  However,  in  1927  a  motorcyclist  was  killed  \nwhen practising on open roads. This was another occasion when a political \nbrake might have been applied and the TT races ended. \n1928: Responses to a Fatality \nThe  original  legislation  for  road  racing  on  the  island  had  made  no  \nprovision  for  the  closing  of  roads  for  practising,  and  as  we  have  seen  a  \nproposal  to  introduce  such  a  condition  had  been  rejected  in  1921.  The  \ndeath  of  Archie  Birkin  in  1927,  after  swerving  to  avoid  a  fish  cart  on  a  \npractice ride, therefore was unsettling.\n31\n However, it prompted a call not to \nterminate  the  TT  but  only  for  legislation  to  protect  both  Manx  residents  \nand  motorcyclists  by  further  road  closures.  The  Highways  Amendment  \nBill was introduced into the Legislative Council by the lieutenant governor \non  14  February  1928,  before  being  introduced  into  and  passed  in  the  \nHouse of Keys in March and finally passed in Tynwald on 24 April. This \nlegalised  the  closing  of  roads  not  just  for  racing  but  also  for  practising  \nbefore the main event took place.  \nWhen the attorney general introduced the first reading of the bill in the \nLegislative Council, he was obviously not seeking to deter racing or even \nto make racing more difficult for riders. Rather, his intention was to make \nracing   safer   by   imposing   more   restrictions   on   the   Manx   people.   \nRemarkably, and indicative of the political support which by 1928 the TT \nraces had attracted in the Isle of Man, no opposition in either section of the \nManx  legislature  was  expressed  to  continuing  the  race  after  the  fatality.  \nInstead  further  road  closures  were  accepted  to  provide  more  security  for  \nriders  whilst  practising.  The  attorney  general  argued  that  “if  we  invite  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n29\n Statutes of the Isle of Man, Vol. XI 1921 – 1924, hereafter Statutes.  \n30\n See Highways (Motor Car) Act 1905, in Statutes, Vol. VII 1896 – 1905. \n31\n J.

      "text": "Chapter Three \n70\nthem  [the  ACU/  TT  racers]  to  come  to  the  Island  for  these  races,  we  \nshould  make  it  safe  for  them  to  practise,  and  not  let  them  run  the  risk  of  \nmeeting  a  fish  cart  on  the  road  with  the  risk  of  injury  and  death.”\n32\n This \nopinion  was  shared  by  Daniel  Teare,  whose  constituency,  Ayre,  was  on  \nthe route but well away from Douglas. When introducing the bill into the \nKeys for its second reading, he argued that: \n \nI think we ought to make the roads safe, if possible, for these cyclists, that \nis, if we are going to retain the motor cycle races. If the motor cycle races \nare of any use to the Island, I think it is our duty to see these men take no \nunnecessary risks. We know that last year a regrettable accident took place, \nand I think it is our duty to see that the roads during practice time are kept \nfree from traffic.\n33\n \n \nDaniel  Teare  and  the  attorney  general  were  aware  of  the  importance  of  \nimproving  safety  if  the  Manx  were  to  continue  hosting  motorcycle  races  \non  the  island,  and  to  do  this  it  was  becoming  increasingly  necessary  to  \nclose roads for practising. Evidently both the attorney general and Daniel \nTeare  wanted  to  see  the  TT  take  place  and  this  proposal  would  make  the  \nstaging  of  the  event  on  the  island  more  attractive  to  the  ACU.  Moreover,  \nwhilst  the  attorney  general  had  little  to  lose  by  supporting  the  races  –  he  \nwas  an  appointed  member  of  the  Legislative  Council  –  Teare  represented  \nthe  rural  sheading  of  Ayre  and  was  elected  to  the  Keys,  and  yet  he  \nendorsed  a  proposal  that  had  the  potential  to  add  to  the  inconvenience  \ncaused by the TT to his constituents.  \nWithin this debate there is no indication at all that Birkin’s death might \nbe  a  reason  to  stop  the  TT  races.  The  focus  was  entirely  placed  on  \nprotecting  the  TT  and  continuing  to  attract  the  ACU  to  the  Isle  of  Man.  \nHowever,   support   for   the   bill   was   not   unanimous.   It   was   largely   \nrepresentatives of rural sheadings who voiced objections. Shimmin, MHK \nfor Peel, disagreed with the stance taken by many MLCs and MHKs. His \nobjection was that: \n \nI  think  there  is  a  great  deal  too  much  time  spent  by  grown  up  people  \nplaying with adult mechanical toys; and a great many young men spending \ntheir  time  riding  to  nowhere  and  back  simply  for  the  fun  of  riding,  and  I  \nthink they could be much better employed.\n34\n \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n32\n Debates, Vol. 45, 14 Feb. 1928, p. 455. \n33\n Debates, Vol. 45, 6 March 1928, p. 617. \n34\n Debates, Vol. 45, 6 March 1928, p. 619."

      "text": "The Acceleration of Domestic Support \n71\nShimmin did not participate in the collective endorsement of the races by \nmembers  of  Tynwald,  and  his  objections  were  pretty  much  a  call  for  the  \nTT  to  be  stopped.  He  might  even  have  been  expressing  the  resentment  of  \nPeel’s  constituents  towards  the  continuation  of  the  TT.  However,  other  \nobjections  to  this  bill  did  not  call  for  the  races  to  be  stopped,  but  rather  \npointed out the considerable inconvenience caused to the rural community \nby the running of the event. Whilst Gill (Middle) argued that as a result of \nBirkin’s  death  the  legislative  changes  were  worth  making  and  that  there  \nwas  “nothing  outrageous  in  it  at  all”,\n35\n  other  MHKs  pointed  out  that  the  \nclosing of roads in the early morning would interfere with the delivery of \nthe milk from farms to towns and with traffic to and from the fishing port \nof Peel in the west of the island. This was a point conceded even by Daniel \nTeare (Ayre) in the House of Keys. Pointing out the potential for factions \nto form between members representing rural and urban constituencies, he \nargued that “there is a certain amount of opposition to closing the roads in \nthe morning, especially by farmers, also by a few men whose business it is \nto  go  to  Peel  to  buy  fish.”\n36\n  Southward,  who  was  keen  on  the  races,  even  \nargued that closing roads for practising would make it an offence to carry \nout  one’s  business.  This  opinion  was  shared  by  J.D.  Clucas,  previously  \nMHK  for  largely  rural  Rushen  but  by  now  a  member  of  the  Legislative  \nCouncil.  He  argued  that  “it  will  be  a  great  inconvenience  to  the  users  of  \nthe  roads  who  wish  to  come  in  from  [Kirk]  Michael  for  the  early  \nmarket.”\n37\n Kirk Michael was in a rural area, and the TT course ran through \nthe centre of the village, thus causing inconvenience.  \nSupport for the continuation of the TT was articulated most strongly in \nterms of the benefits to Douglas. Those supporting the bill emphasised the \nfact that inconvenience caused to the rural community was a small price to \npay  if  Douglas,  the  island’s  largest  town,  benefited  from  the  continuation  \nof  the  TT.  This  attitude  was,  surprisingly,  articulated  even  by  W.C.  \nClucas, representative for rural Glenfaba, who pointed out that: \n \nIt  must  be  remembered  that  Douglas  reaps  nearly  all  the  benefit  [of  the  \nTT]. Seven o’clock in the morning is the time the fish market starts at Peel. \nMany buyers come in from the country, and it means they will have to go \nin many hours earlier or later. It will affect Peel more than any other town; \nstill, if it is going to benefit Douglas and the Island, we are not going to be \nagainst it.

      "text": "Chapter Three \n72\nPeel  was  situated  in  the  sheading  of  Glenfaba,  a  largely  rural  area  and  it  \ncan  therefore  be  expected  that  Clucas  would  have  a  good  idea  of  the  \ninconvenience  caused  to  local  businesses  and  especially  the  fish  market.  \nCowell (Middle) in support of Clucas similarly stated that the TT “is a big \ninconvenience,  but  as  long  as  it  does  good  to  Douglas,  I  am  not  going  to  \noppose  it.  I  think,  however,  we  should  protect  those  who  have  to  make  a  \nlivelihood  by  getting  produce  to  Douglas.”\n39\n  There  was  recognition  of  \ninterests  outside  Douglas,  but  there  was  no  suggestion  of  how  these  \ninterests could be protected. \nUltimately,  it  seems  that  objectors  conceded  to  the  “greater  good”,  \nwhich were not Manx economic interests as such, but rather the economic \ninterests   of   Douglas.   However,   in   order   for   the   TT   to   continue   a   \ncompromise had to be reached. Daniel Teare had indeed suggested that “I \nthink  if  we  are  to  retain  these  races  we  ought  to  make  a  little  bit  of  \nsacrifice.”\n40\n In Teare’s mind, the TT, which was becoming an international \nevent, came before some local business interests. Closing public roads and \nincreasing  safety  primarily  for  the  racers  and  secondarily  the  residents  \nwould  mean  a  compromise  had  to  be  made  between  urban  and  rural  \ninterest groups, but this was a compromise that was not taken. Instead the \ninterests  of  the  ACU,  who  wanted  to  hold  the  TT  on  the  island,  and  the  \ninterests  of  urban  areas,  more  explicitly  Douglas,  were  protected.  For  \nexample,  Moore,  a  tenant  farmer,  made  objections.  He  pointed  out  the  \ndifficulties that would be incurred by further road closures; he had spoken \nto  residents  who  had  voiced  their  opinions.  His  attitude  towards  the  TT  \nwas that: \n \nPersonally,  I  do  not  object  to  the  races  at  all,  but,  as  I  said,  I  have  met  \nseveral  people  who  complain.  A  man  said,  ‘I  pay  my  licence  to  go  on  the  \nhigh road, and I have a right at all times of the year to go on the roads, and \nyou  have  no  legal  right  to  stop  me’.  That  is  just  one  instance.  It  is  not  in  \nmy own constituency. I have met people from Ramsey and Douglas, whose \nbusiness  takes  them  from  Peel  to  Ramsey.  They  say  ‘We  are  being  \ntyrannised  in  the  Isle  of  Man’.  There  are  three  whole  weeks  that  people  \ncannot go on with their ordinary businesses.\n41\n  \n \nThe simplest way to solve this problem was to end the TT races. However, \nthe continuing support for the TT by members of the Legislative Council, \nand  indeed  of  the  House  of  Keys,  made  this  politically  impossible.

It  shows  that  members  of  both  the  Legislative  \nCouncil and the House of Keys were prepared to support the continuation \nof  the  TT  and  wished  to  continue  to  attract  the  ACU  to  the  island.  The  \ndebate also shows that the further endorsement of the TT in 1928 was not \nthe result of a further imposition of legislation by the lieutenant governor. \nWhat was happening was the imposition of legislation by Tynwald on the \nManx  people.  The  move  was  supported,  surprisingly,  not  just  by  the  \nrepresentatives   of   Douglas,   but   also   by   representatives   of   rural   \nconstituencies,  with  varying  degrees  of  reluctance,  because  the  TT  was  \njudged to be good for Douglas and that seemed to be enough. \n1929-1937: Financial Endorsement \nIn 1926 Fry was replaced by Sir Claude Hill as the island’s lieutenant \ngovernor.  It  was  following  Hill’s  initiative  in  1929  that  the  first  financial  \ncontribution was made by the Manx legislature to the ACU for the purpose \nof maintaining the TT races. It has been suggested that Hill’s awareness of \nthe importance of the tourist industry to the island and his enthusiasm for \nthe  TT  led  to  the  proposal.  The  ACU  welcomed  this  grant,  and  looking  \nback  in  1945  the  secretary  of  the  ACU,  T.W.  Loughborough,  concluded  \nthat   there   was   “no   better   man   for   the   future   of   the   TT   races.”\n42\n \nLoughborough  believed  that  Hill  had  realised  that  TT  entrants  would  not  \ncontinue  to  support  the  races  unless  there  were  substantial  rewards  on  \noffer,  and  that  it  was  as  much  in  the  interests  of  the  Isle  of  Man  as  the  \nACU that the TT should continue. In 1949 a Manx journalist, commenting \non  Hill’s  initiative,  pointed  out  that  “whilst  at  the  time  there  was  no  real  \nfear   that   the   T.T.   would   be   taken   from   the   Island,   this   [financial   \ncontribution] was a method of ensuring the continuation of the meeting on \nits  ‘native  soil’.”\n43\n  Hill’s  initiative  would  have  been unlikely in 1921, but \nfinancial  support  for  the  TT  was  more  likely  in  1928,  with  the  event  by  \nnow  receiving  greater  support  politically.  It  was  approved  by  the  Manx  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n42\n T.

Clucas,  the  suspension  of  Tynwald’s  \nstanding orders was suggested so that Hill’s proposal could be considered \nfor  the  provision  of  a  grant  to  assist  the  ACU  in  holding  the  TT  races  on  \nthe  Isle  of  Man.  A  letter  from  the  lieutenant  governor  contained  in  the  \nHouse  of  Keys  Journal  suggests  that  this  resolution  had  actually  been  \nagreed  upon  before  it  entered  Tynwald.  The  letter  asked  members  of  the  \nKeys and the Legislative Council to meet Hill in private “to consider what \nsteps  (if  any)  should  be  taken  to  ensure  the  continuance  of  the  Tourist  \nTrophy  Races  in  the  Island.”\n44\n  This  was  a  sign  that  Hill  believed  that  the  \nTT  was  a  valuable  asset  for  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  the  response  to  his  \ninitiative  shows  that  others  agreed.  The  standing  orders  were  suspended  \nand  a  resolution  in  favour  was  carried  unanimously  in  Tynwald.  The  \nSpeaker  of  the  House  of  Keys  introduced  the  resolution  in  what  was  \ndescribed  as  an  “exhaustive  way”,  and  Corrin  (Rushen)  seconded  the  \nresolution.  These  were  the  only  two  members  of  the  House  who  voiced  \ntheir  opinions,  suggesting  that  by  this  point  there  was  a  ready  acceptance  \nby  members  of  the  Manx  legislature  that  the  TT  would  and  should  \ncontinue.  If  there  had  been  any  objections  to  the  resolution,  they  would  \nseem  to  have  been  dealt  with  privately.  The  resolution,  which  fell  under  \nthe title “help for the races”, read:  \n \nThe Manx Legislature is desirous of contributing its aid, however small, to \nthe cause of international good-will and the spirit of mutual understanding \nand  the  will  to  peace  and  believing  that  International  sports  contests  are  a  \nfactor  in  the  furtherance  of  such  causes.  Resolved  –  that  in  the  estimates  \nfor  the  financial  years  1930  –  31,  provision  should  be  made  for  the  \nexpenditure  of  a  sum  of  £5,000  from  the  general  revenue  to  enable  (1)  a  \ngrant  of  £1,500  to  be  paid  to  the  Auto-Cycle  Union  for  the  provision  of  \ncash prizes to successful competitors in the Tourist Trophy races to be held \nin  the  Isle  of  Man  in  June,  1930,  and  (2)  a  grant  of  £3,500  to  enable  the  \nAuto-Cycle  Union  so  to  reduce  the  expenses  of  competitors  from  the  \nBritish  Empire  overseas  and  from  foreign  countries  that  such  competitors  \ncan   enter   for   the   1930   Tourist   Trophy   on   more   equal   terms   with   \ncompetitors from the British Isles.\n45\n  \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n44\n This letter was contained in the House of Keys Journal (Vol. 15 1922-1929). \n45\n Debates, Vol. 46, 4 October 1929, p. 1202; Tynwald Court Journal 1929 -1934 \nalso shows that there was no opposition to the bill."

      "text": "Chapter Three \n76\nIn proposing this resolution in Tynwald the Speaker had put forward a \nvery grandiose claim. Indeed with the TT becoming a more internationally \nknown  event,  its  role  in  promoting  international  goodwill  might  appear  \njustifiable.  As  a  new  Keys  was  going  to  be  elected,  the  Speaker  believed  \nthat  “it  would  be  a  fine  thing  ...  if  we  should  end  our  career  on  a  large  \nnote  like  this.”\n46\n  Whilst  there  was  no  explicit  reference  to  the  proposal  \nbeing  Hill’s  initiative,  there  is  no  other  place  this  proposal  could  have  \ncome  from,  especially  given  the  evidence  of  the  prior  private  meeting  \nbetween  the  lieutenant  governor  and  members  of  the  legislature.  In  \nproposing  the  resolution  the  Speaker  made  reference  to  the  gratitude  of  \nTynwald to the lieutenant governor for showing that “you were very much \nalive  to  our  interests,  and  in  passing  this  vote,  we  shall  show  that  even  if  \nwere  are  moribund,  there  is  still  some  life  left  in  us.”\n47\n Corrin,  in \nseconding  the  motion,  went  on  to  suggest  that  “he  is  a  brave  man  who  \nfeels in a sportive mood at the point of death, and I think that the House of \nKeys  is  to  be  complimented  on  being  in  a  sportive  mood  at  the  time  of  \ndissolution.”\n48\n  This  was  once  again  a  moment  where  the  Keys  had  the  \npower   to   reject   supportive   legislation   for   the   TT   and   obstruct   the   \ndevelopment and the continuation of the event. However, members chose \nto  follow  the  lead  of  the  Speaker,  and  endorsed  the  proposal  before  their  \nmembership  of  the  House  ended.  Evidently,  the  House  of  Keys  had  \nbecome  comfortable  politically  with  the  TT  and  by  1929  viewed  it  as  \nsomething that was worthy of political support by Manx taxpayers.  \nThe  TT  was  politically  endorsed  and  continuation  not  threatened  \nduring the early 1930s. Members of Tynwald voted annually to renew the \ngrant,  and  so  the  Manx  government  continued  to  provide  the  ACU  with  \nfinancial support for the TT. True, some of this grant was later redirected \nto  motorcar  races.  Even  so,  throughout  the  1930s  the  Manx  government  \nmaintained a financial interest in the TT races. Members of Tynwald, with \nlittle   debate,   voted   for   financial   help   for   the   TT   and   indeed   the   \ncontinuation of the TT and other motor races on the Isle of Man annually.  \nHowever, objections to financial assistance for motor racing on the Isle \nof  Man  were  raised  in  1937,  but  these  were  not  challenges  to  the  \ncontinuation of motorcycle racing on the island as such, but to the way the \ngrant  was  distributed.  The  attorney  general  put  forward  a  resolution  in  \nTynwald  for  the  continuation  of  the  £5,000  grant  but  only  £3,500  would  \ngo  to  the  ACU.\n49\n  The  £5,000  would  cover  the  cost  of  all  races  on  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n46\n Debates, Vol. 46, 4 October 1929, p. 1203. \n47\n Debates, Vol. 46, 4 October 1929, p. 1203. \n48\n Debates, Vol. 46, 4 October 1929, p. 1202. \n49\n Debates, Vol. 54, 6 July 1937, p. 424."

These  included  the  TT  races,  the  Manx  Grand  Prix  \nmotorcycle  races  –  which  had  taken  place  since  1923  -  and  car  races  \ntaking  place  in  Douglas,  as  well  as  a  pedal  cycle  race  around  the  TT  \ncourse  and  an  aeroplane  race.  Although  the  attorney  general  saw  this  as  \nthe “customary appropriation of £5,000”, he also made the suggestion that \na committee be appointed to assist the government treasurer in the proper \nallocation of the grant, and this proposal was adopted. This committee was \nthe Tynwald Motor Races Committee.\n50\n  \nObjections  raised  in  this  discussion  were  not  towards  the  provision  of  \nthe  grant  and  so  not  towards  the  continuation  of  the  TT.  Questions  were  \nraised, rather, concerning the division of the grant between different races \non  the  Isle  of  Man,  since  many  believed  that  the  TT  was  the  most  \nimportant motor sport event on the island. Alfred Teare asked: \n \nDoes  this  mean  the  Court  commits  itself  to  motor  car  racing  next  year?  I  \ndon’t feel disposed to do that. I consider the experience we have had in the \npast of the races is that they are not fulfilling expectations from the point of \nview of the publicity value or encouraging visitors to our shores during the \nperiod of the races. Regarding the experience of the motor-cycle races, we \nknow from our experience that they are an attraction to the young men of \nthe   country   who   can   afford   a   motor-cycle.   They   come   to   see   the   \nperformance  of  the  various  machines  here,  and  upon  the  result  choose  the  \nparticular  type  of  machine  they  are  going  to  purchase  to  tour  the  country.  \nIn regard to the motor car races, I consider nothing of that kind enters into \nit at all.\n51\n \n \nThe  Manx,  or  members  of  Tynwald,  wanted  especially  the  TT  races  to  \ncontinue  to  be  held  on  the  Isle  of  Man  and  for  this  reason  they  were  \nwilling  to  make  a  monetary  contribution  to  the  ACU.  This  grant  was  \nbelieved to be reasonable because it would allow the TT races to continue \non the Isle of Man, sustaining a unique attraction and, as will be discussed \nbelow,  putting  extra  money  into  the  Manx  economy.  This  would  not  be  \ndone  by  the  promotion  of  motorcar  races,  which  were  considered  a  much  \nsmaller affair.  \nIn  the  opinion  of  the  Motor  Races  Committee,  which  had  been  \nappointed after the 1937 TT, the contribution made to the ACU was fully \njustified  as  it  went  towards  maintaining  the  TT  races  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  \nThe  committee’s  report  concluded  that  “we  regard  the  Races  as  of  great  \nvalue to the Island in the early part of the season, and we recommend that \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n50\n Debates, Vol. 54, 6 July 1937, p. 425. \n51\n Debates, Vol. 54, 6 July 1937, p. 425."

Alfred Teare, as we have seen a strong supporter of the \nTT,  had  pointed  mostly  to  the  economic  benefits  to  be  derived  from  the  \nmotorcycle TT in Tynwald when the committee, of which he was a member, \nwas  appointed.\n53\n  The  silence  of  other  members  of  Tynwald  suggests  an  \nagreement  with  the  conclusions  of  the  report.  In  1938,  a  resolution  was  \npassed once again to give the grant to the ACU, once more indicating that \nthe benefits of continuing to hold the TT on the Isle of Man were realised \nin  Tynwald.  When  proposing  the  continuation  of  this  grant,  Deemster  \nCowley  felt  “sure  that  members  will  recognise  the  enormous  publicity  \nvalue of the races to the Island and I have confidence in asking Tynwald to \ncontinue  similar  grants  next  year.”\n54\n  The  TT  races  thus  continued  to  be  \nsupported both politically and financially, and by the end of the inter-war \nperiod  there  was  little  doubt  about  their  continuation.  It  is  the  belief,  \nshared    by    members    of    Tynwald,    that    the    TT    would    publicise    \nadvantageously   the   Isle   of   Man   and   the   growing   commitment   of   \nmotorcycle manufacturers to the event, which will be discussed in the next \nchapter. \n  \n \n \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n52\n Report of the Committee of Tynwald Appointed to Examine the Whole Question \nof Motor Car and Other Races, (Douglas, Norris Modern Press, 1937), pp. 4-5. \n53\n Debates, Vol. 54, 6 July 1937, p. 424.  \n54\n Debates, Vol. 55, 6 July 1938, p. 693."

In  the  years  before  \nWorld  War  One  there  was  an  increasing  reorientation  of  the  Manx  \neconomy,  which  had  been  the  direct  result  of  the  growth  of  the  island’s  \ntourist industry. This trend continued through the inter-war period, and we \ncan  see  the  further  decline  of  fishing,  mining,  agriculture  and  other  \nmanufacturing  industries  as  measured  by  occupation  (see  table  4-1).\n1\n The \ndecline  of  the  island’s  primary  and  secondary  industries  was  marked  in  \n1929  by  the  complete  closure  of  the  Laxey  mines,  which  had  once  been  \nthe  leading  extractors  of  zinc  and  lead  ore  in  the  British  Isles.\n2\n Also,  by \n1931 the number of fishermen on the island had fallen from 410 recorded \nin  the  1921  census  to  186  as  recorded  in  the  1931  census.\n3\n Winterbottom \nnotes  that  by  1937  there  were  only  47  fishing  boats  on  the  Isle  of  Man  \ncrewed  by  128  men  and  boys,  and  further  that  80  per  cent  of  the  herring  \nfor  sale  on  the  island  in  1937  was  caught  by  boats  registered  elsewhere.\n4\n \nThis was a decline of 75 per cent from the 864 fishermen recorded in the \n1901  census.\n5\n  Numbers  employed  in  the  fishing  and  mining  industries  \nduring  the  inter-war  years  were  therefore  much  reduced  and  there  was  \neven  a  discernible  decline  in  the  numbers  engaged  in  agriculture.

This was the lowest recorded number during the \ninter-war  period.\n6\n  However,  the  inter-war  period  saw  the  widening  of  the  \nLoch  Promenade  Douglas,  which  began  in  1929  and  took  six  years  to  \ncomplete,\n7\n  and  also  the  building  of  the  King  Edward  VIII  Pier  in  1936.  \nOther improvements included the building of cinemas, such as The Picture \nHouse  (1921),  the  Royal  and  Regal  cinemas  and  the  2000-seat  Crescent  \n“Super” Cinema (1930). Facilities in boarding houses were also improved \nby  the  installation  of  electric  light,  hot  and  cold  running  water,  and  more  \ncomfortable  furnishings.\n8\n  This  was  in  contrast  to  the  poor  facilities  \navailable  before  World  War  One.\n9\n  However,  staying  in  Douglas  was  still  \nseen to be expensive, the cost varying from between five shillings to seven \nor  eight  shillings  a  day.\n10\n  In  comparison  to  the  “better  end\"  of  Blackpool  \nwhich cost between seven and ten shillings per day, the cost on the Isle of \nMan was nevertheless reasonable.\n11\n The TT should therefore be seen in the \ncontext of this development of tourism.  \nManx Economic Interests in the TT  \nDuring the inter-war period members of Tynwald began to share in the \nbelief  that  the  TT  might  play  a  part  in  publicising  the  Isle  of  Man.  \nMoreover, unlike in the pre-war years, the Manx legislature was prepared \nto  pay  to  advertise  the  TT  races  as  one  of  the  island’s  attractions.  \nBeckerson  notes:  “by  the  1920s  the  races  were  an  established  part  of  the  \nseason and proved ever more successful in attracting June crowds at a time \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n6\n Isle  of  Man  Summer  Passenger  Arrivals  1887  –  Present,  (Douglas,  Economic  \nAffairs Division; Isle of Man Government, 2007).  \n7\n  G.N.

The \nIsle of Man Weekly Times argued in May 1922 that: \n \nSome  idea  of  the  publicity  which  these  races  give  the  Island  can  be  \ngathered  from  the  fact  that  the  two  trade  motor  papers  “Motor-cycle”  and  \n“Motor  Cycling”  have  directed  this  week  practically  their  entire  issue  to  \nthe Isle of Man. In the “Daily Mail” last night there was a full column on \nthe  races,  an  invaluable  advertisement  ...  On  Monday,  some  30  to  40  \nrepresentatives  of  the  greatest  papers  in  the  country  are  coming  to  this  \nIsland. There is absolutely nothing to compare with the motor races as an \nadvertisement.\n [Emphasis added].\n14\n \n \nThe date of this comment is significant. In May 1922 there had only been \none  TT  event  after  World  War  One,  and  we  cannot  say  that  there  was  an  \ninevitability  that  the  TT  would  continue  at  this  point.  The  Isle  of  Man  \nWeekly Times was clearly of the opinion that the TT races could become a \ngood  source  of  revenue  for  the  island.  The  newspaper  believed  that  \nmention  of  the  TT  in  the  English  press  was  publicity  enough.  The  races  \nhad begun to attract people from across the world even by the early 1920s, \nand this would mean more money for the Manx economy. \nThe  statement  above,  however,  was  just  one  opinion  from  the  Manx  \npress. The view of some members of Tynwald was also that the TT would \nhelp  publicise  the  island,  and  therefore  help  the  island’s  tourist  trade  \nrecover  after  World  War  One.  Before  the  outbreak  of  World  War  One  \nthere  had  been  minimal  recognition  of  the  publicity  value  of  the  TT  by  \nmembers of Tynwald, although in 1912 this issue was touched upon.

This was an important argument in favour of the restart of the TT. \nDuring   the   discussion   concerning   the   extension   of   the   highways   \nlegislation,  Southward,  when  asked  if  the  races  should  be  restarted  in  \n1920, answered: “I do not think that it is necessary to labour this question, \nas I think that it is the wish of the people in the Isle of Man in general, and \nof the people in towns in particular, [that] permission should be granted to \nhold  the  races.”  We  might  assume  that  Southward  is  here  referring  to  the  \nfinancial  benefits  that  some  of  the  islanders  could  gain  from  the  TT,  \nespecially those living in Douglas and running businesses.  \nSouthward went on to make two further points. First, he believed that \nthe TT could be used to advertise the Isle of Man. The event had proven to \nattract  visitors.  The  result  of  this  publicity,  argued  Southward,  would  be  \nextra revenue for the Manx economy.\n15\n He went on to claim “the last cycle \nraces were the means of bringing a large number of people to the Island”, \npossibly  referring  to  the  last  pre-war  races  and  that  “the  Island  largely  \nbenefits  by  these  people.”\n16\n  In  particular  he  believed  that  the  holding  of  \nthe  TT  benefited  those  involved  with  tourism,  especially  boarding  house  \nkeepers.\n17\n  Southward’s  claim  was  fairly  obvious.  It  is  clear  that  boarding  \nhouse keepers and hoteliers would benefit from the continuation of the TT. \nThose involved with the event and those just watching the TT would need \nsomewhere to stay on the island. The 1921 census recorded that 1,313 out \nof a total of 1,897 lodging and boarding house keepers, approximately 75 \nper cent, were employed in Douglas (see table 4-1), since this was where \nvisitors disembarked from the ferry, there was the potential for Douglas to \nprofit considerably from the continuation of the TT.  \nHowever,  despite  there  being  a  large  amount  of  support  for  the  TT  in  \nTynwald, not all members shared Southward’s opinion that the event was \nan  obvious  boost  to  the  island’s  economy  and  a  viable  means  of  re-\nestablishing  the  island’s  tourist  trade,  or  even  as  a  way  of  extending  the  \nisland’s  tourist  season  into  June.  Callister,  who  earlier  in  the  discussion  \nhad commented on the inconvenience caused by the TT, was “not convinced \nthat the granting of these facilities to this particular club [the ACU] [was] of  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n15\n Debates, Vol. 38, 4 May 1920, p. 581. \n16\n Debates, Vol. 38, 21 Dec. 1920, p. 239. \n17\n Debates, Vol. 38, 21 Dec. 1920, p. 239."

      "text": "Moving through the Gears: Capitalist Interests in the TT \n85\nBritain and at their permanent offices in London and Manchester.\n21\n It was \nthen that active promotion of the Isle of Man as the home of the TT races \nwas  being  projected  outside  the  island  by  the  Manx  government.  The  \nBoard’s  promotion  of  the  event  was  instigated  after  a  meeting  with  a  \ndeputation from the Manx Motor Cycle Club in January 1922. This was a \ndemonstration  of  a  smaller  group  with  interest  in  the  TT  putting  forward  \nan  agenda  for  the  Board  of  Advertising.  The  deputation  pointed  out  the  \nneed  for  more  advertising  of  the  TT  in  the  mainland  press,  as,  in  their  \nopinion, the TT was growing in popularity and therefore had the potential \nto advertise the island; or at least the TT should be advertised as one of the \nisland’s  diverse  attractions.\n22\n  The  Board  promised  consideration  of  this  \nmatter  and,  after  deliberation,  made  the  decision  to  print  and  distribute  \n10,000  leaflets  advertising  the  TT,  and  they  also  invited  cinema  firms  to  \nthe  Isle  of  Man  to  film  the  races.  The  Board  of  Advertising  continued  to  \npromote  the  TT  during  the  1920s  on  their  posters  and  in  promotional  \nliterature  as  one  of  the  island’s  most  important  attractions,  alongside  the  \nTynwald  ceremony  and  the  Highland  games.  For  example  in  a  1934  \nadvertisement  promoting  the  “Isle  of  Man  for  Happy  Holidays”,  motor  \nsports,   the   “unique   open   air   parliament”   and   highland   games   were   \nconsidered  equally  good  reasons  to  visit  the  island.  This  meant  that  by  \n1928  when  the  future  of  the  TT  was  re-considered,  the  Manx  legislature  \nand  certainly  the  Board  of  Advertising  had  made  a  commitment  to  the  \npromotion of the TT races.  \nThe inter-war period also saw legislation passed that changed the way \nthe TT was organised and in doing so supported the event’s continuation. \nIn  1927  Birkin’s  death  did  not  put  an  end  to  the  TT,  but  rather  instigated  \nthe   closing   of   roads   for   practising,   which   would   cause   further   \ninconvenience  to  island  residents;  an  inconvenience  that  was  on  balance  \nsupported  by  the  Manx  legislature  because  of  the  publicity  value  of  the  \nTT.  As  already  noted,  Daniel  Teare  (Ayre)  supported  this  legislation  \nbecause  the  TT  races  “[were]  established  in  the  Island,  and  we  look  on  \nthem  as  the  event  of  the  summer  season.”\n23\n  He  acknowledged  “I  know  \nvery  well  that  there  are  hardships,  but  if  we  work  for  the  common  good  \nand   put   up   with   these   grievances,   we   shall   bring   the   Island   to   \nprosperity.”\n24\n Johnson (North Douglas), naturally speaking for the island’s \npremier  town,  believed  that  the  races  were  “of  great  benefit  to  the  Island  \nas a visiting resort, and I should have thought that they were, at the most, \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n21\n Board of Advertising Minute Books, 1921-1937. \n22\n Board of Advertising Minute Books, 9 Oct. 1922.  \n23\n Debates, Vol. 45, March 1928, p. 618. \n24\n Debates, Vol. 45, March 1928, p. 622."

However,  suggestions  were  made  that  \nthe whole island would come to prosperity if the TT were continued, and \nindeed in an island that was geographically small the economic impact of \nthe  TT  might  be  felt  across  the  Isle  of  Man.  However,  Douglas,  and  the  \nbusinesses  situated  there  were  bound  to  benefit  in  particular  from  the  \ncontinuation  of  the  TT.  Once  again  we  can  see  a  disregard  of  the  \ndisruption caused to those living in rural areas, because the continuation of \nthe TT would allow Douglas in particular to prosper.  \nThese  were  not  the  only  voices  noting  the  publicity  value  of  the  TT.  \nCurphey  argued  that  the  event  was  “making  the  Island  known  throughout  \nthe season” and further “what you find [is] the Isle of Man brought before \nthe  public  through  the  races,  and  that  is  all  to  our  good.  It  is  an  \nadvertisement,  and  it  is  a  good  thing  to  have  them  here.”\n26\n Despite  the \ndangers of the TT, emphasised by Birkin’s death, this MHK saw the races \nas a good thing because they publicised the island and put money into the \nManx  economy,  or  at  least  into  the  economy  of  Douglas.  Curphey  only  \nsaw  the  benefits  to  be  had  from  publicity.  The  increasing  danger  of  the  \nraces,  and  the  adverse  press  comment  that  might  result  from  further  \ncasualties in the TT, were not pointed out.  \nIt  is  clear  that  members  of  Tynwald  supported  the  TT  because  they  \nbelieved  it  publicised  the  island  in  a  positive  way.  As  noted  above,  \nTynwald in 1929 passed a resolution to allow a grant of £5,000 to be made \nto the ACU, increasing the attractiveness of staging the TT on the island. \nThis  grant  would  come  out  of  the  island’s  general  revenue.\n27\n Annual \ngovernment  expenditure  in  the  financial  year  ending  31  March  1930  \ntotalled £430,451 and on 31 March 1931 totalled £463,082.\n28\n Thus, £5,000 \nequalled approximately one per cent of the total expenditure of the island; \na  small  amount  given  the  estimated  number  of  people  visiting  the  Isle  of  \nMan   and   spending   money   there.   Government   expenditure   naturally   \nincluded large amounts spent on highways and education, each averaging \napproximately £60,000 between 1926 and 1937. However, we can also see \nthat  the  government  granted  £7,000  for  the  purpose  of  advertising  the  \nisland, £6,000 for legislative expenses and £4,000 for the improvement of \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n25\n Debates, Vol. 45, March 1928, p. 620. \n26\n Debates, Vol. 45, March 1928, p. 620. \n27\n Accounts of Government Treasurer, 1926 - 1940 (Douglas, Isle of Man). \n28\n  Central  Government  Expenditure,  table  included  in  Kermode,  p.  125,  see  also  \nAccounts of Government Treasurer."

He argued “these races have been held for many years in \nthe Isle of Man.

In  1928,  550,472  \npeople  visited  the  Isle  of  Man  and  in  1929,  555,211.  More  specifically,  \nvisitor arrivals for May 1928 were 28,569 whereas June’s number totalled \n82,598.\n30\n The  Isle  of  Man  Examiner,  on  8  June  1928,  reported  the  arrival  \nof  between  15,000  and  16,000  people  between  the  Saturday  and  Monday  \npreceding Senior TT race and also anticipated the arrival of 11,000 people \nfor  the  Senior  TT  taking  place  on  9  June.\n31\n  If  there  were  between  20,000  \nand 30,000 people in the Isle of Man during race week, and this might be \nconsidered  a  conservative  estimate,  and  each  visitor  spent  five  pounds  \nduring their stay on the island, between £100,000 and £150,000 would be \nbrought into the Manx economy.

We can see \ntherefore that members of Tynwald wanted to see the TT continue because \nit had the potential to publicise the island alongside other events that took \nplace in the Isle of Man and boost the economy and government revenue.  \nFurther  to  this,  it  was  not  only  the  Manx  government  that  was  \ncommitted  financially  to  the  continuation  of  the  TT  during  the  inter-war  \nyears.  1929  also  saw  the  first  financial  contribution  made  to  the  ACU  by  \nthe Isle of Man Steam Packet Company.\n32\n The decision to make an annual \ncontribution was made on 22 May 1929, and continued for the rest of the \ninter-war  period.  The  company  gave  £100  to  the  ACU  towards  expenses  \nincurred  in  running  the  TT  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  By  giving  financial  \nassistance  to  the  ACU,  and  indeed  in  liaising  with  the  Isle  of  Man  \nHighway Board and the ACU over the dates of each TT race so that extra \nsailings  could  be  provided,  the  Steam  Packet  were  furthering  their  own  \ninterests by assisting the continuation of the TT. Clearly the belief existed \nthat  the  TT  attracted  visitors  to  the  island,  and  the  Isle  of  Man  Steam  \nPacket  provided  the  only  service  by  which  to  get  a  motorcycle  to  the  \nisland.  This  was  in  evidence  in  an  entry  in  the  minute  book  for  1933,  \nwhich, commenting on the decrease of 6,714 visitors to the island between \n29 April and 14 June 1933 stated, “this deficiency would be considerably \nreduced  when  arrivals  for  this  year’s  Senior  T.T.  Motor  Cycle  Races  are  \nascertained.”\n33\n \nThe  Manx  economy  was  becoming  increasingly  reliant  on  the  tourist  \nindustry  as  its  main  source  of  income.  It  has  been  shown  that  during  the  \ninter-war  period  there  was  a  decline  in  the  traditional  primary  and  \nsecondary  industries  of  fishing,  farming  and  manufacturing,  and  that  \ntourist  figures  remained  steadily  around  500,000.  Second,  it  has  been  \nshown that members of Tynwald believed strongly that the TT races were \nan  asset  that  could  be  used  to  advertise  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  hence  their  \nsupport for the legislation authorising and assisting the TT races. Last, we \ncan  once  again  see  some  evidence  of  a  division  between  rural  and  urban  \ninterests  in  the  TT.

For example, an advertisement for the Manningham Private Hotel \nin  the  island’s  1934  official  guide  used  a  photograph  of  hotel  staff  and  \nguests  lined  up  outside  the  premises,  alongside  two  motorcycles  and  a  \nnumber  of  trophies.\n34\n  Indeed,  writing  in  1949,  and  covering  the  inter-war  \nperiod, Manx journalist Curwen Clague noted that “as the years have gone \nby,  many  hotels  and  [boarding]  houses  have  become  the  recognised  H.Q.  \nof  certain  teams  and  personalities;  there  is  the  group  whose  hostess  is  \n‘Kanie’  of  Falcon  Cliff  and  latterly  Howstrake  fame;  the  Pevril  houses  \nRace H.Q of the A.C.U. and the staff of The T.T.

Three  areas  will  be  \nexplored.  First,  the  growing  popularity  of  the  motorcycle  with  consumers  \nwill be discussed. Second, the role that manufacturers and the motorcycle \npress claimed the TT might and eventually did play in the development of \nmotorcycles,  which  even  so  between  the  wars  and  in  comparison  to  the  \nmotorcar  remained  “technologically  stagnant  and  continued  to  demand  \nmore  of  their  riders.”\n36\n  This  involves  examining  what  they  said  about  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n34\n  It  has  not  been  possible  to  examine  closely  the  profits  which  boarding  house  \nkeepers  and  hoteliers  on  the  Isle  of  Man  could  expect  to  make  from  the  TT,  \nbecause  little  material  exists  to  do  this.  There  is  no  comparable  work  to  that  of  \nWalton’s Blackpool Landlady, which examines the social history of Blackpool and \nits  development  as  a  seaside  resort.

Third,   the   \nadvertisements produced by motorcycle and other manufacturers - of spark \nplugs, brakes, tyres, and magnetos – will be examined, to see if success or \neven mere participation in the TT was used to promote their products. \nThe  end  of  war  did  not  signify  an  immediate  revival  of  the  TT.  \nAlthough   it   might   be   expected   that   members   of   the   motorcycling   \ncommunity would be keen to bring back the TT as soon as possible, it was \nnot viable to hold an event in 1919. Despite this The Motor Cycle that year \neagerly anticipated the revival of the TT, feeling that World War One had \nspeeded  up  the  development  of  the  motorcycle  and  that  “most  engine  \ndesigners  will  have  learnt  more  during  that  time  than  any  other  before.”  \nFurther  it  argued:  “the  next  TT  race  [was]  likely  to  surpass  all  others  on  \nthe  point  of  interest.”\n 37\n  However,  the  decision  to  revive  the  races  did  not  \nlie wholly in the sanctioning of the races by Manx politicians, or with the \nreaders of The Motor Cycle; there was also the question of manufacturers \ngetting back on track.\n38\n The Motor Cycle realised this fact, stating “though \nwe  know  readers  would  like  to  see  a  race  in  1919  –  we  recognise  that  in  \nview  of  the  exceptional  circumstances  which  prevail  at  the  present  time,  \nthe financial decision must rest with the trade.”\n39\n It was argued further that \n“the  sporting  motorcyclist  would  doubtless  vote  unanimously  for  the  \nresumption of the races next summer – but it is improbable that the trade \nwould   be   able   to   direct   energies   to   racing   and   satisfy   numerous   \ncustomers.”\n40\n  This  comment  suggests  that  at  this  time  satisfying  the  \nmarket  demand  for  motorcycles  came  before  the  luxury  of  motorcycle  \nracing.  However,  motorcycle  racing  would  not  remain  on  the  sidelines.  \nWhilst there was no TT in 1919 and the 1920 TT received minimal entries, \nby 1921 manufacturers were once again entering teams into the TT. \nThe popularity of the motorcycle increased greatly during the inter-war \nyears. Stevenson argues that for better off young men sports cars were an \nattractive form of transportation, but further down the social scale: \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n37\n Motor Cycle, 3 April 1919.  \n38\n  Two  magazines  dominated  the  popular  motorcycle  press  market  between  the  \nwars, Motor Cycling and The Motor Cycle.

The  Great  War  had  expanded  production  of  motor-\ncycles  and  greatly  increased  knowledge  of  them,  particularly  amongst  \nservicemen. In 1920 there were more motor-cycles than cars, and numbers \nreached a peak in 1930.\n41\n \n \nAlthough  numbers  of  registered  motorcycles  decreased  after  1930,  there  \nwas  still  a  substantial  number  in  Britain.  Perkin  also  describes  the  same  \ntrend  in  the  popularity  of  the  motorcycle,  with  statistics  showing  that  \n“between  1919  and  1939  the  number  of  motor  vehicles  on  the  roads  \nincreased  nearly  ten-fold,  from  330,518  to  3,148,600.  Cars  increased  \nnearly  twentyfold  from  109,715  to  2,034,000.  The  rest  were  made  up  \nchiefly by motor-cycles, which rose from about a quarter of a million to a \npeak of nearly three quarters of a million in 1930 and then fell back to half \na  million.”\n42\n  During  the  inter-war  years  the  British  motorcycle  gained  \nsupremacy in world markets. The Daily Telegraph stated in 1927 “on the \nContinent ... everywhere the British motor-cycle is upon the roads, and the \nforeigner  willingly  concedes  its  superiority.  In  design,  lightness  and  \nefficiency it beats everything.”\n43\n The dominance of the British motorcycle \nindustry   is   backed   up   by   export   figures,   which   show   that   530,000   \nmotorcycles   were   exported   worldwide   between   1924   and   1940,   in   \ncomparison  to  just  169,000  exported  by  the  USA,  its  closest  competitor  \nover  the  same  period.  During  the  1920s  and  1930s  British  motorcycle  \nmanufacturers were market leaders.\n44\n \nMoreover  in  1928  The  Daily  Mail  suggested  that  the  TT  had  made  a  \nlarge  contribution  to  the  success  of  the  British  motorcycle  industry:  “the  \nBritish  manufacturer  is  maintaining,  indeed  increasing,  the  ascendancy  \nwhich  he  has  secured  in  this  type  of  vehicle”,  and  this  was  the  result  of  \n“such tests as those provided by the annual Tourist Trophy races.”\n45\n Motor \nCycling  admitted  in  1930  that  British  supremacy  in  the  motorcycle  \nindustry was being challenged by foreign machines, but insisted that at the \nTT races British motorcycles could not be beaten: \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n41\n J.

The  eyes  of  the  whole  motorcycling  world  are  fixed  upon  \nthese  races  each  year,  and  so  long  as  British  machines  continue  to  win  \nthem  it  would  be  definitely  bad  business  policy  to  discontinue  [the  TT  \nraces].\n46\n \n \nA 1934 issue of Motor Cycling suggested that there were a number of \nways  that  this  supremacy  could  be  measured.  First,  British  motorcycle  \ncompanies   were   producing   more   than   anyone   else;   second,   British   \nmotorcycles were superior in design and workmanship; and, third, British \nproducts were winning race after race on both home and foreign tracks.\n47\n \nConsiderable success was enjoyed in the TT in the case of manufacturers \nsuch  as  Norton.  Race  results  show  Norton  achieved  a  large  number  of  \nvictories  in  the  TT  especially  during  the  late  1920s  and  early  1930s.\n48\n As \nthe  1930s  progressed,  British  motorcycles  would  face  competition  from  \nforeign machines such as BMW and Moto Guzzi, and so entry into the TT \nraces would become more important to the British motorcycle industry in \nmaintaining its superiority.\n49\n  \nThe  Isle  of  Man  was  still  an  inconvenient  location  for  a  motorcycle  \nrace,  despite  the  development  of  an  infrastructure  which  supported  its  \ntourist  industry  and  thus  saw  improved  transport  links,  and  despite  the  \npolitical  and  financial  support  offered  for  the  continuation  of  the  TT  by  \nTynwald  and  indeed  such  organisations  as  the  Isle  of  Man  Steam  Packet  \nCompany. In 1924, the problems faced by manufacturers as a result of the \ninconvenience   of   the   island’s   location   were   addressed   in   a   private   \nmembers’  bill  in  Westminster,  proposing  the  legalisation  of  road  races  in  \nEngland.

It was noted by \nBrabazon   when   proposing   the   bill’s   second   reading,   that   British   \nmotorcycles were superior to those of any other country, but also that the \nmotorcycle  industry  suffered  because  “the  great  races,  which  are  such  an  \nenormous  advertisement  to  [the]  industry,  must  be  held  outside  this  \ncountry  instead  of  in  it.”\n53\n  In  an  article  in  The  Motor  Cycle  in  1925,  \nMoore-Brabazon expressed confidence that the bill would be passed, even \nclaiming on the inevitability of its passage through Westminster.\n54\n \nHowever,  the  majority  inside  or  outside  Westminster  did  not  share  \nBrabazon’s  views,  and  this  was  demonstrated  in  a  lack  of  support  for  the  \nlegislation,  and  indeed  the  progress  of  the  bill  cannot  be  further  traced  \nthrough  the  printed  debates.

It even claimed that a bill before \nparliament  to  legalise  the  use  of  public  roads  for  motorcycling  was  “very  \nmuch as if some member introduced a Bill to legalise homicide and theft. \nWe  do  not  know  any  ground  on  which  the  public  can  be  deprived  of  the  \nuse of the highway for such a purpose in any part of the country – the Isle \nof Man has put itself in this respect outside the pale of civilisation.” This \narticle commented further that if there were to be any change in the law it \nshould  be  in  the  direction  of  the  strict  enforcement  of  the  present  very  \nliberal speed limit, which then stood at twenty miles per hour.\n55\n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n51\n   Kenneth   Rose,   ‘Brabazon,   John   Theodore   Cuthbert   Moore-,   first   Baron   \nBrabazon  of  Tara  (1884–1964)’,  rev.,  Oxford  Dictionary  of  National  Biography, \nOxford   University   Press,   2004   [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32018,   \naccessed 15 Oct. 2008].  \n52\n  Adrian  Smith,  ‘Iliffe,  Edward  Mauger,  first  Baron  Iliffe  (1877–1960)’,  Oxford \nDictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, \nMay   2007   [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34091,   accessed,   15   Oct.   \n2008]. \n53\n Hansard Debates Commons, Volume 171, 1 April 1924, Col. 2119 – 2120. \n54\n Motor Cycle, 15 Jan. 1925, p. 77.  \n55\n ‘The Motor Peril and Nuisance’, Solicitors’ Journal, 68 (1924), 766 – 7, see also \n‘The Motor Peril’, Solicitors’ Journal, 67, (1923), p. 872."

      "text": "Chapter Four \n94\nA  Ministry  of  Transport  memorandum,  written  as  a  comment  on  the  \nbill,  was  of  a  similar  opinion.  It  suggested,  rather  obviously,  that  the  bill  \nhad probably been influenced by the legislation passed on the Isle of Man \nin 1904. It was also asserted, incorrectly, that the Manx had established the \nTT  for  the  purpose  of  prolonging  the  holiday  season.  Further  and  rather  \nignorant criticism of the Manx followed: \n \nRoads were made for getting from one place to another and not for racing, \nand considerations which may have weight in the Isle of Man have none in \nthis  country.  The  Island  is  a  pleasure  resort  and  the  principal  use  of  the  \nroads  is  to  accommodate  the  visiting  traffic.  Roads  in  England  are  in  \ncontinuous  use  by  commercial  and  private  traffic  and  it  is  difficult  to  \nimagine  any  roads  near  populous  centres  where  great  inconvenience  and  \ndanger  would  not  be  caused  by  persons  practising  for  races,  let  alone  by  \nthe races themselves.\n56\n \n \nManx  legislation  definitely  did  not  set  a  precedent  for  legislation  in  \nWestminster.    In    the    opinion    of    the    Ministry    of    Transport,    the    \ninconvenience caused by the TT to islanders was unimportant as they were \nused  to  their  roads  being  used  primarily  by  visitors.  It  would  therefore  \nmatter  little  if  these  roads  were  closed  for  the  purpose  of  motorcycle  \nracing. It was more important to prevent racing on public roads in England \nthan it was to stop such an event taking place on the Isle of Man. With the \nbill receiving little support, the proposal that motor races could take place \non public roads in England remained wildly optimistic. \nThe  greatest  benefit  of  a  race  in  England  would  be  the  reduction  in  \ncosts  to  the  motorcycle  manufacturer.  The  fact  that  the  TT  continued  to  \ntake place on the Isle of Man meant that these costs were large. The Motor \nCycle   in   1929   reckoned   it   “cannot   be   estimated,   but   is   always   \nenormous.”\n57\n   Manufacturers   had   to   get   their   motorcycles   from   the   \nMidlands, where the majority of the motorcycle industry was based, to the \nIsle  of  Man.  There  was  the  cost  of  transport  to  the  island,  which  would  \ninvolve   the   carriage   of   motorcycles,   spare   parts   and   personnel   plus   \naccommodation  costs  on  the  Isle  of  Man  for  riders,  mechanics  and  other  \nteam  members.  There  was  also  the  cost  of  preparing  a  motorcycle,  or  \nmotorcycles, for the TT and the cost of employing a rider, or riders, to take \nthe  motorcycle(s)  successfully  around  the  TT  course.  An  article  in  The \nMotor Cycle in 1924 suggested that a manufacturer might invest a sum of \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n56\n  Home  Office  File  HO45/17413,  Motor,  Motor  Cycle  and  Cycle  race  on  Public  \nRoads and Foreshores March 1924 – October 1929, TNA.  \n57\n Motor Cycle, 27 June 1929, p. 1042."

However,  if  this  TT  were  held  \non  “home  soil”  the  initial  cost  would  be  reduced,  and  an  estimated  \n250,000 spectators, of whom 20,000 would be motorcyclists, would watch \nthe  event.\n58\n  This  would  be  the  result  of  the  races  not  being  held  in  an  \nisolated area – the Isle of Man. Certainly, the figures might be spurious but \nthe argument was plausible. Racing on a circuit in England, maybe in the \nMidlands, would significantly reduce costs of transport and lodgings, and \npotentially  increase  publicity  for  manufacturers.  After  all,  the  TT  was  an  \nevent  geared  towards  the  production  of  the  most  reliable  motorcycle,  but  \nthey also provided publicity.  \nThere  was  also  the  growing  feeling  that  the  TT  was  beginning  to  lose  \nits  original  raison  d’etre,  which  had  been  to  assist  in  the  development  of  \nproduction  line  motorcycles  of  the  kind  sold  to  ordinary  customers.  This  \ncan be seen in the rules laid down for the 1907 TT races (see above). The \nTT was becoming a contest between highly skilled riders, riding specially \nprepared  motorcycles.  It  was  therefore  less  a  test  bed  for  the  “everyday”  \nmachine, the kind of motorcycle that might be ridden to and from work or \nfor  trips  from  urban  areas  into  the  countryside  where  speed  was  not  such  \nan  important  concern.  The  Motor  Cycle  reported  on  the  TT  races  in  1924  \nthat \n \nThis summer the Triumph and Sunbeam factories were represented by only \nsingle  private  entries.  The  Rudge,  Indian  and  Matchless  machines  –  all  \nfamous winners of the past – were completely absent. Scotts only sent two \nmachines,  one  of  them  privately  owned.  On  the  home  going  boats  the  \nremark,  ‘We  shall  never  compete  again!’  is  a  hardy  annual,  and  need  not  \nbe  taken  too  seriously;  but  it  acquires  fresh  significance  when  so  many  \nfirms  already  stand  aloof,  and  it  was  heard  this  year  with  more  frequency  \nand emphasis than usual.\n59\n  \n \nThat  these  manufacturers  stayed  away  from  the  TT  suggests  that  they  \nbelieved that it had little purpose. The TT was becoming more and more a \nrace  in  which  specialist  bikes  and  highly  skilled  riders  competed  against  \neach other and so the technical benefits to be had were said to be limited. \nThere  were  also  some  humorous  representations  of  the  TT’s  failings.  For  \ninstance,  cartoons  in  The  Motor  Cycle  and  Motor  Cycling  identified  the  \nwide range of specialist motorcycles that were entered into the races, and \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n58\n Motor Cycle, 17 July 1924, p. 82.  \n59\n Motor Cycle, 17 July 1924, p. 82."

New  ways  to  make  the  TT  more  interesting  \nnow  that  speed  had  acquired  importance  were  also  proposed  including,  \ninterestingly,  making  competitors  wear  their  national  costume.  These  \nillustrations are intended to be comic, but yet they comment amply on the \nsituation.  \nSo,  the  TT  was  seen  by  some  to  have  become  a  test  of  speed,  which  \nwould  require  specially  designed  machines.  In  the  late  1920s  Edward  \nTurner, chief designer and general manager of Triumph, had this to say: \n \nI am often asked, why Triumph don’t [sic] show interest in the T.T. races. \nThe  answer  is  that  racing  is  no  longer  an  attractive  proposition  for  \nmanufacturers. In 1926 or 1927 the position was different, because at least \n60  per  cent  of  a  racing  machine  was  then  based  on  the  standard  model.  \nToday,  racing  machines  are  special  from  wheel  to  wheel,  and  there  is  \nnothing  that  can  be  translated  into  production.  I  don’t  say  that  the  T.T.  \nshould be abolished, just that there should be stock-machine races, and for \nour  part  we  should  be  prepared  to  support  such  events.  I  believe  other  \nmakers would do so, too.\n60\n \n \nEvidently,  the  chief  designer  at  Triumph  believed  that  the  races  were  not  \nadvantageous to the company because they did not set out to improve the \nproduction motorcycle; they only served to make manufacturers produce a \nspecially  built  motorcycle  for  racing  on  the  island.  BSA  also  proved  that  \nattendance at the TT was not necessary to improve the production of their \nmotorcycles.  BSA  “had  made  two  attempts  to  take  part  in  major  speed  \nevents; in the TT races of 1913 and 1921. In the former, a team of six 500s \nwas entered, with only a single finisher in 7\nth\n place”, and further that “the \n1921  attempt  was  a  total  and  most  spectacular  disaster”\n61\n BSA  did  not \nenter  the  TT  races  again  until  after  World  War  Two.  Despite  this  lack  of  \nsuccess, however, BSA was the market leader during the 1920s, producing \n12,000  to  18,000  machines  per  year  for  much  of  the  decade,  which  \nequated  to  20  –  25  per  cent  of  the  total  output  of  the  British  motorcycle  \nindustry.\n62\n \nWe  can  see  then  that  it  was  not  entirely  necessary  for  a  motorcycle  \nmanufacturer  to  enter  the  TT  races,  as  has  been  shown  in  the  opinion  of  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n60\n  H.

The cost of entering the TT \nwas also large, and while attempts were made to try and reduce this, there \nwas  little  or  even  no  chance  that  a  motorcycle  race  would  be  held  on  \npublic  roads  in  England.  This  meant  that  if  manufacturers  wanted  to  test  \ntheir  machines  against  those  produced  by  other  manufacturers,  the  best  \nand indeed only place to do so was on the Isle of Man.  \nThe  legislation  proposed  by  Moore-Brabazon  failed,  and  so  there  was  \nno chance of a motorcycle road race, taking place in England. This meant \nthat despite the obvious disadvantages of racing on the Isle of Man, most \nmanufacturers  were  tempted  still  to  participate.  Evidently  there  were  \nadvantages to be had from competing on the island. The location of the TT \ncourse  might  have  been  inconvenient,  but  the  course,  tried  and  tested  in  \nthe past, provided a unique examination of a motorcycle’s reliability, with \nhills, tight corners and long straights testing its all-round performance. The \ntourist, most manufacturers argued, wanted a motorcycle that was reliable \nand  easily  maintained.  The  TT  races  were  the  ultimate  test  of  reliability.  \nAn anonymous article in The Evening News in 1922 argued that there were \ncertain areas of motorcycle design that were exposed by races such as the \nTT:  \n \nThe hidden weakness in the gearbox, the latent fault in lubrication – these \nand  a  thousand  other  faults  are  infallibly  brought  to  light  by  the  test  of  \nsuch  races  as  the  Tourist  Trophy  and  the  annual  500  mile  event  at  \nBrooklands. It is to these that we owe the efficiency and reliability of our \nmedium-powered  motor-cycle,  attributes  now  so  well  known  that  the  \ntransfer  of  a  classic  British  maker  is  as  much  respected  in  the  farthest  \ncorner of the world as the hall mark on gold.\n63\n \n \nIt  was  also  acknowledged  that  specific  advances  in  the  development  of  \nmotorcycle engineering also resulted from entry into the TT. An article in \nMotor Cycling in 1930, reported Rudge’s TT success, using a new engine \ndesign  that  consisted  of  a  “semi-spherical  combustion  chamber  and  four  \nvalves,  all  mutually  inclined  with  the  sparking  plug  in  the  middle.”  This  \nengine had been specifically tested in the TT, and whilst the difficulties in \ndesigning  such  an  engine  had  deterred  other  manufacturers,  “the  Rudge  \ndesigners   have   produced   a   TT   machine   with   this   seemingly   ideal   \narrangement  and,  what  is  more,  it  has  proved  itself  good  enough  to  take  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n63\n Evening  News,  17  June  1922.

In  a  meeting  of  the  Competitions  Committee  of  the  \nManufacturers’ Union in 1922, it was decided that teams competing in the \nTT  should  specify  to  the  ACU  at  the  beginning  of  a  race  the  type  of  fuel  \nand oil used by their motorcycles, and that the ACU should be responsible \nfor publishing this information afterwards. It was believed that “the public \nshould  be  acquainted  with  such  details.”\n65\n  This  shows  recognition  of  the  \npower  of  the  races  to  influence  the  buying  public,  assuming  that  the  fuel  \nand oil used were commercially available. The question of the type of fuel \nto be used in the TT was again raised in 1926 in a further meeting between \nthe Competitions Committee of the ACU and the Manufacturers’ Union. A \npress release concerning the rules for the 1926 TT races stated that:  \n \nThe Competition Committee of the ACU and the British Cycle and Motor-\ncycle Manufacturers’ and Traders’ Union Ltd., met at the R.A.C, London, \nto-day  to  discuss  the  question  of  the  fuels  which  should  be  used  by  \ncompetitors   in   the   Tourist   Trophy   Races   this   year.   The   Motorcycle   \nManufacturers   asked   that   no   fuel   should   be   used   which   is   not   \ncommercially   obtainable,   their   opinion   being   that   the   use   of   non-\ncommercial  fuels  in  the  Races  conveys  impressions  to  the  public  that  the  \nmachines used bear no resemblance to those supplied to the public, and are \nnot obtainable, even in a modified form for touring purposes. \n \nWhilst  the  Auto  Cycle  Union  is  firmly  convinced  that  no  restrictions  \nshould be embodied in the regulations which would deprive the T.T. Races \nof  their  value  as  a  testing  ground,  not  only  for  the  machines  themselves,  \nbut  for  every  accessory  used  in  connection  with  them,  the  arguments  \nadvanced by the manufacturers in regard to the use of commercial fuels in \nthis  year’s  Races  were  of  such  value  to  the  riding  public  that  the  Auto  \nCycle  Union  decided  to  accede  to  the  Manufacturers’  request.

From  this  it  is  clear  that  the  Manufacturers’  Union  and  the  \nACU  were  keen  to  see  the  TT  reflect  the  products  available  for  the  \nconsumer, if not now then later. The commitment of these organisations to \nsee  the  TT  serve  the  purpose  of  improving  design  was  therefore  another  \nreason  why  many  manufacturers  entered  the  TT,  because  they  had  the  \nencouragement of their governing bodies.  \nThere were also financial incentives. In 1930, when the first grant was \nprovided  to  the  ACU,  the  reasons  for  which  were  discussed  earlier,  the  \nManx government provided a further reason for manufacturers to continue \ncoming  to  the  Isle  of  Man.  It  was  decided,  in  an  agreement  between  the  \nACU and the Manufacturers’ Union that the initial grant of £5,000 would \nbe  used  for  prize  money  and  to  assist  foreign  competitors  to  participate.  \n£1,000  was  set  aside  to  encourage  international  entries  of  six  to  eight  \ncompetitors  from  Canada,  New  Zealand,  Australia  and  South  Africa.  A  \nfurther   £1,500   was   set   aside   to   secure   first-class   riders   from   other   \nContinental  countries.  This  would  increase  the  international  nature  of  the  \nTT.  The  remaining  £2,500  was  allocated  to  a  prize  fund  for  winning  \nmanufacturers,  which  would  include  rewards  for  up  to  sixth  position  in  \neach race: a further incentive to race on the Isle of Man.\n67\n \nThis grant was redistributed in 1932 with the purpose of giving greater \nincentives to manufacturers to enter the TT, “for it was recognised that the \nmanufacturers’  support  of  the  event  was  imperative  to  the  Island.”\n68\n The \ngrant was redistributed so that teams entered by British manufacturers, not \nexceeding  four  in  each  race,  were  free  of  all  expenses  and  also  so  that  \nriders appearing as the manufacturer’s entrant were paid an appearance fee \nof  £20.  Once  again,  international  entries  were  considered.  It  was  agreed  \nthat official invitations to riders in the dominions should be reduced to one \nper  dominion  –  but  each  entry  would  only  be  accepted  after  the  British  \nmotorcycle manufacturer had signalled his intention to support the entrant. \n£50  would  then  be  given  to  the  manufacturer  to  cover  the  cost  of  the  \nprofessional assistance given to the rider. The balance of the £5,000 would \nbe  used  to  subsidise  foreign  riders,  and  if  riding  a  British  machine  a  £50  \nsubsidy would be payable to the manufacturer.

If  more  people  were  watching  sport  then  there  would  be  much  \ngreater  knowledge  of  sporting  events  among  consumers.  The  TT  was  a  \nsporting  event  that  was  growing  in  significance  during  the  inter-war  \nperiod.  \nThe   motorcycle   industry   began   to   advertise   their   products   more   \nextensively, and one angle that was taken was the emphasis on success in \nracing, especially in the Isle of Man TT. If the decision were made to race \non  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  if  a  manufacturer’s  team  enjoyed  success  in  a  \nparticular  race  –  finishing  either  first,  second  or  third  –  this  achievement  \ncould be used to sell their machines. Despite the limited advertising before \nWorld  War  One,  by  1921  there  was  extensive  use  of  achievements  in  the  \nTT in advertisements produced not only by motorcycle manufacturers but \nalso  by  sellers  of  spare  parts  and  even  independent  garages  to  advertise  \ntheir products and services, especially in the motorcycle press where such \nadvertisements would be expected to appear. \nDespite  the  view  of  one  letter  written  to  the  editor  of  Motor  Cycling, \nwhich  suggested  that  too  many  advertisements  drawing  on  TT  success  \nproduced  confusion  as  to  who  the  winner  of  a  race  was,  there  were  \nadvantages to be derived from a victory in the TT.\n74\n One technical journal, \nThe  Automobile  Engineer,  noted  in  1928  that  there  were  “undoubted  \ncommercial advantages that follow upon success in this [the TT] and other \ntrials  of  a  sports  character”,  and  indeed  it  was  judged  a  “ruling  factor.”\n75\n \nEmphasis  on  sporting  events  was  again  endorsed  in  1937  as  “a  useful  \ndevice  in  breaking  down  sales  resistance.”\n76\n  It  was  claimed  that  a  firm  \nwhose  motorcycles  did  well  at  the  TT  was  almost  certain  to  enjoy  \nimproved  sales  shortly  afterwards.  “Many  chaps  of  quite  high  standing”,  \nclaimed J.M. West in an interview with Koerner, who confided to him that \nhis  choice  of  a  new  machine  was  dependant  on  the  outcome  of  the  TT  \nraces, decided: “I’m going to buy whatever wins the TT.”\n77\n \nWe  can  see  also  that  Triumph,  whose  chief  designer  allegedly  argued  \nagainst  participation  in  the  TT  races,  placed  a  TT  mark  on  some  of  their  \nmotorcycles.  Triumph  had  produced  a  500  c.c.  model  between  1909  and  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n73\n Benson, The Rise of Consumer Society, p. 110.  \n74\n Motor Cycling, 6 July 1921. \n75\n ‘Motor cycles’, The Automobile Engineer, August 1928, p. 273. \n76\n ‘Motor Cycle Sport’, The Export Trader, July 1937, p. 231. \n77\n As quoted in Koerner, ‘The British Motor Cycle Industry, 1935 – 1975’, p. 22."

Triumph  was  using  their  \nearlier  experience  of  the  TT  to  develop  the  design  of  their  motorcycles,  \nand evidently judged that the existence of the TT mark on the motorcycle \nwould  make  it  more  attractive  to  Triumph’s  customers.  Gilbert  Smith,  \nmanaging  director  of  Norton  –  a  brand  which  became  synonymous  with  \nthe  TT  during  this  period  –  looked  back  on  the  success  of  Norton  \nmotorcycles  in  the  TT  during  the  inter-war  years  and  made  it  clear  that  \n“undoubtedly an Isle of Man win means that the winning make of machine \nis  publicised  in  every  important  newspaper  in  the  world:  this  is  valuable  \npublicity   and   would   normally   cost   far   more   than   any   motor-cycle   \nmanufacturer could spend.”\n79\n  \nIt   was   not   just   motorcycle   manufacturers   who   benefited   from   \nachievements   in   the   TT.   Examples   of   advertising   from   the   period   \ndemonstrate   independent   garages   and   manufacturers   of   accessories   \ndrawing  on  success  in  the  TT  to  advertise  their  services.  For  example,  in  \nan advertisement for Renold Chains it is stated that they were fitted to the \nfirst,  second  and  third  placed  machines  in  the  1921  Junior  and  Senior  TT  \nraces.  The  implication  is  that  if  this  accessory  were  fitted  to  a  production  \nmotorcycle  the  customer  would  be  benefiting  “by  the  experience  of  the  \nmen  who  know.”  Indeed,  Renold  Chains  was  a  well-established  business  \nby 1921, having been founded in 1879.\n80\n In this instance the TT was being \nused  to  publicise  the  business  of  Hans  Renold  Limited,  Manchester,  and  \nalso  to  signify  product  reliability.  Further  advertisements  from  Motor \nCycling again  draw  on  achievements  in  the  TT,  the  promoting,  for  \nexample,  the  reliability  of  AMAC  carburettors  that  were  fitted  to  TT  \nmachines and to independent garages selling AJS motorcycles, which had \nbeaten Indian to first place in the Senior TT race. Such promotion, it was \nassumed,  would  make  AJS  motorcycles  more  attractive  to  the  average  \nmotorcyclist  or  tourist.  He  would  be  buying  a  motorcycle  with  proven  \nsuccess on the racetrack and, as a result, reliability.  \nThere was further exploitation of success in the TT by firms selling oil, \ntyres  and  magnetos.  Miracle  Oil  exploits  the  victory  of  Tom  Sheard,  the  \nfirst Manx born TT winner. Dunlop is also shown to have promoted their \nsequence  of  victories  in  the  TT  since  1907  to  advertise  the  quality  of  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n78\n A list of models between 1902 and 1981 can be found in H.

In each of these advertisements there evidently is no need to stipulate \nthat these products had been tested on the Isle of Man and indeed in very \nfew  advertisements  is  the  Isle  of  Man  referred  to.  The  advertisements  \nsimply  list  achievements  under  terms  such  as  “Senior  TT”,  “Lightweight  \nTT”  or  “Junior  TT.”  TT  and  Isle  of  Man  had  become  merged  in  a  single  \nbrand or identity. \nA  further  development  in  advertising  during  the  inter-war  period  saw  \nadvertising  agencies  brought  under  tighter  legal  control.  They  were  no  \nlonger allowed to use people’s names without their consent as if they were \nendorsing  a  product.  Such  misconduct  was  exemplified  in  the  case  of  \namateur  golfer  Cyril  Tolley  in  1928,  whose  name  Fry’s  used  without  his  \npermission. Ultimately Tolley brought an action against Fry’s for libel, in \nwhich  he  was  awarded  £1,000  damages.  This  case  set  a  precedent  and  \nadvertisers could no longer get away with using any person they chose to \nendorse   their   products.\n82\n   It   is   interesting   therefore   that   motorcycle   \nmanufacturers  also  used  the  success  of  TT  riders  to  promote  a  particular  \nmachine. We can see instances where victories of specific riders are drawn \non  to  promote  both  motorcycles  and  motorcycle  accessories,  providing  \nearly examples of a celebrity culture attached to TT victors. A Hutchinson \ntyre  advertisement  from  1922,  for  example,  drew  on  the  success  of  Tom  \nSheard, as noted earlier the first Manxman to win a TT race: \n \nA T.T. winner is Tom Sheard –  \n(Heavens!

Whether  \nthese riders had given permission for their names to be used is unclear, but \nthey were racing for manufacturers’ teams and were not amateur riders, so \nthe  association  between  their  success  and  a  particular  brand  of  machine  \ncould be made. \nIndeed, even during the inter-war period there was some recognition of \nthe  celebrity  of  TT  riders  in  the  British  press,  with  the  Daily  Express  for  \nexample  commenting  in  1927  that  in  the  TT  “heroes  of  the  continent  \ncompete  side  by  side  with  the  men  whose  names  are  household  words  in  \nEngland.”\n85\n The Bolton Evening News claimed that “not the most brilliant \nDerby favourite can inspire such raptures of hero worship as those that are \nlavished each year in the Isle of Man on him who has covered those break \nneck  miles  on  the  flanks  of  Snaefell  at  record  speed.”\n86\n Even  during  the \ninter-war   period   it   was   realised   that   celebrity   sold   products,   and   \nrecognition that those racing in the TT were highly skilled and worthy of \n“celebrity” status.  \nThe  examples  of  Triumph  and  BSA  show  that  success  in  the  TT  was  \nnot  essential  in  order  to  become  a  profitable  motorcycle  manufacturer.  \nHowever,  even  if  entry  and  success  in  the  Isle  of  Man  were  not  essential  \nduring  the  inter-war  period,  they  probably  helped.  Most  motorcycle  \nmanufacturers  continued  to  attend  the  TT  races,  despite  the  obvious  \ndeterrents of cost and inconvenience. If a particular machine, be it AJS or \nNorton,  achieved  anything  from  first  to  even  fourth  or  fifth  place  this  \n“success” could be advertised: the machine on sale had proven TT quality.  \nManufacturers  continued  to  enter  teams  because  the  TT  was  a  test  of  \nreliability and the Isle of Man provided an arena where machines could be \ntested  in  competition.

We  might  suggest  that  the  TT  became  part  of  a  Manx  \nidentity in the minds of Manx politicians, but not necessarily in the minds \nof the entire population. It has also been shown that the TT was supported \nby  motorcycle  manufacturers,  and  by  offering  their  support  they  too  \nplayed  a  part  in  the  development  of  the  TT  as  an  ingredient  of  Manx  \nidentity by increasing the external representation of the Isle of Man as the \nhome  of  the  TT  races. This  chapter  looks  at  the  construction  of  identity  \nboth  outside  and  inside  of  the  island  during  the  inter-war  period.  It  will  \ntake  as  its  theme  the  work  of  Urry,  especially  such  literature  as  The \nTourist  Gaze  and Consuming  Places.  Urry  suggests  that  the  “Tourist  \nGaze”,  which  describes  the  development  of  a  sense-of-place  or  place-\nmyth, is central to the consumption of tourist services. He suggests several \nkey  elements  that  go  towards  constructing  this  “gaze”,  and  explains  the  \nneed for such a construction.\n1\n Urry argues that tourism can be defined as a \nleisure  activity  that  is  organised  and  regulated.  The  greater  movement  of  \npeople  to  other  destinations  outside  normal  places  of  residence  and  work  \nmeans  an  increase  in  numbers  choosing  to  engage  in  tourist  practices,  \ntherefore  increasing  new  socialised  forms  of  provision  in  order  to  cope  \nwith the mass character of the “tourist gaze.” Tourists thus anticipate that \ntheir   chosen   destination   will   provide   pleasures,   distinctiveness   and   \ndifference  from  their  place  of  residence.  This  anticipation  is  constructed  \nand sustained, suggests Urry, through “non-tourist” practices such as film, \nnewspapers,  TV  programmes,  magazines,  records  and  videos  and  is  \nenhanced by particular signs or familiar sights. Urry points out that: \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n J.

It is this “place-myth” that will be examined. \nThe premise of this chapter is that there were in fact two rival place myths \non  the  island  during  the  inter-war  period.  One,  based  on  heritage,  nature  \nand history and the other based on speed, danger and modern technology. \nThis  chapter  will  also  re-introduce  the  idea  of  a  “consumed”  national  \nidentity. In relation to this work, this is the consumption of the TT races in \nthe  press,  in  race  reports,  in  film  and  in  other  literature  about  the  Isle  of  \nMan,   because   no   team,   certainly   not   one   from   the   Isle   of   Man,   \n“represented”  a  nation.  The  Isle  of  Man’s  status  lay  as  a  venue  for  the  \nevent. In that way the TT came to be consumed as a representation of the \nIsle of Man. \nFurther to this, this chapter will also address the idea that the TT races \nbecame   ingrained   in   “Manx   identity”   and   thereby   became   intensely   \nfamiliar  to  the  islanders.  It  is  clear  that,  internally,  the  present  day  TT  \nraces  form  part  of  the  island’s  “banal  nationalism”,  being  a  familiar  \nsymbol  of  Manx  identity  to  residents.  Most  specifically  my  analysis  is  \ninfluenced    by    Billig’s    conclusion    that    nationhood    is    flagged,    \nunobtrusively,   throughout   the   nation.   Symbols   act   as   reminders   of   \nnationality,   and   as   Billig   states,   “the   metonymic   image   of   banal   \nnationalism  is  not  a  flag  which  is  being  waved  with  fervent  passion;  it  is  \nthe flag hanging outside the public building.”\n4\n It is this constant reminding \nthat  not  only  allows  nationalist  movements  to  be  motivated  in  times  of  \nnational crisis but that also draws people together as part of a community. \nThe TT races, it is suggested, came to play such a role on the Isle of Man \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n2\n Urry, Consuming Places, p. 133. \n3\n  For  an  analysis  of  the  development  of  a  ‘sense-of-place’  generated  in  the  Lake  \nDistrict during the inter-war period see C.

This  sense  of  community,  suggests  Billig,  is  also  \nachieved  by  the  “homeland  deixis”,  the  use  of  words  such  as  “we”,  “us”  \nand “our” in newspapers, speeches and other literature.\n5\n  \nBillig’s work is also used as a central interpretative device in an article \nby  Hill.\n6\n  “The  Cup  Final”,  suggests  Hill,  “though  a  more  elaborate  affair  \nthan  the  symbols  studied  by  Billig,  is  nonetheless  a  part  of  the  ‘banal’  \nconstruction  of  nationhood.  Its  familiarity  serves  to  mask  its  flagging  \nfunction.”\n7\n  I  have  similarly  sought  to  demonstrate  the  “banal”  aspects  of  \nthe TT in an article in the International Journal of Motorcycle Studies, in \nwhich  I  suggest  that  the  TT  races  have  become  so  familiar  to  the  Manx  \npeople,  because  the  presence  of  the  course,  the  grandstand  and  other  \nsymbols of the TT all year round perform similar flagging functions, that \nthey  are  prepared  to  waive  the  inconvenience  caused  by  the  event.  It  has  \nalso  become  part  of  who  they  believe  they  are  as  a  “nation.”  This  article  \nalso made an early attempt to employ the homeland deixis to reports of the \nTT races, in which the familiarity of the Manx with the TT and the belief \nthat  the  “nation”  welcomed  the  event  each  year  were  endorsed  by  the  \nlanguage used in such reports.\n8\n  \nExternal Constructions of Manx Identity \nDuring  the  inter-war  period  the  outside  definition  of  the  Isle  of  Man  \nwas  joined  by  the  island’s  growing  fame  as  the  home  of  the  TT  races.  \nRather  than  collide  these  two  representations  came  to  exist  harmoniously  \nalongside  each  other.  Indeed,  in  1925  it  was  suggested,  in  an  article  in  \nSunday at Home that on the Isle of Man “in striking juxtaposition you will \nfind  the  ancient  and  the  modern  ...

One example of such literature is Radcliffe’s 1925 book \nThe Isle of Man.\n11\n One of a series of “little guides”, which included guides \nto  each  English  county,  the  book  gave  a  good  survey  of  the  island  but  it  \nrepresented  the  Isle  of  Man  in  a  particular  way,  a  way  which  highlighted  \nthe more traditional aspects of island life. Hall Caine praised the guide in \nthe preface, stating that: \n \n...I think the first thing [the book] will reveal is that the Isle of Man is very \nbeautiful ... It is lovely, with a loveliness that is perhaps all its own, and it \nis  due  partly  to  its  littleness,  so  many  features  being  packed  into  a  small  \nspace\n.\n12\n \n \nRadcliffe   describes   in   detail   the   “situation,   extent   and   physical   \nfeatures” of the Isle of Man, examining its geographical situation, geology \nand its climate. He goes on to consider the island’s flora and fauna and its \nscenery,  all  of  interest  to  the  naturalist.  There  are  brief  summaries  of  the  \nisland’s  industries,  communications  with  the  mainland,  and  ways  of  \ntravelling around the island, looking most specifically at the island’s roads \nand   railways.   Further   to   this   there   are   descriptions   of   the   island’s   \nantiquities,   Celtic   crosses,   prehistoric   tools   and   pottery   and   ancient   \nchurches.  This  section  moves  on  to  a  concise  narrative  of  the  island’s  \nhistory  up  to  the  twentieth  century,  including  the  changing  control  of  the  \nisland,  from  Celts  to  Vikings  to  the  English.  It  discusses  such  island  \ncelebrities   as   Hall   Caine,   T.E.   Brown,   A.W.   Moore   and   the   artist   \nArchibald Knox. Radcliffe’s is a small book, but it contains a broad survey \nof the Isle of Man. There is, however, no mention of the TT or indeed of \nany sport on the Isle of Man.\n13\n \nLike Radcliffe’s book, other inter-war guidebooks also focused on the \nmany  attractions  of  the  Isle  of  Man  but  ignored  the  TT.  Such  literature  \nincludes Black’s  Guide  to  the  Isle  of  Man  and  Abel  Heywood  and  Sons  \nIllustrated Guide to the Isle of Man, both published outside of the island. \nThese too take on the structure of describing the island town by town and \nconstructing   a   sense   of   place   that   focuses   on   the   natural   or   the   \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n10\n See J.K.

There are few \nplaces in the British Isles which could rival the Isle of Man in displaying \nwithin a little space a great variety of scenes.”\n15\n The island, it was pointed \nout, contained: \n \nAll the elements of a complete national life: ports and harbours, rivers and \nglens,  hills  that  attain  at  times  almost  to  the  dignity  of  mountains,  towns  \nand  villages,  and  a  continuous  and  interesting  history  that  can  be  traced  \nback  for  centuries;  a  sturdy  native  stock  pursuing  native  industries.  It  has  \neven succeeded in breeding its own brand of cat! That cat is symptomatic. \nIt is nearly like other cats – but not quite.\n16\n \n \nThere  was  no  mention  of  motorcycle  races  in  this  description  of  the  \nisland. The main attractions of the island were said to be its scenery, with \nso much crammed into a small space, plus history or the quaint. There was \nalso the recognition that the Isle of Man was not quite like any other place. \nA  special  issue  of  The  Humorist  (1934)  almost  neglected  to  mention  the  \nTT,  with  the  author  stating,  “personally,  I  cannot  see  all  the  need  for  the  \nhurry of the TT. The Island possesses quite a good little electric railway to \nget about on.”\n17\n This suggested that there were many other reasons to visit \nthe Isle of Man. The tourist need not visit the island during the TT period.  \nThe Isle of Man could be therefore still represented in rather traditional \nways.  Moreover,  it  was  not  only  travel  literature  that  highlighted  the  \nisland’s natural scenery, history and heritage as reasons to visit the island. \nEven  the  motorcycle  press  recognised  the  diversity  on offer in the Isle of \nMan  in  articles  that  made  suggestions  for  places  to  visit  when  not  \nwatching  the  TT  races.  Such  articles  include  “The  Mysteries  of  Mona”  \nwhich  attempted  to  explain  the  development  of  some  Manx  customs,\n18\n \n“Manxland  for  potterers”  which  proposed  places  to  visit  on  the  island  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n14\n  See  for  example,  Black’s  Guide  to  the  Isle  of  Man,  1919;  Abel  Heywood  and  \nSons  Illustrated  Guide  to  the  Isle  of  Man,  (Manchester,  1919/1932);  Midland  and  \nScottish Railway Company, The Isle of Man: Pleasure Island, (1929). \n15\n  Midland  and  Scottish  Railway  Company,  The  Isle  of  Man:  Pleasure  Island,  \n(1929). \n16\n  Midland  and  Scottish  Railway  Company,  The  Isle  of  Man:  Pleasure  Island,  \n(1929). \n17\n The Humorist, 23 June 1934.  \n18\n Motor Cycling, 24 June 1931, pp. 248-249."

The \nTT  was  representative  of  the  Manx  identity  not  because  it  was  Celtic  or  \nNorse but because it was modern. It imposed itself on the island’s natural \nscenery  and  was  in  some  accounts  juxtaposed  with  the  island’s  historic  \nsites. In fact and as one would expect the motorcycle press, since the TT’s \ninception  in  1907,  had  always  regarded  the Isle of Man as principally the \nhome of the TT, and had always eagerly anticipated the event. According \nto the motorcycle press, the  Isle  of  Man  largely  if  not exclusively existed \nfor motorcycle racing. The island’s biggest attraction was the TT. In 1928, \nStaxton,   a   correspondent   for   Motor   Cycling,   described   his   island   \nimpressions,  focusing  strongly  on  the  importance  of  the  TT.  His  opinion  \nwas that:  \n \nTo  be  the  complete  motorist,  one  must  have  seen  at  least  one  Tourist  \nTrophy meeting. The races must be seen and the atmosphere of the Island \nsampled before one can claim to know all the joys that are attached to this \nwonderful sport of ours. \n \nThe  “Magic  Island”  has  about  it  during  T.T.  week  an  atmosphere  that  is  \nunique;  it  becomes  for  the  time  being  the  motorcyclist’s  paradise.  He  and  \nhis  machine  are  welcomed;  his  pet  sport  is  the  one  and  only  topic  of  the  \nhour – and what could the keen rider want more? \n \nCertainly  this  year’s  [TT]  saw  no  diminution  of  T.T.  fever.  Once  again  a  \nrecord  number  of  visitors  arrived  in  the  Island,  with  a  record  number  of  \nmotor-cycles  and  cars.  Once  again  these  visitors  formed  themselves  into  \nhuge  crowds  around  the  course;  once  again  these  crowds  displayed  an  \nenthusiasm that neither pen nor camera can, somehow, get quite fully into \nprint. \n \nEverybody, too, seemed to be having the time of their lives. Whether they \ncame  over  for  the  Senior  only,  by  one  of  the  Motor  Cycling  steamers,  or  \nwhether  they  did  the  thing  in  de  luxe  manner  by  booking  a  room  for  a  \nweek  or  two  in  the  “Fort  Anne.”  The  visitors  seemed  bent  on  enjoying  \nthemselves ... the good Manx folk were more than kind to them; the Manx \npolice were forbearing to a point that at times became almost alarming, and \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n19\n Motor Cycling, 13 June 1933, pp. 170-171. \n20\n Motor Cycling, 16 June 1937, p. 243."

As  a  holiday  the  week  \ncould not be beaten.\n21\n \n \nBy suggesting that to be the complete motorist one must have seen the TT, \nStaxton  brought  together  the  motorcyclist,  motorcycle  racing  and  the  Isle  \nof Man. He did this further by referring to the Isle of Man as the “Magic \nIsle” and as the “motorcyclist’s paradise.” Staxton also creates an image of \nthe Isle of Man being populated, albeit for a certain part of the year, by a \nlarge number of motorcyclists.  \nAlthough Staxon’s description of the island focused heavily on the TT, \nit  was  not  as  extreme  a  description  as  offered  by  a  columnist  in  a  1935  \nedition  of  TT  Special  who  admitted  that,  as  a  school-boy,  he  had  “no  \ndesire  to  learn  anything  more  than  was  considered  necessary”,  but,  \namusingly,  he  did  “learn  something  which  was  not  included  in  the  \ncurriculum. [He] learned that the Island had at least one road that formed a \n37  ¼  mile  circuit.  The  highest  mountain  was  Snaefell;  the  principal  \nindustry was racing and its inhabitants were all motorcyclists. To a school-\nboy   that   sounded   like   utopia.”\n22\n   There   is   an   overemphasis   on   the   \nimportance  of  the  TT  in  this  description  since  the  Manx  were  obviously  \nnot all motorcyclists. However, many travelled to the Isle of Man in June \nbecause  the  island  was  the  home  of  the  TT,  albeit  only  for  two  or  three  \nweeks of the year. Indeed, A Guide to the Sporting Facilities on the Isle of \nMan,  published  in  Dundee  in  1932,  noted,  “The  greatest  sporting  event  \nnow  held  in  the  island  is,  of  course,  the  great  Tourist  Trophy  Races.”  It  \nwent  on  to  point  out  that  the  TT  attracted  “more  visitors  than  any  other  \nsingle event ... As the events are held in June, which is before the big rush \nof    visitors    for    the    July    and    August    holidays,    there    is    ample    \naccommodation  for  visitors.”\n23\n  The  1935  volume  of  this  publication  went  \nfurther to point out that “the T.T. races and the Grand Prix are sure to be \nheld  in  the  Isle  of  Man  for  several  years  to  come,  and  the  fact  that  the  \nLegislature  now  offers  a  sum  of  £5,000  for  the  purpose  of  inducing  and  \nassisting foreigners and colonials to compete has made the T.T. races more \ninternational than ever before.”\n24\n  \nHowever,  it  was  not  only  the  motorcycle  press  and  publications  that  \nspecifically  considered  the  development  of  sport  on  the  Isle  of  Man  that  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n21\n Motor Cycling, 20 June 1928. \n22\n TT Special, 12 June 1935. \n23\n Simmath Press Ltd., Sports  in  Manxland:  A  Guide  to  the  Sporting  Facilities  on  \nthe Isle of Man, (Dundee, Simmath Press, 1932), p. 7.  \n24\n Simmath Press Ltd., Sports  in  Manxland:  A  Guide  to  the  Sporting  Facilities  on  \nthe Isle of Man, (Dundee, Simmath Press, 1935), p. 7."

The British daily press \nalso  commented  on  the  races,  particularly  on  the  aspects  of  speed  and  \ndanger  that  brought  fame  or  infamy  to  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  also  in  \nrecognition of the event’s vast importance to the motorcycling community. \nIn 1928 the Daily Express, noting the popularity of the event, reported that \n“tens  of  thousands  travel  to  the  Isle  of  Man  each  year  to  see  the  blue  \nriband  of  motor  cycling,  the  Tourist  Trophy  Races.”\n25\n  An  article  in  the  \nBolton Evening News highlighted both the prestigious nature of the TT and \nthe potential dangers and thrills when it suggested that in the TT “man is \npitted  against  man,  and  the  qualities  that  count  are  courage,  steadiness  of  \nnerve,  coolness  of  head.”\n26\n  The  dangers  of  the  course  could  be  overcome  \nby  steadiness  of  nerve,  and  those  who  won  the  races  were  lavished  with  \nthe spoils of victory. \nNot  all  comments  in  the  British  press  were  comfortable  with  the  \npurpose   of   the   TT.   A   letter   to   the   Manchester   Guardian   in   1931   \nquestioned whether the event should continue. It read: \n \nWhen  one  reads  of  a  rider  killed  and  five  others  more  or  less  seriously  \ninjured in one day’s motor-cycle racing in the Isle of Man one cannot help \nasking whether the game is really worth the candle ... There are two things \nto  be  said  for  such  contests  as  the  Tourist  Trophy  races.  The  first  is  that  \nthey  provide  the  most  exacting  test  possible  for  engines  and  appliances.  \nThe  second  –  and  perhaps  this  is  to  do  more  with  their  popularity  –  they  \nare extremely spectacular ... They draw so many people to watch them that \nthe Manx Government finds it worth while to turn the whole island upside \ndown for them every year.\n27\n \n \nThe  letter  might  have  started  off  by  questioning  the  value  of  the  TT  \nraces, but it moved on to highlight the efforts made by the Manx to make \nit possible for the races to take place on the island. For one enthusiast, and \nindeed  for  those  who  read  the  Manchester  Guardian,  the  impression  was  \nthat  the  Manx  authorities  were  prepared  to  do  whatever  they  could  to  \nmake  the  continuation  of  the  TT  possible,  despite  the  danger  associated  \nwith  the  TT.  This  was  an  early  example  of  criticism  being  aimed  at  the  \nraces. It also shows, however, that the belief existed outside the island that \nthe Manx wanted to see the TT continue. \nDuring  the  inter-war  period  the  TT  certainly  helped  to  define  the  \nposition  of  the  Isle  of  Man  and  likewise  the  purpose  of  the  island’s  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n25\n Daily Express, 25 June 1927. \n26\n Bolton Evening News, 4 June 1928. \n27\n Manchester Guardian, 20 June 1931."

Yet the Isle of Man was still viewed as a \nplace  that  maintained  its  history,  heritage  and  natural  scenery.  There  was  \nmuch to do on the Isle of Man besides participate in motorcycle races.  \nIn  the  mid-1930s  these  rival  place  myths  were  firmly  set  down  in  \ncelluloid.  In  1935,  the  Isle  of  Man  Board  of  Advertising  allowed  the  \nfilming of Monty Banks’ film No Limit, starring George Formby and with \na story set at the TT races.\n28\n This film had originally been planned to show \nFormby  visiting  the  island’s  many  attractions.\n29\n No  Limit  follows  the  \nsuccess   of   George   Shuttleworth   riding   his   homemade   “Shuttleworth   \nSnap.”  It  follows  his  transformation  from  the  “lone  hand”,  whose  mother  \nstole from his grandfather the money to pay for the trip, to him becoming \nan   official   rider   for   Rainbow   motorcycles   (a   fictional   motorcycle   \nmanufacturer).  The  film  played  a  crucial  role  in  helping  to  reinforce  an  \nexternal perception of the Isle of Man. In the film we see shots of the Isle \nof  Man  TT  races,  of  the  rivalry  between  the  professional  and  amateur  \nmotorcycle  riders,  of  Douglas  beach  crowded  with  tourists,  and  of  the  \nisland’s range of other attractions.  \nThe  fact  that  this  film  was  made  at  all,  and  also  that  it  was  Formby’s  \nmost popular film, demonstrates the popularity of the TT externally.\n30\n It is \nparticularly  noticeable  that  throughout  the  film  the  Isle  of  Man  was  \nreferred  to  without  any  explanation  of  where  the  island  was  or  why  a  \nmotorcycle  race  was  being  held  there.  It  was  assumed  that  an  external  \naudience would be familiar with both. It is fair to assume that the island’s \ngrowing dependence on mass tourism – with visitors being drawn mostly \nfrom  the  northern  working  class  –  meant  that  the  majority  of  viewers  \nwould be familiar with the Isle of Man and the TT races before seeing the \nfilm. In this sense there is an implied familiarity between the audience and \nthe Isle of Man and between the audience and the TT races; the audience \nknows the location of the Isle of Man and they knew TT races took place \nthere  annually.  Viewers  might  have  holidayed  in  the  island  and  may  or  \nmay  not  have  seen  the  TT  races.  This  film  also  reflected  the  style  of  \nnewsreels  at  the  time,  demonstrating  the  popularity  of  the  races  in  scenes  \nshowing the bustling grandstands, crowds of spectators around the course, \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n28\n No Limit, (1935). \n29\n Board of Advertising Minutes, 13 March 1935. \n30\n Further discussion of No Limit and indeed Formby’s other films can be found in, \nfor  example,  D.

There \nwas no need for any explanation of why a keen motorcyclist from Wigan \nwould want to enter a motorcycle race held on the Isle of Man.  \nReviews of No Limit were also favourable, further representing the Isle \nof  Man  as  the  home  of  the  TT  races.  Picturegoer  Weekly  described  the  \nfilm   as   a   “breezy,   happy-go-lucky   farce,   which   culminates   in   an   \nexhilarating   piece   of   slapstick   spectacle”,   but   most   importantly   “it   \nincludes  cut-in  shots  of  the  Isle  of  Man  T.T.  races.”\n32\n The Pontefract \nAdvertiser in a review of No Limit suggested that: \n \nWhitsuntide,   the   Isle   of   Man   and   the   TT   races   make   a   delectable   \ncombination  for  the  holiday  period,  and  for  those  who  like  the  idea,  but  \nfind  it  impracticable,  there  is  solace  at  the  Alexandra  Cinema,  Pontefract.  \nNo  Limit  which  is  booked  for  presentation  throughout  the  week  abounds  \nwith  fast  moving  and  powerful  scenes,  many  of  which  show  actual  \nsequences from the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy races.\n33\n \n \nNo Limit further cemented the representation of the Isle of Man as the \nhome of the TT races, and the presentation of the film to a large audience \nincreased  the  perpetuation  of  this  particular  aspect  of  the  island’s  place  \nmyth.  The  races  were  eagerly  anticipated  by  the  motorcycle  community  \nand the success of No Limit suggests that the TT races were familiar to and \npopular with a wider audience.

Everywhere  the  visitor  brings  devastation  with  him.  \nThis, in a way, means a good amount of well-being to the Islander, and in \nconsequence  may  be  partly  over-looked.  But  the  visitor  seldom  brings  \nanything worthy of imitation, and rarely anything that Manxland would do \nwell to permanently maintain.\n36\n \n \nEyre clearly showed displeasure with the island’s growing dependence \non  the  attraction  of  tourists.  The  article  went  on  to  state  further  that  the  \n“invader arrives, and from that moment begins his habitual all-conquering \noffensiveness  with  a  widespread  distribution  of  largesse.”  It  was  pointed  \nout “for him [the visitor] they [the Manx] build hotels and hydros, and lose \ntheir  identity  ...  for  him  they  build  music-halls  and  picture-dromes,  and  \nlose  their  intelligence.”\n37\n  The  article  concluded:  “the  screaming  hectic  \nhurly  burly  is  the  price  the  Manxman  pays  for  the  desecration  of  his  \nland.”\n38\n These comments are filled with condemnation for the continuation \nof mass tourism on the Isle of Man. In Eyre’s opinion, then, the promotion \nof  mass  tourism  equalled  assimilation  with  England.  In  1908  a  “dweller  \nbeside  the  motor  course”  had  called  on  the  Manx  to  celebrate  their  \nseparateness  by  holding  motor  races,\n \nbut  Eyre  called  on  the  Manx  to  \ncelebrate  their  own  history,  language  and  the  natural  attractions  that  the  \nisland  had  to  offer.  These  two  contrasting  opinions  both  asserted  the  \nisland’s distinctiveness, but for very different reasons.  \nCaine celebrated the “traditional” characteristics of the island and Eyre \ncondemned the island’s reliance on mass tourism. Further constructions of \ntraditional   Manxness   can   be   seen   in   the   continuation   of   the   Manx   \nrenaissance. One aspect of this was the attempted resurrection of the Manx \nlanguage,  which  had  received  attention  in  the  years  before  World  War  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n36\n D.

For  the  Manx,  or  more  clearly  for  the  small  section  involved  in  the  \nManx  renaissance,  the  continued  pursuit  of  a  Manx  language  revival  \nmeant setting the island apart from England and denying the anglicisation \nof  the  island  which  was  the  result  of  mass  tourism.\n39\n  However,  in  1932  \nW.W. Gill, author of three volumes of A Manx Scrapbook, was compelled \nto  admit  that  “Manx  is  not  even  losing  ground,  languishing,  or  on  the  \nverge of extinction. As a means of communication it is dead, and has been \ndead  for  a  generation.”\n40\n  By  asserting  that  the  Manx  language  was  dead,  \nGill  removed  one  defining  characteristic  of  the  island’s  Celtic  identity.  \nAfter  taking  Gill’s  comments  into  consideration,  we  might  be  led  to  \nbelieve that Manx was unimportant as a means of communication and that \nattempts   at   its   revival   had   been   unsuccessful.   However,   Broderick   \nsuggests  that  the  Manx  language  underwent  a  second  phase  in  its  revival  \nduring the 1930s.\n41\n Broderick associates this second phase with J. J. Kneen \nand  Mona  Douglas.  Kneen  compiled  a  six-volume  work  on  Manx  place  \nnames, a Manx grammar and a work on Manx personal names.\n 42\n Kneen’s \nGrammar  of  the  Manx  Language  had  been  completed  in  1910,  but  it  was  \nnot published until the late 1920s when the Trustees of the Manx Museum \nrecognised  its  importance.\n43\n  Mona  Douglas,  who  it  must  be  pointed  out  \nwas  not  born  on  the  Isle  of  Man,  was  active  in  collecting  folklore  and  \nfolksongs  from  the  last  surviving  bearers  of  this  tradition  on  the  island.\n44\n \nShe founded the Manx youth movement Aeglagh Vannin in 1932 and was \nalso active in Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh (YCG), the Manx Gaelic Society, \nand   the   Celtic   Congress   up   until   World   War   Two.

Only \na  very  small  proportion  of  the  island’s  population  spoke  only  Manx  or  \nManx  and  English  in  1921  and  1931,  and  thus  the  island’s  dominant  \nlanguage  was  English.  In  1921  of  a  total  population  (aged  over  three  \nyears)  of  57,849  there  were  only  nineteen  speakers  of  Manx  alone,  896  \nspeakers  of  Manx  and  English  but  56,943  English  only  speakers.\n45\n By \n1931  of  a  population  (aged  over  three  years)  of  47,408  there  were  no  \nManx only speakers, only 529 speakers of English and Manx, and 46,879 \nEnglish only speakers.\n46\n Even with the disproportionately high population \nfigure recorded in 1921, as a result of the census being taken in June that \nyear  when  tourists  were  present  and  therefore  an  increased  number  of  \nsolely  English  speakers  on  the  island  we  can  see  that  the  Manx  language  \nwas indeed dying as a means of communication. Indeed, it could no longer \nbe used to construct Manx identity.  \nThe  attempts  to  increase  awareness  of  the  Manx  language  might  have  \nbeen    unsuccessful,    but    the    inter-war    period    did    see    important    \ndevelopments in the promotion of the island’s heritage. In 1922 the Manx \nMuseum  was  given  permanent  premises,  36  years  after  the  Museum  and  \nAncient  Monuments  Act  (1886)  had  provided  for  the  establishment  of  an  \ninsular   museum   and   better   protection   of   ancient   monuments.   The   \nmuseum’s  curators  during  the  inter-war  years,  Philip  Moore  Callow  \nKermode  (1922  -  1932)  and  William  Cubbon  (1932  -  1940),  sought  to  \npreserve aspects of the island’s Celtic history. Kermode’s focus concerned \narchaeological  work,  such  as  the  preservation  of  Manx  crosses  and  \nexcavations  at  Maughold  (1926)  and  Knock-e-Doonee  (1927).  Cubbon  \nwas responsible for compiling the two volumes of the Bibliography of the \nLiterature of the Isle of Man (1933 and 1939).\n47\n He also edited the Journal \nof  the  Manx  Museum  (1924  –  1939)  and  was  responsible  for  the  opening  \nof  Harry  Kelly’s  cottage  at  Cregneash,  the  Manx  National  Folk  Museum.  \nThese were efforts to sustain the more traditional parts of a Manx identity.  \nConstructions  of  a  traditional  Manx  identity  were  also  embodied  in  \npromotional  literature  produced  by  the  Board  of  Advertising  in  their  Isle  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n45\n Census 1921: Isle of Man, (London, H.M.S.O, 1924). \n46\n Census 1931: Isle of Man, (London, H.M.S.O, 1934). \n47\n W.

The  Board  printed  these  for  \nexternal  consumption  and  they  were  structured  to  promote  the  island  and  \nindicate  the  attractions  on  offer  to  the  tourist  in  the  different  areas  of  the  \nIsle of Man. The guidebooks were given names such as “Pleasure Island” \n(1925)  and  “Playground  of  the  British  Isles”  (1926).\n48\n The  prevailing \nimage created by these guidebooks was that the Isle of Man was a holiday \nresort  and  there  was  much  for  visitors  to  do.  These  mostly  excluded  \nwatching  the  TT  races.  One  indication  of  this  can  be  seen  in  the  type  of  \nnewspaper  comment  chosen  in  these  books  to  be  representative  of  the  \nisland.  These  were  examples  of  external  opinion  selected  for  use  by  the  \nManx  Board  of  Advertising  in  internally  produced  promotional  literature.  \nThe  examples  chosen  are  indicative.  In  1926,  the  Leicester  Advertiser  \nsuggested  that  “‘Just  one  big  playground”  was  as  apt  a  description  of  the  \nIsle  of  Man  as  one  can  give,  and  there  is  probably  no  place  in  the  British  \nIslands  where  the  traveller  is  more  deeply  and  effectively  catered  for.”\n49\n \nThis was a point of view that was reflected in the Aberdeen Press, which \npointed out that “‘Pleasure Island’ is certainly no misnomer. How to cater \nfor  visitors  is  the  Isle  of  Man’s  chief  end  ...  The  Island  is  full  of  beauty  \nspots,  the  roads  are  ideal,  and  everywhere  the  holiday  maker  is  the  first  \nconsideration.”\n50\n  Nevertheless,  in  this  instance  the  TT  races  were  then  \nmentioned  as  another  attraction.  A  paragraph  to  this  effect  was  contained  \nin the 1936 official guide. It stated: \n \nThe prevailing impression among those who have never been to the Island \nseems  to  be  that  T.T.  racers  dash  madly  through  dense  crowds  of  people,  \nand that any spare ground unoccupied by the holiday makers is taken up by \ntailless cats. The exquisite and varied beauty of the Island scenery; its age \nold  traditions;  its  gracious  hospitality;  and  above  all  the  possibility  of  \nfinding  miles  of  cliff  and  mountain  paths,  are  seldom  realised,  and  \nalthough  secure  in  the  affections  of  its  visitors,  Manxland  finds  difficulty  \nin  combating  the  too  general  opinion  that  it  is  over  run  with  visitors  and  \ncompletely given over to noisy pastimes.\n51\n \n \nIndeed,  despite  the  presence  and  promotion  of  the  more  traditional  \nfeatures of the Isle of Man, by the late 1920s there were clear indications \nthat   the   TT   races   had   become   embedded   within   Manx   identity   as   \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n48\n Isle  of  Man  Handbook:  Isle  of  Man:  Pleasure  Island,  (Douglas,  1925);  Isle  of  \nMan Handbook: Isle of Man: Playground of the British Isles, (Douglas, 1926).  \n49\n Isle of Man Handbook: ‘Isle of Man: Playground of the British Isles’, (Douglas, \n1926). \n50\n ‘Isle of Man: Playground of the British Isles’.  \n51\n Isle of Man Official Guide 1936, (Douglas, 1936)."

The   government-funded   Board   of   Advertising   \npromoted  the  TT  as  one  of  the  many  attractions  the  island  had  to  offer,  \nalongside  music  festivals  and  highland  games  and  indeed  the  Tynwald  \nceremony held each year on 5 July. \nSimilarly, there is evidence in the Manx press that the TT had become \nintegrated into the island’s sense-of-place. In 1928 the Isle of Man Weekly \nTimes  commented  on  the  passing  of  legislation  to  permit  further  road  \nclosures.  There  was  no  negative  reaction  to  the  inconvenience  of  closing  \nroads  to  allow  TT  racers  to  practice.  In  an  article  titled  simply  “roads  \nclosed  for  practising  at  last  [emphasis  added]”,  the  Isle  of  Man  Weekly  \nTimes  offered  their  support  for  the  TT,  noting  that  “the  T.T.  Races  exist  \nfor the purpose of improving the breed [the motorcycle]” and further that \n“this  year  practising  takes  place  under  what  can  be  described  as  ideal  \nconditions.”\n52\n  These  might  have  been  ideal  conditions  for  the  racers,  but  \nthey were not ideal for residents in towns and villages around the course. \nNevertheless,  there  was  unquestioned  support  offered  for  the  TT.  Further  \nto  this,  the  1928  Act  was  passed  by  a  legislature  “who  to-day  realise  as  \nmuch  as  we  all  do  the  value  of  motor-cycle  racing  to  this  Island.”\n53\n That \nthere  was  no  negative  reaction  to  the  passing  of  supportive  legislation  by  \nTynwald  suggests  that  the  TT  had  been  accepted  as  a  Manx  event,  which  \nshould  continue  to  take  place  on  the  island  and  that  was  beneficial  to  the  \nManx.  This  was  a  point  in  time  where  protests  could  have  been  made  \nagainst the continuation of the TT, yet it seems that because the event had \nbecome so far embedded in the Manx sense of what the island offered that \nthis would not happen.  \nThere was also a further representation of the TT as part of the island’s \nself-image in 1929. This was exemplified by the Speaker of the House of \nKeys when proposing the annual grant for the ACU. He was anxious that \nthe TT races should continue on the Isle of Man, having been “assured that \nthese races have been the cause of vast mechanical developments, not only \nin  connection  with  motors  and  vehicles  on  the  road,  but  indirectly  the  \naeroplane  industry  and  some  experimental  machines.”\n54\n The  Speaker  was \nclearly   proud   that   the   Isle   of   Man   had   become   associated   with   \nimprovements in technology. He went on to note: \n \nWe  are  anxious  that  these  races  should  continue,  and  we  are  all  very  \ndesirous  that  the  Island  should  be  the  arena  of  contests  of  this  kind.

The  Speaker  was  prepared  to  overlook  any  \npractical  disadvantages  that  there  might  be  in  holding  motor  races  on  the  \nIsle  of  Man  providing  that,  with  the  unrivalled  facilities  the  island  could  \nprovide, there were economic advantages to be had and above all that the \ncontinuation of motor racing on the island led to a positive representation \nof the Isle of Man as a place of distinction.  \nMoreover,  there  was  also  a  growing  claim  that  the  TT  placed  the  Isle  \nof  Man  towards  the  “centre  of  the  world.”  In  1921  Eyre  had  called  for  \nrecognition that: \n \nWithin  recent  years  this  English  conquest  of  the  Isle  of  Man  has  become  \nmore and more apparent. The Manx are gradually forsaking their priceless \nheritage – they have mostly forgotten or never known the language of their \nancestors,  and  it  has  become  the  fashion,  unfortunately,  to  do  things  as  \nthey are done in England.\n56\n \n \nThis  was  a  call  for  the  Manx  to  assert  their  independence,  to  use  \nlanguage and heritage to reject Englishness, and this should have included \nthe  intruding  presence  of  the  TT.  Yet,  by  the  late  1920s  the  TT  was  \nbecoming  a  global  event.  The  Manx  were  no  longer  doing  “things”  to  \nplease  the  English.  By  now  they  were  seeking  to  attract  TT  competitors  \nfrom  Europe  and  still  further  afield  to  give  the  event  an  increasingly  \ninternational feeling. In 1928 it was pointed out in Tynwald that: \n \nWe  have  machines  here  from  all  parts  of  the  world;  Italian,  Spanish  and  \nFrench  journalists  here;  German  machines  and  German  journalists.  As  far  \nas advertising is concerned, the Isle of Man is in a wonderful position not \nonly throughout the British Islands, but throughout the world, and it would \nbe a pity if anything was done to prevent the cyclists from coming here.\n57\n \n \nThe  attendance  of  motorcyclists  from  across  the  world  meant  greater  \npublicity  for  the  Isle  of  Man,  and  enhanced  substantially  the  status  of  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n55\n Debates, Vol. 45, 4 October 1929, p. 1203. \n56\n D.

A  1928  article  in  the  Isle  of  \nMan  Weekly  Times  suggested  that  there  was  no  doubt  that  the  “island”  \nappreciated the continuation of the TT and that: \n \nWe are  very  proud  indeed  of  our  course.  We know  it  is  the  finest  testing  \nground  in  the  world.  Riders  who  have  ridden  all  over  the  Continent  \nconfirm this statement. \n \nIn  saying  good-bye,  as  we do  today,  to  our  motoring  friends,  may  we \nexpress  the  wish  that  they  will  be  with  us  again  next  year,  and  that  the  \nlesson  learned  this  year  will  enable  the  British  motor-cycle  industry  to  \nmake  further  progress,  upholding  as  it  does,  the  supremacy  of  the  British  \nmotor-cycle over all others [Emphases added].\n58\n  \n \nWe  can  clearly  see  the  Manx  press  making  an  association  between  the  \nManx  people  and  the  TT  races.  This  was  clearly  an  association  between  \nthe  TT  and  what  it  meant  to  be  Manx,  an  ingredient  in  a  sense  of  Manx  \nidentity.  \nThe growing support of the Manx press for the TT, the recognition that \nthe races were a defining part of the island’s character and the suggestion \nthat they placed the Isle of Man towards the centre of the world can again \nbe seen in the Isle of Man Weekly Times’s support of Tynwald’s financial \ngrant  to  the  ACU  in  1930.  Instead  of  a  negative  reaction  to  this  use  of  \ntaxpayers’ money towards funding the event, it was stated that: \n  \nFor 23 years now the races have been run here, and now this little Island of \nours  has  become  the  hub  of  the  road  racing  universe  so  far  as  motor-\ncycling   is   concerned.   During   that   time   the   Manx   public   have   been   \ngradually  educated  to  a  realisation  of  the  important  part  which  the  races  \nplay  in  the  life  of  the  Island.  They  are  an  undoubted  attraction  to  visitors,  \nand this is fully realised here – so much so that the Manx Government last \nyear  voted  £5,000  to  the  A.C.U  in  order  that  the  prize  money  might  be  \nincreased  and  to  provide  a  fund  for  assisting  overseas  competitors  with  \ntheir expenses.\n59\n \n \nThere  is  not  even  the  smallest  hint  of  criticism  in  this  statement.  The  \njournalist considered the growing status of the TT internationally as reason \nto believe that the Manx people, as a whole, supported the continuation of \nthe event and that the TT races therefore belonged to the island and were a \nmatter of pride.     \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n58\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 9 June 1928. \n59\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 14 June 1930."

However,  there  was  no  organised  protest  against  the  TT  during  the  \ninter-war  years.  An  article  in  the  Isle  of  Man  Examiner  in  1937  did  \nacknowledge there was a small minority “who frown upon [the races] and \nresent   that   nocturnal,   unearthly   dim   made   by   the   machines   during   \npractising”,  but  the  author  also  reported  that  there  was  an  overwhelming  \ndesire  to  see  the  TT  continue  on  the  Isle  of  Man.\n60\n This  article,  titled \n“What we have let us hold” suggested that the TT race had indeed become \npart  of  the  Manx  way  of  life.  The  author  did  “not  propose  to  waste  any  \ntime  by  reflecting  on  whether  we  want  the  T.T.  races  to  continue  or  not”  \n[emphasis  added].  He  was  certain  that  “any  plebiscite  would  give  an  \noverwhelming  vote  in  their  favour,  and  so  we will  accept  that  to  be  the  \ngeneral  wish...[T]o  most  people  the  T.T.  races  are  a  boon  and  a  blessing  \nto the Island.”\n61\n While this was the view of one journalist, his suggestions \nthat no time should be wasted on asking whether “we” want the races and \nthat “we” will accept a general vote in their favour are much more than the \njournalist  interacting  with  his  readers.  It  is  an  attempt  to  assert  what  had  \nbecome important to the Manx people and what it meant to be Manx.  \nConclusion to Part Two \nA quotation taken from the Manchester Evening News and contained in \nthe  1925  Isle  of  Man  handbook  makes  the  following  suggestion:  “The  \nManx  Arms  are  legs,  three  in  number,  surrounded  by  a  motto  which  \nmeans,  ‘Whichever  way  you  throw  me  I  shall  stand’.  Some  people  take  \nthis  to  mean  that  the  Manx  will  stand  anything.  This  is  wrong.”\n62\n This \nrather flippant assessment of the feelings of the Manx population would be \nan  inaccurate  view  of  their  response  to  the  TT,  as  something  that  would  \nnot  merely  be  tolerated.  From  the  conclusions  drawn  earlier  we  might  \nhave  expected  to  see  the  development  of  a  conflict  between  rural  and  \nurban  interests  that  was  occasionally  voiced  in  the  Manx  legislature.  We  \nmight  have  expected  to  see  the  old  and  the  new  clash.  However,  this  did  \nnot happen. Instead the TT races became incorporated as another element \nin   Manx   identity.   They   sat   harmoniously   alongside   the   traditional   \nconstructions of the Manx place-myth. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n60\n Isle of Man Examiner, 25 June 1937. \n61\n Isle of Man Examiner, 25 June 1937. \n62\n ‘Isle of Man Handbook: Isle of Man: Pleasure Island’, (Douglas, 1925)."

This  was  in  conjunction  \nwith the growing support for the TT in the Manx legislature. This support \nwas realised because it was believed that the event could help publicise the \nisland. By using the TT in their publicity the Manx government went some \nway  to  creating  a  place  myth  to  rival  the  traditional  Celtic  and  Norse  \nrepresentations  of  the  island;  a  construction  that  was  more  Celtic  Tiger  \nthan  Celtic  twilight.  The  continuing  support  of  motorcycle  manufacturers  \nfor  the  event  also  aided  the  growing  external  representation  of  the  Isle  of  \nMan as the home of the TT races. Their attendance at the TT sustained the \nevent,  which  led  to  extra  column  inches  in  the  press  and,  further,  visual  \nrepresentations of the Isle of Man as the home of the TT as in the film No \nLimit and in newsreels shown to the British public. \nWhat  is  significant  though  is  that  the  TT  was  only  one  way  in  which  \nthe  Manx  and  those  outside  the  island  constructed  their  identity.  Whilst  \nthere was some reaction against the growth of mass tourism in the Isle of \nMan  (see  Eyre  and  the  continuation  of  the  Manx  cultural  renaissance),  \nthere  was  no  apparent  organised  protest  against  the  TT.  The  TT  races,  a  \nmore   modern   ingredient   in   Manx   identity,   did   not   clash   with   the   \ntraditional Celtic (language) and Norse (Tynwald) symbols of identity.

There  would  still  have  \nbeen  service  personnel  on  the  island.  There  were  not  only  difficulties  for  \nthe Manx in restarting the TT, but also for motorcycle manufacturers who \nwould  not  have  time  to  switch  from  war  time  production  and  to  prepare  \ntheir motorcycles for the TT races, despite the industry being in relatively \ngood  shape  after  the  end  of  the  war.\n1\n  In  the  period  immediately  after  the  \nend  of  World  War  Two  domestic  support  for  the  TT,  which  had  been  \nstrengthened during the inter-war period, was confirmed.  \nStructure and Practice of Government  \nFurther changes were made to the structure and practice of the island’s \ngovernment  in  the  period  immediately  after  World  War  Two.  First,  the  \nboards of Tynwald were renamed and reconstituted.

The  Executive  Council  was  to  be  composed  of  chairmen  of  the  \nmajor  spending  boards,  and  Tynwald  therefore  agreed  that  the  existing  \nprocess,  by  which  board  members  selected  their  chairman,  should  be  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n  See  S.

Third,  MHKs  took  on  a  \ngreater role in providing chairmen of Tynwald boards. Despite the balance \nbeing in favour of the Legislative Council during World War Two and in \nthe years immediately after, by 1951 MHKs provided chairmen for all but \nthe  Local  Government  Board  and  the  Electricity  and  Water  Boards.\n3\n The \ngrowing participation of MHKs as members of Tynwald Boards and their \nparticipation  in  Tynwald  committees  continued  through  the  1950s.  Thus  \nMHKs had a greater say in the practice of government on the Isle of Man, \nand therefore a greater say in the continuation of the TT. \nPerhaps  the  most  significant  change  in  the  structure  and  practice  of  \ngovernment  in  the  post-war  period  was  the  establishment  of  an  executive  \ncouncil.  The  precedent  for  this  was  set  during  World  War  Two  when  the  \nWar  Consultative  Committee  was  established,  with  the  purpose  of  acting  \nas a cushion between the lieutenant governor and the Legislative Council.\n4\n \nThe  first  executive  council  was  appointed  on  16  October  1946.  The  \nstructure of government now saw the lieutenant governor at the top, but an \nexecutive  council,  composed  of  chairmen  from  the  main  spending  boards  \nof  Tynwald  now  sat  between  the  lieutenant  governor  and  the  Legislative  \nCouncil. Members of the first executive council were Cowin (Agriculture \nand  Fisheries  Board),  Crellin  (Local  Government  Board  (LGB))  and  Gill  \n(Highways  and  Transport  Board)  all  from  the  Legislative  Council  and  \nKneen  (Social  Services  Board)  from  the  House  of  Keys.  MHKs  Alfred  \nTeare  and  Higgins  were  also  elected  to  the  Executive  Council  from  the  \nmembership of Tynwald. In an attempt to provide continuity from the War \nConsultative  Committee,  Deemster  Cowley,  who  had  been  chairman  of  \nthis committee was appointed as the seventh member. This meant that the \nExecutive  Council  had  a  balance  that  favoured  the  Legislative  Council  \nrepresentatives, much to the Keys’ agitation who, in the past, had sought a \nbalance of five to two in their favour. More importantly, however, Cowin, \nCowley,  Gill  and  Alfred  Teare  would  all  be  elected  by  the  members  of  \nTynwald to the Tynwald Motor Races Committee during their time on the \nExecutive  Council.  This  meant  that  the  members  of  the  House  of  Keys,  \nLegislative  Council  and  the  Executive  Council  all  had  an  interest  in  the  \ncontinuation of the TT, and support was widespread amongst members of \nthe Manx legislature. \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n3\n Kermode, Offshore Island Politics, pp. 144-143.  \n4\n  Statement  by  Lieutenant  Governor,  in  War  Committee  Minutes,  Vol.  1,  28  \nNovember 1939 -7 June 1940, Isle of Man Public Records Office (IOMPRO)."

For  this  purpose  the  Tynwald  Motor  Races  \nCommittee  was  soon  restored  and  members  were  re-elected  by  Tynwald  \non  19  March  1946.\n5\n  At  a  meeting  of  Tynwald  on  19  June  1945,  Cowin,  \nwho   had   previously   been   a   member   of   the   Tynwald   Motor   Races   \nCommittee,  had  asked  the  lieutenant  governor  if  there  were  any  plans  to  \nre-elect this Committee with the restart of the TT in mind.\n6\n The lieutenant \ngovernor   agreed   that   if   Tynwald   wished   to   see   the   Committee   re-\nestablished  then  steps  would  be  taken.  Membership  remained  the  same,  \nwith  the  notable  exception  of  W.C.  Southward  who  had  died  in  1943,  \nbeing  replaced  by  Gill,  a  member  of  the  Executive  and  Legislative  \nCouncils   and   chairman   of   the   Highways   and   Transport   Board.   The   \nTynwald  Motor  Races  Committee  had  been  established  in  late  1937  to  \nassess  the  practicality  of  continuing  financial  assistance  to  the  ACU,  and  \nits re-establishment after 1945 meant that the restart of the TT was a much \nmore organised affair.  \nTynwald approved the Motor Races Committee’s first post-war report \non 17 April 1946. In this report the Committee had concluded that it was \nimpossible to revive the TT races in 1946, probably because it was simply \nimpractical  and  unlikely  to  attract  sufficient  entries  so  soon  after  the  end  \nof the war.\n7\n However, although the TT did not take place on the island that \nyear,  the  Committee  recommended  that  money  be  set  aside  from  the  \nannual budget, first for expenses incurred in staging the Manx Grand Prix \nin September (£1,500), second, for the cost of maintaining the grandstand, \nscoreboards, control tower and other expenditure (£1,900) and, last, so that \nany  loss  made  by  the  June  Effort  Committee  (which  had  been  made  \nresponsible  for  extending  the  island’s  tourist  season  into  June),  on  an  \nInternational  TT  Bicycle  Race  should  be  guaranteed  up  to  £300.  This  \nexpenditure  totalled  £3,700.\n8\n  It  is  apparent  that  the  Committee,  despite  \nviewing  the  restart  of  the  TT  as  impractical,  wished  to  see  the  return  of  \nsome events that might help re-establish the island’s tourist industry.

The  Committee’s  membership  now  consisted  of  three  \nmembers   from   the   Legislative   Council,   Deemster   Cowley,   Gill   and   \nCowin,  and  two  members  from  the  House  of  Keys,  Alfred  Teare  (South  \nDouglas)   and   T.G.   Moore   (Rushen).\n9\n   Their   1947   report   made   the   \nfollowing  observations  regarding  the  grant  to  be  made  to  the  ACU.  \nTynwald’s  grant  of  £3,500  in  1939  had  helped  in  the  running  of  the  TT,  \nbut  the  event  had  been  run  at  a  loss  of  £1,257  to  the  ACU.  Moreover  the  \nACU believed that the cost of the TT would increase in 1947 and therefore \na  larger  grant  would  have  to  be  made  by  the  Manx  legislature.  As  a  \nbenchmark for the increase, it was pointed out that the Manx Grand Prix, \nwhich  had  been  held  on  the  island  since  1923,  had  cost  the  Manx  \ngovernment £519 in 1938 but £1,153 in 1946. It was therefore put forward \nby  representatives  of  the  ACU  that  the  Manx  government’s  grant  should  \nbe  increased  to  £7,000.  The  Motor  Races  Committee,  however,  thought  \nthis  too  large  an  amount  to  provide  and  recommended  a  grant  of  £6,000.  \nThe  ACU  were  happy  to  accept  this  sum  agreeing,  “if  this  grant  was  \nforthcoming,  they  would  be  prepared  to  enter  into  a  binding  contract  to  \ncontinue  the  Races  for  at  least  another  three  years.”\n10\n  Members  of  the  \nManx  legislature  thus  recognised  the  value  of  continuing  to  stage  the  TT  \non  the  Isle  of  Man,  but  were  not  prepared,  at  this  stage,  to  raise  their  \nfinancial commitment much above the £5,000 provided in the 1930s. The \nreport  was  discussed  in  Tynwald  on  15  April  1947.  A  resolution  was  put  \nforward  by  Deemster  Cowley,  chairman  of  the  committee,  proposing  that  \nTynwald  adopt  the  recommendations  of  the  report.  The  resolution  was  \nsupported by Cowin and by G.P. Quine, representative for North Douglas. \nThey  too  stressed  the  publicity  value  of  the  TT.  This  resolution  received  \nthe unanimous support of the members of Tynwald and the TT’s publicity \nvalue to the island was acknowledged. \n11\n  \nA third report by the Tynwald Motor Races Committee was presented \nto Tynwald in 1948 and discussed on 20 April. No objections were raised \nand  once  again  it  was  agreed  to  unanimously  by  members  of  the  House.  \nThe  TT  featured  only  minimally,  alongside  recommendations  made  for  \nmotorcar  races  on  the  island  and  the  International  TT  Bicycle  Race,  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n9\n Further Report, 1947, p. 3. \n10\n Further Report, 1947, p. 3. \n11\n Debates, Vol. 64, 15 April 1947, pp. 524-526."

The Committee’s 1948 report recommended \nthat  the  £6,000  given  to  the  ACU  in  1947  should  also  be  provided  in  \n1948.\n12\n  It  was  this  time  left  to  Gill  to  put  forward  the  resolution  for  the  \nreport  to  be  accepted  by  Tynwald,  and  this  was  seconded  by  Cowin.  The  \nrequirement for a further report on the future of motor racing on the island \nto  be  submitted  to  Tynwald  suggests  that  a  much  larger  consensus  of  \nopinion  was  needed  for  the  continuation  of  the  TT,  but  support  for  the  \nMotor  Races  Committee’s  reports  and  the  renewal  of  legislation  suggests  \nthat this consensus was guaranteed.  \nFrom  this  point  on  it  was  the  responsibility  of  the  Tynwald  Motor  \nRaces Committee to organise the continuation of the grant for motor races \non   the   island,   which   required   the   annual   consent   of   Tynwald.   The   \nHighway  Board  was  responsible  for  road  closures,  and  again  the  consent  \nof  Tynwald  was  required  before  any  action  was  taken.  In  both  1949  and  \n1950,  further  financial  grants  and  road  closures  were  permitted  after  \ndiscussion  in  Tynwald,  with  no  objections  raised.\n13\n  In  1949  the  Motor  \nRaces  Committee  recommended  that  the  grant  should  once  again  be  \n£6,000 but in 1950 this was raised to £7,000: a further commitment to the \nTT by the Manx legislature.\n14\n  \nRoad Races Act 1951 \nIn  1951  issues  of  safety  around  the  course  were  placed  on  the  \nlegislative   agenda.   This   was   a   point   where   members   of   the   Manx   \nlegislature  might  have  removed  their  hands  from  the  political  throttle.  \nHowever, their continued support for the TT was further demonstrated by \nthe  passing  of  the  Road  Races  Act,  1951.  The  Road  Races  Bill  was  \nintroduced  into  the  Legislative  Council  by  the  attorney  general  and  \nreceived  its  first,  second  and  third  readings  on  27  February  1951.\n15\n The \nattorney  general  made  it  clear  that  the  bill  was  necessary  to  give  the  \nHighway  Board  the  statutory  authority  to  request  the  public  to  keep  their  \nanimals   off   the   roads   during   racing.

During  this  discussion,  and  prior  to  a  third  reading  taking  place,  a  \nnumber of clauses were considered. Particular attention was paid to clause \nthree  of  the  bill  that  sought  to  make  the  owners  of  animals  responsible  if  \nthey  strayed  onto  the  TT  course  when  roads  were  closed.  Gill  offered  \nsupport for this clause, stating that “we must take every care to protect the \ncompetitors  and  the  public  who  are  watching  these  races.  The  speeds  are  \nnow in the region of 100 mph [sic], and I hate to think what would happen, \nif  an  accident  to  a  rider,  due  to  an  animal  being  on  the  course,  happened  \nwhile he was going that speed.”\n16\n Little attention was paid to the fact that \nowners of animals might not support the TT, and might therefore disagree \nwith   being   prosecuted   if   an   accident   occurred.   After   a   very   brief   \ndiscussion  of  the  bill,  and  with  no  objections  being  raised,  it  was  read  a  \nthird  time  and  passed  in  the  Legislative  Council.  As  had  been  the  case  in  \n1928,  by  supporting  amendments  to  legislation  to  make  the  TT  safer,  \nmembers of the Legislative Council demonstrated their continuing support \nfor the event.  \nAfter being passed in the Legislative Council, the bill was presented to \nthe  House  of  Keys  and  was  read  for  the  first  time  on  6  March  1951.  It  \nreceived  its  second  reading  on  24  April.\n17\n  T.G.  Moore,  representative  for  \nthe rural sheading of Rushen, moved that this was “a consolidation Bill ... \nit brings together into one body all the provisions relating to the holding of \nthe races and the closing of roads contained in the three Acts set out in the \nschedule, and which the Highway Board have needed to ensure the proper \nrunning of the various events which we hold in the Island.”\n18\n This was an \nendorsement  of  such  events  from  a  rural  MHK.  After  a  substantial  \ndiscussion,  the  majority  of  which  focused  on  the  publicity  benefits  of  the  \nTT, the bill was then read a third time and passed without division in the \nKeys.  \nAfter  due  consideration,  the  Road  Races  Act  was  passed  on  15  May  \n1951, received its Royal Assent on 29 June and was read at Tynwald Hill \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n16\n Debates, Vol. 68, 27 Feb. 1951, p. 409. \n17\n Debates, Vol. 68, 24 April 1951, p. 707. \n18\n Debates, Vol. 68, 24 April 1951, p. 707."

It  repealed  the  whole  of  the  \nHighway Amendment Act 1928, and certain sections of the Highway Act \n1927  and  Road  Traffic  Act  1933.  Under  part  one  of  the  1951  Act  it  was  \nstill the responsibility of the Highway Board to close roads for racing, and \nit was also necessary for the board to request the consent of the lieutenant \ngovernor  and  Tynwald  to  put  this  process  into  action.  So  the  lieutenant  \ngovernor still had a part to play in the continuation of the TT and Tynwald \nstill  had  to  agree  that  the  event  was  an  asset  to  the  island.  Also  put  into  \nplace  were  provisions  for  the  punishment  of  owners  who  allowed  their  \nanimals to stray onto the roads. Part two of the act made it possible for the \nHighway Board to restrict motor traffic on “all or any of the public roads \nof  the  Island  on  the  Sunday  immediately  preceding  the  day  of  the  races”  \nand,  further,  to  prohibit  motorcycle  traffic  on  “all  or  any  of  the  roads  or  \nstreets of any borough or town in this Island on the Sunday following the \nday  of  any  races.”\n20\n  This  was  a  continuation  of  provisions  made  in  \nprevious legislation.  \nPost-war continuity \nFollowing  the  passage  of  the  1951  legislation,  and  as  was  the  case  \nduring  the  inter-war  years,  the  extension  of  the  powers  of  the  Highway  \nBoard  to  permit  road  closures  for  racing,  and  the  provision  of  a  financial  \ngrant  by  the  Tynwald  Motor  Races  Committee,  required  the  consent  of  \nTynwald  annually.\n21\n  After  the  passing  of  the  1951  Road  Races  Act  there  \nwas  no  subsequent  condemnation  of  the  TT,  indicative  of  continuing  \npolitical support. The extension of the powers of the Highway Board and \nthe  provision  of  an  annual  financial  grant  was  repeated  in  Tynwald  each  \nyear,  with  no  objections  and  minimal  debate.  Indeed,  political  support  \nmanifested  itself  in  the  growing  financial  grant  given  to  the  ACU,  which  \nincreased from the £6,000 provided in 1947 to £10,500 in 1957.\n22\n  \nHowever, in 1956 the decision was made by Tynwald that the Tourist \nBoard  should  be  made  responsible  for  the  organisation  of  the  TT  in  the  \nIsle of Man, officially giving responsibility for the organisation of the TT \nto  the  body  responsible  for  publicising  the  island.

Giving  \nthe  Tourist  Board  sole  responsibility  as  a  point  of  contact  on  the  island  \nstreamlined this process. It was also recommended by the attorney general \nthat,  “if  the  task  is  given  to  them  [the  Tourist  Board,]  [he]  would  \nrecommend  them  to  appoint  a  sub-committee,  which  would  be  a  Race  \nCommittee of people vitally interested in the races, and [he would] suggest \nthat this committee should comprise the chairman and two representatives \nof  the  Tourist  Board,  two  members  of  the  Highway  Board  and  two  \nmembers  of  the  Douglas  Corporation.”\n26\n  Such  a  sub-committee  would  be  \nrepresentative of all parties with an interest in the TT.  \nThere  was  considerable  debate  on  the  matter  of  a  single  coordinating  \nauthority  and  alternatives  were  proposed.  At  the  end  of  the  debate  the  \nlieutenant governor summed up each suggestion and proposed a vote. The \nfirst  suggestion  that  had  been  put  forward  was  that  instead  of  the  Tourist  \nBoard  taking  over  control  of  the  TT  and  other  motor  races,  a  separate  \ncommittee  should  be  appointed  that  consisted  of  two  members  from  the  \nHighway  Board,  two  from  the  Tourist  Board  and  one  from  the  Douglas  \nCorporation;  in  this  way  all  interested  parties  would  be  represented.  The  \nsecond suggestion was that the Highway Board and not the Tourist Board \nshould  be  given  sole  responsibility  as  the  body  responsible  for  road  \nclosures. The third suggestion asked that instead of the Tourist Board there \nshould  be  a  special  committee  of  Tynwald  consisting  of  five  members.  \nWho  these  five  members  would  be  was  not  stipulated.\n27\n Seemingly, \nmembers  of  Tynwald  wished  to  see  the  TT  continue  on  the  Isle  of  Man,  \nand there were only conflicting ideas as to how this continuation should be \norganised.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n23\n Debates, Vol. 74, 12 Dec. 1956, p. 190-197. \n24\n Debates, Vol. 74, 12 Dec. 1956, p. 190. \n25\n Debates, Vol. 74, 12 Dec. 1956, p. 190. \n26\n Debates, Vol. 74, 12 Dec. 1956, p. 190. \n27\n Debates, Vol. 74, 12 Dec. 1956, p. 197."

The Tourist Board was \ngiven  authority  over  the  TT  in  the  1958  Tourist  (Isle  of  Man)  Act.\n28\n This \nAct  stipulated  that  the  duty  of  the  Tourist  Board  would  be  to  “maintain,  \nencourage,  develop,  protect,  promote  and  facilitate  tourism  in,  to,  and  \nfrom the Isle of Man to the best advantage of the Island.” Evidently the TT \nwas  firmly  recognised  as  advantageous  to  the  Isle  of  Man,  since  the  \nTourist  Board  was  now  solely  responsible  for  its  organisation.  The  Act  \nalso  gave  the  Board  power  to  “provide  or  assist  financially  (by  way  of  \ngrant, loan, guarantee or indemnity) or in any other manner, competitions, \nexhibitions,  services,  sports,  races,  amusements,  carnivals,  attractions,  \nentertainments  and  other  facilities,  relating  to  tourism.”\n29\n The  Tourist \nBoard  Race  Committee  was  also  established,  and  the  minutes  of  their  \nmeetings  provide  a  starting  point  for  further  examination  of  political  \nsupport  for  the  TT,  after  1958.\n30\n  Therefore,  by  1958  the  TT  had  become  \nstill  more  firmly  ingrained  by  Manx  legislation  and  in  the  island’s  \nadministrative structure.  \nThroughout  the  1960s  the  legislation  for  motor  racing  was  annually  \nrenewed,  with  very  little  discussion  in  the  Manx  legislature.  This  did  not  \nmean  that  there  was  no  protest  over  the  continued  closure  of  roads  for  \nmotor  races.  Indeed,  in  1962  Callister,  MHK  for  North  Douglas  and  a  \nrepresentative of the Manx Labour Party, made a protest over the severity \nof  the  conditions  for  road  closures  in  relation  to  the  TT  races.  Callister  \nargued: “I think the conditions laid down even for the T.T. are too severe. \nThere  are  people  living  around  the  course  who  cannot  get  to  their  homes  \nor place of business because they cannot go on the course when the races \nare  on”  and  furthermore  that  “road  closures  were  going  on  to  such  an  \nextent  that  it  is  intolerable.”\n31\n  However,  whilst  Callister’s  fears  were  \nrecognised  by  Bolton  who  stated  that  “we  must  protect  the  people  taking  \npart,  otherwise  we  may  lose  these  events”,  there  was  no  call  for  the  \nlegislation  to  not  be  renewed.\n32\n  An  amendment  to  the  resolution  was  \nproposed,  which  would  allow  people  to  be  given  the  right  of  access  to  \ntheir home or place of business, by permission of a constable or marshal. \nA vote was taken on the amendment but did not receive the full support of \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n28\n Tourist (Isle of Man) Act 1958, Statutes, Vol. 17 1952-1959, pp. 957-965. \n29\n Statutes, Vol. 17, 1952-1959. \n30\n See Tourist Board Race Committee Minutes.  \n31\n Debates, Vol. 79, February 28, 1962, pp. 653-655.  \n32\n Debates, Vol. 79, February 28, 1962, pp. 653-655."

This  continued  to  be  the  case  throughout  the  1970s  and  early  \n1980s  and  although  objections  to  the  TT  were  sometimes  raised,  there  is  \nlittle to suggest that ending the event was ever given serious consideration \nby  the  Manx  authorities.  During  this  period  the  TT’s  place  on  the  world  \nchampionship was threatened – this status would be lost in 1976. Two new \npieces  of  legislation  were  also  passed  by  Tynwald,  the  Road  Races  \n(Amendment)  Act  1975  and  the  Road  Races  Act  1982.  The  debate  that  \ntook  place  around  these  three  key  events  help  to  confirm  that  by  the  last  \nquarter  of  the  twentieth  century  the  TT  had  come  to  be  supported  \npolitically  in  the  Isle  of  Man.  Indeed,  it  is  today  the  1982  legislation  that  \npermits the closure of roads for the TT races.  \n1975: Road Races (Amendment) Act \nThe 1975 Road Races (Amendment) Bill was given its first reading in \nthe House of Keys on 4 February 1975 by Ward, MHK for South Douglas. \nThe  Bill  was  to  amend  existing  legislation  to  permit  motor  racing  to  take  \nplace on a Sunday. Ward noted that “those of us who believe in tourism as \nsomething that this Island can do well, and must go on regarding as one of \nthe  main  planks  of  our  economy,  must  realise  the  importance  of  the  T.T.  \nraces,  (a)  as  a  world  famous  event  coupled  almost  exclusively  with  the  \nname of the Isle of Man ever since its inception in 1907; and (b) a curtain \nraiser for our season which almost any holiday resort in the British Isles or \nanywhere  else  would  give  its  eye-teeth  to  promote.”\n33\n  Here,  once  again,  \nwas a Douglas MHK promoting the TT races in the interests of tourism.  \nThere  was  disagreement  over  the  necessity  of  the  proposal.  MHK  \nClucas  objected  to  the  “lack  of  priorities  we  seem  to  have  in  our  \ngovernment”,  echoing  the  objections  of  MHKs  in  1904.  He  questioned  \n“very much our priority in having this particular measure in front of us at \nthis  particular  time.  It  was  only  last  July  that  for  the  T.T.  week  we  had  \ndifficulty with the weather, and here we are, one year of difficulty and we \nare  immediately  flying  into  legislation.”\n34\n  Whilst  Clucas  objected  to  the  \nproposed   amendment   because   of   the   quickness   of   the   changes   to   \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n33\n Debates, Vol. 92, February 25, 1975, pp. K338-K339.  \n34\n Debates, Vol. 92, February 25, 1975, p.

I  feel  that  it  is  an  intrusion  into  a  day  which  \nalthough may not be kept as holy by many people today, yet it is a day set \napart  for  us  in  recreation  and  I  feel  that  such  a  Bill  as  this  is  driving  a  \nwedge  as  it  were  and  is  breaking  that  which  is  kept  for  the  good  of  the  \ncommunity and is doing it for only a certain section of the community.\n35\n  \n \nClucas  agreed  with  the  point,  stating  that  “I  am  against  this  Bill,  I  feel  it  \nbreaches  the  Sunday  and  once  people  are  going  to  be  able  to  race  motor-\ncycles  on  a  Sunday  they  will  use  it  as  an  excuse  for  all  sorts  of  other  \nthings.”\n36\n  Cringle’s  objection  to  the  Bill  was  because  of  the  timing  of  the  \nroad  closure.  He  was  prepared  to  accept  road  closure  on  the  first  Sunday  \nof  TT  week,  “because  I  think  that  is  what  is  commonly  called  ‘Mad  \nSunday’ and we have the inconvenience of the motor-cycle already on the \nIsland on the Sunday.”\n37\n  \nMHK Bell was quick to dismiss these worries: “What has been said is \nperfectly  clear.  The  T.T.  programme  is  mapped  out  months  beforehand,  \nno-one  knows  what  the  weather  is  going  to  be  in  five  years’  time  on  a  \nparticular date. We know everyone is going to church on that day and they \nwill be going to church for the other 52 or 53 Sundays in the year and we \nare  not  asking  them  to  give  up  church  every  Sunday.  We  are  not  even  \nsuggesting  in  the  Bill  that  they  will  have  to.”  \n38\n  Following  the  discussion  \nthe Bill was read for a second time and a vote was taken. In the Keys 13 \nwere  for  the  Bill  and  8  against,  and  so  the  Act  was  read  for  a  third  time.  \nThe discussion over the third reading was centred on the same points and \nnothing new was introduced into the debate. The Bill was read for a third \ntime and passed by members of the Keys, but not unanimously.  \nThe  Bill  was  then  considered  in  the  Legislative  Council,  on  8  April  \n1975  and  the  first,  second  and  third  readings  were  approved.  There  was  \nlittle discussion, and few objections were raised. However, Crowe pointed \nout that it was a “terrific thing if we have got to rush now and pretty well \nbreak our necks to get a Bill through, to put it through for this year.

Any \nlittle  thing  that  might  be  evasive  or  an  irritant  could,  perhaps,  put  these  \nthings  in  further  jeopardy.”\n41\n  The  bill  was  then  read  second  and  third  \ntimes,  with  no  further  discussion  and  was  then  passed  in  the  Legislative  \nCouncil.  The  Road  Races  (Amendment)  Act  1975  therefore  provided  for  \nthe  closure  of  roads  for  racing  on  a  Sunday.  However,  it  would  only  be  \npossible  for  roads  to  be  closed  on  one  Sunday  of  the  year  during  the  \nmonths  of  May  or  June  and  this  would  be  the  Sunday  between  practice  \nweek  and  race  week.  Such  provisions  were  only  exercisable  if  a  race  had  \nbeen postponed during the preceding week and roads could only be closed \nbetween 1:30 pm and 6pm.  \nFollowing  the  amendment  to  the  Road  Races  Act  in  1975,  new  \nlegislation was drafted in 1982. New legislation was necessary because it \nwas felt that the provisions of section four of the 1951 Road Races Act did \nnot make it clear that all road traffic legislation was suspended when roads \nwere closed for racing. This was a matter that had been brought up by C.P. \nBowring  Motorsport,  the  principle  insurers  for  motor  racing  events,  and  \nthe  Attorney  General  had  advised  that  the  best  cause  of  action  was  to  \nredraft  the  Road  Races  Bill,  to  avoid  any  mistakes  in  interpretation.  This  \nwas  another  point  in  time  where  the  importance  of  the  TT  to  the  island  \nwas discussed in the Manx Legislature, with the event receiving support in \nboth the House of Keys and the Legislative Council.  \nThere  was  a  good  discussion  over  the  proposed  new  legislation  and  \nonce  again  support  for  motor  racing  on  the  island  was  forthcoming.  \nWalker, MHK for ..., supported the Bill believing it to be “right and proper \nthat the Government should update this legislation and consolidate it, and \nin  fact  [it]  makes  things  simpler  for  everybody  to  understand.”\n42\n MHKs’ \ndisagreements focused largely on the inconvenience caused by the TT and, \nindeed, other motor racing events held on the island. Anderson, MHK for \n...,  realised  that  in  his  constituency  “there  are  a  great  number  of  people  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n39\n Debates, Vol. 92, April 8, 1975, p.

Walker, MHK for \n..., proposed that “it is unfortunate, I think, that some people on the Island \nhave  to  put  up  with  a  certain  amount  of  discomfort  because  of  the  very  \nnature  of  the  business  we  are  in,  tourism,  but  I  think  that  is  a  fact  of  life  \nand  personally  I  am  proud  of  the  Isle  of  Man  and  the  events  it  holds.”\n45\n \nThis attitude was shared by Delaney and Teare, MHKs for ... respectively. \nDelaney  believed  that  “we  need  everyone  we  can  get  regardless  of  the  \ninconvenience,   because   we   either   have   to   suffer   inconvenience   or   \nbankruptcy  as  far  as  my  constituency  is  concerned,  and  I  would  rather  \nhave inconvenience for a couple of days and make money for the people in \nthe  Isle  of  Man  who  badly  need  it  than  satisfy  one  or  two  people  who  \nunfortunately might be inconvenienced.”\n46\n Teare thought it “wrong to miss \nthe  opportunity  to  try  and  reduce  the  irritation  and  inconvenience  to  the  \npublic.”\n47\n \nThe bill was read in the Legislative Council on 30 March, and Moore \nmade a similar statement to Radcliffe in the Keys, who had noted that the \nbill  reflected  the  need  for  clarity  in  existing  legislation.  Moore  then  went  \non  to  offer  further  information  on  the  bill, suggesting that there had been \nsome misunderstanding on behalf of the (Manx) National Farmers’ Union, \nwho felt some new clause was contained in the Bill with which they were \nnot happy. This was clause five, which dealt with the problem of animals \nstraying  onto  the  roads  and  the  question  of  who  was  responsible.  It  was  \nnoted  that  there  had  been  no  change  in  the  clause,  but  the  wording  had  \nbeen  redrafted  to  reflect  modern  terminology.  This  issue  was  dealt  with  \nquickly. The Council also considered the re-insertion of clause 1 (4). The \nLord Bishop proposed that “I think that it is important that the members of \nTynwald have the opportunity of making comments on these orders as so \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n43\n Debates, Vol. 99, February 2, 1982, p.

The annual approval of legislation \nwas  required  by  Tynwald,  which  enabled  the  Highway  and  Transport  \nBoard to make any orders under the road racing legislation. This was seen \nas  a  formality  as  it  did  not  specific  any  actual  races.  The  Highway  and  \nTransport  Board  then  made  an  order  to  close  roads  for  races,  gained  the  \nconsent  of  the  Governor  in  Council  and  then  gave  adequate  public  notice  \nof  the  orders.  The  Keys,  by  deleting  a  sub-clause  of  the  Road  Races  Act,  \nproposed a change to this procedure. It was suggested that under the 1982 \nbill,  the  Highway  Board  would  make  an  order,  get  the  consent  of  the  \nGovernor and then give “adequate” public notice of all orders. This cut out \nthe need for the renewal of legislation to be considered by Tynwald.\n49\n  \nIt  was  reported  in  the  Keys  that  members  of  the  Legislative  Council  \nhad  got  in  “quite  a  predicament”  over  the  removal  of  the  sub-clause.  The  \nKeys’  proposal  caused  disagreement  between  the  two  chambers  in  the  \nManx   legislature.   To   fix   this   disagreement,   the   Keys   voted   that   a   \ncommittee  of  three  of  its  members  should  meet  with  the  Legislative  \nCouncil.   The   conference   was   scheduled   to   take   place   on   18   May.   \nFollowing  this  conference  with  the  Legislative  Council,  the  proceedings  \nwere reported in the House of Keys on 25 May, and it was made clear that \nfollowing   discussion   over   the   re-insertion   of   the   sub-clause   the   \nrepresentatives of the Legislative Council were to recommend the deletion \nof the clause to their colleagues. Members of the House of Keys voted for \nthe  acceptance  of  this  report.\n50\n  Thus  the  Manx  legislature  had  come  to  \naccept  the  TT  in  the  period  after  World  War  Two  and  so  the  event  had  \ndeveloped from an imposition by the lieutenant governor.

The costs of this were \nmet  by  the  UK  government.\n2\n  The  island’s  economy  also  benefited  from  \nthe stationing of military service personnel on the island, and the building \nof two aerodromes. Internees and service personnel replaced the tourists and \nprovided  a  market  for  agricultural  products  that  existed  all  year  round.  So,  \nwith island residents being given new employment opportunities as a result \nof wartime activity and boarding houses being filled all year round, the Isle \nof Man fared well during World War Two, at least in economic terms.\n3\n  \nHowever,  a  brief  analysis  of  occupational  data  taken  from  the  1951  \ncensus report shows the further demise of the island’s traditional industries \nof fishing, agriculture and mining (see table 7-1). By 1951 there were only \n119  people  employed  in  the  island’s  fishing  industry  and  the  majority  of  \nthese  worked  out  of  Peel.  Agriculture  was  by  now  only  employing  2,609  \npersons and mining and quarrying 135.

Most  notably  the  majority  of  \nthese persons were situated in Douglas (982). The dominance of Douglas \ncan  also  be  noted  by  the  large  amount  of  accommodation  for  visitors  on  \noffer  there  (see  table  7-2).  Statistics  for  1951  show  that  of  a  total  1,242  \nboarding  houses  situated  on  the  island  882  were  situated  in  Douglas  and  \nonly  340  were  situated  across  the  rest  of  the  island.\n4\n  By  1961  the  total  \nnumber  of  hotels  and  boarding  houses  was  1,510,  with  1,079  situated  in  \nDouglas,  and  431  in  other  areas  of  the  island,  reaffirming  Douglas’s  \ndominance both economically and in terms of population.\n5\n  \nTourist  numbers  recorded  for  this  period  are  also  significant.  In  1946  \nthere were 482,962 visitors recorded, rising to 602,230 in 1947, 624,737 in \n1948  and  611,286  in  1949.\n6\n  However,  this  initial  post-war  recovery  was  \nnot  typical  of  the  post  war  period,  and  after  1949  the  island’s  economy  \nentered a period of recession.\n7\n Tourist figures fell from 611,286 (1949) to \n535,558  (1950)  and  averaged  500,000  during  the  1950s,  before  hitting  a  \nlow  of  473,704  in  1960.\n8\n  Despite  this  decline  in  visitor  numbers,  the  \ntourist industry still remained a valuable source of income for the island’s \neconomy.  Birch  estimates  average  per  capita  expenditure  by  tourists  over  \nthe  time  spent  in  the  island  to  be  £15,  which,  if  multiplied  by  542,065  \ntourists  gives  a  figure  of  approximately  £8,500,000.\n9\n  This  figure  was  \nincreased  in  1955  when  the  Visiting  Industry  Commission  estimated  the  \ntotal spent per tourist to be £18, which was multiplied by an approximate \nfigure  of  580,000,  a  total  that  was  approximately  ten  times  the  island’s  \npopulation, giving a total value of £10,500,000. This figure was adjusted to \ntake   into   consideration   travel   expenses,   which   were   estimated   to   be   \n£1,500,000 to give a net valuation of tourist expenditure in the Isle of Man \nof  £9,000,000.\n  10\n  The  Commission  put  this  into  context  by  valuing  the  \nScottish tourist trade at £45,000,000, the Welsh tourist trade at £30,000,000 \nand the tourist trade in Jersey at £10,000,000.\n11\n On the Isle of Man, with a \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n4\n Census 1951: Report of Isle of Man, (London, H.M.S.O, 1956). \n5\n Census  1961:  Report  on  Isle  of  Man:  Part  II  Migration,  Economic  Activity  and  \nOther Topics, (London, H.M.S.O, 1966).  \n6\n Isle of Man Summer Passenger Arrivals 1887 – Present. \n7\n Birch, The Isle of Man.  \n8\n Isle of Man Summer Passenger Arrivals 1887 – Present. \n9\n Visiting Industry Commission, (Douglas, 1955), p. 11.

We should do our utmost [to support the \nTT] because we live on [it].”\n14\n The decline in tourist numbers visiting the \nisland  also  emphasised  the  need  to  retain  the  TT,  at  least  for  Craine.  He  \nwent  further  to  point  out  that  “the  arrivals  in  June  last  year  [1951]  \nrepresented  22.8%  of  the  total  arrivals  for  the  season.”\n15\n  The  TT  could  \nextend into June a tourist season that currently saw the largest number of \nvisitors  between  July  and  August.  The  TT  would  continue  to  draw  \nattention to the island, and thus would act as something like free publicity. \nThe TT also remained a unique selling point for the island. The spectacle \nprovided by the TT and the publicity it generated throughout the post-war \nperiod, were enough to justify continued political support for the TT.  \n \nTynwald and Business Interests in the TT \n \nDuring  a  public  sitting  to  consider  the  recommendations  of  the  1955  \nVisiting Industry Commission Report, a member of the Douglas Residential \nand Boarding House Association made the following statement: \n \nI am going to make a statement at which you may perhaps be amused. We \nhave  three  big  sporting  events  which  take  place  during  the  periods  when  \nWakes  do  not  occur.  The  T.T.  races  in  early  June,  the  cycle  races  a  \nfortnight later, and the Grand Prix races at the back end of the season. All \nof these things happened accidentally on the Isle of Man. No Government \nbody,  no  Municipal  body  in  any  way  encouraged  or  supported  them  ...  A  \ngroup  of  dirty  little  lads  got  going  on  motor  cycles,  when  everybody  was  \nhorrified  by  them,  and  started  the  T.T.

I  hope  this  House  will  give  it  [the  Bill]  \nunanimous support.”\n20\n His support for the TT and acknowledgement of the \nadvertising potential of the races demonstrates that support for the TT was \nnot confined to urban areas, especially Douglas.  \nSupport  for  the  races  amongst  members  of  Tynwald  was  strong  and  \narose  from  the  widely  held  belief  that  the  TT  advertised  the  island.  \nHowever,  not  all  members  of  Tynwald  were  keen  to  see  the  continuation  \nof  the  TT.  Commander  Quine,  representative  for  the  rural  sheading  of  \nGarff,  raised  his  voice  in  opposition  in  1947,  arguing  that  by  continuing  \nwith the TT the Manx government were encouraging an activity that was, \nin his view, lethal. In Quine’s opinion: \n \nIt seems strange that we should encourage these lethal machines, which are \nresponsible for killing seven thousand people on the roads of Great Britain, \nand injuring 25,000, every year, whereas I have a distinct recollection that \nwhen  the  same  hon.  member  proposed  a  vote  of  £100  for  the  Isle  of  Man  \nrifle  association  which  is  concerned  with  national  defence,  it  was  laid  \ndown that no part of the money was allowed for prizes.\n21\n \n \nThat  the  Manx  rifle  association  was  concerned  with  national  defence  is  a  \ncontentious  point,  but  Commander  Quine  did  highlight  a  fact  that  could  \nnot  be  denied:  the  TT  was  a  hazardous  contest  and  motorcycles  were  a  \ndangerous  form  of  transport.  However,  G.P.  Quine,  no  relation,  strongly  \nbacked the event and indeed claimed the support of the Manx people. He \nwas “sure the majority of the people in the Isle of Man endorse this policy \nof the Government supporting these events ... Apart from the advantage to \nthe  manufacturers,  these  events  provide  a  delightful  holiday  and  a  fine  \nspectacle for the visitors who come to our Island.”\n22\n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n19\n Debates, Vol. 65, 20 April 1948, p. 664. \n20\n Debates, Vol. 68, 24 April 1951, p.708. \n21\n Debates, Vol. 65, 20 April 1948, p. 664. \n22\n Debates, Vol. 65, 20 April 1948, pp.664-5."

However,  whilst  some  of  the  \nrevenue  from  TT  visitors  would  in  a  taxation  of  income  go  to  the  Isle  of  \nMan government, there were also a number of private interest groups who \nstood  to  benefit  directly  from  the  continuation  of  the  TT  on  the  Isle  of  \nMan.   Such   interest   groups   included   the   Isle   of   Man   Steam   Packet   \nCompany,  which  was  responsible  for  transporting  the  majority  of  TT  \nparticipants and spectators to the island, plus boarding house keepers and \nhoteliers,  who  would  provide  accommodation  for  these  people,  and  also  \nthe  small  businesses  benefiting  from  the  provision  of  goods  and  services  \naround  the  course.  However  because  of  the  dearth  of  sources  it  has  been  \nharder  to  examine  the  interests  of  boarding  house  keepers  and  hoteliers,  \nnor of other small businesses. \nThe existence of minute books recording directors’ meetings of the Isle \nof Man Steam Packet allow us to get a general idea of the importance this \ncompany placed on the continuation of the TT to its business interests. A \n1948  incident  that  saw  a  clash  of  interests  between  the  Company  and  the  \nACU  illustrates  this  point.  In  January  1948  a  letter  from  the  Secretary  of  \nthe  ACU,  advising  that  riders  were  asking  for  concessions  to  be  made  \nbecause of the higher costs of entering the TT, was read in a meeting. The \nACU   had   proposed   that   the   Steam   Packet   Company   should   carry   \ncompetitors’   motorcycles   for   free,   since   this   would   help   greatly   in   \nreducing  the  cost  of  entering  the  TT.  It  might  also  have  the  effect  of  \nencouraging  a  larger  number  of  competitors  to  enter  the  event.  Hence,  it  \nwas  argued  this  would  be  beneficial  for  both  the  ACU  and  the  Steam  \nPacket  Company.  However,  the  company  was  not  persuaded.  It  was  \npointed  out  to  the  ACU  that  they  already  donated  100  guineas  to  support  \nthe TT. The company also worried that if they permitted these competitors \nto  travel  for  free,  further  requests  for  such  assistance  would  be  made  in  \nregard to other motorcycle races, such as the Manx Grand Prix. It did not \nmake financial sense to them to transport a large number of motorcycles to \nthe island without monetary rewards.\n 23\n  \nThe ACU did not accept the Company’s decision, and in April 1948 a \nfurther  letter  from  the  secretary  of  the  ACU  was  read,  expressing  the  \nUnion’s  dissatisfaction.  It  was  hoped  that  the  Steam  Packet  Company  \nwould at least see fit to do something to encourage the continuation of the \nTT,  even  if  it  were  only  to  offer  a  return  fare  for  half  the  price  to  racers  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n23\nIsle of Man Steam Packet Minutes Book, 19 Jan. 1948."

The  Steam  \nPacket’s   original   decision   was   therefore   maintained;   although   the   \ncompany’s  financial  contribution  to  the  ACU  was  increased  to  120  \nguineas.\n24\n  This,  at  least,  demonstrates  the  importance  placed  by  the  \ncompany  on  the  TT  to  maintain  business  before  the  beginning  of  the  \nconventional tourist season in July. \nAlthough the Steam Packet Company benefited from the holding of the \nTT on the island, there was little co-ordination between their interests and \nthe  interests  of  the  government.  In  1955  a  letter  from  the  Isle  of  Man  \nSteam  Packet  Company  to  the  island’s  government  secretary  made  this  \npoint clear. It stated that: \n \nWe  understand  that  consideration  is  being  given  by  the  Isle  of  Man  \nGovernment,  the  Isle  of  Man  Highway  Board,  the  Douglas  Corporation,  \nthe  Auto  Cycle  Union  and  other  interested  parties  to  the  fixing  of  the  TT  \nRaces in 1956 on June 4\nth\n, 6\nth\n and 8\nth\n, and, if possible, to keep these early \ndates for future years. \n \nThis company has never been consulted about the dates for the Races and \nonly  after  repeated  enquiries  in  October/  December  each  year  are  we  able  \nto  ascertain  the  dates  which  have  been  agreed  upon  for  the  next  Races,  in  \nfact in some cases we have had to schedule our sailings for the T.T. Races \nblindly and hope that the dates provisionally fixed will be actual.\n25\n \n \nBoth   the   need   for   the   coordination   of   interests   and   the   financial   \ncontribution  made  to  the  ACU  were  necessary  to  maintain  TT-related  \nbusiness in the early part of the season. The advertised price for a passage \non the Isle of Man Steam Packet in 1947 was 6s 9d.\n26\n Therefore, it might \nbe  suggested  that  if  visitor  figures  for  the  TT  week  remained  at  between  \n30,000 and 40,000, which was the suggested figure towards the end of the \ninter-war  period,  the  Steam  Packet  Company  could  make  approximately  \n£13,500  in  the  early  part  of  the  season.  The  TT  races  were  thus  an  \nimportant  boost  to  business  in  June  when  tourist  figures  were  otherwise  \nlow.

There  is  \nsome  evidence  for  the  continuation  of  a  split  between  rural  and  urban  \ninterests in support of the TT, but during the 1950s a consensus of opinion \nin  favour  of  the  TT  races  developed.  However,  although  support  for  the  \nTT  was  much  stronger  during  the  post-war  years  and  Tynwald  endorsed  \nthe  economic  interests  of  its  members  there  would  be  no  TT  unless  \nmotorcycle  manufacturers  still  continued  to  send  teams  to  the  event  or  if  \nno  private  entrants  were  attracted,  and  this  will  be  discussed  in  the  next  \nchapter.  \nGoing global: manufacturers’ interests \nThe  inter-war  period  saw  significant  developments  take  place  in  the  \nsupport  offered  to  the  TT  races  by  motorcycle  manufacturers.  By  the  \nbeginning of the 1950s the TT had become firmly supported by the Manx \nauthorities. The event now had the full support of the Manx legislature and \nthere  was  a  dedicated  Tynwald  Committee  responsible  for  restarting  and  \nrunning   the   TT.   Members   of   the   Manx   legislature   recognised   the   \neconomic  value  of  the  event  to  the  Isle  of  Man.  The  TT  had  become  an  \nevent that was firmly embedded in the minds of Manx politicians. The TT \nhad   also   during   the   inter-war   period   become   an   event   attended   by   \nmanufacturers’ teams from across Europe, if no longer by the 1950s from \nthe  United  States  and  not  yet  from  Japan.  As  Ixion  put  it  in  1950  “the  \ncontrast between this mighty spectacle and the slightly puny and laughable \naffair of 1907 is stupendous.”\n27\n  \nDuring  the  inter-war  years  the  British  motorcycle  industry  enjoyed  \nconsiderable  prosperity  and  the  motorcycle  grew  in  popularity  as  a  mode  \nof   transport,   outstripping   the   motorcar   in   terms   of   both   sales   and   \nproduction figures. In the decade after the end of World War Two and in \ncontrast  to  the  austerity  felt  in  Britain,  the  result  of  the  economy  being  \noverstretched  as  a  result  of  the  demands  of  war,  the  British  motorcycle  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n27\n Ixion, Motor Cycle Cavalcade, (London, Illiffe and Sons Ltd., 1950), p. 147."

During  the  \n1950s races were staged for lightweight machines, 250 c.c. machines and \n125   c.c.   machines,   in   addition   to   the   Senior   and   Junior   TT   races.   \nMotorcycle manufacturers continued to return to the Isle of Man, because \nthe  TT  had  established  itself  securely  as  the  most  important  event  on  the  \nmotorcycle  calendar.  The  following  section  will  consider  why  the  TT  \ncontinued to be supported by motorcycle manufacturers and motorcyclists \nalike. \nBy  the  beginning  of  the  post-war  period,  we  can  say  that  the  TT  was  \nfirmly  embedded  as  an  event  in  which  motorcycle  manufacturers  could  \ntest  their  machines  and  also  that  if  success  were  achieved  on  the  Isle  of  \nMan  this  was  good  promotion  for  a  particular  brand  of  motorcycle.  \nHowever,  the  secretary  of  the  ACU,  S.T.  Huggett,  writing  immediately  \nafter   World   War   Two,   noted   that   “after   the   first   world   war   [sic]   \nmanufacturers  generally  plunged  wholeheartedly  into  the  T.T.,  but  after  \nthis  latest  upheaval  it  was  only  the  distinguished  few  who  officially  \nentered the struggle.” He went on further to claim that “It would seem that \nthe  excuse  which  was  put  forward,  that  concentration  on  the  export  drive  \nprohibited   the   maintenance   of   a   factory   racing   stable,   was   hardly   \njustified.”\n36\n Furthermore,  the  managing director  of  Triumph,  Edward  \nTurner, who in the 1920s had been of the opinion that attendance in the TT \nraces was not necessary to further the design and mechanical reliability of \nmotorcycles,\n37\n   maintained   his   stance   after   World   War   Two.   Bert   \nHopwood, a co-worker, reported, “Turner would never listen to the many \npersuasive voices urging him to enter and support Grand Prix events such \nas  the  TT  races.”\n38\n  Hopwood  agreed  with  Turner’s  opinion,  writing  in  \n1981 that: \n \nI feel now, as I did then, that this policy was absolutely right. [Triumph’s] \nstrength  and  reputation  lay  with  the  many  sporting  Triumph  owners  who  \nthemselves  entered  and  were  successful  in  various  competitive  events  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n36\n  S.T.

Furthermore,  it  left  us  free  of  the  \nextreme  demands  which  such  projects  would  have  made  on  the  cream  of  \nour   technical   staff,   to   the   possible   detriment   of   the   production   \nprogramme.\n39\n \n \nIt  seems  that  the  obduracy  of  Triumph’s  managing  director  meant  that  a  \nteam  would  not  be  entered  into  the  TT  races,  because  doing  so  meant  \ninterrupting   domestic   production.   This,   it   seems,   was   the   managing   \ndirector’s decision. However, other manufacturers did enter teams into the \nTT,  and  belief  in  the  technical  and  publicity  benefits  to  be  had  from  the  \nevent remained. \nA  1953  article  in  Motor  Cycling  noted  the  large  participation  of  \nmotorcycle  manufacturers  in  the  TT.  It  was  stated  that,  by  this  date,  150  \ndifferent makes of machine had been raced on the island and that the most \nsuccessful  had  been  Norton,  winning  16  Senior  and  10  Junior  TT  races  \nsince  1907.  The  three  most  popular  makes  which  were  entered  were  \nNorton,  Velocette  and  A.J.S.,  with  entries  totalling  682,  423  and  404  \nrespectively.\n40\n  There  can  be  little  doubt  of  the  popularity  of  the  TT.  \nMotorcycle manufacturers by the beginning of the post-war period would \nbe  familiar  with  the  location  of  the  TT  course  and  the  Isle  of  Man.  By  \n1947  the  TT  had  taken  place  on  the  Isle  of  Man  for  40  years,  and  it  also  \nbecame the British stage of the motorcycle World Championship in 1949, \nthus adding prestige to the event. The ACU had the backing of the Manx \nlegislature  both  legally  and  financially,  and  the  event  could,  therefore,  be  \neasily  organised  each  year.  By  contrast,  there  was  little  chance  of  a  race  \nbeing  held  in  England,  which  would  require  legislation  to  be  passed  in  \nWestminster,  and,  as  was  discussed  earlier,  passing  such  legislation  was  \nimprobable.\n41\n  Indeed  the  contrasting  attitudes  of  Westminster  and  the  \nManx legislature towards road racing were acknowledged in an editorial in \nMotor   Cycling   early   in   1949.   The   editorial   stated   that   the   British   \nmotorcycle  industry  did  not  enjoy  the  same  freedom  to  run  races  as  was  \nallowed in Italy, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, France, Holland and Germany, \nwhere public roads could be closed for racing. It was further stated that: \n \nOnly in England are the domestic manufacturers forced to cross the sea  \nin search of similar facilities. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n39\n Hopwood, Whatever Happened to the British Motor Cycle Industry, pp. 65.  \n40\n Motor Cycling, 4 June 1953, p. 142.  \n41\n See Chapter Three."

But for the progressive policy \nof the Manx Government and its wisdom in permitting the T.T. Races our \nmotorcycle industry would probably have died in its infancy.\n42\n \n \nMotorcycle races did take place in other areas of Great Britain, usually on \nenclosed  racetracks.  In  1946  a  road  race  had  been  established  at  Oliver’s  \nMount  in  Scarborough,  the  origins  of  which  are  somewhat  mysterious  \nsince  racing  on  public  roads  was  illegal.\n43\n  However,  no  other  race  \nprovided the same unique test as the Isle of Man TT course. Manufacturers \nstill wanted to prove their machines on the tight corners and steep hills of \nthe  Isle  of  Man  TT  circuit  and,  moreover,  by  then  a  lot  of  prestige  was  \nassociated with the event.  \nBy the time the TT restarted after World War Two it can be said with \nsome  certainty  that  most  motorcycle  manufacturers  were  prepared  to  \nforgive  the  disadvantages  of  the  TT’s  location  in  order  to  take  advantage  \nof the prestige to be gained from success in the event. Indeed, a June 1949 \neditorial in Motor Cycling argued that there were a number of benefits to \nbe  had  for  both  the  motorcycle  manufacturer  and  the  consumer  from  \nracing on the Isle of Man: \n \nThe  objects  of  these  meetings  [the  TT]  are  three  in  number:  First,  to  \npromote   technical   development;   secondly,   to   provide   sport   for   the   \ncompetitors and a spectacle for the onlookers; lastly, to supply publicity for \nthe   motorcycle   industry.   The   [1949   TT]   satisfied   each   of   these   \nrequirements in full measure.\n44\n \n  \nIxion, a contributor to The Motor Cycle also reckoned that whilst men \nraced  for  motives  of  research  and  to  perfect  the  numerous  components  \ninvolved  in  a  design,  they  also  raced  for  fame.  This  aspect  will  be  \ndiscussed  later.\n45\n  More  specifically  many  manufacturers  entering  teams  \ninto  the  TT  did  so  because  they  believed  the  TT  experience  to  be  \nadvantageous to the design of the motorcycle. Indeed, articles appeared in \nthe motorcycle press after the conclusion of each TT race, commenting on \nthe technical benefits that were derived from that year’s event. \nMotorcycle manufacturers believed that racing in the TT could lead to \nimprovements  in  the  mechanics  and  design  of  their  machines.  Indeed,  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n42\n Motor Cycling, 16 June 1949. \n43\n This still takes place today.

      "text": "Chapter Seven \n156\nIxion  put  forward  the  argument  that  motorcycle  manufacturers  “cannot  \nafford not to race. [Their] duty to customers demands that [they] give them \nthe   best   machines   possible.   This   implies   that   [they]   must   perfect   \nroadholding, steering, brakes, control and reliability by all means in [their] \npower. [Their] experience [was] that every race teaches [them] something \nnew.”\n46\n  But  what  value  did  the  TT  have?  Ixion  also  answered  this  \nquestion.  The  T.T.  races  “had  been  much  maligned”,  possibly  as  a  result  \nof the danger associated with the event, but it was “indisputable that they \ntransformed  the  primitive  motorcycle  from  a  flimsy  toy  into  a  well  nigh  \nperfect  two  wheeler,  in  which  it  [was]  impossible  to  fault  any  feature  \nessential for safety.”\n47\n In Ixion’s mind then, there were definite advantages \nto  be  had  from  competing  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  As  mentioned  earlier,  after  \neach  TT  meeting  was  finished  motorcycle  magazines  would  offer  reports  \nof the races and comment on the success of the TT in their editorials and \nalso  include  articles  commenting  on  the  technical  developments  achieved  \nby  racing  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  For  example,  a  1951  editorial  in  Motor \nCycling stated that: \n \nCollectively  the  races  again  served  their  primary  purpose  by  disclosing  \nwhere  further  development  is  necessary.  The  chain  trouble  experienced  \nsuggests the time has come when, in fairness to the producers, this type of \ntransmission must be improved with efficient lubrication – and that implies \nenclosure  in  light  cases,  possibly  made  of  plastic  materials.  Such  a  \ndevelopment   would   be   of   direct   benefit   to   everyday   motorcyclists.   \nSimilarly   the   tyre,   sparking   plug   and   magneto   manufacturers   gained   \nvaluable data, whilst theories on the construction of ultra-light frames were \nproved in some instances and disproved in others.\n48\n  \n \nThis   comment   might   be   fairly   difficult   for   the   non-motorcyclist   to   \nunderstand, and it is not made clear exactly what knowledge sparking plug \nand   magneto   manufacturers   had   taken   from   the   event,   but   it   does   \ndemonstrate  that  amongst  the  motorcycling  community  and  especially  in  \nthe  motorcycle  press,  there  was  an  interest  in  the  purpose  of  the  TT  as  a  \ntesting ground. It was not just an event designed to discover who could get \nround  the  Isle  of  Man  in  the  fastest  time.  Indeed,  this  attitude  was  \nsustained in a 1953 article in The Motor Cycle, which considered in more \ndetail the technical developments on display in the 1953 event: \n \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n46\n Ixion, Cavalcade, p.140. \n47\n Ixion, Cavalcade, p.140. \n48\n Motor Cycling, 14 June 1951."

The  classic  series  of  T.T.  \nRaces continues to serve its function as a testing ground to stimulate design \nand development.\n49\n  \n \nOnce  again  we  can  see  certain  technical  developments  were  the  result  of  \nracing in the TT. Indeed, TT programmes also noted that the TT continued \nto  be  an  event  which  would  further  the  design  of  the  motorcycle.  An  \narticle  in  the  1952  TT  programme,  written  by  the  editor  of  The  Motor  \nCycle stated that: \n \nBetter  chains,  more  rigid  brake  drums,  better  friction  materials  for  brakes  \nand  clutches,  improved  steels  for  a  variety  of  components,  especially  \nrockers,  valves,  springs  and  gears,  more  efficient  speaking  plugs  and  \nignition equipment, better tyres; all owe their development, in part at least, \nto the stimulus of the endless quest for success in the T.T. and other races. \nRacing  is  a  hard  task  master.  It  brings  proud  success  and  disappointing  \nfailures.  But  racing  never  ceases  to  have  its  lessons  that  mean  so  much  in  \nthe evolution of finer motor cycles.\n50\n \n \nDespite  the  benefits  of  racing  that  were  pointed  out  in  the  motorcycle  \npress, not all manufacturers would send teams to the Isle of Man. \nThe   Clubman’s   TT   was   used   by   the   ACU   to   help   secure   the   \ncontinuation  of  the  financial  grant  from  the  Manx  government.  It  was  \nstated  by  the  ACU  that  this  race  would  “improve  their  [the  TT  races]  \nattractiveness and popularity.”\n51\n The Union said it was anxious to interest \na  larger  number  of  manufacturers  in  the  TT  and  were  introducing  an  \nentirely new type of race. The proposed new race was the Clubman’s TT, \nwhich  would  be  four  laps  of  the  course.  The  Secretary  of  the  ACU  \nbelieved   that   “a   ready-made   opportunity   was   afforded   to   the   trade   \ngenerally  to  take  a  close  interest  in  the  Isle  of  Man  circuit  by  the  \nintroduction  of  the  Clubman’s  races.”\n52\n  Entries  were  to  be  made  by  \nmotorcycle club members, not by manufacturers, and the machines would \nbe fully equipped stock machines, with slight improvements, but still with \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n49\n Motor Cycle, 11 June 1953.  \n50\n H.

The  Clubman’s  TT  ran  \nbetween  1947  and  1956  and  was  aimed  at  private  entrants  who  had  no  \ndirect  association  with  the  motorcycle  trade,  but  they  were  riding  shop-\nbought motorcycles. The entry form also testifies to the different nature of \nthe  event  especially  in  comparison  to  the  standard  TT  entry  form  which  \nshows that modifications could not be made to motorcycles, and that riders \nin  the  Clubman’s  TT  must  be  amateurs,  unattached  to  a  manufacturer’s  \nteam.  This  shows  that  the  TT  was  not  only  popular  amongst  motorcycle  \nmanufacturers  as  a  testing  ground  for  their  products  but  also  for  private  \nentries,  or  enthusiastic  motorcyclists  wanting  to  try  their  hand  at  racing  \naround  the  TT  course.  However,  there  was  more  to  it.  Manufacturers’  \nmachines  would  still  be  publicised  in  the  results  of  each  race  and  so  \nsuccess and reliability were still important issues, and even more so since \nmotorcycles  raced  would  be  similar  to  production  cycles.  Manufacturers  \nmight, as was the case with Geoff Duke and Norton, take a rider from the \nClubman’s TT and give them a place on their team.  \nBritish  manufacturers,  such  as  Norton,  Triumph  and  BSA,  enjoyed  \nmixed success in the TT during the post-war period. Norton continued the \nsuccess it had first achieved in 1907, which was due much to the prowess \nof  Geoff  Duke.  Triumph,  however,  was  not  so  successful.  In  February  \n1948  Triumph  released  the  500  c.c.  “Grand  Prix”,  which  was  a  racing  \nmotorcycle;  its  success  in  the  TT  was  limited.  Each  of  the  six  Triumph  \nGrand  Prix  motorcycles  entered  in  the  1948  TT  retired.  In  1949  only  two  \nof thirteen finished the race. The Grand Prix model has been described as \nbeing  obsolete  by  1950,  and  by  1951  with  only  two  senior  TT  entries  it  \nwas  dead.  This  may  have  led  to  the  dissatisfaction  with  the  TT  expressed  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n53\n Further Report, 1947, p. 3. \n54\n  These  regulations  were  included  in  Government  Office  File  R2701/1/2,  Tourist \nTrophy Races 1952."

However,  BSA’s  domination  of  the  event,  with  BSAs  \neventually  taking  up  the  majority  of  the  entries,  meant  the  purpose  of  the  \nrace  was  lost,  and  eventually,  after  1956,  it  was  removed  from  the  TT  \nprogramme.\n56\n  However,  other  TT  races  still  continued  and  manufacturers  \nwere  still  able  to  use  the  event  as  a  showcase  for  their  products,  as  the  \nfollowing section will demonstrate.  \nBy the beginning of 1954 Honda, the Japanese motorcycle manufacturer \nhad been established for around five years. In March 1954 Soichiro Honda \nhad made the decision to enter the Isle of Man TT races:  \n \nNow  that  we  are  equipped  with  a  production  system  in  which  I  have  \nabsolute confidence, the time of opportunity has arrived. I have reached \nthe firm decision to enter the TT Races next year.  \n  \nNever before has a Japanese entered this race with a motorcycle made in \nJapan. It goes without saying that the winner of this race will be known \nacross the globe, but the same is also true for any vehicle that completes \nthe  entire  race  safely.  It  is  said,  therefore,  that  the  fame  of  such  an  \nachievement  will  assure  a  certain  volume  of  exports,  and  that  is  why  \nevery  major  manufacturer  in  Germany,  England,  Italy,  and  France  is  \nconcentrating on preparations with all its might\n.\n57\n  \n \nHonda clearly identified that in order for their motorcycles to be improved \nthey  needed  to  compete  against  the  best  manufacturers  and  at  the  best  \nmotorcycle race in the world. Honda viewed the TT as a test bed for their \nmachines, but was also quick to note the international nature of the event. \nBy  the  end  of  1958  the  Honda  Motor  Company  was  Japan’s  biggest  \nmotorcycle  maker.  It  had  3,000  employees,  a  high-speed  test  track  and  \nwas  gearing  up  to  enter  the  European  and  American  markets.  It  is  not  \ndifficult to see that entry into the TT would be of great importance.  \nBetween 1959 and the late 1960s Honda took their first steps towards \nsuccess  in  the  TT.  Honda  entered  the  TT  for  the  first  time  in  1959  and  \nafter  some  initial  confusion  regarding  the  rules  of  some  race  categories  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n55\n  H.

But  some  of  my  press  colleagues  didn’t  take  \nHonda  seriously  in  the  early  days  and  there  was  still  some  anti-Japanese  \nfeeling   around.”\n58\n   In   1959   four   machines   were   entered,   under   the   \nmanagement  of  Kiyoshi  Kawashima  and  Honda  motorcycles  came  sixth,  \nseventh, eighth and eleventh in the 125cc lightweight class. They also won \nthe manufacturers’ team award. Following this early success, Honda lifted \nits  first  winner’s  trophy  at  the  Isle  of  Man  TT  in  1961  when  Mike  \nHailwood was victorious in the 125cc and 250cc races. By now it was not \njust   Japanese   riders   riding   Honda’s   motorcycles.   The   brand   was   \nrepresented by Mike Hailwood, most significantly, but also by riders such \nas  the  Swiss  Lugi  Taveri,  the  Rhodesian  Jim  Redman  and  the  Scottish  \nrider  Bob  McIntyre.  By  1966,  Honda  was  represented  in  all  classes  –  50,  \n125, 250, 350, and 500cc.  \nHonda  dominated  the  world-series  in  the  1960s,  winning  not  just  on  \nthe  Isle  of  Man  but  in  other  European  events  as  well,  but  despite  early  \nsuccess,  between  1967  and  1977  Honda  sent  no  production  team  to  the  \nTT.  The  brand’s  representation  at  the  event  rested  on  the  success  on  \nstandard motorcycles. Honda did return in 1977, to an event that was now \ncalled  the  “Formula  TT”  established  after  the  Isle  of  Man  was  removed  \nfrom the World Championship circuit following the refusal of many of the \ntop riders, like Barry Sheene, to compete on the Isle of Man. Honda would \ngo  from  strength  to  strength  during  the  1980s  and  1990s,  and  the  TT  \nwould  see  the  emergence  of  two  of  its  greatest  riders:  Joey  Dunlop  and  \nSteve  Hislop.  Today,  Honda  is  very  recognisable  at  the  event  and  five  \nyears ago celebrated 50 years of TT racing (2009). Honda has provided a \nnumber  of  “star”  riders.  Looking  down  the  list  of  results,  one  sees  a  \nnumber of Japanese manufacturers – Honda, Suzuki, Yamaha for example. \nThe TT has become a truly international competition.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n58\n M.

He further suggests \nthat  growth  in  one  area  stimulated  demand  in  another,  for  example  the  \nincrease  in  house  building  stimulated  demand  for  furnishings.\n60\n Also,  as \nnoted  by  Clarke  earlier,  the  popularity  of  motorcycles  was  growing  and  \nthus we might suggest advertising plays a bigger role in their marketing.  \nIt  was  also  noted  earlier  that  there  was  a  rise  in  the  consumption  of  \nsport  during  the  inter-war  years,  measured  by  the  growing  amount  of  \nmoney spent on watching sport and gambling on sport. The post-war years \nsaw a continuation of this trend.\n61\n This was despite a decline in newspaper \ncoverage of sport, between 1947 and 1951. The Times, which had devoted \n21 per cent of news space to the coverage of sport between 1937 and 1939, \nnow only set aside sixteen per cent. The Daily  Mail, 36 per cent between \n1937  and  1939,  now  only  set  aside  33  per  cent  and  The Daily  Mirror, 36 \nper  cent  between  1937  and  1939,  now  allotted  only  24  per  cent  of  space.  \nThese  figures  were  reduced  despite  a  rise  in  circulation  or  the  evident  \nsustained interest in sport to consumers.\n62\n  \nIxion  pointed  out  that  “the  motor  industries  are  fiercely  competitive,  \nand  their  success  is  very  largely  based  on  shrewd  publicity.”\n63\n In  1951  a \njournalist writing for The Motor Cycle and Cycle Trader commented, “one \nis apt to think of the TT as a sporting event that the trade happens to find \nworthwhile  to  patronise.  But  it  is  more  accurate  to  consider  it  as  a  trade  \nevent that happens to be of a sporting character...The ultimate purpose of \nthe [race] meeting is the sale of motor cycles.”\n64\n To an extent this was an \naccurate  assessment  of  the  value  of  the  TT  to  motorcycle  manufacturers,  \nand  also  manufacturers  of  other  products,  such  as  tyres,  spark  plugs  and  \nbrake.  Motorcycle  manufacturers  continued  to  use  the  publicity  gained  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n59\n T.R.

Koerner does, however, suggest \nthat  motorcycle  sport  had  two  practical  functions.  First,  races  provided  \ncommercial   opportunities   –   allowing   advertising   and   increasing   the   \nprestige of British motorcycles in foreign markets. According to an article \nin Export  Trader  “past  racing  successes  have  done  much  to  build  and  \nmaintain the supremacy of the British sports motor cycle, and its racebred \nprecision  has  brought  it  admirers  in  every  overseas  country.”\n65\n Second, \nraces  acted  as  a  forum  for  research  and  development  and  the  race-track  \nprovided   the   perfect   environment   on   which   to   perfect   design   and   \nmechanical reliability.\n66\n Improvements in design and reliability still had to \nbe demonstrated to the public, and one way to do this was by advertising \nsuccess in the TT.  \nAgain, advertisements in the motorcycle press, demonstrate the use of \nsuccess  at  the  TT  to  advertise  motorcycles  and  motorcycle  accessories.  \nWithin these advertisements, whilst emphasis placed on achievement was \nstill  evident,  we  can  see  the  development  of  more  visual  advertisements  \nusing  images  of  the  Isle  of  Man  and  TT  riders,  of  increased  use  of  the  \nriders’  names  and  of  the  coming  together  of  accessories  and  motorcycle  \nbrands  in  a  single  advertisement  for  instance  a  certain  tyre  to  relate  to  a  \ncertain   machine.   Advertisements   for   Dunlop   tyres,   for   instance   and   \nsuggest that “Dunlop leads the way again!” and states that this is “the tyre \nwith  a  background  of  leadership.”  We  immediately  see  a  difference  in  \npromotion  from  the  inter-war  period.  The  artwork  presents  a  large  “TT”,  \ndrawing  the  reader  to  assume  that  this  success  was  achieved  at  the  1947  \nTT,  overlying  an  image  of  the  Isle  of  Man.  Similar  adverts  drew  on  the  \nachievements  of  riders  such  as  Firth,  Foster  and  Bell  in  the  1948  TT  to  \npromote  the  quality  of  Dunlop  tyres,  and  others  promoted  Dunlop’s  \nachievement in what is “the Toughest Test”, pointing to 190 successes and \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n65\n Export  Trader,  June  1947,  p.  167  as  quoted  in  Koerner,  ‘The  British  Motor  \nCycle Industry 1935 – 1975’.  \n66\n S.

It \ndraws  on  the  achievement  of  particular  riders,  but  also  places  the  Isle  of  \nMan  and  the  TT  together  by  placing  the  “Three  Legs  of  Man”  on  the  \nmotorcycles  in  place  of  the  rider’s  number.  The  role  played  by  Lucas  \nMagnetos  in  the  victories  of  TT  riders  is  also  evident  in  advertising.  For  \nexample,  the  success  of  John  Surtees  in  the  1959  Junior  TT  using  the  \nimage  of  the  crowds  gathering  at  the  finish  line,  and  the  slogan  “Taking  \nthe Flag.”  \nOnce again we can see that in each of these advertisements there is no \nneed to stipulate that these accomplishments were achieved on the Isle of \nMan,  as  was  similarly  the  case  during  the  inter-war  period.  TT  races  are  \nsimply referred to as “Junior TT” or “Senior TT”, and not the “Isle of Man \nJunior  TT.”  We  can  see  that  achievement  in  the  TT  continued  to  be  \nprevalent  in  advertising  motorcycles  and  motorcycle  accessories.  This  \nangle  had  developed  during  the  inter-war  period  and  continued  to  be  \nimportant in the post-war period but by then there was more extensive use \nof images of the Isle of Man and of TT riders, and more extensive use of \nriders’ names.  \nThe emergence of TT “Celebrity” \nWe  have  seen  above  that  there  was  particular  use  of  the  names  of  \naccomplished  TT  riders  in  advertising  during  the  post-war  period.  This  \nleads  into  a  discussion  of  celebrity  and  its  relationship  to  the  Isle  of  Man  \nTT.  Celebrity  endorsement  makes  products  more  attractive  because  it  \nhelps  create  an  image  of  success.  In  the  modern  day  the  celebrity  and  \nindeed  the  sports  celebrity  have  become  a  part  of  everyday  life  and,  as  \nPringle  proposes,  when  “we  watch  movie  stars  on  the  screen  or  great  \nsportsmen  on  the  pitch  we  are  in  awe  of  them  but  we  also  get  to  know  \nthem. We learn about their capabilities and their characters.”\n68\n Businesses \nchoose a celebrity to promote their product because “in choosing a star to \nbe  associated  with,  the  advertiser  is  attempting  to  gain  instant  fame,  for  \nsome of the glitz and glamour to rub off on their brand and to acquire by \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n67\n  B.

This  section  will  readdress  this  issue,  and  \nexplore  it  further.  Today  sportspersons  are  widely  involved  in  selling  a  \nwide range of products to the consumer, from watches to crisps, and from \nrazors to bank accounts.\n70\n It is easy to pick up a book and read about how \nan accomplished sportsperson has achieved such a level of success. Indeed \nit is difficult, if not impossible, to pick up a newspaper or a magazine and \nnot  see  sports  people  advertising  one  product  or  another.  Indeed,  in  \ntoday’s  sporting  events  promotional  logos  for  all  sorts  of  products  are  \nplaced on the motor cars and motorcycles, in Formula One and at the TT. \nThis  is  a  practice  that  has  developed  over  the  last  50  years.  Today’s  \nFormula  One  drivers,  footballers,  golfers,  cricketers,  tennis  players  -  and  \nthe list continues - are not just celebrities in their own sports and amongst \ntheir  own  sports  fans  but  to  a  global  audience.  This  might  not  yet  be  the  \ncase  for  riders  in  the  Isle  of  Man  TT,  but  they  are  still  celebrities  at  least  \namongst  the  TT  community.  Indeed,  perhaps  as  a  foretaste,  shortly  after  \nthe  2007  TT  John  McGuinness’s  success  in  setting  a  new  record  average  \nspeed of 130 mph was used to advertise Honda motorcycles in the Sunday \nTimes Magazine.\n71\n This section will ask how far riders such as Geoff Duke \nwere  created,  and  indeed  commercially  exploited,  as  TT  celebrities.  The  \nnames  of  other  TT  riders  are  included  in  advertising  from  the  1950s,  but  \namong them it is Geoff Duke who remains the most famous.  \nThe  concluding  sentence  of  Geoff  Duke’s  biography  on  the  Isle  of  \nMan TT website reads: “as legends and heroes go, they don’t come much \ngreater  than  Geoff  Duke.”\n72\n  This  official  TT  website  lists  an  extensive  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n69\n Pringle, Celebrity Sells, p. xxiv. \n70\n ‘A Hundred Years of Sport and Advertising’, Telegraph, 26 Feb. 2008.  \n71\n  While  it  is  difficult  to  find  literature  focusing  specifically  on  the  history  of  \ncelebrity,  it  is  clear  that  images  created  through  the  use  of  celebrities  to  advertise  \nproducts  is  a  campaign  particularly  well  used  in  the  advertising  world.

Yet  he  is  still  a  \nvery  well-known  rider.  Duke’s  career  is  impressive.  His  success  in  the  \nClubman’s  TT  in  1949  paved  the  way  for  further  achievement  during  the  \n1950s,  when  he  rode  for  Norton  and  then  the  Italian  Gilera  firm.  He  was  \nthe  first  rider  to  wear  one-piece  leathers,  which  became  a  distinguishing  \nmark. He also won the Seagrave Trophy in 1951, Sportsman of the Year in \n1952\n73\n and he was awarded an MBE in 1953, a year celebrated also for the \nQueen’s Coronation, the ascent of Everest by Hilary and Tensing and the \nso called Stanley Matthews Cup Final. He recorded the first 100 mph lap \nof the TT course in 1955. After retiring, Duke would become a member of \nthe  Isle  of  Man’s  Tourist  Board  Race  Committee  and  he  played  a  part  in  \nthe    discussion    surrounding    the    future    of    the    TT    when    World    \nChampionship  status  was  threatened  in  the  mid-1970s.\n74\n I  was  also \nreminded  of  his  success  and  popularity  by  the  presence  of  a  1976  \nadvertisement  in  The  Isle  of  Man  Weekly  Times  that  used  an  image  of  \nGeoff  Duke  to  promote  the  Whitestone  Garage  Ltd.  and  the  Volkswagon  \nPolo with the slogan “Geoff Duke does a lap and a half...easy!” \nDuring  his  career  the  motorcycle  press  praised  Duke’s  talent  and  \nachievement.  A  1950  editorial  in  Motor  Cycling  commented  on  Duke’s  \nvictory  that  year,  when  he  was  riding  for  the  Norton  team  in  the  Senior  \nTT:  “The  1950  series”,  it  stated,  “will  always  be  remembered  for  Duke’s  \neffortless   Senior   victory.”   This   article   went   further   to   suggest   that   \n“arguments  have  raged,  and  will  continue  to  do  so,  as  to  whether  Alec  \nBennett,  Jimmy  Simpson,  Walter  Handley,  Tim  Hunt,  Stanley  Woods  or  \nJimmy  Guthrie  was  the  finest  T.T.  rider  of  all  time,  but  there  are  now  \nmany  who  believe  the  new  star  will  eventually  be  awarded  that  title  \nwithout equivocation.”\n75\n Indeed, one does not readily remember the names \nStanley  Woods,  Jimmy  Guthrie  or  Walter  Handley  unless  you  are  an  \nardent  TT  fan,  but  many  people  will  have  an  idea  of  who  Geoff  Duke  is.  \nSuch was the popularity of Duke during the 1950s that a reduction in the \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n73\n M.

      "text": "Chapter Seven \n166\nnumber  of  people  visiting  the  TT  in  1956  was  attributed  to  his  absence  \nfrom the competition. An editorial in Motor Cycling stated that “as to the \nInternational events, it is perhaps too early to try to plumb all the reasons \nfor  the  falling  off  of  popularity,  though  three  major  causes  appear  to  be  \nobvious:  (a)  a  plethora  of  races  on  the  mainland:  (b)  times  are  getting  \nharder and, (c) no Geoff Duke.” The suggestion was put forward that “as \nGeoff and the Gilera ‘Fours’ would have competed on the Friday only it is \nperhaps not fair to ascribe all the downward drop in visitors to their non-\nappearance. It seems fairly certain, however, that the staggering falling off \nin  ‘Senior’  excursionists  can  be  generally  attributed  to  Geoff’s  absence  \nfrom the races. From all quarters it is reported that the ‘Stanley Matthews \nof  motorcycling’  is  the  man  the  crowds  will  pay  to  see”  [Emphasis  \nadded].\n76\n  This  comment  is  clearly  in  praise  of  Duke’s  sporting  prowess,  \nespecially in the likening of him to Stanley Matthews, the footballing hero \nof  the  1950s  whose  popularity  leads  one  sports  historian  to  conclude  that  \n“rarely  have  so  many  been  entertained  so  richly  by  a  solitary  football  \nplayer.”\n77\n  In  the  motorcycle  press  Duke  was  placed  on  the  same  level  of  \nsporting achievement.  \nGeoff Duke was perhaps not the “household name” that Hill describes \nCompton  to  have  become.  The  fact  that  Denis  Compton  can  be  so  easily  \nreferred  to  as  “Brylcreem  Boy”  demonstrates  his  profile  outside  football  \nand  cricket.\n78\n  He  might  be  seen  as  one  of  the  earliest  examples  of  a  \nsportsman  being  used  to  advertise  a  non-sporting  product.  However,  the  \nsame  cannot  be  said  of  Duke.  Walker  states,  “there  is  little  doubt  ...  that  \nGeoff  Duke  could,  equally,  have  reached  the  very  top  in  not  only  road  \nracing, but trials and scrambling (motocross). In fact, he can very well lay \nclaim to being the most successful all-rounder motor cycle sport has ever \nseen.”\n79\n    Predominantly    advertisements    featuring    Duke    are    only    \nadvertisements  for  motorcycles,  motorcars  or  related  products.

Duke  is  given  prominence  in  advertisements  for  \nNorton,  and  “Lucas  Ignition”  in  which  the  success  of,  as  well  as  his  new  \n“record  speed  and  record  lap”  are  drawn  upon.  A  1954  advertisement  for  \nCastrol  draws  on  Duke’s  success  in  the  Italian  Grand  Prix  on  an  Italian  \nmotorcycle.  This  is  an  advertisement  for  Castrol,  with  whom  Duke  had  a  \ncontract,   which   demonstrates   that   his   name   was   used   not   only   in   \nassociation with the Isle of Man TT but also with other motorcycle races.\n80\n \nAnother  Castrol  advertisement  significantly  includes  a  photograph  of  \nDuke,  with  the  advice  “It’s  risky  to  just  ask  for  ‘oil’  I  say  Castrol.”  \nConsumers  were  not  presented  only  with  the  name  of  a  successful  rider,  \nbut also with an instantly recognisable image. Denis Compton was used to \nsell  Brylcreem,  and  by  doing  so  he  lent  the  image  of  a  successful  \nsportsman  to  the  product  and  increased  its  desirability.  By  using  Castrol  \nmotorcyclists would be using the same oil as a six-time World Champion \nand successful TT rider.  \nBoorstin points out that the “the celebrity is a person who is known for \nhis   well-knowness”   but   that   “the   hero   was   distinguished   by   his   \nachievement.”  Geoff  Duke  might  be  seen  as  a  TT  celebrity.  He  still  \nattends  the  event  and  was  a  focal  point  in  the  centenary  celebrations  in  \n2007.  Yet,  during  the  1950s  he  was  also  hero  at  least  to  motorcyclists,  \ndistinguished  by  his  achievements,  as  were  other  riders  featured  in  TT-\nrelated advertisements. In Sport and Identity in the North of England, Holt \npoints to the cricketers, the footballers and the rugby league players in the \n“north”  who  might  be  viewed  as  northern  sporting  heroes.\n81\n Duke  was, \nand  remains,  one  of  the  most  well-known  TT  riders,  and  he  was  a  \n“northerner”,  from  St.  Helens,  who  enjoyed  considerable  success  in  this  \ninternational event, and other motor sports events, whose image was used \nin  advertising  and  who  members  of  the  motorcycling  community  hugely  \nrespected. Indeed, Duke, who raced in his last TT in 1959, is even pointed \nto  as  a  sporting  champion  on  Manchester  UK,  a  virtual  encyclopedia  of  \ngreater  Manchester.\n82\n  He  is  one  of  seven  sports  celebrities  alongside  \nAndrew   Flintoff   (cricketer),   Ricky   Hatton   (boxer),   Paula   Radcliffe   \n(athlete), David Lloyd (cricketer), Stanley Matthews (footballer) and Billy \nNevett (jockey).

For  example  the  1956  British  Railways  \nHoliday Guide described the island in the following way: \n \nIn  many  superficial  ways  you  can  match  the  Island  to  England.  Yet  it  is  \nnever  wholly  England,  for  its  roots  are  not  the  same  ...  It  has  queer  \nsuperstitions, dealing for instance with the herring trade which was once its \nmain  industry,  and  with  the  rowan  in  whose  mystic  power  the  Norsemen  \nbelieved.  It  remembers  its  witchcraft,  its  mermaids,  its  water-bulls,  its  \nfairies, folksongs and prophecies. It remembers from very ancient times its \nKing-wizard,  Mannanan,  who  in  the  clearest  weather  could  protect  it  \nagainst invaders by sudden mist.\n1\n \n \nHere  we  have  a  description  that  focuses  on  the  more  traditional  indeed  \nmythical aspects of the island’s past. Consideration is given to the island’s \nfolklore,  but  most  importantly  stress  is  placed  on  the  island’s  difference  \nfrom  England.  The  TT,  however,  did  not  have  a  place  in  this  brief  \ndescription  of  the  island  and  in  fact  this  representation  went  on  to  focus  \nfurther on the Norse ingredients of the island’s identity: “On Tynwald Hill \nthe parliament of Manxland is held annually; this is a relic of Norse rule, \nand is the only ceremony of its kind to outlast a thousand years.”\n2\n Further \nto this, the 1947 Isle of Man: Footpath Guide noted that “no conspectus of \nthe  Island,  however,  brief,  would  be  complete  without  a  reference  to  the  \nManx  Arms  and  the  Manx  cat,  which  with  the  Great  Wheel...are  among  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n British  Railways  Holiday  Guide  1956,  (Railway  Executive,  1956),  p.  231.

This  was  a  fusion  of  the  two  rival  place-\nmyths  that  emerged  during  the  inter-war  period.  The  old  and  new  are  \nencompassed   in   the   first   chapter   of   Maxwell   Fraser’s   In   Praise   of   \nManxland,  which  is  titled  “The  Island  Where  Yesterday  Meets  Today.”\n4\n \nHer  book,  after  introducing  the  Isle  of  Man,  describes  the  island’s  towns,  \nvillages  and  places  of  interest  in  clearly  marked  chapters.  It  is  somewhat  \nsurprising  then  that  the  opening  description  of  the  Isle  of  Man  is  the  \nfollowing: \n \nMany people associate only three things with the Isle of Man: tailless cats, \ncrowds  of  holiday  makers,  and  the  T.T.  Motor-Cycle  Races.  Only  those  \nwho have visited the island – and by that is meant those who have explored \nits  country-side  and  not  merely  stayed  in  Douglas  –realize  that  within  its  \nnarrow limits the Isle of Man has scenery comparable with the finest to be \nfound  in  the  British  Isles,  with  a  background  of  history  and  tradition  as  \ndifferent from that of England as if it were a foreign country.\n5\n \n \nFraser immediately made clear the contrasting place-myths in evidence \non  the  Isle  of  Man.  She  goes  on  further  to  describe  aspects  of  the  island,  \nand  writes  about  the  island’s  natural  scenery,  its  folklore,  customs  and  \nhistory  and  integrated  into  this  description  is  a  paragraph  commenting  on  \nthe  TT  races,  noting  their  establishment  in  1907  and  describing  the  \nspectacle provided by the event. Further allusions to the TT are contained \nat  various  points  in  the  text.\n6\n  For  instance,  in  the  description  of  Douglas  \nshe  notes  the  existence  of  Governor’s  bridge  where  crowds  gather  to  \nwatch the races. In Ramsey she states that another attraction for visitors is \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n3\n V.

The  sun  sets  behind  the  rugged  outline  of  the  Castle  and  the  \nruined  Cathedral  and  Round  Tower...Inland,  the  last  rays  of  sun  are  \nlighting  the  winding  lanes  of  Peel,  the  red  sandstone  of  its  church  towers,  \nand  the  soft  protecting  mountains  behind  it  of  the  Isle  of  Man.

Holliday suggested ways of making the most of a \ntrip by visiting the other attractions the island had to offer and by taking in \nthe scenery and enjoying long walks in the countryside.\n15\n An article in The \nMotor  Cycle  in  1956,  titled  “Our  Island”  noted,  “The  Isle  of  Man’s  \nromantic history is full of fascination and legend.” It went on to state that: \n \nTo  most  readers  of  this  journal  the  Isle  of  Man  means  motor-cycle  racing  \nand nothing else. But the fact that it was the birthplace of the T.T. Races in \n1907  and  their  home  ever  since  is  surely  an  indication  that  there  is  \nsomething  about  the  island  that  distinguishes  it  from  all  other  parts  of  \nBritain. Where else could 37 ¼ miles of public roads be closed against the \nQueen’s subjects for the purpose of racing? \n16\n \n \nThe  article  continued  by  stating:  “motor-cycle  racing  epitomises  the  \nunique  position  that  the  Isle  of  Man  has  enjoyed  for  centuries  as  a  self-\ngoverning  dependency  of  the  crown.”\n17\n  However,  it  also  went  on  to  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n12\n S.P.B.

We can see, therefore, that the Isle of Man continued to \nbe associated with the TT races through the post-war period, and also that \nthe  two  rival  place-myths  that  had  emerged  during  the  inter-war  years  \nwere now commonly fused together. The next section will look at the way \nthis developed inside the Isle of Man.  \nIdentity inside the Isle of Man \nEarlier it was mentioned that members of the Manx cultural elite were \nkeen  to  revive  the  Manx  language  as  a  means  of  guarding  themselves  \nagainst  the  growing  anglicisation  of  the  island.  However,  census  data  \nreveals that the Manx language underwent a decline and by the beginning \nof  World  War  Two  we  can  see  that  attempts  at  reviving  the  Manx  \nlanguage had been unsuccessful. Possibly as a result of this, the post-war \nperiod saw the beginning of the third phase of these attempts at language \nrevival.\n18\n This was marked in 1952 by calls from Fargher (secretary of Yn \nCheshaght  Gailckagh  (YCG))  and  Woods  (secretary  of  the  Manx  branch  \nof  the  Celtic  congress)  for  the  Manx  language  to  be  reinvigorated,  and  \nappeals  to  support  the  Manx  language  were  printed  in  Mona’s  Herald. \nDuring  this  period  YCG  also  recorded  the  speech  of  the  few  surviving  \nManx  speakers  on  the  Isle  of  Man.\n19\n  In  his  attempts  to  revive  the  Manx  \nlanguage, Fargher made a call for the Manx people to: \n \nThrow  off  apathy  and  disinterestedness  [sic]  and  take  part  in  another  \ncrusade   which   can   harm   no   one,   but   which   will   strengthen   us   as   \nindividuals  and  as  a  nation.  We  refer  to  the  crusade  for  maintaining  and  \nusing  the  Manx  Language.  Join  an  evening  class,  Manxmen,  and  bring  a  \nfriend with you.\n20\n \n \nClearly,  Fargher  believed  that  language  played  an  important  role  in  the  \nconstruction,  or  in  this  case  in  the  survival  of  a  distinctive  identity.  Here  \nwe  can  see  once  again  emphasis  being  placed  on  the  more  traditional  \ningredients  in  this  construction.  The  reasons  for  such  a  desperate  call  for  \n“Manxmen”  to  become  committed  to  a  revival  of  the  Manx  language  are  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n18\n  G.

Census  data  for  the  years  1951  and  1961  \nshows a further decline of Manx speakers on the island. In 1951 of a total \npopulation  of  52,897  (over  the  age  of  three  years)  there  were  no  solely  \nManx speakers and only 355 capable of speaking both English and Manx. \nBy  contrast  52,542  were  English  only  speakers.\n21\n  By  1961  from  a  total  \npopulation  of  46,321  (over  the  age  of  three  years),  there  were  only  155  \nbilingual English and Manx speakers and 46,156 solely English speakers.\n22\n  \nFurther  emphasis  was  also  placed,  by  some  in  the  Isle  of  Man,  on  the  \npromotion of the island’s traditional heritage. Carrying on from the inter-\nwar period, during which William Cubbon had published his Bibliography \nof the Literature of the Isle of Man and was responsible for the opening of \nthe  Cregneash  folk  museum,  the  next  curator  Basil  Megaw  (1940-1957)  \nset about cementing the work of Cubbon and enlarging the Manx museum \nin  Douglas,  developing  Cregneash,  and  opening  in  1951  the  island’s  \nnautical museum, a celebration of the island’s seafaring history. 1951 also \nsaw  the  passing  of  the  Manx  National  Trust  Act.  When  his  emphasis  on  \nthe promotion of traditional aspects of island life was challenged, Megaw \nanswered thus: \n \nA people which breaks all links with its traditions and inherited knowledge \nof  the  forebears  is  like  a  tree  without  roots.  By  the  addition  of  a  folk  \nsection  to  the  museum  we  are  able,  for  the  first  time,  to  appreciate  the  \ncontinuity of development in Manx domestic life from remote times to the \npresent day. \n23\n \n \nClearly  we  can  see  that  some  stressed  the  role  to  be  played  by  language,  \nhistory   and   heritage   in   constructions   of   Manx   identity   during   the   \nimmediate  post-war  period  and  earlier,  especially  those  responsible  for  \ncultural institutions and societies such as YCG and the Manx Museum.  \nHowever,  we  also  see  that  there  was  emphasis  placed  on  the  new  as  \nwell  as  the  old  in  such  promotional  literature  as  the  Isle  of  Man  Official  \nGuides produced by the Publicity Board, and later the Tourist Board. The \ngreat  variety  of  attractions  on  offer  in  the  island  was  stressed  in  these  \nguides.  For  instance,  the  1951  guidebook  contained  an  article  written  by  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n21\n Census 1951: Report on the Isle of Man, (London, H.M.S.O, 1954).  \n22\n Census  1961:  Report  on  the  Isle  of  Man:  Part  II  Migration,  Economic  Activity  \nand Other Topics, (London, H.M.S.O, 1966).  \n23\n S.

These  are  always  \navailable  here.  Do  they  seek  quiet  seclusion  with  just  the  peace  of  the  \nmountains  and  the  moors,  rivers  and  glens,  the  unpeopled  [sic]  coastal  \nscenery, the quiet bays and the creeks and coves, free from the hurly-burly \nof  everyday  life?  Here  they  all  are.  Do  they  look  for  a  quiet  motoring  or  \ncycling  holiday  not  too  strenuous  but  full  of  interest?  Here  we  can  offer  \nroads,  better  than  the  rest  in  Britain,  passing  through  places  of  surpassing  \nnatural  and  historical  interest,  every  turn  in  the  road  bringing  into  view  \nsome new and delightful vista.\n24\n \n \nStenning here focused on aspects that were not the TT races and by doing \nso  helped  in  the  further  construction  of  a  sense-of-place  that  was  centred  \non the traditional, and not the modern. Such a construction of the island’s \nplace-myth  can  also  be  seen  in  the  1953  Isle  of  Man  Guidebook,  which  \nstressed the traditional friendliness of the welcome afforded to visitors by \nthe islanders.  \n \nCatering  for  visitors  in  this  Isle  is  no  summer  sideline;  it  is  a  principle  \nindustry in which the minds and endeavours of many people living here are \nconcentrated.  Their  job  is  to  maintain  and  enhance  the  island’s  reputation  \nas  a  place  where  the  happiest  of  holidays  can  be  spent,  and  they  take  a  \ngood deal of pleasure in the fulfilment of that task.\n25\n \n \nHowever,  the  traditional  place-myth  stressing  the  modern  is  also  \nevident within this tourist literature, as is the harmony with which the rival \nmyths  sat  alongside  each  other.  Whilst  Stenning  had  described  the  more  \ntraditional attractions of the Isle of Man, he also stressed “the greatest lure \nof  all  in  this  mechanical  age,  a  lure  which  attracts  so  many  thousands  to  \nour nation. For does not this island claim the greatest and most spectacular \nof  all  speed  events...the  Tourist  Trophy  Race?

This  statement  seemed  to  sit  comfortably  in  Stenning’s  \narticle  alongside  his  description  of  the  island’s  history,  heritage  and  \nnatural beauty.  \nThe  1954  Isle  of  Man  Guidebook  similarly  made  it  clear  that  the  TT  \nraces played an important role in attracting visitors to the Isle of Man and \npromoting the island internationally. It was suggested that: \n \nIn   the   sporting   field   the   Isle   of   Man   is   already   world   famous.   Of   \noutstanding  interest  are  the  International  Tourist  Trophy  Motor  Cycle  \nRaces,  which  bring  together  every  June  the  world’s  most  daring  and  \naccomplished  road  racers.  The  development  of  the  internal  combustion  \nengine  has  been  very  closely  linked  with  T.T.  racing  in  the  Isle  of  Man.  \nWill the island play a similar part in the development of the jet engine, or \neven atomic power for the propulsion of road vehicles? Who knows?\n27\n \n \nThe  Manx  were  clearly  keen  to  represent  themselves  as  curators  of  a  \nnatural  beauty  and  an  appealing  history,  but  also,  paradoxically,  as  being  \nat  the  forefront  of  modernity  epitomised  by  technological  advance  and  \nindeed  by  danger.  The  TT  itself  was  described  in  1954  as  being  “one  of  \nthe most thrilling and hazardous events in the world”, and the excitement \ndescribed  as  being  “high  and  continuous.”\n28\n  Similarly  the  1955  official  \nguide noted that the TT was “amongst the most important sporting events \nwhich  take  place  on  the  Isle  of  Man.”\n29\n  It  was  further  stressed  that  the  \nevent attracted enthusiasts “from all over the world” and that therefore the \nisland  was  not  some  backwater  because  “Douglas  assumes  a  decidedly  \ncosmopolitan  air  as  competitors  and  their  supporters  talk  in  their  many  \ndifferent  tongues.”\n30\n  So  there  still  existed  within  constructions  of  Manx  \nidentity apparently discordant elements, but in tourist guides these did not \nclash.  \nThe Manx press also comfortably combined old and new. The TT races \nwere prominent in the Manx press during this period. TT reports appeared \nalongside   domestic   news,   and   advertisements   for   motorcycles   and   \nmotorcycle   accessories   adorned   large   areas   of   these   newspapers,   \nespecially in the period before, during and for a couple of weeks after the \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n27\n Isle of Man Guidebook 1953: The Isle of Man puts the Seal on Happy Holidays, \n(Douglas, Isle of Man). \n28\n Isle  of  Man  Guidebook  1954:  The  Isle  of  Man  for  Happy  Holidays,  (Douglas,  \nIsle of Man). \n29\n Isle of Man Guidebook 1955: The Isle of Treasured Holidays, (Douglas, Isle of \nMan). \n30\n Isle of Man Guidebook 1955."

The  structure  of  most  Manx  newspapers  meant  that  \nthere  was  no  dedicated  sports  section  and  so  reports  of  the  TT  were  \njuxtaposed  with  local  news  and  events,  as  a  textual  representation  of  the  \nharmony  that  existed  between  the  old  and  the  new.  Therefore,  it  was  not  \nuncommon to find a report of the TT race next to a story about the Manx \nmusic festival or such like.  \nFor  instance,  a  1958  article  in  the  Isle  of  Man  Weekly  Times  reported  \nthe  visit  of  “exiled”  Manxmen  from  Canada  and  the  United  States.  It  \nreported  the  welcoming  ceremony  that  took  place  on  Douglas  harbour.  It  \nwas stated that: \n \nThey  were  greeted  by  the  Lon  Leah  Choir’s  recording  of  ‘Oh  Canada’,  \n‘The  Star  Spangled  Banner’  and  the  Manx  national  anthem  as  they  drew  \nnearer  landing...There  was  also  the  singing  of  ‘Ellan  Vannin’  and  other  \nbeautiful  national  songs  by  a  quartet,  charming  speeches  of  welcome  and  \nmany grand reunions of the quayside.\n31\n \n \nWe are thus given the impression that those responsible for organising the \nofficial  reception  were  keen  to  promote  a  traditional  view  of  the  island.  \nBut, the report of this ceremony went on to suggest that: \n \nIf   the   music   of   church   bells   did   not   come   over   the   water   to   the   \nHomecomers in this early hour there was instead the roar of high-powered \nmotor  cycles  a  sound  as  nostalgically  sweet  to  Manxmen  as  a  belfry  \ncarillon, for  are  not  the  world  famous  TT  and  the  homeland  synonymous? \n[Emphasis added] \n32\n \n \nThis comment demonstrates the belief, perpetuated in the Manx press, that \nthe  TT  races  were  good  for  the  island.  Indeed  the  report  went  further  by  \nputting the old and the new together and by suggesting that those returning \nto the island would be listening for the sound of motorcycles and that this \nsound   would   remind   them   that   the   Isle   of   Man   was   indeed   their   \n“homeland.” The Isle of Man and the TT were synonymous and so a point \nhad  been  reached  where  the  Isle  of  Man  and  the  TT  could  not  be  \nseparated.  \nThis  might  be  taken  further  to  suggest  that  whilst  inside  the  Isle  of  \nMan and within the Manx press there was an emerging opinion that the TT \nwas  a  defining  part  of  a  Manx  sense-of-self,  the  TT  races  also  seemed  to  \nposition  the  Isle  of  Man  at  the  centre  of  the  world  in  both  spectacle  and  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n31\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 30 May 1958. \n32\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 30 May 1958."

Mona’s Herald might \nhave exaggerated the feelings of the Manx people when it stated that “we \nlike  to  think  that  even  those  who  have  this  mundane  interest  in  the  races  \nand  their  results  share  a  strong  desire  to  see  the  prestige  of  the  British  \nmotor cycle upheld.”\n35\n The sentiment was, however, the same. Success for \nthe  British  motorcycle  industry  would  equal  further  publicity  for  the  Isle  \nof  Man  and  this  enhanced  sense  of  importance  was  factored  into  Manx  \nidentity.  \nDespite stronger support for the TT in the Manx press, and the greater \nuse  of  the  TT  in  promoting  the  island  in  tourist  literature,  the  fact  still  \nremained that a large amount of inconvenience was caused by the staging \nof the event on the Isle of Man. Roads still had to be closed, and the Manx \npeople would still be prevented from going about their everyday business. \nYet  no  evidence  of  an  organised  protest  has  been  found.  Indeed,  in  1956  \nthe Isle of Man Weekly Times, welcoming people to the Isle of Man for the \nTT,   commented   that   “next   week   the   countryside   of   Manxland   will   \nreverberate  to  the  ‘roar  of  the  free  exhaust’  and  once  again  we  wish  the  \nbest of luck to those men who will provide the amazing spectacle offered \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n33\n Mona’s Herald, 21 June 1949. \n34\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 5 June 1949.  \n35\n Mona’s Herald, 21 June 1949."

      "text": "“The Motorcycling Isle”: The TT as Part of Manx Identity \n179\nby   the   incomparable   T.T..”\n36\n   This   comment   suggests   that   racing   \nmotorcycles along the island’s roads was an inconvenience that would be \ntolerated. \nCannon   E.H.   Stenning,   a   Manx   resident   (since   1912)   and   once   \npresident of the Manx Motor Cycle Club, to whom the Duke of Edinburgh \nonce referred as the “Motorcycling Dean”,\n37\n was also quick to discard the \ninconvenience  caused  by  the  TT  and  to  make  the  point  that  the  event  \nunited the Manx people. In an article in the 1954 TT programme he noted \nthat – and the language used is indicative: \n \nYear by year we on the Island look forward with the greatest of pleasure to \nthe   coming   of   the   A.C.U.   and   the   attendant   train   of   riders   and   \nmanufacturers. We look  forward  to  renewing  old  friendships,  making  new  \nassociations  which  we  trust  will  last  for  many  years  ...  welcoming  \ncompetitors  from  all  parts  of  the  earth,  welcoming  foreign  machines  (for  \nwe  realise  that  competition  is  the  backbone  of  success)  ...  So  we on  the  \nIsland bid you welcome, and hail your arrival with great pleasure. It is true \nthat you bring us wealth, but to the great majority of us that is no concern. \nWe like to hear of new designs, new devices, new speeds, but all these are \nsmall  matters  to  us  compared  with  the  human  side,  the  personal  contact  \nwith  you  all  ...  look  upon  us  ...  as  people  who  welcome  you  all,  who  \nappreciate  you  fully,  who  hope  you  will  come  again  to  our  lovely  island.  \n[Emphases added].\n38\n \n \nUsing Stenning’s comments we can begin to appreciate the insular point of \nview by looking at the language used in his article about the TT races. We \nshould not assume that all Manx residents were as keen as Stenning to see \nthe  TT  continue,  but  Stenning’s  point  of  view,  which  was  projected  from  \ninside the island outwards to TT visitors, groups the Manx together in their \nsupport  of  and  enthusiasm  for  the  TT  races  and  was  never  significantly  \nchallenged.\n39\n  We  can  therefore  see,  from  the  evidence  discussed,  that  the  \nTT  had  become  accepted  in  internal  constructions  of  Manx  identity.  This  \nacceptance  of  the  event  by  the  islanders  was  particularly  exemplified  in  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n36\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 1 June 1956.  \n37\n This reference was included in an article in the Isle of Man Weekly Times, 2 May \n1958.  \n38\n E.H.

      "text": "Chapter Eight \n180\n1953  when  the  Manx  press  defended  the  TT  against  external  criticism,  \nwhen  a  section  of  the  British  press  criticised  the  TT  because  it  entailed  \nrisk, danger and death.  \nEarlier it was shown that The Times had raised such matters in 1908 in \nreaction  to  the  staging  of  the  “four-inch”  race.\n40\n  The  TT  was  again  \nattacked  by  the  British  press  in  1953  on  three  grounds.  First,  fatalities  in  \nthe  TT  were  pointed  out  as  a  reason  to  stop  the  event.  It  was  reported  in  \nThe  Daily  Sketch  and  Graphic  that  on  8  June  “two  more  young  men  met  \ndeath...on  the  37  miles  of  tortuous  roads  which  form  the  Isle  of  Man  \nmotor-cycle T.T. race course.”\n41\n The Daily Mirror went as far as to list the \nfatalities  from  the  past  five  TT  races:  one  killed  in  1948,  two  killed  in  \n1949,  four  killed  in  1950,  six  killed  in  1951  and  five  killed  in  1952.\n42\n \nThese  fatalities  were  seen  as  reason  enough  to  stop  the  TT  races.  The \nDaily Mirror exclaimed, “slap down on the whole show. Close it up”, and \nstated  further  that  “now  with  speeds  of  up  and  over  100  m.p.h.  this  \nspectacle,  once  called  the  greatest  sport  on  earth,  has  degenerated  into  a  \nsuicidal free for all.”\n43\n The Times’ reaction against the “four-inch” race in \n1908 was caused by the possibility of fatal accidents. In 1953 criticism of \nthe TT in a section of the British press was to the actuality of death in the \nTT.  \nSecond,  what  made  it  worse  was  apparently  that  the  Manx  prospered  \nfrom this murderous event: \n \nFour  young  men  died  this  week  providing  a  spectacle  which  brought  \n25,000 people with £250,000 to spend to this small island. Four young men \nwhose  deaths  are  set  against  the  balance  sheet  of  ‘progress’  in  an  island  \nwhere officialdom does not separate their tragic end from the ‘normal run \nof casualties’.\n44\n \n \nThis article in the Sunday Pictorial evidently considered the prosperity the \nTT  brought  to  the  Isle  of  Man,  but  did  not  justify  the  continuation  of  the  \nevent.  Third,  it  was  claimed,  “the  islanders  are  used  to  it  [the  TT].  For  \nsome  46  years  they  have  lived,  slept  and  eaten  motor-cycle  racing.  It  has  \nbecome part of their life.” The Manx therefore should, “turn a blind eye to \nthe  fact  that  the  roaring  modern  motor-cycle  has  outgrown  the  narrow  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n40\n Government Office File, R2701/1/3, Tourist Trophy Races 1953 (IOMPRO).  \n41\n Daily Sketch and Daily Graphic, 9 June 1953. \n42\n Daily Mirror, 10 June 1953. \n43\n Daily Mirror, 10 June 1953. \n44\n Sunday Pictorial, 14 June 1953."

The event was not defended in 1953 just because the \nEnglish  wished  to  stop  it,  as  was  the  case  in  1908.  The  TT  was  now  \ndefended because it was a distinguishing Manx event that had the support \nof the Manx people. The sensationalist angle taken in reports in the British \npress, were particularly resented. The Isle of Man Times argued that “there \nare  people  in  the  newspaper  world  with  insufficient  intelligence  to  report  \ncurrent  events  in  readable  fashion,  and  they  have,  perforce,  to  rely  on  \nsensationalism”,\n46\n whilst  the Isle  of  Man  Examiner  noted  that  “national  \nnewspaper  representatives  are  incapable  of  filing  a  report  without  losing  \nall  sense  of  proportion.  A  race  without  a  tragedy  or  some  trumped  up  \n‘human  angle’  leaves  them  floundering  for  material.”\n47\n Their  responses \nmay  appear  as  comments  on  the  skills  of  the  journalists  writing  for  these  \nnewspapers,  but  in  essence  they  were  defensive  of  the  TT  as  part  of  a  \nManx identity.  \nArticles  in  the  Manx  press  did  not  ignore  the  fatalities  suffered  in  the  \nTT,  but  attempted  to  deny  the  implications.  The  Isle  of  Man  Examiner \ncommented, “two fatalities on Monday provoked some of the most vicious \nreporting  we  have  seen  of  a  T.T.  race.”  It  was  pointed  out  that  over  the  \nyears  165  races  had  been  held  on  the  mountain  course,  which  totalled  \nroughly  37,000  laps.  During  these  races  there  had  only  been  59  fatalities,  \nand  “those  few  statistics  are  sufficient  to  put  the  story  into  proper  \nperspective.”  This  comment  sat  alongside  the  assertion  that  “there  are  no  \nsimilar  campaigns  focusing  attention  on  the  100  deaths  and  5,000  road  \ncasualties a week being recorded regularly on the other side of the water.” \nThe same article went on to state that it should not be necessary to stress \nwhat is obvious, that “the hordes of roaring motor-cycles going round the \nfamous circuit day and night are music to the ears of everyone who has the \nIsland’s  interests  at  heart.”\n48\n  These  comments  were  in  defence  of  a  TT,  \nwhich had become part of Manx life and a Manx sense of identity.  \nIn  the  face  of  the  1953  criticism  The  Isle  of  Man  Weekly  Times \nsummed up what it believed to be the general feeling in the island towards \nthe continuation of the TT: \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n45\n Sunday Pictorial, 14 June 1953. \n46\n The Isle of Man Times, 10 June 1953. \n47\n Isle of Man Examiner, 12 June 1953. \n48\n Isle of Man Examiner, 12 June 1953."

The  TT  \nwas  defended  because  it  had  become  by  1953,  as  earlier  and  later,  fully  \nincorporated into Manx identity, something to be defended because of that \nsense of “who we are”: the parallel defence of bull-fighting by the Spanish \nagainst  external  critics  comes  readily  to  mind.  The  reaction  of  the  Manx  \npress  to  sensationalist  reports;  the  lack  of  notice  taken  by  the  Manx  \nlegislature to this criticism; and the continuation of the event show that the \nTT had become firmly embedded within a Manx sense-of-self.  \nAfter  1945,  the  island  continued  to  promote  its  Celtic  and  Norse  \nheritage,  its  natural  beauty  and  its  distinctive  history.  However,  in  both  \nexternal   and   internal   representations   of   the   island   these   different   \ningredients  were  placed  alongside  each  other  and  combined.

Most  importantly  and  with  greater  \nemphasis,  the  TT  also  put  the  Isle  of  Man  on  a  world  stage.  Symbols  of  \nManx  identity,  which  by  now  most  definitely  included  the  TT,  sat  \nharmoniously  alongside  one  another.  Motorcycle  racing,  which  had  been  \nimposed  on  the  island  and  the  islanders  but  which  had  been  gradually  \naccepted  during  the  inter-war  period,  was  now  firmly  ingrained  in  the  \nisland’s place-myth alongside the island’s natural beauty and its distinctive \nhistory and heritage. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n49\nIsle of Man Weekly Times, 20 June 1953."

In  recognition  of  his  20  wins  at  the  Isle  of  Man  TT,  he  \nreceived  his  award  from  John  Surtees.  Recently  the  TT  has  once  again  \nbegun to gain greater publicity outside of the Isle of Man. The 2011 film \nTT: Closer to the Edge was shown at cinemas nationwide (to considerable \nacclaim).

The Manx authorities might also have given in \nto external criticism in, for example, 1908 and 1953 but they did not. Even \nin  1927  the  death  of  a  rider  did  not  call  a  halt  to  the  TT,  but  instead  \nprompted  the  passage  of  legislation  intended  only  to  improve  safety  for  \ncompetitors when practising for the main event. Thus, by the 1960s the TT \nhad become securely established in the island’s politics, and it continues to \nbe supported today despite criticism from outside. After the loss of World \nChampionship   status   in   1976,   the   continuation   of   the   TT   was   still   \nendorsed  by  members  of  the  Manx  legislature.  In  a  1976  debate  in  \nTynwald the Speaker of the House of Keys proposed that the chairman of \nthe   Tourist   Board   should   enquire   into   its   future,   “in   view   of   the   \nwidespread   concern   felt   by   motorcycling   enthusiasts   throughout   the   \nworld.”  The  chairman  of  the  Tourist  Board  was  adamant  in  his  response:  \n“I  would  never  submit  to  pressure  from  inside  or  outside  the  Island  to  \nabandon the magnificent mountain circuit.”\nʹ\n  \nIndeed,  a  1976  letter  to  the  editor  contained  in  the  Isle  of  Man  \nExaminer  asked:  “Will  someone  tell  me  what  has  the  T.T.  been  but  the  \ngreatest  endurance  of  man  and  machine  in  the  whole  world.”\n 3\n The  letter \nwent on to suggest that, should the races be cancelled, in the next year Isle \nof Man TT arrivals would be down 65-70, and the season would then start \nin  the  first  week  of  July.  This  was  “in  short  a  devastating  blow  to  the  \nIsland.”  Further  confirmation  of  the  event’s  status  in  this  edition  of  the  \nnewspaper: “It is surely the unique nature of the course which attracts the \nthousands  of  riders  and  enthusiasts  to  the  Island.  The  evidence  is  here  \nnow.  The  main  championship  contenders  have  not  been  here  this  week,  \nbut  the  entry  has  been  terrific  and  the  crowd  bigger  than  ever.  Whatever  \nhappens, hands off the TT course. Short circuits are two a penny. We are \ncertain no one would come here for races on one!”\n4\n By the late 1970s then, \nthe  TT  had  become  firmly  ingrained  and  supported  as  part  of  a  Manx  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n2\n Manx Debates, Vol. 93, 15 June 1976, p.

Similarly,  in  2008  the  Manx  legislature  continued  to  support  the  \ncontinuation of the TT after strong criticism following fatalities in 2007.\nͷ\n \n \nThe discussion of how and why the TT has continued over the past 100 \nyears  has  been  structured  around  three  themes  dealing  with  politics,  \neconomics  and  national  identity.  The  theme  of  politics  addressed  the  \nquestion of how the TT was established and sustained on the Isle of Man \nand it has shown that political history matters in understanding the origins \nand  continuation  of  the  TT.  I  have  demonstrated  that  motor  racing  was  \nimposed on the Manx legislature, and therefore on the Manx people, by an \nauthoritative   lieutenant   governor.   Comparisons   with   the   moves   that   \nlegalised  an  international  motorcar  race  in  Ireland  in  1903  were  made  \nbecause this set a precedent for Manx legislation in 1904. What cannot be \ndoubted  is  that  legislation  that  authorised  motorcar  races  on  the  island,  \npaved the way for the motorcycle TT races held on the Isle of Man in 1907 \nand thereafter to 1914.  \nHowever,  between  the  wars,  following  constitutional  reforms,  members  \nof Tynwald now offered their backing for the TT’s continuation. Members \nof  the  Legislative  Council  and  the  House  of  Keys  were  able  to  express  \nsupport  for  the  TT  in  more  open  and  transparent  debates  in  Tynwald  and  \nthis led to the embedding of more widespread political support for the TT \nand the passing of supportive legislation. This was a result of the changing \nstructure  and  practice  of  government  in  the  island.  Further  political  \nsupport  was  demonstrated  by  the  endorsement  of  Hill’s  initiative  in  1929  \nfor a financial grant to be given to the ACU to allow the TT to continue on \nthe  Isle  of  Man.  This  meant  that  after  World  War  Two,  there  was  little  \ndoubt  that  the  TT  would  be  restarted  on  the  Isle  of  Man,  because  of  the  \npolitical  support  that  existed  in  Tynwald.  So  after  World  War  Two,  there  \nwas  a  further  consolidation  of  political  support  for  the  TT.  The  TT  was  \nnot,  therefore,  an  event  imposed  on  the  Manx  people  since  there  was  \ncertainly  strong  support  for  the  event  amongst  elected  members  of  the  \nManx  legislature.  Political  endorsement  of  the  TT  was  demonstrated,  for  \nexample,  by  the  re-election  of  the  Tynwald  Motor  Races  Committee  in  \n1946  and  by  the  unanimous  support  for  the  annual  renewal  of  legislation  \nand the government’s financial grant to the ACU. By the end of the 1950s \npolitical  support  for  the  TT  was  confirmed,  and  this,  as  indicated  earlier,  \nhas been sustained into the present day. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n5\n  This  matter  was  widely  discussed  in  the  Manx  press  and  it  was  made  clear  that  \ndespite  the  publishing  of  a  report  which  concluded  that  health  and  safety  had  not  \nbe adhered to by those policing the course, it was clear that the Manx government \nwere not going to end the TT."

There  continues  to  be  no  organised  protest  \nagainst  the  TT’s  continuation,  an  absence  that  has  been  noted  throughout  \nthis work. Only occasional rumbles have been unearthed. True, expressions \nof active public support have been largely confined to anecdotal evidence \nfound  in  the  Manx  press.  In  1988,  however,  an  article  included  in  The \nScottish Geographical Magazine assessed residents’ opinions of the Manx \nTT  races  and  concluded  that  the  event  was  “not  considered  excessively  \ndisruptive  by  the  Manx  population.”\n͸\n  The  investigation  asked  residents  \nwhether  they  personally  enjoyed  TT  week  and  for  their  views  on  its  \npromotion  and  its  economic  impact  and  whether  they  found  it  disruptive.  \nThe  results  of  this  survey  can  be  seen  in  appendix  one.  Interestingly  they  \nwere  also  asked  whether  the  TT  generated  “national  feeling.”  Three  \nstatements  were  put  to  Manx  residents:  first,  “the  TT  races  create  a  \nnational  feeling”,  second,  “in  my  experience  most  Islanders  welcome  the  \nTT  races”,  and  third,  “the  TT  races  are  an  essential  part  of  the  Island’s  \ntwentieth-century  heritage.”  A  total  of  500  residents  were  asked  if  they  \nagreed or disagreed with these statements. Seventy-four per cent agreed or \nstrongly agreed that the TT created national feeling, 78 per cent agreed or \nstrongly  agreed  that  most  islanders  welcomed  the  TT  and  85  per  cent  \nagreed  or  strongly  agreed  that  the  TT  was  part  of  the  island’s  twentieth-\ncentury  heritage.\n͹\n  Clearly,  there  was  a  strong  body  of  public  opinion  in  \nfavour   of   the   TT.   Only   two   per   cent   strongly   disagreed   with   the   \nstatements.  Although  in  the  past  the  Manx  people  had  not  been  given  \ndirectly  the  chance  to  express  their  opinions  this  poll  demonstrated  that  \ncertainly by 1988 there was still much support for the continuation of the \nevent amongst the Manx people.  \nThroughout  the  twentieth  century  the  TT  became  an  integral  part  of  \nManx  identity  and  an  important  part  of  the  way  the  island  is  marketed  to  \noutsiders,  as  we  have  seen  above.  Yet,  one  question  still  remains:  that  is  \nwhy  the  TT  continues  to  be  tolerated  by  the  Manx.  It  is  undoubtedly  an  \nevent  that  causes  disruption  to  the  local  community.  Indeed,  in  2006  \n52.4%  of  residents  were  born  outside  of  the  Isle  of  Man,  suggesting  that  \nsome  protest  against  the  inconvenience  of  the  race  might  be  expected.\n8\n It \nis difficult to fully understand what the ‘man-on-the-street’ feels about the \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n6\n R.

This  is  data  that  has  simply  not  been  \nrecorded.  \nSo in order to summarise how far public opinion had developed since \nPrentice’s  1988  survey,  I  carried  out  a  similar  survey.  1,292  people  took  \nthe  survey:  779  or  60.9%  of  the  respondents  were  Manx  residents;  40.8  \nper  cent  of  participants  were  aged  between  20  and  39  and  44.7%  aged  \nbetween 40 and 59. Only 2% were aged between 0 and 19, 11.8% 60 to 79 \nand  0.4%  80  or  older.  The  majority  of  participants,  64.7%  were  male,  \nmeaning the other 35.3% were female. Of the 779 initial respondents, 738 \nrecorded  their  place  of  residence.  177  (24%)  lived  inside  the  TT  course  \nand  561  (76%)  lived  outside  the  TT  course.  Surprisingly  a  large  majority  \nof participants lived in the north of the island.  \nThe  survey  was  designed  to  be  a  way  to  get  some  idea  of  how  both  \nManx  residents  and  some  non-residents  viewed  the  TT  and  to  ask  further  \nhow important a part of Manx identity residents believe the TT to be and \nthe following statements were proposed: \n \n1) Most islanders welcome the TT races \n2) The TT races are good for the Manx economy \n3) The TT races bring the Island good publicity \n4) The TT races are a significant inconvenience to Islanders \n5) The TT races disrupt the peacefulness of the Island \n6) The TT races are dangerous \n7) The TT races are an important ingredient in Manx identity \n8) The TT races create a national feeling \n9) The  TT  races  are  an  important  part  of  the  island’s  21\nst\n  century  \nheritage \n10) Without the TT the Isle of Man would lose a distinctive part of its \nidentity \nThese  were  opinion  statements,  and  participants  were  asked  if  they  \nstrongly  agreed,  agreed,  disagreed  or  strongly  disagreed  with  a  particular  \nstatement or if they had no opinion (an opinion which only a small amount \nof people chose).  \nThe results of the survey are represented in appendix one, below. From \nthe results it can be suggested that there continues to be strong support and \ncommitment  towards  the  TT  from  a  majority  of  Manx  residents.

For example, 78.8% of participants in the online survey \nagreed  that  islanders  welcomed  the  TT;  Prentice  calculated  this  figure  to  \nbe  78%.  79%  of  participants  believed  the  TT  was  good  for  the  Manx  \neconomy; Prentice’s figure was 83%. However, where the continuation of \nthe  TT  comes  into  question  the  figures  differ  slightly.  My  survey  showed  \nthat  72.7%  of  residents  who  responded  disagreed  that  the  TT  should  be  \nended,  whereas  Prentice’s  figure  was  closer  to  90%.  This  relates  directly  \nto  changes  in  perceptions  of  the  dangerous  nature  of  the  TT.  76.9%  of  \nresidents  agreed  that  the  TT  was  dangerous,  and  only  15.7%  disagreed.  \nOpinion  was  split  in  Prentice’s  survey:  47%  agreed  and  47%  disagreed.  \nBut  there  are  other  areas  that  are  also  ripe  for  further  examination.  For  \ninstance, the balance of opinion between residents living inside the course \nand outside the course was fairly even - in some cases people living inside \nthe course had a more positive commitment towards the TT. The results of \nthis  survey  were  fairly  unsurprising.  There  was  strong  support  for  the  \ncontinuation  of  the  TT  amongst  the  738  residents  that  participated  in  this  \nsurvey.  It  must  be  concluded  that  the  evidence  supports  that  assumption  \nthat the TT is strongly established as a part of Manx national identity.  \nDecisions  made  and  legislation  passed  by  the  Manx  government,  \nalongside  changes  to  the  structure  and  practice  of  government  in  the  Isle  \nof Man, were clearly important to the development of the TT. Thus we can \nsee that politics had a large role to play in the origins and continuation of \nthis  event  and  this  is  surely  also  the  case  for  sport  in  general,  which  \ncommonly  involves  the  use  of  public  money  and  has  public  profiles,  \nespecially  large-scale  international  events.  Hosting  an  Olympic  Games  or  \na  World  Cup  tournament  involves  a  large  deal  of  political  decision-\nmaking. Indeed, Guttmann clearly points to the political agenda behind the \nestablishment  and  staging  of  the  Olympics.\nͻ\n  Political  endorsement  of  a  \nsporting  event  might  not  be  forthcoming,  however,  unless  there  were  \neconomic benefits expected. \nTherefore,  whilst  the  political  theme  had  introduced  and  answered  the  \nquestion of how the TT races were established and maintained on the Isle \nof Man it was the economic rewards, which helped to explain the event’s \npolitical endorsement. The TT’s continuation owed much to an anticipated \neconomic  gain.  Members  of  Tynwald  believed  with  good  reason  that  the  \nTT  brought  economic  benefits  to  the  Isle  of  Man.  Before  the  First  World  \nWar  these  interests  were  minimal  and  members  of  Tynwald  did  not  \nsuggest  until  as  late  as  1912  that  the  TT  might  bring  prosperity  to  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n9\n A.

During the inter-war years, however, the belief that the TT offered \neconomic  benefits  grew  considerably  amongst  members  of  Tynwald.  \nHence  the  TT  was  used  to  publicise  the  island  and  the  provision  of  an  \nannual grant to the ACU. Also during this period, interest groups such as \nthe Isle of Man Steam Packet Company demonstrated their support for the \nTT  with  their  own  grant  to  the  ACU.  The  belief  that  the  TT  would  bring  \nfinancial rewards was consolidated during the post-war years. Thus we can \nsee that economics played a large part in the growth of support for the TT \nraces in the Isle of Man between 1919 and the 1960s. Support continues to \nbe offered for economic reasons up to the present day. When in 1976 the \nchairman  of  the  Tourist  Board  insisted  that  the  TT  should  be  continued,  \nhis  argument  was  very  explicit:  “Our  main  consideration  must  always  be  \nthe attraction of tourists.”\nͳͲ\n In fact so popular is the event, and such are the \neconomic benefits that the Manx are seen to take from staging the TT, that \na 2008 article in the Lancaster Guardian reported that: \n \nTT  legends  John  McGuinness,  Ian  Lougher  and  Richard  ‘Milky’  Quayle  \nare  to  visit  Miyakejima  Island,  one  of  the  Islands  off  Tokyo,  approved  by  \nthe  Isle  of  Man  Government’s  Department  of  Tourism  and  Leisure.  \nMiyakejima Island is looking into creating its own equivalent of the Isle of \nMan   TT   races   to   boost   local   tourism   and   the   economy   following   \nsignificant volcanic eruption in 1983 and 2000.\n11\n \n \nThe  use  of  a  motorcycle  race  to  boost  an  economy  in  the  wake  of  a  \nnatural  disaster  could  be  seen  as  strange,  indeed  bizarre.  However,  the  \nJapanese have taken the Isle of Man TT races as their guide, because it has \nindeed boosted the island’s tourist trade and brought money into the Manx \neconomy.  A  pseudo-TT  race  on  this  Japanese  island  may  well  attract  \nspectators,  especially  when  we  take  into  consideration  the  number  of  \nJapanese  manufacturers  involved  in  the  event  in  the  present  day  and  the  \npopularity  of  the  Isle  of  Man  TT  internationally.\nͳʹ\n  But  it  must  also  be  \nremembered that the TT was established at a time when health and safety \nissues did not overwhelm the organisers and that today’s competition only \ncontinues because of the history attached to the event. \nWe  have  also  seen  that  it  was  not  just  the  Manx  who  believed  that  \nthere  was  money  to  be  made  from  the  continuation  of  the  event.

The TT has indeed become more than \na test bed for motorcycles, but the capitalist spectacle provided by the TT \nis  not  yet,  however,  on  a  par  with  such  event  as  the  World  Cup  or  the  \nOlympics Games, which are hugely attractive to producers of a wide range \nof products.\nͳ͵\n Nevertheless, the exposure provided by the TT continues to \nbe  exploited  worldwide  by  motorcycle  manufacturers  and  manufacturers  \nof accessories.  \nPolitical support for the TT and the economic gains to be had from the \nevent’s continuation has led to the ingraining of the TT in constructions of \na  Manx  national  identity.  Over  the  course  of  this  book  I  have  taken  \naccount  of  the  different  ingredients  in  representations  of  Manx  identity  \noutside  and  inside  of  the  island,  defining  what  this  means  and  assessing  \nthe place of the TT within this identity. I set out initially to suggest that in \nthe  years  before  1914  Manx  identity,  both  internally  and  externally,  was  \nconstructed largely around the island’s Celtic and Norse traditions and its \nnatural  beauty;  motor  racing  did  not  impinge  upon  this.  Inside  the  Isle  of  \nMan there was little recognition of motor racing as an ingredient of Manx \nidentity,  and  externally  it  was  almost  only  the  motorcycle  press  who  \npointed  to  the  Isle  of  Man  as  the  home  of  the  TT  races.  This  changed  \nduring  the  inter-war  period  and  the  TT  came  to  find  a  place  in  the  \nconstruction of Manx identity, both inside and outside the island. This led \nto the emergence of two rival place-myths, one still embracing the island’s \nancient  heritage  and  natural  beauty,  the  other,  apparently  discordant,  \nstressing  such  aspects  of  modernity  as  technology  and  speed.  However,  \nthese rival place-myths were fused together during the post-war period and \nthe  TT  thus  became  ingrained  in  constructions  of  Manx  identity.  It  was  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n13\n  See  J.

The  island’s  identity  therefore  became  multifaceted  and  was  \nbased  around  the  old  (Celtic  and  Norse  traditions  and  the  beauty  of  the  \nlandscape) and the new (TT races and the excitement of the modern). Most \nimportantly, however, these representations did not collide, as might have \nbeen  expected,  but  came  to  sit  alongside  each  other  harmoniously,  as  \nidentifiers of the Isle of Man and components of Manx identity.  \nAs Tony Mason proposes, “sport often  contributes  to  an  enhancement  \nof  the  individual’s  sense  of  identity  with  or  belonging  to  a  group  or  \ncollectivity. It can be district, village, town, city or country. It can be class, \ncolour or country.”\nͳͶ\n That certainly is the case with respect to the TT and \nManx  identity.  Anderson  has  famously  described  nations  as  “imagined  \ncommunities” in which large and dispersed populations are led to a sense \nof commonality by especially the media.\nͳͷ\n In the case of the TT or the Isle \nof Man, the sources used in this study certainly show that the Manx press \ndid  advertise  the  TT  as  a  matter  of  common  interest.  However,  in  other  \nrespects the small space of the island through most of which a 37 ¾ mile \nroad  race  circuit  runs  makes  the  TT  pretty  inescapable  as  a  bonding  \nexperience for a population which has never topped 80,000. Moreover, as \nnoted,  the  year-round  unavoidable  remembrance  of  the  TT  along  those  \npublic  roads  and  in  the  grandstand  in  Douglas  did  much  to  insert  the  TT  \ninto  Manx  consciousness,  along  the  lines  suggested  by  Billig’s  thesis  on  \n“banal nationalism.”\nͳ͸\n  \nSmith  and  Porter  state  in  their  introduction  to  Sport  and  National  \nIdentity  in  the  Post-war  World  that  “the  idea,  for  example,  that  sport  in  \ngeneral, or one sport in particular, creates or fosters a senses of nationhood \nis   important,   not   least   because   international   competition   creates   a   \nseemingly  endless  number  of  occasions  where  nations  are  embodied  in  \nsomething   manifestly   real   and   visible.”\nͳ͹\n However,   Manx   riders \ncompeting  in  the  TT  do  not  embody  Manx  national  identity.  There  are  \nManx riders, and the success of Manx born rider Tom Sheard in the 1923 \nTT was celebrated, but there is not a national Manx team, embodying the \nManx  nation.  Nor  were  there,  or  indeed  are  there,  national  teams  from  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n14\n T.

Much  was  made  of  the  success  of  British  motorcycles,  or  US,  \nItalian,   German   and   later   Japanese   motorcycles,   but   it   was   the   \nmanufacturers  who  were  more  celebrated  than  their  home  countries.  \nTherefore the TT did not embody other nations either. The Isle of Man is \nthe  only  winner  in  terms  of  national  identity.  In  fact  only  the  national  \nidentity of the Isle of Man is expressed and endorsed by the TT. Moreover, \nrather than the Isle of Man being embodied by the TT, it is because the TT \nis consumed  internally  and  externally  that  it  has  become  an  ingredient  in  \nthe  construction  of  a  Manx  identity.  The  island  is  famous  as  a  venue  for  \nmotorcycle  racing.  It  is  true  that  Wembley  stadium  is  famous  as  a  venue  \nfor  international  football  matches.  Hill  and  Varrasi,  in  a  1997  article,  \ndefined  Wembley  as  a  national  monument:  “it  in  fact  became  a  synonym  \nfor English  football  and  something  of  an  icon  of  Englishness:  its  twin  \ntowers were readily identified by millions as a mark of identity, almost as \nfamiliar as Big Ben.”\nͳ ͅ\n Wembley stadium has become clearly identifiable \nas  the  English  home  of  football.  Likewise,  Monaco  is  the  venue  for  the  \nMonaco Grand Prix, and Singapore has recently become the venue for the \nfirst  nighttime  Formula  One  race.\nͳͻ\n  These  are  certainly  internationally  \nrecognised  venues  where  sporting  events  take  place.  None,  however,  can  \nmarket themselves the same way that the Isle of Man projects itself as the \nvenue  for  a  unique  international  motorcycle  road  race.  The  sport  and  the  \nplace   embrace   each   other   and   constitute   a   distinctive   element   in   a   \nprojected national identity consumed inside and outside the Isle of Man.  \n The study of sport therefore enables us to examine politics, economics \nand the construction and consumption of a national identity. We have also \nseen that when a sport becomes embedded in a sense-of-self it is difficult \nfor  it  to  be  given  up,  much  like  the  Spanish  and  their  bullfighting.\nʹͲ\n \nUndoubtedly  the  TT  causes  inconvenience  to  the  Manx  people,  but  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n18\n  J.  Hill  and  F.  Varrasi,  ‘Creating  Wembley:  The  Construction  of  a  National  \nMonument, The  Sports  Historian,  No.  17  (1997),  p.40.  The  original  Wembley  \nstadium  was  demolished  in  2003  and  the  rebuilt  stadium  opened  in  2007.  The  \n‘twin towers’ a feature that made Wembley easily identifiable were replaced by a \ngigantic  steel  arch.  Hill  and  Varrasi,  stated  at  the  end  of  their  article  that  ‘in  the  \nimminent,  end  of  century  re-building  of  Wembley  the  towers  are  to  remain,  the  \nonly vestiges of the original structure. Thus an artefact designed to commemorate \nnineteenth-century empire will survive into the world of the twenty-first century’. \nPerhaps unfortunately, this commitment was subsequently abandoned.  \n19\n An idea of the promotion of these events can be seen at www.visitmonaco.com \nand www.visitsingapore.com.  \n20\n  For  further  comment  on  this  ‘sport’  see  T.

The TT has been the subject of criticism from outside because of the \ndanger that comes with racing motorcycles around the Isle of Man, but the \nTT  is  sustained  because  it  is  a  distinctive  part  of  Manx  identity.  The  TT  \nhas thus become so far ingrained in a Manx sense-of-self that if the event \nwere to be ended, this would not just mean the loss of a “sport”, or the loss \nof  the  economic  rewards  brought  by  the  TT.  If  the  TT  were  abandoned  a  \ndistinctive  part  of  the  island’s  identity  would  be  lost,  an  ingredient  that  \nhas, in the past and still in the present, set the island apart from not just the \nUK  but  also  the  rest  of  the  world.

For  the  reasons  discussed  herein,  and  because  of  recent  \ndevelopments such as the staging of a “green” TT, at the time of writing it \nis difficult to see the TT coming to an end; there can be little doubt that the \nTT continues to be supported by the Manx, and thus would continue to be \nstaged on the Isle of Man."

      "q": "The  T.T.  races  “had  been  much  maligned”,  possibly  as  a  result  \nof the danger associated with the event, but it was “indisputable that they \ntransformed  the  primitive  motorcycle  from  a  flimsy  toy  into  a  well  nigh  \nperfect  two  wheeler,  in  which  it  [was]  impossible  to  fault  any  feature  \nessential for safety.”\n47\n In Ixion’s mind then, there were definite advantages \nto  be  had  from  competing  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  As  mentioned  earlier,  after  \neach  TT  meeting  was  finished  motorcycle  magazines  would  offer  reports  \nof the races and comment on the success of the TT in their editorials and \nalso  include  articles  commenting  on  the  technical  developments  achieved  \nby  racing  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  For  example,  a  1951  editorial  in  Motor \nCycling stated that: \nCollectively  the  races  again  served  their  primary  purpose  by  disclosing  \nwhere  further  development  is  necessary.  The  chain  trouble  experienced  \nsuggests the time has come when, in fairness to the producers, this type of \ntransmission must be improved with efficient lubrication – and that implies \nenclosure  in  light  cases,  possibly  made  of  plastic  materials.  Such  a  \ndevelopment   would   be   of   direct   benefit   to   everyday   motorcyclists.   \nSimilarly   the   tyre,   sparking   plug   and   magneto   manufacturers   gained   \nvaluable data, whilst theories on the construction of ultra-light frames were \nproved in some instances and disproved in others.\n48\nThis   comment   might   be   fairly   difficult   for   the   non-motorcyclist   to   \nunderstand, and it is not made clear exactly what knowledge sparking plug \nand   magneto   manufacturers   had   taken   from   the   event,   but   it   does   \ndemonstrate  that  amongst  the  motorcycling  community  and  especially  in  \nthe  motorcycle  press,  there  was  an  interest  in  the  purpose  of  the  TT  as  a  \ntesting ground. It was not just an event designed to discover who could get \nround  the  Isle  of  Man  in  the  fastest  time.  Indeed,  this  attitude  was  \nsustained in a 1953 article in The Motor Cycle, which considered in more \ndetail the technical developments on display in the 1953 event: \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n46\n Ixion, Cavalcade, p.140. \n47\n Ixion, Cavalcade, p.140. \n48\n Motor Cycling, 14 June 1951. \nGoing Global: The Growth of Capitalist Support \n157\nAn  unorthodox  three-cylinder  two  stroke;  a  transverse  four  of  only  350  \nc.c.;  oil  cooling  of  the  exhaust  valve;  ignition  by  battery  and  coil;  a  three  \nvalve   cylinder   head;   quickly   adjustable   hydraulic   damping   on   rear   \nsuspensions;  variety  in  front  fork  design;  wider  use  of  two-leading-shoe  \nbrakes; these, and others less obvious, are among the wealth of interesting \nfeatures  of  this  year’s  Isle  of  Man  machines.  The  classic  series  of  T.T.  \nRaces continues to serve its function as a testing ground to stimulate design \nand development.\n49\nOnce  again  we  can  see  certain  technical  developments  were  the  result  of  \nracing in the TT. Indeed, TT programmes also noted that the TT continued \nto  be  an  event  which  would  further  the  design  of  the  motorcycle.  An  \narticle  in  the  1952  TT  programme,  written  by  the  editor  of  The  Motor  \nCycle stated that: \nBetter  chains,  more  rigid  brake  drums,  better  friction  materials  for  brakes  \nand  clutches,  improved  steels  for  a  variety  of  components,  especially  \nrockers,  valves,  springs  and  gears,  more  efficient  speaking  plugs  and  \nignition equipment, better tyres; all owe their development, in part at least, \nto the stimulus of the endless quest for success in the T.T. and other races. \nRacing  is  a  hard  task  master.  It  brings  proud  success  and  disappointing  \nfailures.  But  racing  never  ceases  to  have  its  lessons  that  mean  so  much  in  \nthe evolution of finer motor cycles.\n50\nDespite  the  benefits  of  racing  that  were  pointed  out  in  the  motorcycle  \npress, not all manufacturers would send teams to the Isle of Man. \nThe   Clubman’s   TT   was   used   by   the   ACU   to   help   secure   the   \ncontinuation  of  the  financial  grant  from  the  Manx  government.  It  was  \nstated  by  the  ACU  that  this  race  would  “improve  their  [the  TT  races]  \nattractiveness and popularity.”\n51\n The Union said it was anxious to interest \na  larger  number  of  manufacturers  in  the  TT  and  were  introducing  an  \nentirely new type of race. The proposed new race was the Clubman’s TT, \nwhich  would  be  four  laps  of  the  course.  The  Secretary  of  the  ACU  \nbelieved   that   “a   ready-made   opportunity   was   afforded   to   the   trade   \ngenerally  to  take  a  close  interest  in  the  Isle  of  Man  circuit  by  the  \nintroduction  of  the  Clubman’s  races.”\n52\n  Entries  were  to  be  made  by  \nmotorcycle club members, not by manufacturers, and the machines would \nbe fully equipped stock machines, with slight improvements, but still with \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n49\n Motor Cycle, 11 June 1953.  \n50\n H. Louis, ‘Technical Development and the TT’, 1952 TT Programme, p. 27.  \n51\n Further Report, 1947, p. 3. \n52\n Huggett, ‘The Post-War Races’, p. 24.  \nChapter Seven \n158\nthe qualities of an ordinary touring motorcycle.\n53\n In the regulations for this \nrace it was stated that: \nA driver must not be, or have been, a manufacturer or registered dealer or \nsub-dealer for the particular make of motor cycle to be driven in the race at \nany time during the twelve months immediately preceding the closing date \nfor  entries,  nor  may  he  be,  or  during  a  similar  period  have  been,  in  the  \nemploy of such manufacturer, registered dealer or sub-dealer.\n54\nThis  was  an  important  development  especially  when  the  comments  of  \nHuggett  (see  above)  are  taken  into  account.  The  Clubman’s  TT  ran  \nbetween  1947  and  1956  and  was  aimed  at  private  entrants  who  had  no  \ndirect  association  with  the  motorcycle  trade,  but  they  were  riding  shop-\nbought motorcycles. The entry form also testifies to the different nature of \nthe  event  especially  in  comparison  to  the  standard  TT  entry  form  which  \nshows that modifications could not be made to motorcycles, and that riders \nin  the  Clubman’s  TT  must  be  amateurs,  unattached  to  a  manufacturer’s  \nteam.  This  shows  that  the  TT  was  not  only  popular  amongst  motorcycle  \nmanufacturers  as  a  testing  ground  for  their  products  but  also  for  private  \nentries,  or  enthusiastic  motorcyclists  wanting  to  try  their  hand  at  racing  \naround  the  TT  course.  However,  there  was  more  to  it.  Manufacturers’  \nmachines  would  still  be  publicised  in  the  results  of  each  race  and  so  \nsuccess and reliability were still important issues, and even more so since \nmotorcycles  raced  would  be  similar  to  production  cycles.  Manufacturers  \nmight, as was the case with Geoff Duke and Norton, take a rider from the \nClubman’s TT and give them a place on their team.  \nBritish  manufacturers,  such  as  Norton,  Triumph  and  BSA,  enjoyed  \nmixed success in the TT during the post-war period. Norton continued the \nsuccess it had first achieved in 1907, which was due much to the prowess \nof  Geoff  Duke.  Triumph,  however,  was  not  so  successful.  In  February  \n1948  Triumph  released  the  500  c.c.  “Grand  Prix”,  which  was  a  racing  \nmotorcycle;  its  success  in  the  TT  was  limited.  Each  of  the  six  Triumph  \nGrand  Prix  motorcycles  entered  in  the  1948  TT  retired.  In  1949  only  two  \nof thirteen finished the race. The Grand Prix model has been described as \nbeing  obsolete  by  1950,  and  by  1951  with  only  two  senior  TT  entries  it  \nwas  dead.  This  may  have  led  to  the  dissatisfaction  with  the  TT  expressed  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n53\n Further Report, 1947, p. 3. \n54\n  These  regulations  were  included  in  Government  Office  File  R2701/1/2,  Tourist \nTrophy Races 1952.  \nGoing Global: The Growth of Capitalist Support \n159\nby Triumph’s managing director.\n55\n BSA had not been successful in the TT \nraces  during  the  inter-war  period,  but  the  company  dominated  the  market  \nin the post-war period, and was especially successful in the Clubman’s TT. \nThe organisers of the Clubman’s TT had hoped to attract a wide range of \ndifferent  brands.  However,  BSA’s  domination  of  the  event,  with  BSAs  \neventually  taking  up  the  majority  of  the  entries,  meant  the  purpose  of  the  \nrace  was  lost,  and  eventually,  after  1956,  it  was  removed  from  the  TT  \nprogramme.\n56\n  However,  other  TT  races  still  continued  and  manufacturers  \nwere  still  able  to  use  the  event  as  a  showcase  for  their  products,  as  the  \nfollowing section will demonstrate.  \nBy the beginning of 1954 Honda, the Japanese motorcycle manufacturer \nhad been established for around five years. In March 1954 Soichiro Honda \nhad made the decision to enter the Isle of Man TT races:  \nNow  that  we  are  equipped  with  a  production  system  in  which  I  have  \nabsolute confidence, the time of opportunity has arrived. I have reached \nthe firm decision to enter the TT Races next year.  \nNever before has a Japanese entered this race with a motorcycle made in \nJapan. It goes without saying that the winner of this race will be known \nacross the globe, but the same is also true for any vehicle that completes \nthe  entire  race  safely.  It  is  said,  therefore,  that  the  fame  of  such  an  \nachievement  will  assure  a  certain  volume  of  exports,  and  that  is  why  \nevery  major  manufacturer  in  Germany,  England,  Italy,  and  France  is  \nconcentrating on preparations with all its might\n.\n57\nHonda clearly identified that in order for their motorcycles to be improved \nthey  needed  to  compete  against  the  best  manufacturers  and  at  the  best  \nmotorcycle race in the world. Honda viewed the TT as a test bed for their \nmachines, but was also quick to note the international nature of the event. \nBy  the  end  of  1958  the  Honda  Motor  Company  was  Japan’s  biggest  \nmotorcycle  maker.  It  had  3,000  employees,  a  high-speed  test  track  and  \nwas  gearing  up  to  enter  the  European  and  American  markets.  It  is  not  \ndifficult to see that entry into the TT would be of great importance.  \nBetween 1959 and the late 1960s Honda took their first steps towards \nsuccess  in  the  TT.  Honda  entered  the  TT  for  the  first  time  in  1959  and  \nafter  some  initial  confusion  regarding  the  rules  of  some  race  categories  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n55\n  H.

The Japanese were \nmeticulous  in  their  preparation,  even  filming  a  coin  on  the  road  to  record  \nthe  state  of  the  track’s  surface.  A  correspondent  from  the  Motor  Cycle \nreported, “I was very impressed by [their] bike. It was fantastically fast for \na one-two-five. I could see from the way the team were going about things \nthat  they  meant  business.  But  some  of  my  press  colleagues  didn’t  take  \nHonda  seriously  in  the  early  days  and  there  was  still  some  anti-Japanese  \nfeeling   around.”\n58\n   In   1959   four   machines   were   entered,   under   the   \nmanagement  of  Kiyoshi  Kawashima  and  Honda  motorcycles  came  sixth,  \nseventh, eighth and eleventh in the 125cc lightweight class. They also won \nthe manufacturers’ team award. Following this early success, Honda lifted \nits  first  winner’s  trophy  at  the  Isle  of  Man  TT  in  1961  when  Mike  \nHailwood was victorious in the 125cc and 250cc races. By now it was not \njust   Japanese   riders   riding   Honda’s   motorcycles.   The   brand   was   \nrepresented by Mike Hailwood, most significantly, but also by riders such \nas  the  Swiss  Lugi  Taveri,  the  Rhodesian  Jim  Redman  and  the  Scottish  \nrider  Bob  McIntyre.  By  1966,  Honda  was  represented  in  all  classes  –  50,  \n125, 250, 350, and 500cc.  \nHonda  dominated  the  world-series  in  the  1960s,  winning  not  just  on  \nthe  Isle  of  Man  but  in  other  European  events  as  well,  but  despite  early  \nsuccess,  between  1967  and  1977  Honda  sent  no  production  team  to  the  \nTT.  The  brand’s  representation  at  the  event  rested  on  the  success  on  \nstandard motorcycles. Honda did return in 1977, to an event that was now \ncalled  the  “Formula  TT”  established  after  the  Isle  of  Man  was  removed  \nfrom the World Championship circuit following the refusal of many of the \ntop riders, like Barry Sheene, to compete on the Isle of Man. Honda would \ngo  from  strength  to  strength  during  the  1980s  and  1990s,  and  the  TT  \nwould  see  the  emergence  of  two  of  its  greatest  riders:  Joey  Dunlop  and  \nSteve  Hislop.  Today,  Honda  is  very  recognisable  at  the  event  and  five  \nyears ago celebrated 50 years of TT racing (2009). Honda has provided a \nnumber  of  “star”  riders.  Looking  down  the  list  of  results,  one  sees  a  \nnumber of Japanese manufacturers – Honda, Suzuki, Yamaha for example. \nThe TT has become a truly international competition.  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n58\n M.  Duckworth, Realising  the  Dream  at  the  TT,  (Ramsey,  Lily  Publications,  \n2009), p. 23. \nGoing Global: The Growth of Capitalist Support \n161\nAdvertising and the TT \nDuring the post-war period, after wartime restrictions were lifted, there \nwas  a  considerable  rise  in  advertising  expenditure,  from  £76  million  in  \n1947  to  £323  million  in  1960.\n59\n  Nevett  suggests  that  between  1952  and  \n1954 the expansion of advertising began with the lifting of restrictions on, \nfor example, food, confectionary products and petrol. He further suggests \nthat  growth  in  one  area  stimulated  demand  in  another,  for  example  the  \nincrease  in  house  building  stimulated  demand  for  furnishings.\n60\n Also,  as \nnoted  by  Clarke  earlier,  the  popularity  of  motorcycles  was  growing  and  \nthus we might suggest advertising plays a bigger role in their marketing.  \nIt  was  also  noted  earlier  that  there  was  a  rise  in  the  consumption  of  \nsport  during  the  inter-war  years,  measured  by  the  growing  amount  of  \nmoney spent on watching sport and gambling on sport. The post-war years \nsaw a continuation of this trend.\n61\n This was despite a decline in newspaper \ncoverage of sport, between 1947 and 1951. The Times, which had devoted \n21 per cent of news space to the coverage of sport between 1937 and 1939, \nnow only set aside sixteen per cent. The Daily  Mail, 36 per cent between \n1937  and  1939,  now  only  set  aside  33  per  cent  and  The Daily  Mirror, 36 \nper  cent  between  1937  and  1939,  now  allotted  only  24  per  cent  of  space.  \nThese  figures  were  reduced  despite  a  rise  in  circulation  or  the  evident  \nsustained interest in sport to consumers.\n62\nIxion  pointed  out  that  “the  motor  industries  are  fiercely  competitive,  \nand  their  success  is  very  largely  based  on  shrewd  publicity.”\n63\n In  1951  a \njournalist writing for The Motor Cycle and Cycle Trader commented, “one \nis apt to think of the TT as a sporting event that the trade happens to find \nworthwhile  to  patronise.  But  it  is  more  accurate  to  consider  it  as  a  trade  \nevent that happens to be of a sporting character...The ultimate purpose of \nthe [race] meeting is the sale of motor cycles.”\n64\n To an extent this was an \naccurate  assessment  of  the  value  of  the  TT  to  motorcycle  manufacturers,  \nand  also  manufacturers  of  other  products,  such  as  tyres,  spark  plugs  and  \nbrake.  Motorcycle  manufacturers  continued  to  use  the  publicity  gained  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n59\n T.R.

Koerner does, however, suggest \nthat  motorcycle  sport  had  two  practical  functions.  First,  races  provided  \ncommercial   opportunities   –   allowing   advertising   and   increasing   the   \nprestige of British motorcycles in foreign markets. According to an article \nin Export  Trader  “past  racing  successes  have  done  much  to  build  and  \nmaintain the supremacy of the British sports motor cycle, and its racebred \nprecision  has  brought  it  admirers  in  every  overseas  country.”\n65\n Second, \nraces  acted  as  a  forum  for  research  and  development  and  the  race-track  \nprovided   the   perfect   environment   on   which   to   perfect   design   and   \nmechanical reliability.\n66\n Improvements in design and reliability still had to \nbe demonstrated to the public, and one way to do this was by advertising \nsuccess in the TT.  \nAgain, advertisements in the motorcycle press, demonstrate the use of \nsuccess  at  the  TT  to  advertise  motorcycles  and  motorcycle  accessories.  \nWithin these advertisements, whilst emphasis placed on achievement was \nstill  evident,  we  can  see  the  development  of  more  visual  advertisements  \nusing  images  of  the  Isle  of  Man  and  TT  riders,  of  increased  use  of  the  \nriders’  names  and  of  the  coming  together  of  accessories  and  motorcycle  \nbrands  in  a  single  advertisement  for  instance  a  certain  tyre  to  relate  to  a  \ncertain   machine.   Advertisements   for   Dunlop   tyres,   for   instance   and   \nsuggest that “Dunlop leads the way again!” and states that this is “the tyre \nwith  a  background  of  leadership.”  We  immediately  see  a  difference  in  \npromotion  from  the  inter-war  period.  The  artwork  presents  a  large  “TT”,  \ndrawing  the  reader  to  assume  that  this  success  was  achieved  at  the  1947  \nTT,  overlying  an  image  of  the  Isle  of  Man.  Similar  adverts  drew  on  the  \nachievements  of  riders  such  as  Firth,  Foster  and  Bell  in  the  1948  TT  to  \npromote  the  quality  of  Dunlop  tyres,  and  others  promoted  Dunlop’s  \nachievement in what is “the Toughest Test”, pointing to 190 successes and \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n65\n Export  Trader,  June  1947,  p.  167  as  quoted  in  Koerner,  ‘The  British  Motor  \nCycle Industry 1935 – 1975’.  \n66\n S.

It \ndraws  on  the  achievement  of  particular  riders,  but  also  places  the  Isle  of  \nMan  and  the  TT  together  by  placing  the  “Three  Legs  of  Man”  on  the  \nmotorcycles  in  place  of  the  rider’s  number.  The  role  played  by  Lucas  \nMagnetos  in  the  victories  of  TT  riders  is  also  evident  in  advertising.  For  \nexample,  the  success  of  John  Surtees  in  the  1959  Junior  TT  using  the  \nimage  of  the  crowds  gathering  at  the  finish  line,  and  the  slogan  “Taking  \nthe Flag.”  \nOnce again we can see that in each of these advertisements there is no \nneed to stipulate that these accomplishments were achieved on the Isle of \nMan,  as  was  similarly  the  case  during  the  inter-war  period.  TT  races  are  \nsimply referred to as “Junior TT” or “Senior TT”, and not the “Isle of Man \nJunior  TT.”  We  can  see  that  achievement  in  the  TT  continued  to  be  \nprevalent  in  advertising  motorcycles  and  motorcycle  accessories.  This  \nangle  had  developed  during  the  inter-war  period  and  continued  to  be  \nimportant in the post-war period but by then there was more extensive use \nof images of the Isle of Man and of TT riders, and more extensive use of \nriders’ names.  \nThe emergence of TT “Celebrity” \nWe  have  seen  above  that  there  was  particular  use  of  the  names  of  \naccomplished  TT  riders  in  advertising  during  the  post-war  period.  This  \nleads  into  a  discussion  of  celebrity  and  its  relationship  to  the  Isle  of  Man  \nTT.  Celebrity  endorsement  makes  products  more  attractive  because  it  \nhelps  create  an  image  of  success.  In  the  modern  day  the  celebrity  and  \nindeed  the  sports  celebrity  have  become  a  part  of  everyday  life  and,  as  \nPringle  proposes,  when  “we  watch  movie  stars  on  the  screen  or  great  \nsportsmen  on  the  pitch  we  are  in  awe  of  them  but  we  also  get  to  know  \nthem. We learn about their capabilities and their characters.”\n68\n Businesses \nchoose a celebrity to promote their product because “in choosing a star to \nbe  associated  with,  the  advertiser  is  attempting  to  gain  instant  fame,  for  \nsome of the glitz and glamour to rub off on their brand and to acquire by \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n67\n  B.

This  section  will  readdress  this  issue,  and  \nexplore  it  further.  Today  sportspersons  are  widely  involved  in  selling  a  \nwide range of products to the consumer, from watches to crisps, and from \nrazors to bank accounts.\n70\n It is easy to pick up a book and read about how \nan accomplished sportsperson has achieved such a level of success. Indeed \nit is difficult, if not impossible, to pick up a newspaper or a magazine and \nnot  see  sports  people  advertising  one  product  or  another.  Indeed,  in  \ntoday’s  sporting  events  promotional  logos  for  all  sorts  of  products  are  \nplaced on the motor cars and motorcycles, in Formula One and at the TT. \nThis  is  a  practice  that  has  developed  over  the  last  50  years.  Today’s  \nFormula  One  drivers,  footballers,  golfers,  cricketers,  tennis  players  -  and  \nthe list continues - are not just celebrities in their own sports and amongst \ntheir  own  sports  fans  but  to  a  global  audience.  This  might  not  yet  be  the  \ncase  for  riders  in  the  Isle  of  Man  TT,  but  they  are  still  celebrities  at  least  \namongst  the  TT  community.  Indeed,  perhaps  as  a  foretaste,  shortly  after  \nthe  2007  TT  John  McGuinness’s  success  in  setting  a  new  record  average  \nspeed of 130 mph was used to advertise Honda motorcycles in the Sunday \nTimes Magazine.\n71\n This section will ask how far riders such as Geoff Duke \nwere  created,  and  indeed  commercially  exploited,  as  TT  celebrities.  The  \nnames  of  other  TT  riders  are  included  in  advertising  from  the  1950s,  but  \namong them it is Geoff Duke who remains the most famous.  \nThe  concluding  sentence  of  Geoff  Duke’s  biography  on  the  Isle  of  \nMan TT website reads: “as legends and heroes go, they don’t come much \ngreater  than  Geoff  Duke.”\n72\n  This  official  TT  website  lists  an  extensive  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n69\n Pringle, Celebrity Sells, p. xxiv. \n70\n ‘A Hundred Years of Sport and Advertising’, Telegraph, 26 Feb. 2008.  \n71\n  While  it  is  difficult  to  find  literature  focusing  specifically  on  the  history  of  \ncelebrity,  it  is  clear  that  images  created  through  the  use  of  celebrities  to  advertise  \nproducts  is  a  campaign  particularly  well  used  in  the  advertising  world.

Yet  he  is  still  a  \nvery  well-known  rider.  Duke’s  career  is  impressive.  His  success  in  the  \nClubman’s  TT  in  1949  paved  the  way  for  further  achievement  during  the  \n1950s,  when  he  rode  for  Norton  and  then  the  Italian  Gilera  firm.  He  was  \nthe  first  rider  to  wear  one-piece  leathers,  which  became  a  distinguishing  \nmark. He also won the Seagrave Trophy in 1951, Sportsman of the Year in \n1952\n73\n and he was awarded an MBE in 1953, a year celebrated also for the \nQueen’s Coronation, the ascent of Everest by Hilary and Tensing and the \nso called Stanley Matthews Cup Final. He recorded the first 100 mph lap \nof the TT course in 1955. After retiring, Duke would become a member of \nthe  Isle  of  Man’s  Tourist  Board  Race  Committee  and  he  played  a  part  in  \nthe    discussion    surrounding    the    future    of    the    TT    when    World    \nChampionship  status  was  threatened  in  the  mid-1970s.\n74\n I  was  also \nreminded  of  his  success  and  popularity  by  the  presence  of  a  1976  \nadvertisement  in  The  Isle  of  Man  Weekly  Times  that  used  an  image  of  \nGeoff  Duke  to  promote  the  Whitestone  Garage  Ltd.  and  the  Volkswagon  \nPolo with the slogan “Geoff Duke does a lap and a half...easy!” \nDuring  his  career  the  motorcycle  press  praised  Duke’s  talent  and  \nachievement.  A  1950  editorial  in  Motor  Cycling  commented  on  Duke’s  \nvictory  that  year,  when  he  was  riding  for  the  Norton  team  in  the  Senior  \nTT:  “The  1950  series”,  it  stated,  “will  always  be  remembered  for  Duke’s  \neffortless   Senior   victory.”   This   article   went   further   to   suggest   that   \n“arguments  have  raged,  and  will  continue  to  do  so,  as  to  whether  Alec  \nBennett,  Jimmy  Simpson,  Walter  Handley,  Tim  Hunt,  Stanley  Woods  or  \nJimmy  Guthrie  was  the  finest  T.T.  rider  of  all  time,  but  there  are  now  \nmany  who  believe  the  new  star  will  eventually  be  awarded  that  title  \nwithout equivocation.”\n75\n Indeed, one does not readily remember the names \nStanley  Woods,  Jimmy  Guthrie  or  Walter  Handley  unless  you  are  an  \nardent  TT  fan,  but  many  people  will  have  an  idea  of  who  Geoff  Duke  is.  \nSuch was the popularity of Duke during the 1950s that a reduction in the \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n73\n M.

An editorial in Motor Cycling stated that “as to the \nInternational events, it is perhaps too early to try to plumb all the reasons \nfor  the  falling  off  of  popularity,  though  three  major  causes  appear  to  be  \nobvious:  (a)  a  plethora  of  races  on  the  mainland:  (b)  times  are  getting  \nharder and, (c) no Geoff Duke.” The suggestion was put forward that “as \nGeoff and the Gilera ‘Fours’ would have competed on the Friday only it is \nperhaps not fair to ascribe all the downward drop in visitors to their non-\nappearance. It seems fairly certain, however, that the staggering falling off \nin  ‘Senior’  excursionists  can  be  generally  attributed  to  Geoff’s  absence  \nfrom the races. From all quarters it is reported that the ‘Stanley Matthews \nof  motorcycling’  is  the  man  the  crowds  will  pay  to  see”  [Emphasis  \nadded].\n76\n  This  comment  is  clearly  in  praise  of  Duke’s  sporting  prowess,  \nespecially in the likening of him to Stanley Matthews, the footballing hero \nof  the  1950s  whose  popularity  leads  one  sports  historian  to  conclude  that  \n“rarely  have  so  many  been  entertained  so  richly  by  a  solitary  football  \nplayer.”\n77\n  In  the  motorcycle  press  Duke  was  placed  on  the  same  level  of  \nsporting achievement.  \nGeoff Duke was perhaps not the “household name” that Hill describes \nCompton  to  have  become.  The  fact  that  Denis  Compton  can  be  so  easily  \nreferred  to  as  “Brylcreem  Boy”  demonstrates  his  profile  outside  football  \nand  cricket.\n78\n  He  might  be  seen  as  one  of  the  earliest  examples  of  a  \nsportsman  being  used  to  advertise  a  non-sporting  product.  However,  the  \nsame  cannot  be  said  of  Duke.  Walker  states,  “there  is  little  doubt  ...  that  \nGeoff  Duke  could,  equally,  have  reached  the  very  top  in  not  only  road  \nracing, but trials and scrambling (motocross). In fact, he can very well lay \nclaim to being the most successful all-rounder motor cycle sport has ever \nseen.”\n79\n    Predominantly    advertisements    featuring    Duke    are    only    \nadvertisements  for  motorcycles,  motorcars  or  related  products.

Duke  is  given  prominence  in  advertisements  for  \nNorton,  and  “Lucas  Ignition”  in  which  the  success  of,  as  well  as  his  new  \n“record  speed  and  record  lap”  are  drawn  upon.  A  1954  advertisement  for  \nCastrol  draws  on  Duke’s  success  in  the  Italian  Grand  Prix  on  an  Italian  \nmotorcycle.  This  is  an  advertisement  for  Castrol,  with  whom  Duke  had  a  \ncontract,   which   demonstrates   that   his   name   was   used   not   only   in   \nassociation with the Isle of Man TT but also with other motorcycle races.\n80\nAnother  Castrol  advertisement  significantly  includes  a  photograph  of  \nDuke,  with  the  advice  “It’s  risky  to  just  ask  for  ‘oil’  I  say  Castrol.”  \nConsumers  were  not  presented  only  with  the  name  of  a  successful  rider,  \nbut also with an instantly recognisable image. Denis Compton was used to \nsell  Brylcreem,  and  by  doing  so  he  lent  the  image  of  a  successful  \nsportsman  to  the  product  and  increased  its  desirability.  By  using  Castrol  \nmotorcyclists would be using the same oil as a six-time World Champion \nand successful TT rider.  \nBoorstin points out that the “the celebrity is a person who is known for \nhis   well-knowness”   but   that   “the   hero   was   distinguished   by   his   \nachievement.”  Geoff  Duke  might  be  seen  as  a  TT  celebrity.  He  still  \nattends  the  event  and  was  a  focal  point  in  the  centenary  celebrations  in  \n2007.  Yet,  during  the  1950s  he  was  also  hero  at  least  to  motorcyclists,  \ndistinguished  by  his  achievements,  as  were  other  riders  featured  in  TT-\nrelated advertisements. In Sport and Identity in the North of England, Holt \npoints to the cricketers, the footballers and the rugby league players in the \n“north”  who  might  be  viewed  as  northern  sporting  heroes.\n81\n Duke  was, \nand  remains,  one  of  the  most  well-known  TT  riders,  and  he  was  a  \n“northerner”,  from  St.  Helens,  who  enjoyed  considerable  success  in  this  \ninternational event, and other motor sports events, whose image was used \nin  advertising  and  who  members  of  the  motorcycling  community  hugely  \nrespected. Indeed, Duke, who raced in his last TT in 1959, is even pointed \nto  as  a  sporting  champion  on  Manchester  UK,  a  virtual  encyclopedia  of  \ngreater  Manchester.\n82\n  He  is  one  of  seven  sports  celebrities  alongside  \nAndrew   Flintoff   (cricketer),   Ricky   Hatton   (boxer),   Paula   Radcliffe   \n(athlete), David Lloyd (cricketer), Stanley Matthews (footballer) and Billy \nNevett (jockey).

For  example  the  1956  British  Railways  \nHoliday Guide described the island in the following way: \nIn  many  superficial  ways  you  can  match  the  Island  to  England.  Yet  it  is  \nnever  wholly  England,  for  its  roots  are  not  the  same  ...  It  has  queer  \nsuperstitions, dealing for instance with the herring trade which was once its \nmain  industry,  and  with  the  rowan  in  whose  mystic  power  the  Norsemen  \nbelieved.  It  remembers  its  witchcraft,  its  mermaids,  its  water-bulls,  its  \nfairies, folksongs and prophecies. It remembers from very ancient times its \nKing-wizard,  Mannanan,  who  in  the  clearest  weather  could  protect  it  \nagainst invaders by sudden mist.\n1\nHere  we  have  a  description  that  focuses  on  the  more  traditional  indeed  \nmythical aspects of the island’s past. Consideration is given to the island’s \nfolklore,  but  most  importantly  stress  is  placed  on  the  island’s  difference  \nfrom  England.  The  TT,  however,  did  not  have  a  place  in  this  brief  \ndescription  of  the  island  and  in  fact  this  representation  went  on  to  focus  \nfurther on the Norse ingredients of the island’s identity: “On Tynwald Hill \nthe parliament of Manxland is held annually; this is a relic of Norse rule, \nand is the only ceremony of its kind to outlast a thousand years.”\n2\n Further \nto this, the 1947 Isle of Man: Footpath Guide noted that “no conspectus of \nthe  Island,  however,  brief,  would  be  complete  without  a  reference  to  the  \nManx  Arms  and  the  Manx  cat,  which  with  the  Great  Wheel...are  among  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n British  Railways  Holiday  Guide  1956,  (Railway  Executive,  1956),  p.  231.

This  was  a  fusion  of  the  two  rival  place-\nmyths  that  emerged  during  the  inter-war  period.  The  old  and  new  are  \nencompassed   in   the   first   chapter   of   Maxwell   Fraser’s   In   Praise   of   \nManxland,  which  is  titled  “The  Island  Where  Yesterday  Meets  Today.”\n4\nHer  book,  after  introducing  the  Isle  of  Man,  describes  the  island’s  towns,  \nvillages  and  places  of  interest  in  clearly  marked  chapters.  It  is  somewhat  \nsurprising  then  that  the  opening  description  of  the  Isle  of  Man  is  the  \nfollowing: \nMany people associate only three things with the Isle of Man: tailless cats, \ncrowds  of  holiday  makers,  and  the  T.T.  Motor-Cycle  Races.  Only  those  \nwho have visited the island – and by that is meant those who have explored \nits  country-side  and  not  merely  stayed  in  Douglas  –realize  that  within  its  \nnarrow limits the Isle of Man has scenery comparable with the finest to be \nfound  in  the  British  Isles,  with  a  background  of  history  and  tradition  as  \ndifferent from that of England as if it were a foreign country.\n5\nFraser immediately made clear the contrasting place-myths in evidence \non  the  Isle  of  Man.  She  goes  on  further  to  describe  aspects  of  the  island,  \nand  writes  about  the  island’s  natural  scenery,  its  folklore,  customs  and  \nhistory  and  integrated  into  this  description  is  a  paragraph  commenting  on  \nthe  TT  races,  noting  their  establishment  in  1907  and  describing  the  \nspectacle provided by the event. Further allusions to the TT are contained \nat  various  points  in  the  text.\n6\n  For  instance,  in  the  description  of  Douglas  \nshe  notes  the  existence  of  Governor’s  bridge  where  crowds  gather  to  \nwatch the races. In Ramsey she states that another attraction for visitors is \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n3\n V.

In  Castletown  she  takes  note  \nof  the  troop  of  boy  scouts  there  who  give  assistance  with  the  signalling  \napparatus in the TT, and in St. Johns she points out Ballig Bridge “where \nin the contest the motor-cycles sometimes leap 30 feet as they tear over the \nbridge.”\n7\n  This  comment  suggests  that  for  Fraser,  whose  book  commented  \ncertainly   on   the   more   traditional   attractions   of   the   island,   seeing   \nmotorcycles   racing   along   country   roads   was   not   an   unexpected   or   \nunwelcome sight.  \nJohn  Betjeman  also  embodied  old  and  new  in  his  contribution  to  \nMoloney’s Portraits of Isles, in 1951. He suggested “the Isle of Man, like \nShakespeare,  has  something  memorable  for  everyone.  It  is  a  place  of  \nstrong contrasts and great variety.”\n8\n Betjeman describes the island between \nJune and September as being packed with visitors, with the lodging houses \n“stuffed to capacity.” He describes how “the main road around the island, \nthe  famous  T.T.  track,  hums  with  ‘charas’”,\n9\n  and  he  then  contrasts  the  \nmodernity of Douglas and the peacefulness of the countryside: “all this in \nsuch a small kingdom, such wildness and such sophistication, such oldness \nand such newness.”\n10\n His final paragraph sums up pertinently the contrasts \non the Isle of Man: \nAnd while the dance bands are playing in Douglas and the yellow moon is \nrising in its bay, on the western, wilder coast the herring fleet is setting out \nfrom  Peel.  The  sun  sets  behind  the  rugged  outline  of  the  Castle  and  the  \nruined  Cathedral  and  Round  Tower...Inland,  the  last  rays  of  sun  are  \nlighting  the  winding  lanes  of  Peel,  the  red  sandstone  of  its  church  towers,  \nand  the  soft  protecting  mountains  behind  it  of  the  Isle  of  Man.  Here,  salt  \nspray,  seagulls,  wild  rocks  and  cavernous  cliffs.  Beyond  these  mountains  \nthe dance halls of Douglas and the dance-band leader in his faultless tails. \nAn isle of contrasts!\n11\nThe TT sits effortlessly alongside descriptions of the island’s beauty, of its \nhistory  and  of  its  tourist  industry  as  a  further  illustration  of  the  fusing  \ntogether  of  the  two  rival  place-myths.

But integrated into his trip was a \nvisit  to  the  TT  course,  and  references  were  made  to  the  event  as  if  they  \nwere expected by the reader. This again was an integration of the TT in a \nconstruction  of  the  island’s  identity.  Mais  believed  that  “the  excellent  air  \nservice has made the Island so much more easily accessible to everyone. I \ncan see more families from the South discovering the allurement of what, I \nthink, can fairly claim to be the liveliest and most progressive island round \nour coast.”\n13\nOf  course,  the  motorcycle  press  also  continued  to  promote  the  Isle  of  \nMan as the home of the TT races. Alongside reports of the races, articles \nappeared  that  considered  the  other  attractions  of  the  Isle  of  Man.  A  1948  \narticle   in   Motor   Cycling,   commented   on   the   “new   generation”   of   \nspectators  who  were  expected  to  visit  the  island,  stating  that  “if  you  are  \ngoing  to  the  Isle  of  Man  next  week  you  can  be  sure  of  one  thing.  As  an  \noccasion it will be terrific...Viewed from any angle this is the meeting of \nthe year.”\n14\n In 1949 R.R. Holliday suggested ways of making the most of a \ntrip by visiting the other attractions the island had to offer and by taking in \nthe scenery and enjoying long walks in the countryside.\n15\n An article in The \nMotor  Cycle  in  1956,  titled  “Our  Island”  noted,  “The  Isle  of  Man’s  \nromantic history is full of fascination and legend.” It went on to state that: \nTo  most  readers  of  this  journal  the  Isle  of  Man  means  motor-cycle  racing  \nand nothing else. But the fact that it was the birthplace of the T.T. Races in \n1907  and  their  home  ever  since  is  surely  an  indication  that  there  is  \nsomething  about  the  island  that  distinguishes  it  from  all  other  parts  of  \nBritain. Where else could 37 ¼ miles of public roads be closed against the \nQueen’s subjects for the purpose of racing? \n16\nThe  article  continued  by  stating:  “motor-cycle  racing  epitomises  the  \nunique  position  that  the  Isle  of  Man  has  enjoyed  for  centuries  as  a  self-\ngoverning  dependency  of  the  crown.”\n17\n  However,  it  also  went  on  to  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n12\n S.P.B.

We can see, therefore, that the Isle of Man continued to \nbe associated with the TT races through the post-war period, and also that \nthe  two  rival  place-myths  that  had  emerged  during  the  inter-war  years  \nwere now commonly fused together. The next section will look at the way \nthis developed inside the Isle of Man.  \nIdentity inside the Isle of Man \nEarlier it was mentioned that members of the Manx cultural elite were \nkeen  to  revive  the  Manx  language  as  a  means  of  guarding  themselves  \nagainst  the  growing  anglicisation  of  the  island.  However,  census  data  \nreveals that the Manx language underwent a decline and by the beginning \nof  World  War  Two  we  can  see  that  attempts  at  reviving  the  Manx  \nlanguage had been unsuccessful. Possibly as a result of this, the post-war \nperiod saw the beginning of the third phase of these attempts at language \nrevival.\n18\n This was marked in 1952 by calls from Fargher (secretary of Yn \nCheshaght  Gailckagh  (YCG))  and  Woods  (secretary  of  the  Manx  branch  \nof  the  Celtic  congress)  for  the  Manx  language  to  be  reinvigorated,  and  \nappeals  to  support  the  Manx  language  were  printed  in  Mona’s  Herald. \nDuring  this  period  YCG  also  recorded  the  speech  of  the  few  surviving  \nManx  speakers  on  the  Isle  of  Man.\n19\n  In  his  attempts  to  revive  the  Manx  \nlanguage, Fargher made a call for the Manx people to: \nThrow  off  apathy  and  disinterestedness  [sic]  and  take  part  in  another  \ncrusade   which   can   harm   no   one,   but   which   will   strengthen   us   as   \nindividuals  and  as  a  nation.  We  refer  to  the  crusade  for  maintaining  and  \nusing  the  Manx  Language.  Join  an  evening  class,  Manxmen,  and  bring  a  \nfriend with you.\n20\nClearly,  Fargher  believed  that  language  played  an  important  role  in  the  \nconstruction,  or  in  this  case  in  the  survival  of  a  distinctive  identity.  Here  \nwe  can  see  once  again  emphasis  being  placed  on  the  more  traditional  \ningredients  in  this  construction.  The  reasons  for  such  a  desperate  call  for  \n“Manxmen”  to  become  committed  to  a  revival  of  the  Manx  language  are  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n18\n  G.

Census  data  for  the  years  1951  and  1961  \nshows a further decline of Manx speakers on the island. In 1951 of a total \npopulation  of  52,897  (over  the  age  of  three  years)  there  were  no  solely  \nManx speakers and only 355 capable of speaking both English and Manx. \nBy  contrast  52,542  were  English  only  speakers.\n21\n  By  1961  from  a  total  \npopulation  of  46,321  (over  the  age  of  three  years),  there  were  only  155  \nbilingual English and Manx speakers and 46,156 solely English speakers.\n22\nFurther  emphasis  was  also  placed,  by  some  in  the  Isle  of  Man,  on  the  \npromotion of the island’s traditional heritage. Carrying on from the inter-\nwar period, during which William Cubbon had published his Bibliography \nof the Literature of the Isle of Man and was responsible for the opening of \nthe  Cregneash  folk  museum,  the  next  curator  Basil  Megaw  (1940-1957)  \nset about cementing the work of Cubbon and enlarging the Manx museum \nin  Douglas,  developing  Cregneash,  and  opening  in  1951  the  island’s  \nnautical museum, a celebration of the island’s seafaring history. 1951 also \nsaw  the  passing  of  the  Manx  National  Trust  Act.  When  his  emphasis  on  \nthe promotion of traditional aspects of island life was challenged, Megaw \nanswered thus: \nA people which breaks all links with its traditions and inherited knowledge \nof  the  forebears  is  like  a  tree  without  roots.  By  the  addition  of  a  folk  \nsection  to  the  museum  we  are  able,  for  the  first  time,  to  appreciate  the  \ncontinuity of development in Manx domestic life from remote times to the \npresent day. \n23\nClearly  we  can  see  that  some  stressed  the  role  to  be  played  by  language,  \nhistory   and   heritage   in   constructions   of   Manx   identity   during   the   \nimmediate  post-war  period  and  earlier,  especially  those  responsible  for  \ncultural institutions and societies such as YCG and the Manx Museum.  \nHowever,  we  also  see  that  there  was  emphasis  placed  on  the  new  as  \nwell  as  the  old  in  such  promotional  literature  as  the  Isle  of  Man  Official  \nGuides produced by the Publicity Board, and later the Tourist Board. The \ngreat  variety  of  attractions  on  offer  in  the  island  was  stressed  in  these  \nguides.  For  instance,  the  1951  guidebook  contained  an  article  written  by  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n21\n Census 1951: Report on the Isle of Man, (London, H.M.S.O, 1954).  \n22\n Census  1961:  Report  on  the  Isle  of  Man:  Part  II  Migration,  Economic  Activity  \nand Other Topics, (London, H.M.S.O, 1966).  \n23\n S.

Stenning, which certainly represented the Isle of Man as the location \nof traditional virtues:  \nDo   visitors   look   for   a   holiday   of   vigorous   amusements,   dancing   \nentertainments,  excursions,  sea-bathing  and  sunshine?  These  are  always  \navailable  here.  Do  they  seek  quiet  seclusion  with  just  the  peace  of  the  \nmountains  and  the  moors,  rivers  and  glens,  the  unpeopled  [sic]  coastal  \nscenery, the quiet bays and the creeks and coves, free from the hurly-burly \nof  everyday  life?  Here  they  all  are.  Do  they  look  for  a  quiet  motoring  or  \ncycling  holiday  not  too  strenuous  but  full  of  interest?  Here  we  can  offer  \nroads,  better  than  the  rest  in  Britain,  passing  through  places  of  surpassing  \nnatural  and  historical  interest,  every  turn  in  the  road  bringing  into  view  \nsome new and delightful vista.\n24\nStenning here focused on aspects that were not the TT races and by doing \nso  helped  in  the  further  construction  of  a  sense-of-place  that  was  centred  \non the traditional, and not the modern. Such a construction of the island’s \nplace-myth  can  also  be  seen  in  the  1953  Isle  of  Man  Guidebook,  which  \nstressed the traditional friendliness of the welcome afforded to visitors by \nthe islanders.  \nCatering  for  visitors  in  this  Isle  is  no  summer  sideline;  it  is  a  principle  \nindustry in which the minds and endeavours of many people living here are \nconcentrated.  Their  job  is  to  maintain  and  enhance  the  island’s  reputation  \nas  a  place  where  the  happiest  of  holidays  can  be  spent,  and  they  take  a  \ngood deal of pleasure in the fulfilment of that task.\n25\nHowever,  the  traditional  place-myth  stressing  the  modern  is  also  \nevident within this tourist literature, as is the harmony with which the rival \nmyths  sat  alongside  each  other.  Whilst  Stenning  had  described  the  more  \ntraditional attractions of the Isle of Man, he also stressed “the greatest lure \nof  all  in  this  mechanical  age,  a  lure  which  attracts  so  many  thousands  to  \nour nation. For does not this island claim the greatest and most spectacular \nof  all  speed  events...the  Tourist  Trophy  Race?  Where  else  in  the  world  \ncan  be  seen  such  thrills  as  we  have  to  offer  on  our  island  course?”\n26\nStenning’s   assertion   was   most   definitely   not   solely   focused   on   the   \ntraditional attractions of the island, but on the modern appeal of speed and \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n24\n E.

Stenning, ‘The Magic Isle’, Isle of Man Guidebook 1951, (Douglas, Isle of \nMan). \nChapter Eight \n176\ntechnology and the role the Isle of Man had played in the development of \nthe  motorcycle.  This  statement  seemed  to  sit  comfortably  in  Stenning’s  \narticle  alongside  his  description  of  the  island’s  history,  heritage  and  \nnatural beauty.  \nThe  1954  Isle  of  Man  Guidebook  similarly  made  it  clear  that  the  TT  \nraces played an important role in attracting visitors to the Isle of Man and \npromoting the island internationally. It was suggested that: \nIn   the   sporting   field   the   Isle   of   Man   is   already   world   famous.   Of   \noutstanding  interest  are  the  International  Tourist  Trophy  Motor  Cycle  \nRaces,  which  bring  together  every  June  the  world’s  most  daring  and  \naccomplished  road  racers.  The  development  of  the  internal  combustion  \nengine  has  been  very  closely  linked  with  T.T.  racing  in  the  Isle  of  Man.  \nWill the island play a similar part in the development of the jet engine, or \neven atomic power for the propulsion of road vehicles? Who knows?\n27\nThe  Manx  were  clearly  keen  to  represent  themselves  as  curators  of  a  \nnatural  beauty  and  an  appealing  history,  but  also,  paradoxically,  as  being  \nat  the  forefront  of  modernity  epitomised  by  technological  advance  and  \nindeed  by  danger.  The  TT  itself  was  described  in  1954  as  being  “one  of  \nthe most thrilling and hazardous events in the world”, and the excitement \ndescribed  as  being  “high  and  continuous.”\n28\n  Similarly  the  1955  official  \nguide noted that the TT was “amongst the most important sporting events \nwhich  take  place  on  the  Isle  of  Man.”\n29\n  It  was  further  stressed  that  the  \nevent attracted enthusiasts “from all over the world” and that therefore the \nisland  was  not  some  backwater  because  “Douglas  assumes  a  decidedly  \ncosmopolitan  air  as  competitors  and  their  supporters  talk  in  their  many  \ndifferent  tongues.”\n30\n  So  there  still  existed  within  constructions  of  Manx  \nidentity apparently discordant elements, but in tourist guides these did not \nclash.  \nThe Manx press also comfortably combined old and new. The TT races \nwere prominent in the Manx press during this period. TT reports appeared \nalongside   domestic   news,   and   advertisements   for   motorcycles   and   \nmotorcycle   accessories   adorned   large   areas   of   these   newspapers,   \nespecially in the period before, during and for a couple of weeks after the \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n27\n Isle of Man Guidebook 1953: The Isle of Man puts the Seal on Happy Holidays, \n(Douglas, Isle of Man). \n28\n Isle  of  Man  Guidebook  1954:  The  Isle  of  Man  for  Happy  Holidays,  (Douglas,  \nIsle of Man). \n29\n Isle of Man Guidebook 1955: The Isle of Treasured Holidays, (Douglas, Isle of \nMan). \n30\n Isle of Man Guidebook 1955. \n“The Motorcycling Isle”: The TT as Part of Manx Identity \n177\nTT  had  taken  place.  The  structure  of  most  Manx  newspapers  meant  that  \nthere  was  no  dedicated  sports  section  and  so  reports  of  the  TT  were  \njuxtaposed  with  local  news  and  events,  as  a  textual  representation  of  the  \nharmony  that  existed  between  the  old  and  the  new.  Therefore,  it  was  not  \nuncommon to find a report of the TT race next to a story about the Manx \nmusic festival or such like.  \nFor  instance,  a  1958  article  in  the  Isle  of  Man  Weekly  Times  reported  \nthe  visit  of  “exiled”  Manxmen  from  Canada  and  the  United  States.  It  \nreported  the  welcoming  ceremony  that  took  place  on  Douglas  harbour.  It  \nwas stated that: \nThey  were  greeted  by  the  Lon  Leah  Choir’s  recording  of  ‘Oh  Canada’,  \n‘The  Star  Spangled  Banner’  and  the  Manx  national  anthem  as  they  drew  \nnearer  landing...There  was  also  the  singing  of  ‘Ellan  Vannin’  and  other  \nbeautiful  national  songs  by  a  quartet,  charming  speeches  of  welcome  and  \nmany grand reunions of the quayside.\n31\nWe are thus given the impression that those responsible for organising the \nofficial  reception  were  keen  to  promote  a  traditional  view  of  the  island.  \nBut, the report of this ceremony went on to suggest that: \nIf   the   music   of   church   bells   did   not   come   over   the   water   to   the   \nHomecomers in this early hour there was instead the roar of high-powered \nmotor  cycles  a  sound  as  nostalgically  sweet  to  Manxmen  as  a  belfry  \ncarillon, for  are  not  the  world  famous  TT  and  the  homeland  synonymous? \n[Emphasis added] \n32\nThis comment demonstrates the belief, perpetuated in the Manx press, that \nthe  TT  races  were  good  for  the  island.  Indeed  the  report  went  further  by  \nputting the old and the new together and by suggesting that those returning \nto the island would be listening for the sound of motorcycles and that this \nsound   would   remind   them   that   the   Isle   of   Man   was   indeed   their   \n“homeland.” The Isle of Man and the TT were synonymous and so a point \nhad  been  reached  where  the  Isle  of  Man  and  the  TT  could  not  be  \nseparated.  \nThis  might  be  taken  further  to  suggest  that  whilst  inside  the  Isle  of  \nMan and within the Manx press there was an emerging opinion that the TT \nwas  a  defining  part  of  a  Manx  sense-of-self,  the  TT  races  also  seemed  to  \nposition  the  Isle  of  Man  at  the  centre  of  the  world  in  both  spectacle  and  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n31\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 30 May 1958. \n32\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 30 May 1958.  \nChapter Eight \n178\ntechnological development. The TT was an event that had made the Isle of \nMan world famous. Indeed, in 1949 Mona’s Herald commented: “the Isle \nof  Man  has  the  right  to  feel  some  pride  in  staging  this  world  famous  \nspectacle, as well as joy in the material gain it brings.” That was why “as a \npeople  we  jointly  -  and  cheerfully  we  hope  –  subscribe  to  the  cost  of  \npromotion.”\n33\nIt  was  also  believed  that  the  success  of  British  motorcycles  in  the  TT  \nfurther  elevated  the  Isle  of  Man’s  position  at  the  centre  of  the  world,  \nbecause  the  British  motorcycle  industry  used  the  Isle  of  Man  as  a  testing  \nground  for  their  machines.  Indeed,  in  1949  when  commenting  on  the  \nunsatisfactory  arrangements  made  by  the  BBC  for  broadcasting  the  TT,  \nthe press noted that: \nThese motorcycle races are of great importance, and not only for the Island \nbut  for  the  whole  of  the  country.  They  have  made  the  British  motorcycle  \nthe premier motorcycle in the world and at the present moment they are the \nfinest advertising medium the motorcycle has in Britain in connection with \nthe export drive, upon which we all depend for our very existence.\n34\nThe TT might have increased publicity for the British motorcycle industry \nbut undoubtedly it did the same for the Isle of Man. Mona’s Herald might \nhave exaggerated the feelings of the Manx people when it stated that “we \nlike  to  think  that  even  those  who  have  this  mundane  interest  in  the  races  \nand  their  results  share  a  strong  desire  to  see  the  prestige  of  the  British  \nmotor cycle upheld.”\n35\n The sentiment was, however, the same. Success for \nthe  British  motorcycle  industry  would  equal  further  publicity  for  the  Isle  \nof  Man  and  this  enhanced  sense  of  importance  was  factored  into  Manx  \nidentity.  \nDespite stronger support for the TT in the Manx press, and the greater \nuse  of  the  TT  in  promoting  the  island  in  tourist  literature,  the  fact  still  \nremained that a large amount of inconvenience was caused by the staging \nof the event on the Isle of Man. Roads still had to be closed, and the Manx \npeople would still be prevented from going about their everyday business. \nYet  no  evidence  of  an  organised  protest  has  been  found.  Indeed,  in  1956  \nthe Isle of Man Weekly Times, welcoming people to the Isle of Man for the \nTT,   commented   that   “next   week   the   countryside   of   Manxland   will   \nreverberate  to  the  ‘roar  of  the  free  exhaust’  and  once  again  we  wish  the  \nbest of luck to those men who will provide the amazing spectacle offered \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n33\n Mona’s Herald, 21 June 1949. \n34\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 5 June 1949.  \n35\n Mona’s Herald, 21 June 1949. \n“The Motorcycling Isle”: The TT as Part of Manx Identity \n179\nby   the   incomparable   T.T..”\n36\n   This   comment   suggests   that   racing   \nmotorcycles along the island’s roads was an inconvenience that would be \ntolerated. \nCannon   E.H.   Stenning,   a   Manx   resident   (since   1912)   and   once   \npresident of the Manx Motor Cycle Club, to whom the Duke of Edinburgh \nonce referred as the “Motorcycling Dean”,\n37\n was also quick to discard the \ninconvenience  caused  by  the  TT  and  to  make  the  point  that  the  event  \nunited the Manx people. In an article in the 1954 TT programme he noted \nthat – and the language used is indicative: \nYear by year we on the Island look forward with the greatest of pleasure to \nthe   coming   of   the   A.C.U.   and   the   attendant   train   of   riders   and   \nmanufacturers. We look  forward  to  renewing  old  friendships,  making  new  \nassociations  which  we  trust  will  last  for  many  years  ...  welcoming  \ncompetitors  from  all  parts  of  the  earth,  welcoming  foreign  machines  (for  \nwe  realise  that  competition  is  the  backbone  of  success)  ...  So  we on  the  \nIsland bid you welcome, and hail your arrival with great pleasure. It is true \nthat you bring us wealth, but to the great majority of us that is no concern. \nWe like to hear of new designs, new devices, new speeds, but all these are \nsmall  matters  to  us  compared  with  the  human  side,  the  personal  contact  \nwith  you  all  ...  look  upon  us  ...  as  people  who  welcome  you  all,  who  \nappreciate  you  fully,  who  hope  you  will  come  again  to  our  lovely  island.  \n[Emphases added].\n38\nUsing Stenning’s comments we can begin to appreciate the insular point of \nview by looking at the language used in his article about the TT races. We \nshould not assume that all Manx residents were as keen as Stenning to see \nthe  TT  continue,  but  Stenning’s  point  of  view,  which  was  projected  from  \ninside the island outwards to TT visitors, groups the Manx together in their \nsupport  of  and  enthusiasm  for  the  TT  races  and  was  never  significantly  \nchallenged.\n39\n  We  can  therefore  see,  from  the  evidence  discussed,  that  the  \nTT  had  become  accepted  in  internal  constructions  of  Manx  identity.  This  \nacceptance  of  the  event  by  the  islanders  was  particularly  exemplified  in  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n36\n Isle of Man Weekly Times, 1 June 1956.  \n37\n This reference was included in an article in the Isle of Man Weekly Times, 2 May \n1958.  \n38\n E.H. Stenning, ‘The TT Races: An Insular Point of View’, TT Programme 1954.  \n39\n  Stenning  also  expressed  this  in  future  TT  programmes.  He  wrote  a  number  of  \narticles  in  support  of  the  TT  races,  expressing  the  views  of  various  clubs  and  \norganisations  involved  with  the  races  and  also  looking  at  the  history  of  the  event,  \nSee  articles  such  as  E.H.  Stenning,  ‘Four  wheels  on  the  T.T.  course’,  1962  TT  \nprogramme; ‘The “Nurseries” of the Tourist Trophy Race’, 1961 TT programme. \nChapter Eight \n180\n1953  when  the  Manx  press  defended  the  TT  against  external  criticism,  \nwhen  a  section  of  the  British  press  criticised  the  TT  because  it  entailed  \nrisk, danger and death.  \nEarlier it was shown that The Times had raised such matters in 1908 in \nreaction  to  the  staging  of  the  “four-inch”  race.\n40\n  The  TT  was  again  \nattacked  by  the  British  press  in  1953  on  three  grounds.  First,  fatalities  in  \nthe  TT  were  pointed  out  as  a  reason  to  stop  the  event.  It  was  reported  in  \nThe  Daily  Sketch  and  Graphic  that  on  8  June  “two  more  young  men  met  \ndeath...on  the  37  miles  of  tortuous  roads  which  form  the  Isle  of  Man  \nmotor-cycle T.T. race course.”\n41\n The Daily Mirror went as far as to list the \nfatalities  from  the  past  five  TT  races:  one  killed  in  1948,  two  killed  in  \n1949,  four  killed  in  1950,  six  killed  in  1951  and  five  killed  in  1952.\n42\nThese  fatalities  were  seen  as  reason  enough  to  stop  the  TT  races.  The \nDaily Mirror exclaimed, “slap down on the whole show. Close it up”, and \nstated  further  that  “now  with  speeds  of  up  and  over  100  m.p.h.  this  \nspectacle,  once  called  the  greatest  sport  on  earth,  has  degenerated  into  a  \nsuicidal free for all.”\n43\n The Times’ reaction against the “four-inch” race in \n1908 was caused by the possibility of fatal accidents. In 1953 criticism of \nthe TT in a section of the British press was to the actuality of death in the \nTT.  \nSecond,  what  made  it  worse  was  apparently  that  the  Manx  prospered  \nfrom this murderous event: \nFour  young  men  died  this  week  providing  a  spectacle  which  brought  \n25,000 people with £250,000 to spend to this small island. Four young men \nwhose  deaths  are  set  against  the  balance  sheet  of  ‘progress’  in  an  island  \nwhere officialdom does not separate their tragic end from the ‘normal run \nof casualties’.\n44\nThis article in the Sunday Pictorial evidently considered the prosperity the \nTT  brought  to  the  Isle  of  Man,  but  did  not  justify  the  continuation  of  the  \nevent.  Third,  it  was  claimed,  “the  islanders  are  used  to  it  [the  TT].  For  \nsome  46  years  they  have  lived,  slept  and  eaten  motor-cycle  racing.  It  has  \nbecome part of their life.” The Manx therefore should, “turn a blind eye to \nthe  fact  that  the  roaring  modern  motor-cycle  has  outgrown  the  narrow  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n40\n Government Office File, R2701/1/3, Tourist Trophy Races 1953 (IOMPRO).  \n41\n Daily Sketch and Daily Graphic, 9 June 1953. \n42\n Daily Mirror, 10 June 1953. \n43\n Daily Mirror, 10 June 1953. \n44\n Sunday Pictorial, 14 June 1953.  \n“The Motorcycling Isle”: The TT as Part of Manx Identity \n181\ntwisting  roads  of  the  island.”\n45\n  The  morality  of  the  Manx  was  being  \nassaulted because they were seen to tolerate death and danger for the gain \nof  economic  prosperity  and  allowed  the  TT  to  become  an  integral  part  of  \ntheir life. \nThe  reaction  of  the  Manx  press  to  this  criticism  was  resentful  and  \nabove all defensive. The event was not defended in 1953 just because the \nEnglish  wished  to  stop  it,  as  was  the  case  in  1908.  The  TT  was  now  \ndefended because it was a distinguishing Manx event that had the support \nof the Manx people. The sensationalist angle taken in reports in the British \npress, were particularly resented. The Isle of Man Times argued that “there \nare  people  in  the  newspaper  world  with  insufficient  intelligence  to  report  \ncurrent  events  in  readable  fashion,  and  they  have,  perforce,  to  rely  on  \nsensationalism”,\n46\n whilst  the Isle  of  Man  Examiner  noted  that  “national  \nnewspaper  representatives  are  incapable  of  filing  a  report  without  losing  \nall  sense  of  proportion.  A  race  without  a  tragedy  or  some  trumped  up  \n‘human  angle’  leaves  them  floundering  for  material.”\n47\n Their  responses \nmay  appear  as  comments  on  the  skills  of  the  journalists  writing  for  these  \nnewspapers,  but  in  essence  they  were  defensive  of  the  TT  as  part  of  a  \nManx identity.  \nArticles  in  the  Manx  press  did  not  ignore  the  fatalities  suffered  in  the  \nTT,  but  attempted  to  deny  the  implications.  The  Isle  of  Man  Examiner \ncommented, “two fatalities on Monday provoked some of the most vicious \nreporting  we  have  seen  of  a  T.T.  race.”  It  was  pointed  out  that  over  the  \nyears  165  races  had  been  held  on  the  mountain  course,  which  totalled  \nroughly  37,000  laps.  During  these  races  there  had  only  been  59  fatalities,  \nand  “those  few  statistics  are  sufficient  to  put  the  story  into  proper  \nperspective.”  This  comment  sat  alongside  the  assertion  that  “there  are  no  \nsimilar  campaigns  focusing  attention  on  the  100  deaths  and  5,000  road  \ncasualties a week being recorded regularly on the other side of the water.” \nThe same article went on to state that it should not be necessary to stress \nwhat is obvious, that “the hordes of roaring motor-cycles going round the \nfamous circuit day and night are music to the ears of everyone who has the \nIsland’s  interests  at  heart.”\n48\n  These  comments  were  in  defence  of  a  TT,  \nwhich had become part of Manx life and a Manx sense of identity.  \nIn  the  face  of  the  1953  criticism  The  Isle  of  Man  Weekly  Times \nsummed up what it believed to be the general feeling in the island towards \nthe continuation of the TT: \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n45\n Sunday Pictorial, 14 June 1953. \n46\n The Isle of Man Times, 10 June 1953. \n47\n Isle of Man Examiner, 12 June 1953. \n48\n Isle of Man Examiner, 12 June 1953. \nChapter Eight \n182\nWhatever  happens  in  the  future,  the  Isle  of  Man  people  will  take  pride  in  \nthe  fact  they  were  able  to  place  a  course  at  the  disposal  of  organisers  for  \nmotor  cycle  races  which  undoubtedly  did  much  to  develop  the  internal  \ncombustion engine; which did much to make the Spitfire possible in those \ndread and dreary days of 1940, which has brought fame to some and given \nsatisfaction to others, but which most regretfully has brought tragedy, too, \nin its train.  \nThese  people  who  write  horrific  articles  in  which  they  describe  the  Manx  \nas a people who think blood well shed so long as it lines their pockets with \nmoney  forget  one  thing:  They  forget  many  of  us  know  the  men  who  race  \nhere: that their fortunes are our concern, and that we regret the death of any \none of them as we would regret the passing of a friend.\n49\nThere  was  then  a  general  defence  of  the  TT  not  only  because  of  an  \nunsporting  attempt  by  the  English  to  dictate  to  the  Manx  people.  The  TT  \nwas  defended  because  it  had  become  by  1953,  as  earlier  and  later,  fully  \nincorporated into Manx identity, something to be defended because of that \nsense of “who we are”: the parallel defence of bull-fighting by the Spanish \nagainst  external  critics  comes  readily  to  mind.  The  reaction  of  the  Manx  \npress  to  sensationalist  reports;  the  lack  of  notice  taken  by  the  Manx  \nlegislature to this criticism; and the continuation of the event show that the \nTT had become firmly embedded within a Manx sense-of-self.  \nAfter  1945,  the  island  continued  to  promote  its  Celtic  and  Norse  \nheritage,  its  natural  beauty  and  its  distinctive  history.  However,  in  both  \nexternal   and   internal   representations   of   the   island   these   different   \ningredients  were  placed  alongside  each  other  and  combined.  The  TT  had  \nbeen accepted as part of Manx identity, and it had a definite role to play in \nconstructions  of  a  Manx  sense-of-self.  Most  importantly  and  with  greater  \nemphasis,  the  TT  also  put  the  Isle  of  Man  on  a  world  stage.  Symbols  of  \nManx  identity,  which  by  now  most  definitely  included  the  TT,  sat  \nharmoniously  alongside  one  another.  Motorcycle  racing,  which  had  been  \nimposed  on  the  island  and  the  islanders  but  which  had  been  gradually  \naccepted  during  the  inter-war  period,  was  now  firmly  ingrained  in  the  \nisland’s place-myth alongside the island’s natural beauty and its distinctive \nhistory and heritage. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n49\nIsle of Man Weekly Times, 20 June 1953. \n“The Motorcycling Isle”: The TT as Part of Manx Identity \n183\nConclusion to Part Three \nWhat  began  as  an  imposition  by  the  lieutenant  governor  before  1914  \nand  became  an  imposition  led  by  Douglas  based  politicians  and  interest  \ngroups  during  the  1920s  became,  in  the  years  after  World  War  Two,  an  \nevent  that  was  supported  by  the  Manx  legislature  and  endorsed  by  \nmembers  of  Tynwald.  During  this  period  we  can  see  the  passing  of  \nsupportive legislation, the delegation of the orgnanisation of the TT to the \nTourist Board and the continuation and development of the belief that the \nTT was beneficial to the Manx economy. In addition, the TT continued to \nbe  attended  by  some  motorcycle  manufacturers’  teams  and  the  new  \nClubman’s  TT  increased  its  popularity  by  giving  private  entrants  that  \nchance  to  race  on  the  island.  It  was  also  during  this  period  that  the  TT  \nwould  become  a  more  ‘global’  event  attracting  teams  and  riders  from  as  \nfar afield as Japan and New Zealand. The continued support of the Manx \nlegislature,  the  growing  economic  value  of  the  TT  and  the  established  \nrepresentation of the Isle of Man as a place for motorcycle races, were all \nelements  that  contributed  to  the  further  embedding  of  the  TT  in  the  \nconstruction of a Manx identity or a Manx sense-of-self and contributed to \nthe  continuation  of  the  TT  after  World  War  Two  and  in  subsequent  \ndecades. \n\u0003\nCHAPTER NINE \nT\nAKING THE CHEQUERED FLAG? \nIn 2014 John McGuinness was inducted into the Motor Sport magazine \nHall of Fame, along with motor racing greats Alain Prost, James Hunt and \nRoss  Brawn.  In  recognition  of  his  20  wins  at  the  Isle  of  Man  TT,  he  \nreceived  his  award  from  John  Surtees.  Recently  the  TT  has  once  again  \nbegun to gain greater publicity outside of the Isle of Man. The 2011 film \nTT: Closer to the Edge was shown at cinemas nationwide (to considerable \nacclaim).  TT  riders  such  as  Guy  Martin  and  John  McGuinness  have  \nbecome  household  names.  There  are  a  number  of  documentaries  on  \nnational  television  that  follow  a  now  familiar  fly-on-the-wall  style  in  the  \nbuild up to the event. It is much easier to follow the outcomes of the two \nweeks on motorcycle racing on the Isle of Man without having to make the \ninevitably expensive trip to the island. Such is the continued popularity of \nthe TT if you want to visit the Isle of Man in June you need to make your \nplans a year in advance. \nTwo international sporting events were established at the beginning of \nthe  twentieth  century:  the  Isle  of  Man  TT  motorcycle  races  and  the  Tour \nde France bicycle race. Both are subject to their share of controversy, but \nboth continue to be supported by the communities that host the event, and \nbecause  they  are  an  integral  part  of  a  “national  identity.”  The  year  2007  \nmarked  the  centenary  of  the  Isle  of  Man  TT  races,  and  so  the  event  has  \ncontinued  to  be  an  almost  constant  part  of  twentieth  and  twenty-first  \ncentury Manx history.\nͳ\n The only time the TT has not been run was during \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n1\n  Huddersfield  University  Business  School  celebrated  the  TT’s  centenary  by  \norganising  a  conference,  ‘The  Isle  of  Man  TT  Races:  Heritage,  Place  and  Spirit’,  \nbetween 28 and 30 May 2007. Papers presented at this conference were published \nin   a   special   edition   of   the   International   Journal   of   Motorcycle   Studies: \nhttp://ijms.nova.edu.  An  article  summarising  the  main  points  of  this  work  was  \npublished in the International Journal of Motorcycle Studies. See S. Vaukins, ‘The \nIsle  of  Man  TT  Races:  Politics,  Economics  and  National  Identity’,  International \nJournal of Motorcycle Studies, Nov. 2007 at  \nhttp://ijms.nova.edu/November2007TT/index.html.  \nTaking the Chequered Flag? \n185\nthe two world wars and also in 2004 when an outbreak of foot-and-mouth \ndisease in England prevented the running of the event. In the light of what \nthe TT has become - a large scale international event commonly associated \nwith speed, danger and death - this book has set out to explain the origins \nof the TT and also, more importantly, why the TT was not stopped despite \neasy opportunities to do so in 1914 and 1939, for example, after the event \nhad been disrupted by war. The Manx authorities might also have given in \nto external criticism in, for example, 1908 and 1953 but they did not. Even \nin  1927  the  death  of  a  rider  did  not  call  a  halt  to  the  TT,  but  instead  \nprompted  the  passage  of  legislation  intended  only  to  improve  safety  for  \ncompetitors when practising for the main event. Thus, by the 1960s the TT \nhad become securely established in the island’s politics, and it continues to \nbe supported today despite criticism from outside. After the loss of World \nChampionship   status   in   1976,   the   continuation   of   the   TT   was   still   \nendorsed  by  members  of  the  Manx  legislature.  In  a  1976  debate  in  \nTynwald the Speaker of the House of Keys proposed that the chairman of \nthe   Tourist   Board   should   enquire   into   its   future,   “in   view   of   the   \nwidespread   concern   felt   by   motorcycling   enthusiasts   throughout   the   \nworld.”  The  chairman  of  the  Tourist  Board  was  adamant  in  his  response:  \n“I  would  never  submit  to  pressure  from  inside  or  outside  the  Island  to  \nabandon the magnificent mountain circuit.”\nʹ\nIndeed,  a  1976  letter  to  the  editor  contained  in  the  Isle  of  Man  \nExaminer  asked:  “Will  someone  tell  me  what  has  the  T.T.  been  but  the  \ngreatest  endurance  of  man  and  machine  in  the  whole  world.”\n 3\n The  letter \nwent on to suggest that, should the races be cancelled, in the next year Isle \nof Man TT arrivals would be down 65-70, and the season would then start \nin  the  first  week  of  July.  This  was  “in  short  a  devastating  blow  to  the  \nIsland.”  Further  confirmation  of  the  event’s  status  in  this  edition  of  the  \nnewspaper: “It is surely the unique nature of the course which attracts the \nthousands  of  riders  and  enthusiasts  to  the  Island.  The  evidence  is  here  \nnow.  The  main  championship  contenders  have  not  been  here  this  week,  \nbut  the  entry  has  been  terrific  and  the  crowd  bigger  than  ever.  Whatever  \nhappens, hands off the TT course. Short circuits are two a penny. We are \ncertain no one would come here for races on one!”\n4\n By the late 1970s then, \nthe  TT  had  become  firmly  ingrained  and  supported  as  part  of  a  Manx  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n2\n Manx Debates, Vol. 93, 15 June 1976, p.

Similarly,  in  2008  the  Manx  legislature  continued  to  support  the  \ncontinuation of the TT after strong criticism following fatalities in 2007.\nͷ\nThe discussion of how and why the TT has continued over the past 100 \nyears  has  been  structured  around  three  themes  dealing  with  politics,  \neconomics  and  national  identity.  The  theme  of  politics  addressed  the  \nquestion of how the TT was established and sustained on the Isle of Man \nand it has shown that political history matters in understanding the origins \nand  continuation  of  the  TT.  I  have  demonstrated  that  motor  racing  was  \nimposed on the Manx legislature, and therefore on the Manx people, by an \nauthoritative   lieutenant   governor.   Comparisons   with   the   moves   that   \nlegalised  an  international  motorcar  race  in  Ireland  in  1903  were  made  \nbecause this set a precedent for Manx legislation in 1904. What cannot be \ndoubted  is  that  legislation  that  authorised  motorcar  races  on  the  island,  \npaved the way for the motorcycle TT races held on the Isle of Man in 1907 \nand thereafter to 1914.  \nHowever,  between  the  wars,  following  constitutional  reforms,  members  \nof Tynwald now offered their backing for the TT’s continuation. Members \nof  the  Legislative  Council  and  the  House  of  Keys  were  able  to  express  \nsupport  for  the  TT  in  more  open  and  transparent  debates  in  Tynwald  and  \nthis led to the embedding of more widespread political support for the TT \nand the passing of supportive legislation. This was a result of the changing \nstructure  and  practice  of  government  in  the  island.  Further  political  \nsupport  was  demonstrated  by  the  endorsement  of  Hill’s  initiative  in  1929  \nfor a financial grant to be given to the ACU to allow the TT to continue on \nthe  Isle  of  Man.  This  meant  that  after  World  War  Two,  there  was  little  \ndoubt  that  the  TT  would  be  restarted  on  the  Isle  of  Man,  because  of  the  \npolitical  support  that  existed  in  Tynwald.  So  after  World  War  Two,  there  \nwas  a  further  consolidation  of  political  support  for  the  TT.  The  TT  was  \nnot,  therefore,  an  event  imposed  on  the  Manx  people  since  there  was  \ncertainly  strong  support  for  the  event  amongst  elected  members  of  the  \nManx  legislature.  Political  endorsement  of  the  TT  was  demonstrated,  for  \nexample,  by  the  re-election  of  the  Tynwald  Motor  Races  Committee  in  \n1946  and  by  the  unanimous  support  for  the  annual  renewal  of  legislation  \nand the government’s financial grant to the ACU. By the end of the 1950s \npolitical  support  for  the  TT  was  confirmed,  and  this,  as  indicated  earlier,  \nhas been sustained into the present day. \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n5\n  This  matter  was  widely  discussed  in  the  Manx  press  and  it  was  made  clear  that  \ndespite  the  publishing  of  a  report  which  concluded  that  health  and  safety  had  not  \nbe adhered to by those policing the course, it was clear that the Manx government \nwere not going to end the TT.  \nTaking the Chequered Flag? \n187\nBy  the  1960s  then,  Manx  interest  groups  and  ultimately  the  Manx  \npeople  had  come  to  accept  and  indeed  welcome  the  legislation,  which  \nallowed  the  TT  to  continue.  There  continues  to  be  no  organised  protest  \nagainst  the  TT’s  continuation,  an  absence  that  has  been  noted  throughout  \nthis work. Only occasional rumbles have been unearthed. True, expressions \nof active public support have been largely confined to anecdotal evidence \nfound  in  the  Manx  press.  In  1988,  however,  an  article  included  in  The \nScottish Geographical Magazine assessed residents’ opinions of the Manx \nTT  races  and  concluded  that  the  event  was  “not  considered  excessively  \ndisruptive  by  the  Manx  population.”\n͸\n  The  investigation  asked  residents  \nwhether  they  personally  enjoyed  TT  week  and  for  their  views  on  its  \npromotion  and  its  economic  impact  and  whether  they  found  it  disruptive.  \nThe  results  of  this  survey  can  be  seen  in  appendix  one.  Interestingly  they  \nwere  also  asked  whether  the  TT  generated  “national  feeling.”  Three  \nstatements  were  put  to  Manx  residents:  first,  “the  TT  races  create  a  \nnational  feeling”,  second,  “in  my  experience  most  Islanders  welcome  the  \nTT  races”,  and  third,  “the  TT  races  are  an  essential  part  of  the  Island’s  \ntwentieth-century  heritage.”  A  total  of  500  residents  were  asked  if  they  \nagreed or disagreed with these statements. Seventy-four per cent agreed or \nstrongly agreed that the TT created national feeling, 78 per cent agreed or \nstrongly  agreed  that  most  islanders  welcomed  the  TT  and  85  per  cent  \nagreed  or  strongly  agreed  that  the  TT  was  part  of  the  island’s  twentieth-\ncentury  heritage.\n͹\n  Clearly,  there  was  a  strong  body  of  public  opinion  in  \nfavour   of   the   TT.   Only   two   per   cent   strongly   disagreed   with   the   \nstatements.  Although  in  the  past  the  Manx  people  had  not  been  given  \ndirectly  the  chance  to  express  their  opinions  this  poll  demonstrated  that  \ncertainly by 1988 there was still much support for the continuation of the \nevent amongst the Manx people.  \nThroughout  the  twentieth  century  the  TT  became  an  integral  part  of  \nManx  identity  and  an  important  part  of  the  way  the  island  is  marketed  to  \noutsiders,  as  we  have  seen  above.  Yet,  one  question  still  remains:  that  is  \nwhy  the  TT  continues  to  be  tolerated  by  the  Manx.  It  is  undoubtedly  an  \nevent  that  causes  disruption  to  the  local  community.  Indeed,  in  2006  \n52.4%  of  residents  were  born  outside  of  the  Isle  of  Man,  suggesting  that  \nsome  protest  against  the  inconvenience  of  the  race  might  be  expected.\n8\n It \nis difficult to fully understand what the ‘man-on-the-street’ feels about the \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n6\n R. Prentice, ‘The Manx TT Races and Residents’ Views: A Case Study of Doxy’s \n“Irridex”’, Scottish Geographical Magazine, 107 (1988), pp. 155-160.  \n7\n Prentice, ‘The Manx TT Races and Residents’ Views’, p.156. \n8\n 2009 Digest of Economic and Social Statistics, (Economic Affairs Division, Isle \nof Man Treasury). \nChapter Nine \n188\ncontinuation  of  the  TT;  there  is  no  way  to  really  understand  how  greatly  \nthe beer sellers, ice-cream sellers or proprietors of campsites believed that \nthe  TT  offered  them  an  economic  advantage,  which  has  been  the  case  \nthroughout  the  TT’s  history.  This  is  data  that  has  simply  not  been  \nrecorded.  \nSo in order to summarise how far public opinion had developed since \nPrentice’s  1988  survey,  I  carried  out  a  similar  survey.  1,292  people  took  \nthe  survey:  779  or  60.9%  of  the  respondents  were  Manx  residents;  40.8  \nper  cent  of  participants  were  aged  between  20  and  39  and  44.7%  aged  \nbetween 40 and 59. Only 2% were aged between 0 and 19, 11.8% 60 to 79 \nand  0.4%  80  or  older.  The  majority  of  participants,  64.7%  were  male,  \nmeaning the other 35.3% were female. Of the 779 initial respondents, 738 \nrecorded  their  place  of  residence.  177  (24%)  lived  inside  the  TT  course  \nand  561  (76%)  lived  outside  the  TT  course.  Surprisingly  a  large  majority  \nof participants lived in the north of the island.  \nThe  survey  was  designed  to  be  a  way  to  get  some  idea  of  how  both  \nManx  residents  and  some  non-residents  viewed  the  TT  and  to  ask  further  \nhow important a part of Manx identity residents believe the TT to be and \nthe following statements were proposed: \n1) Most islanders welcome the TT races \n2) The TT races are good for the Manx economy \n3) The TT races bring the Island good publicity \n4) The TT races are a significant inconvenience to Islanders \n5) The TT races disrupt the peacefulness of the Island \n6) The TT races are dangerous \n7) The TT races are an important ingredient in Manx identity \n8) The TT races create a national feeling \n9) The  TT  races  are  an  important  part  of  the  island’s  21\nst\n  century  \nheritage \n10) Without the TT the Isle of Man would lose a distinctive part of its \nidentity \nThese  were  opinion  statements,  and  participants  were  asked  if  they  \nstrongly  agreed,  agreed,  disagreed  or  strongly  disagreed  with  a  particular  \nstatement or if they had no opinion (an opinion which only a small amount \nof people chose).  \nThe results of the survey are represented in appendix one, below. From \nthe results it can be suggested that there continues to be strong support and \ncommitment  towards  the  TT  from  a  majority  of  Manx  residents.  In  this  \nrespect  little  has  changed  since  Prentice  published  his  research  in  1988  –  \nand  this  still  remains  the  only  comparable  data  available.  The  figures  are  \nTaking the Chequered Flag? \n189\nstrikingly similar. For example, 78.8% of participants in the online survey \nagreed  that  islanders  welcomed  the  TT;  Prentice  calculated  this  figure  to  \nbe  78%.  79%  of  participants  believed  the  TT  was  good  for  the  Manx  \neconomy; Prentice’s figure was 83%. However, where the continuation of \nthe  TT  comes  into  question  the  figures  differ  slightly.  My  survey  showed  \nthat  72.7%  of  residents  who  responded  disagreed  that  the  TT  should  be  \nended,  whereas  Prentice’s  figure  was  closer  to  90%.  This  relates  directly  \nto  changes  in  perceptions  of  the  dangerous  nature  of  the  TT.  76.9%  of  \nresidents  agreed  that  the  TT  was  dangerous,  and  only  15.7%  disagreed.  \nOpinion  was  split  in  Prentice’s  survey:  47%  agreed  and  47%  disagreed.  \nBut  there  are  other  areas  that  are  also  ripe  for  further  examination.  For  \ninstance, the balance of opinion between residents living inside the course \nand outside the course was fairly even - in some cases people living inside \nthe course had a more positive commitment towards the TT. The results of \nthis  survey  were  fairly  unsurprising.  There  was  strong  support  for  the  \ncontinuation  of  the  TT  amongst  the  738  residents  that  participated  in  this  \nsurvey.  It  must  be  concluded  that  the  evidence  supports  that  assumption  \nthat the TT is strongly established as a part of Manx national identity.  \nDecisions  made  and  legislation  passed  by  the  Manx  government,  \nalongside  changes  to  the  structure  and  practice  of  government  in  the  Isle  \nof Man, were clearly important to the development of the TT. Thus we can \nsee that politics had a large role to play in the origins and continuation of \nthis  event  and  this  is  surely  also  the  case  for  sport  in  general,  which  \ncommonly  involves  the  use  of  public  money  and  has  public  profiles,  \nespecially  large-scale  international  events.  Hosting  an  Olympic  Games  or  \na  World  Cup  tournament  involves  a  large  deal  of  political  decision-\nmaking. Indeed, Guttmann clearly points to the political agenda behind the \nestablishment  and  staging  of  the  Olympics.\nͻ\n  Political  endorsement  of  a  \nsporting  event  might  not  be  forthcoming,  however,  unless  there  were  \neconomic benefits expected. \nTherefore,  whilst  the  political  theme  had  introduced  and  answered  the  \nquestion of how the TT races were established and maintained on the Isle \nof Man it was the economic rewards, which helped to explain the event’s \npolitical endorsement. The TT’s continuation owed much to an anticipated \neconomic  gain.  Members  of  Tynwald  believed  with  good  reason  that  the  \nTT  brought  economic  benefits  to  the  Isle  of  Man.  Before  the  First  World  \nWar  these  interests  were  minimal  and  members  of  Tynwald  did  not  \nsuggest  until  as  late  as  1912  that  the  TT  might  bring  prosperity  to  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n9",

Much  was  made  of  the  success  of  British  motorcycles,  or  US,  \nItalian,   German   and   later   Japanese   motorcycles,   but   it   was   the   \nmanufacturers  who  were  more  celebrated  than  their  home  countries.  \nTherefore the TT did not embody other nations either. The Isle of Man is \nthe  only  winner  in  terms  of  national  identity.  In  fact  only  the  national  \nidentity of the Isle of Man is expressed and endorsed by the TT. Moreover, \nrather than the Isle of Man being embodied by the TT, it is because the TT \nis consumed  internally  and  externally  that  it  has  become  an  ingredient  in  \nthe  construction  of  a  Manx  identity.  The  island  is  famous  as  a  venue  for  \nmotorcycle  racing.  It  is  true  that  Wembley  stadium  is  famous  as  a  venue  \nfor  international  football  matches.  Hill  and  Varrasi,  in  a  1997  article,  \ndefined  Wembley  as  a  national  monument:  “it  in  fact  became  a  synonym  \nfor English  football  and  something  of  an  icon  of  Englishness:  its  twin  \ntowers were readily identified by millions as a mark of identity, almost as \nfamiliar as Big Ben.”\nͳ ͅ\n Wembley stadium has become clearly identifiable \nas  the  English  home  of  football.  Likewise,  Monaco  is  the  venue  for  the  \nMonaco Grand Prix, and Singapore has recently become the venue for the \nfirst  nighttime  Formula  One  race.\nͳͻ\n  These  are  certainly  internationally  \nrecognised  venues  where  sporting  events  take  place.  None,  however,  can  \nmarket themselves the same way that the Isle of Man projects itself as the \nvenue  for  a  unique  international  motorcycle  road  race.  The  sport  and  the  \nplace   embrace   each   other   and   constitute   a   distinctive   element   in   a   \nprojected national identity consumed inside and outside the Isle of Man.  \n The study of sport therefore enables us to examine politics, economics \nand the construction and consumption of a national identity. We have also \nseen that when a sport becomes embedded in a sense-of-self it is difficult \nfor  it  to  be  given  up,  much  like  the  Spanish  and  their  bullfighting.\nʹͲ\nUndoubtedly  the  TT  causes  inconvenience  to  the  Manx  people,  but  the  \n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\n18\n  J.  Hill  and  F.  Varrasi,  ‘Creating  Wembley:  The  Construction  of  a  National  \nMonument, The  Sports  Historian,  No.  17  (1997),  p.40.  The  original  Wembley  \nstadium  was  demolished  in  2003  and  the  rebuilt  stadium  opened  in  2007.  The  \n‘twin towers’ a feature that made Wembley easily identifiable were replaced by a \ngigantic  steel  arch.  Hill  and  Varrasi,  stated  at  the  end  of  their  article  that  ‘in  the  \nimminent,  end  of  century  re-building  of  Wembley  the  towers  are  to  remain,  the  \nonly vestiges of the original structure. Thus an artefact designed to commemorate \nnineteenth-century empire will survive into the world of the twenty-first century’. \nPerhaps unfortunately, this commitment was subsequently abandoned.  \n19\n An idea of the promotion of these events can be seen at www.visitmonaco.com \nand www.visitsingapore.com.  \n20\n  For  further  comment  on  this  ‘sport’  see  T.  Mitchell,  Blood  Sport:  A  Social  \nHistory  of  Spanish  Bullfighting,  (Philadelphia,  University  of  Pennsylvania  Press,  \n1991).  \nChapter Nine \n194\nraces  continue  to  be  tolerated  because  of  the  prestige  they  bring  to  the  \nisland  and  because  they  have  become  part  of  whom  the  Manx  think  they  \nare. The TT has been the subject of criticism from outside because of the \ndanger that comes with racing motorcycles around the Isle of Man, but the \nTT  is  sustained  because  it  is  a  distinctive  part  of  Manx  identity.  The  TT  \nhas thus become so far ingrained in a Manx sense-of-self that if the event \nwere to be ended, this would not just mean the loss of a “sport”, or the loss \nof  the  economic  rewards  brought  by  the  TT.  If  the  TT  were  abandoned  a  \ndistinctive  part  of  the  island’s  identity  would  be  lost,  an  ingredient  that  \nhas, in the past and still in the present, set the island apart from not just the \nUK  but  also  the  rest  of  the  world.  It  can  be  said  with  some  certainty  that  \nthe  TT  placed  the  Isle  of  Man  on  a  world  stage  and  has  become  firmly  \ningrained in constructions of Manx identity and in the consciousness of the \nManx  people.  For  the  reasons  discussed  herein,  and  because  of  recent  \ndevelopments such as the staging of a “green” TT, at the time of writing it \nis difficult to see the TT coming to an end; there can be little doubt that the \nTT continues to be supported by the Manx, and thus would continue to be \nstaged on the Isle of Man. \n\u0003\nAPPENDIX \nR\nESIDENTS’ VIEWS OF THE ISLE OF MAN TT \nAppendix \n196\nSummary of results: All Manx Residents (738) \nSource: Isle of Man TT survey, Vaukins 2010 \nResidents’ Views of the Isle of Man TT \n197\nSummary of results: residents outside the TT course (561) \nSource: Isle of Man TT survey, Vaukins 2010 \nAppendix \n198\nSummary of results: residents inside the TT course (177) \nSource: Isle of Man TT survey, Vaukins 2010\n\u0003\nBIBLIOGRAPHY \nPrimary Sources \nManx Sources \nParliamentary Debates and Minute Books \nStatutes of the Isle of Man, Volume 7 1896-1905 to Volume 17 1952-1959 \n(Manx National Heritage Library (MNHL)) \nThe Times Reports of Debates in the Manx Legislature, Volume 21 (1903-\n1904) to Volume 75 (1957-1958) (MNHL) \nReports  of  Debates  in  the  Manx  Legislature,  Volume  93  (1975-1976)  \n(MNHL) \nMinutes of the Manx Motorcycle Club (MNHL): \n- Apr. 1921 – Jan. 1924 (1 Vol.) \n- Feb. 1924 – Jan. 1930 (1 Vol.) \nMinutes of the Manx Automobile Club (MNHL) \nMinutes  of  the  Isle  of  Man  Highway  Board  (1905-1946)/  Highway  and  \nTransport Board (1947) (MNHL): \nVolume 4 June 1905 – May 1909 \nVolume 5 May 1909 – Mar. 1913 \nVolume 7 May 1918 – Nov. 1922 \nVolume 8 Dec. 1922 – Aug. 1926 \nVolume 9 Sept. 1926- May 1930 \nVolume 10 June 1930 – Jan. 1935 \nVolume 11 Jan. 1935 – Jan. 1939 \nVolume 14 Oct. 1945 – Aug. 1947 \nVolume 15 (1) Aug. 1947 – Feb. 1949 \nVolume 16 (2) Feb. 1949 – July 1950 \nVolume 17 (3) July 1950 – Aug. 1951 \nVolume 18 (4) Aug. 1951 – Jan. 1953 \nVolume 19 (5) Jan. 1953 – Oct. 1954 \nVolume 20 (6) Oct. 1954 – May 1956 \nVolume 21 (7) May 1956 – Jan. 1958 \nVolume 22 (8) Feb. 1958 – Oct. 1959 \nBibliography \n200\nBoard  of  Advertising/  Publicity  Board/  Tourist  Board  Minutes  Books  \n(MNHL): \nBoard of Advertising: \n- Volume 2 June 1903 – Apr. 1921 \n- Volume 3 May 1921 – Nov. 1924 \n- Volume 4 Nov. 1924 – Nov. 1927 \n- Volume 5 Nov. 1927 – Mar. 1931 \nPublicity Board: \n- Volume 6 Mar. 1931 – Nov. 1937 \n- Volume 7 Nov. 1937 – Feb. 1949 \n- Volume 8 Mar. 1949 – July 1952 \nTourist Board: \n- Volume 9 Sept. 1952 – Mar. 1954 \n- Volume 10 Apr. 1954 -
