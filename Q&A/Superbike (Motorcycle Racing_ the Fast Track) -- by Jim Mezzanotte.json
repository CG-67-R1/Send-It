Maybe \nyou have seen people zoom down the road on their \nbikes. Of course, they do not race. Racing on \nregular roads is illegal — and dangerous. But you \ncould race on a track! In road racing, riders speed \naround tracks that are similar to regular roads. The \ntracks have straightaways and twisting turns. \nSuperbike racing is a kind of road racing. It began \nin the 1970s. Superbikes are fast racing bikes. They \nare similar to street bikes. \nAt first, superbike racing only took place in the \nUnited States. Today, it is popular around the \nworld. It is full of high-speed action! \nRoad racing tracks are similar to regular \nroads. Riders speed through tight turns. \n\n\n\nSuperbike Races \nTop pros compete in the U.S. championship. \nThey earn points in each race. The rider with the \nmost points becomes champ. AMA Pro Racing sets \nthe rules. It is part of the American Motorcyclist \nAssociation, or AMA. Pros also race bikes that \nare similar to superbikes, such as supersport bikes. \nThere is a world superbike championship, too. \nRiders have to qualify to race. They have to be \nable to speed around the track. Only riders with \nfast times get to race. Before they start, they line up \nin rows on the grid. The fastest riders are in front. \nThe fastest one of all has the pole position. \nMost U.S. races are about 60 miles (100 kilometers) \nlong. One race, the Daytona 200, is 200 miles \n(322 km) long. \nA race begins. Riders in front often \nhave the best chance of winning. \n\n\n\nPower and Speed \nSuperbikes are street bikes that are modified for \nracing. They have no headlights or other things \nneeded for street riding. They weigh less than \nstreet bikes. \nEngines are modified, too. These engines are small, \nbut they produce a lot of horsepower. A superbike \nengine has more power than some car engines! \nThe bikes also have lightweight fairings. A fairing \ncovers a bike in the front and on the sides. It \ncreates a smooth shape that cuts through the air. \nFairings help the bikes go fast. Superbikes can travel \nmore than 180 miles (290 km) per hour! The bikes \nhave large brakes, for slowing down quickly. \nRoad racing bikes are light but powerful. \nFairings help them reach high speeds. \n\n\n\nRacing Rubber \nTires are important in superbike racing. Riders \nspeed through many twisting turns. They need \ntires with good traction on the pavement. \nSuperbikes use special tires, called slicks. \nThe slicks do not have grooved treads like most \ntires. Instead, they are smooth. Slicks have a lot \nof rubber touching the ground. The rubber is very \nsoft, and it wears out quickly. A normal tire lasts \nfor several years. Slicks usually last for one race! \nSlicks only work well if they are hot. They need to \nbe hotter than boiling water! If they are too cold, \nthey could break apart. Teams often warm the tires \nbefore a race. \nA rider leans into a tight turn. The \nbike's slicks grip the track. \n\n\n\nA Team Effort \nIn road racing, riders get help from other people. \nMost top pros are part of factory teams. They race \nfor companies that make motorcycles. There are \nteams from Honda, Suzuki, Yamaha, Kawasaki, \nand Ducati. Success in racing can help them sell \nmore bikes! \nBefore a race, big trucks arrive at the track. The \ntrucks carry factory teams. Team members make \nsure every bike is ready to race. They fix the bikes \nif they break. They do whatever it takes to help \ntheir riders win. \nCompanies often use road racing to test new ideas. \nThey keep improving their bikes, so the bikes will \nbe faster on the track. \nThese team members are hard at work. They \nwill make sure this bike is in top shape. \n\n\n\nSuper Skills \nRacing a superbike takes skill. Pros first race as \namateurs. They spend a lot of time learning to \nrace. They get a special license to race as pros. \nRiders need strength and balance. In turns, they \nlean close to the ground. Their knees may touch \nthe pavement. They take the fastest line, or path, \nthrough each turn. Pro racers steer their bikes \nexactly where they need to go. \nDuring a race, everything happens quickly. Riders \nare always twisting the throttle, shifting gears, and \nusing the brakes. They race close together at high \nspeeds. They look for any chance to pass, but one \nsmall mistake could mean disaster! \nIn turns, riders put their weight to one \nside. They look like they might fall off! \n\n\n\nStaying Safe \nRiders can get injured in road racing. Safety is \nimportant. Riders wear helmets to protect the \nhead and face. They wear thick leather suits, called \nleathers. They also wear pucks on their knees. \nPucks are made of smooth plastic. When riders lean \ninto turns, the pucks slide on the pavement. Riders \nwear gloves and boots, too. They wear padding and \ntough body armor. \nRace officials help with safety. If a rider crashes, \nthey wave a yellow flag. Riders cannot pass when \nthis flag is out. Officials may even wave a red flag, \nstopping a race. If they see a rider’s bike leaking \noil, they wave a black flag. That rider must leave \nthe track. \nAn AMA official waves a red flag. Riders \nmust slow down and stop their bikes. \n\n17 \n\nSuperbike Stars \nMathew Mladin is a top superbike pro. He has \nbeen the AMA superbike champ five times. No \nother rider has been a champ this many times! \nHe has won many big races, including the Daytona \n200. Mladin is from Australia. He first raced \nsuperbikes there. \nMiguel Duhamel is a top pro, too. He is the first \nperson from Canada to be an AMA superbike \nchamp. He has won many races. \nBen and Eric Bostrom are brothers. They both \nrace superbikes! Ben was an AMA champ. He \nnow competes in world superbike races. Eric is still \ntrying to become the U.S. superbike champ. They \nboth began riding at an early age. \nMathew Mladin speeds through a turn. \nYou can see the puck on his knee. \n\n\n\nLet’s Race! \nIt’s time to race. You are on the grid, surrounded \nby other riders. You watch for the green light. \nFinally, it flashes. Rear tires spin and engines \nscream. The race has begun! \nAt the first turn, you brake hard and lean to the \nground. You speed through more turns, leaning \nright and left. Other riders are inches from your \nbike. You see an opening and pass. On the \nstraightaway, you twist the throttle and shift \ngears. You crouch down to cut through the air. \nYou hit the next turn in seconds. Coming out \nof the turn, you twist the throttle again. The \nleaders are up ahead. Will you get your chance \nto pass them? \nIn road racing, riders are often \nclose together. It can be hard to pass! \n\n\n\namateurs: in sports, people \nwho compete for fun and \nnot to make a living. \nbody armor: plastic shields \nthat protect a rider’s body. \ngrid: in racing, the starting \nlineup on a track. A grid \nhas many rows of riders, \nwith several riders in each \nrow. Their place in the \ngrid depends on how well \nthey qualify. \nhorsepower: the amount of \npower an engine produces, \nbased on how much work \none horse can do. \nmodified: changed in \nsome way. \npole position: the spot \nat the very front of the \nstarting grid. \npros: short for professionals. \nIn sports, people who are \nvery good at a sport and \nearn money competing in it. \npucks: in superbike racing, \nsmooth plastic pieces that \ncover a rider’s knees. \nqualify: in racing, to earn \na spot in the main race. \nstreet bikes: motorcycles \nthat people can ride on \nregular roads. \nthrottle: the part of a \nmotorcycle that controls \nhow much gas goes to the \nengine. Riders work the \nthrottle by twisting one of \nthe bike’s handlebar grips. \ntraction: the ability of \nsomething to grip a surface. \ntreads: the parts of tires \nthat touch the ground. \n\nBooks \nMotorcycles.
